<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Established by resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980 of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a global mandate. 
</p>
<p> This report, submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 7/12, covers 
the period 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008 and reflects communications and cases 
examined by the Working Group during its sessions in 2008, and general allegations considered 
at its eighty-third session in 2007. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group 
to Governments since its inception is 52,952. The number of cases under active consideration 
that have not yet been clarified or discontinued stands at 42,393 and concerns 79 States. The 
Working Group has been able to clarify 1,763 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p> During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 1,203 new cases of 
enforced disappearances to the Governments of Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cameroon, 
Chad, Colombia, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, the 
Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Viet Nam, Yemen and 
Zimbabwe. Of the newly-reported cases, 83 allegedly occurred during the same period. 
</p>
<p> A summary of activities during the last year is presented in a table for each country, with a 
detailed text description of the areas of activity. 
</p>
<p> During the reporting period the Working Group conducted a country visit to Argentina (see

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first 
United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate. 
The original mandate derives from Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 
29 February 1980. This resolution followed General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 
20 December 1978, in which the Assembly expressed concern at reports from various parts of 
the world relating to enforced disappearances and requested the Commission on Human Rights 
to consider the question of missing or disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p>2. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate or 
whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In this humanitarian 
capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between family members of 
victims of disappearance and Governments. 
</p>
<p>3. Following the adoption of General Assembly resolution 47/133 on 18 December 1992 and 
of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Working 
Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in fulfilling their obligations derived from 
the Declaration. The mandate was most recently extended by Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/12 of 27 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>4. Following a review of its methods of work in 2007, the Working Group decided that 
adjustments were needed. The revised methods of work, approved on 4 December 2008, are 
contained in annex 1 to the present report and will come into immediate effect. 
</p>
<p>5. The report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group during its 
three sessions in 2008, covering the period 1 December 2007 to 30 November 2008. 
</p>
<p>6. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity. Where there has been no 
information from the Government or the sources, notwithstanding the annual reminder sent by 
the Working Group concerning outstanding cases, only the table is provided and a reference is 
made to a description of cases. 
</p>
<p>7. In countries where the number of newly-reported cases is less than 10, the names of the 
persons appear in the country section. If the number of newly-reported cases is greater than 10, 
the list of names appears in annex 5. 
</p>
<p>8. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since its 
inception is 52,952. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet been 
clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,393 and concerns 79 States. The Working Group 
has been able to clarify 1,763 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>9. It is recalled that recent cases of disappearance are the priority of the Working Group. 
Large volumes of cases submitted to the Working Group many years after the persons </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>disappeared are reviewed by it and processed by the Secretariat as an ongoing process. The 
Working Group is pleased to inform that as at the end of the present reporting period, there is no 
backlog of cases, due to the continuous support given by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR). The Working Group thanks OHCHR and hopes to maintain the 
adequate level of staffing which it now enjoys. 
</p>
<p><b>II. ACTIVITIES OF THE WORKING GROUP ON ENFORCED 
OR INVOLUNTARY DISAPPEARANCES: 1 DECEMBER 2007 
TO 30 NOVEMBER 2008 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions: the eighty-fourth 
from 10 to 14 March in Geneva, the eighty-fifth from 24 to 26 July in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 
and the eighty-sixth from 26 November to 4 December 2008, in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>11. The Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group is Mr. Santiago Corcuera. The other 
members are Mr. Olivier de Frouville, Mr. Darko G&#246;ttlicher, Mr. Saied Rajaie Khorasani and 
Mr. Jeremy Sarkin. Mr. de Frouville and Mr. Sarkin were appointed in 2008. 
</p>
<p>12. On 11 March 2008, the Chairman-Rapporteur presented the Working Group&#8217;s annual 
report for 2007 to the seventh session of the Council and on 14 March participated in the 
interactive dialogue with its member States. On 17 March 2008, Mr. G&#246;ttlicher participated, on 
behalf of the Chairman-Rapporteur, at the review, rationalization and improvement of the 
mandate, as a result of which the Working Group was renewed for an additional three years. 
</p>
<p>13. On 22 May 2008, the Chairman-Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion on the 
Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, cosponsored by the 
Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations and OHCHR. From 24 to 27 June 2008, 
Mr. Corcuera participated in the International Seminar on Enforced Disappearances in Bogot&#225; 
organized by OHCHR in Colombia. From 23 to 27 June 2008, Mr. G&#246;ttlicher, on behalf of the 
Chairman-Rapporteur, attended the fifteenth annual meeting of special rapporteurs, 
representatives, independent experts and chairpersons of working groups of the Council. On 
24 and 25 November 2008, Mr. Corcuera represented the Coordination Committee of the Special 
Procedures at the Regional Arrangements Workshop called for by Council resolution 6/20. 
</p>
<p>14. During the period under review, the Working Group met formally with representatives of 
the Governments of Argentina, Iraq, Japan, Montenegro, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Upon the 
initiative of the Working Group, meetings were requested with all regional groups and held with 
the Asian and the Latin American and Caribbean Regional Groups. The Working Group looks 
forward to meeting all other regional groups in the future, as part of an ongoing initiative. The 
Working Group also met with representatives of human rights non-governmental organizations 
and associations of relatives of disappeared persons and families or witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>15. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 1,203 new cases of enforced 
disappearance to the Governments of Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Chad, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Colombia, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, 
the Sudan, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Viet Nam, Yemen and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>16. The Working Group sent 69 of these cases under the urgent action procedure to the 
Governments of Algeria, Cameroon, Chad, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, 
Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>17. Of the newly-reported cases, 83 allegedly occurred during the reporting period and relate 
to Algeria, Bangladesh, Cameroon, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Viet Nam and 
Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>18. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 54 cases in the following countries: 
Algeria, Argentina, China, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Nepal, 
the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Turkey. Of those, 38 cases were clarified based on information 
provided by the Government and 16 cases were clarified based on information provided by 
sources. 
</p>
<p>19. During the reporting period, the Working Group sent 12 prompt intervention 
communications addressing harassment of and threats to human rights defenders and relatives of 
disappeared persons in Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, Namibia, the Philippines, 
Senegal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Five of these were sent as joint communications with one or 
more of the following special procedures: on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p><p>20. Following its eighty-third session in 2007 and its first two sessions in 2008, the Working 
Group sent 14 general allegations to the Governments of Bolivia, Colombia, Egypt, India, Italy, 
Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Sudan, the United States of America and Thailand. During 
its eighty-sixth session, the Working Group decided to transmit general allegations to some 
Governments, inviting them to comment thereon. Summaries of the general allegations 
considered during the eighty-sixth session, including government responses, if any, will be 
included in the 2009 annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>21. Upon the invitation of the Government of Argentina, Mr. Corcuera, 
Chairperson-Rapporteur, and Mr. Saied Rajaie Khorasani, member of the Working Group, 
visited the country from 21 July to 24 July 2008, assisted by staff from the Secretariat.  
The purpose of the mission was to examine practices carried out to clarify cases of enforced 
disappearances as well as the programmes and measures adopted to guarantee the rights of the 
victims, including the right to reparation. 
</p>
<p>22. The report on the visit to Argentina is contained in A/HRC/10/9/Add.1. Among others, the 
Working Group recommended to the Government of Argentina to define enforced disappearance </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>as an autonomous crime and to adopt a comprehensive protection programme for witnesses, 
families, lawyers, prosecutors, judges and civil society organizations involved in the 
investigation of cases of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group requested visits to Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Nicaragua, the 
Philippines, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Timor-Leste. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group 
in 2005, which was delayed at the request of the Government. 
</p>
<p>25. In 2007, the Governments of Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation and Indonesia stated that it 
would not be possible to schedule a visit by the Working Group because other special 
rapporteurs would be visiting the country at that time. To date, and notwithstanding reminders by 
the Working Group, no possible dates have been proposed by the above-mentioned 
Governments. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group deeply regrets that Algeria has not responded to its repeated requests 
to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>27. The Working Group invites the Governments of Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, the 
Sudan and Timor-Leste to respond to the continued interest expressed to visit these countries. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group welcomes the official invitation from the Government of Ecuador 
on 17 September 2008 to visit the country after February 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Statements 
</b></p>
<p>29. On 11 June 2008, the Working Group issued a press release deploring the large number of 
cases of disappearances in Sri Lanka. It expressed concern that both women and humanitarian 
aid workers were being targeted. It also called upon the Sri Lankan authorities to take effective 
measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearances, carry out thorough 
investigations and bring the perpetrators to justice. Finally, it reiterated its request to conduct an 
official country visit. 
</p>
<p>30. To commemorate the International Day of the Disappeared, the Working Group issued a 
press release on 29 August 2008, expressing its concern over the increasing number of cases of 
enforced disappearances around the world and reiterating its solidarity with the victims and 
human rights defenders helping the victims. The Working Group also expressed concern about 
the phenomenon of under-reporting, as it considers that cases of disappearances are happening in 
certain parts of the world but are not being reported. 
</p>
<p>31. On 6 October 2008, the Working Group issued a joint statement with 12 other special 
procedures mechanisms at the start of the Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week, a global 
initiative launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The statement called on all 
States to do their utmost to ensure that detainees are treated with respect and dignity and to 
provide for effective complaints and monitoring mechanisms in places of detention, including 
efficient avenues to challenge the legality of detention and access to legal counsel. </p>

The first concerned <b>Adel Saker</b>, disappeared in Skikda Province in May 2008. The second 
concerned <b>Mohamed Ben Missoum</b>, arrested at his home in El Oued in March 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Working Group transmitted 768 newly-reported cases to the Government. The 
majority concerned males disappeared between 1992 and 1999, mainly in 1994 and 1995 in 
Constantine, Tipaza, Algiers, Oran and Tiaret. Most disappearances are attributed to the Police, 
the Military and the Department of Investigation and Security Forces. Five cases concern minors 
and one case concerns a man disappeared in February 2008 in Boumerdes.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Working Group received two communications from the Government, 
dated 2 February and 19 May 2008. The first concerned two outstanding cases, where the 
Government stated that both persons had been questioned and released by the authorities. The 
information was insufficient to clarify them. The second referred to the Government&#8217;s 
interpretation of the Working Group&#8217;s mandate and concerns regarding its implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Working Group received communications from sources concerning three outstanding 
cases, stating that one victim was being held at Blida prison, one had been killed and a third had 
been released. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>37. Based on information provided by the sources, the Working Group clarified three cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>38. On 25 August 2000, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to Algeria. 
Notwithstanding several reminders a reply has not been received yet. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>39. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 2,743 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 24 cases: 9 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 15 on the basis 
of information provided by the source; 15 were found to be duplications and were therefore 
deleted; 2,704 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Working Group expresses concern that during the period under review, two urgent 
actions and a standard case occurring in 2008 were sent to the Government. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group reiterates its call from previous years that little progress has been 
made in clarifying cases of disappearance in Algeria. A high number of newly-reported cases 
arising from the 1990s continues to be received by the Working Group and is being transmitted 
to the Government. 
</p>
<p>42. The Working Group reiterates the observation made in 2007 regarding the Government&#8217;s 
obligations under article 13 of the Declaration to take steps to ensure that all involved in the 
investigations are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group strongly reaffirms its request to the Government of Algeria for a 
country visit aimed at clarifying the 2,704 outstanding cases.

<p>47. The Working Group transmitted one newly-reported case of disappearance to the 
Government concerning <b>Iv&#225;n Eladio Torres</b>, disappeared in the Province of Chubut on 
2 October 2003, after being arrested by police officers.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Working Group received two communications from the Government on 6 June 
and 27 June 2008, regarding the disappearance of a witness in trials against perpetrators of 
enforced disappearances. A third was received on 3 October 2008, regarding four outstanding 
cases. However, the information reviewed was considered insufficient to constitute a 
clarification. On 28 December 2006 the Government provided information on 8 cases to which 
the Working Group applied the six-month rule at its eighty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Working Group received new information from sources on 13 cases regarding children 
born in captivity. The sources informed that nine of these children have been found and 
identified. Additional four children, who were filed under their parents&#8217; names, have also been 
found and identified.<b> 
</b></p>

<p>51. Representatives of the Government of Argentina met with the Working Group at its 
eighty-fourth session to discuss efforts to clarify outstanding cases and the visit to the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention letters 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 16 May 2008, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the Government 
of Argentina regarding the short-term disappearance of a witness on various trials against 
perpetrators of enforced disappearances which occurred during the military dictatorship. The 
witness disappeared on 29 April 2008 and he was released the following day. The prompt 
intervention letter was jointly sent with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>53. The Working Group received two communications from the Government on 6 June 
and 27 June 2008 providing information on the actions taken by the Government regarding the 
above-mentioned disappearance as well as actions taken to protect him and his family after his 
release. 
</p>
<p><b>Deleted case 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Working Group decided that one case was erroneously reported. Although this case 
was originally submitted to the Working Group as a disappearance, the source recently informed 
that the person left voluntarily. Therefore, the case has been deleted from the Working Group&#8217;s 
records. 
</p>
<p><b>Visit 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Working Group undertook a mission to Argentina from 21 to 24 July 2008 (see

26 July 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases

July 2008. On the last day of the mission, the Working Group held a press conference in 
Buenos Aires. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>57. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 3,446 cases to the

Prompt intervention letter N/A Government response N/A 
Working Group request for a visit N/A Government response N/A 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>70. On 18 November 2008, the Government replied to the general allegation. The response 
could not be translated by the Secretariat in time for consideration by the Working Group for 
inclusion in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in Bolivia. This information was transmitted to the Government through 
the following general allegation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>72. In March 2004, the Government enacted Law 2640 on Exceptional Reparation to Victims 
of Political Violence during Inter-Constitutional Governments (Law CONREVIP), in which it 
agreed to pay compensation to victims of political violence, including victims of enforced 
disappearance that occurred between 1964 and 1982. Law 2640 created a National Commission 
(CONREVIP) to evaluate the victims&#8217; requests. Notwithstanding that, Law 2640 determined that 
CONREVIP be established after 90 days from its publication, Statutory Decree 28015, which 
regulated Law 2640; it was adopted only 11 months later. 
</p>
<p>73. It was reported that CONREVIP has serious administrative problems, mainly because of a 
lack of institutional support from the Ministry of Justice, which chairs the Commission. 
</p>
<p>74. It has been alleged that huge administrative and human resource constraints faced by the 
Commission have caused delays in the procedure. According to the information received, if 
CONREVIP continues to work with its current resources, it is unlikely that the review of the 
pending applications will be concluded by 2010. 
</p>
<p>75. It was reported that the Government has not provided payments to victims. Rather, the 
Government enacted complementary rules that are causing delays in the processing of 
compensation to victims, such as: Law 3275, which determines a new deadline for the 
submission of requests but also determines a delay in the procedure of compensating victims 
who had already applied for reparation before the new deadline; Law 3449, which determines 
that the CONREVIP Presidency, which was under the Ministry for Presidency, is now under the 
Ministry for Justice, and that two members from the legislative power become members of 
CONREVIP, which involves further delays in providing the victims with reparation; and 
Statutory Decree 29214, which establishes new deadlines to CONREVIP causing further delays. 
</p>
<p>76. According to credible sources, the main obstacle is that Law 2640 requires that 80 per cent 
of the total amount of the compensation is to be funded by the international community. This 
substantial part of the required financial resources is unlikely to be obtained from the 
international community; it is the State that is directly responsible for human rights violations 
and compensation. It was reported that a lack of funds prevents the Government from providing 
reparation to victims. 
</p>
<p>77. As reported above, on 18 November 2008, the Government replied to the general 
allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>78. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 48 cases to the Government. The 
majority occurred between 1980 and 1982, in the context of measures taken by the authorities 
after two military coups d&#8217;&#233;tat<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group clarified 20 cases; 19 on the basis of information provided by the 
Government and 1 on the basis of information provided by the source; 28 remain outstanding. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observation 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Working Group reminds the Government of its responsibility, according to article 19 
of the Declaration, to provide adequate compensation to victims, regardless of the level of funds 
received from the international community.

<p>98. The Working Group transmitted two newly-reported cases to the Government of  
Colombia concerning <b>Edgar Jaimes Ni&#241;o </b>and<b> Victor Julio Ricardo Villalba</b>, arrested in the 
municipality of Sahagun in the province of Cordoba, allegedly by members of the Prosecutor&#8217;s

</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Working Group reviewed 14 communications from the Government: 
11 communications dated 18 July 2007, 23 August 2007, 28 September 2007, 
27 November 2007, 5 December 2007, 3 January 2008, 12 February 2008, 22 February 2008, 
20 May 2008, 20 May 2008 and 1 July 2008. Information on cases was reviewed  
but considered insufficient to constitute a clarification. In the remaining three communications 
dated 16 August 2007, 22 October 2007 and 12 November 2007 the Government provided death 
certificates related to four cases, to which the Working Group applied the six-month rule. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>100. Additional information was received from sources concerning 40 outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group clarified four cases for which the six-month rule expired as no 
observations were received from the source. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention letter 
</b></p>
<p>101. On 6 October 2008, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the 
Government of Colombia regarding acts of intimidation and reprisals suffered by the family 
members of a person who disappeared on 29 July 2002. According to the source, the Mayor of 
Agua Azul, the city where the family lived, was not only responsible for the disappearance of the 
victim but also for intimidating his family. 
</p>
<p>102. On 13 October 2008, the source informed that on 11 October 2008, the Mayor of 
Agua Azul was arrested after the Prosecutor of the Human Rights Unit issued an arrest warrant 
against him for the alleged crime of enforced disappearance and conspiracy to commit a criminal 
offence. 
</p>
<p>103. On 17 November 2008, the Working Group sent a joint communication together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the threats 
and acts of intimidation suffered by five human rights defenders due to their activities related to 
the investigation of enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>104. No response was received from the Government regarding the above reported prompt 
interventions. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>105. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
allegedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government through two general allegations. 
</p>
<p>106. On the first general allegation, credible sources reported that the number of people that 
have disappeared in Colombia in recent years may reach 30,000. In 2000, the Government 
investigated 3,500 disappearances. In 2007, that number rose to 15,600 investigations. 
</p>
<p>107. According to credible sources, the number of disappearances is much higher than the 
official figures because of a poor and inefficient administrative system in the country, especially 
in the rural areas of Colombia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>108. It was reported that demobilized paramilitary commanders and troops confessed to no less 
than 1,009 mass graves, enabling authorities to find the remains of 1,996 missing persons. 
</p>
<p>109. It was reported that there have hardly been any convictions for the enforced 
disappearances. Most crimes have never been solved and most confessions were made under the 
Justice and Peace law, granting lower sentences for cooperation with justice. 
</p><p>110. On the second general allegation, credible sources reported that despite the legislative 
efforts undertaken by the Government of Colombia during the past decades, including the 
enactment of Law 589 of 2000 which criminalizes the practice of enforced disappearance, the 
families of the disappeared still face many difficulties, particularly with regard to the rights to 
truth, justice and reparation. 
111. It was reported that one of the main legal problems is that according to Law 418 of 1997 
and Decree 7381 of 2004, victims of enforced disappearance and their families are not 
considered victims of political violence, thus depriving them of humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>112. In order to receive humanitarian assistance, the families must apply for a declaration of 
presumption of death, and then a death certificate. This lays down preferential treatment for 
victims of other crimes such as kidnappings, who are not required to obtain death certificates in 
order to receive assistance. 
</p>
<p>113. According to the reports received, this legal obligation re-victimizes families by making 
them go through the process of having a death certificate, although neither the fate nor the 
whereabouts of the disappeared person are known. 
</p>
<p>114. In addition, the fact that a disappearance is treated as a direct death does not take into 
account the continuous nature of the crime, the right to truth for the families of  
the disappeared and the obligation of the State to continue the investigation. There is also fear 
that a declaration of presumed death may lead to a legal registry as a death rather than a 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>115. No reply was received from the Government regarding both general allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>116. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 1,227 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 272 cases, 205 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 67 on the 
basis of information provided by the source; 955 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>117. A summary of the situation in the country appears in document E/CN.4/2006/56 and 
Corr.1. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>118. The Working Group notes that only two newly-reported cases were received. However, it 
expresses deep concern at the fact that allegedly the real number of disappearances is much 
higher than the number reported in official figures. 
</p>
<p>119. The Working Group is pleased to note that a number of mass graves have been revealed by 
demobilized paramilitary commanders and troops. In this connection, it encourages the 
Government to identify all remains, some of which may lead to the clarification of cases. 
</p>
<p>120. The Working Group notes that although the number of investigations has increased, few 
convictions have occurred. In this regard, it reminds the Government of its obligation to bring to 
justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced disappearance, according to 
article 14 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>121. The Working Group expresses concern about the increasing number of cases of 
intimidation and reprisals. In this connection, it reminds the Government of its obligation to 
protect against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal according to article 13.3 (protection against 
ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal) and 13.5 (ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal should be 
punished) of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>122. The Working Group expresses concern that compensation is subject to a presumption of 
death and then a death certificate, which is not in accordance with article 19 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>123. The Working Group sent a letter to the Government of Colombia requesting a report on the 
implementation of its recommendations following its country visit in 2005. The Working Group 
regrets that no such report was received.

<p><b>Urgent action 
</b></p>
<p>175. The Working Group transmitted one case to the Government under its urgent action 
procedure. The case concerned <b>Mr. T. S. Abi Chiru</b>, aged 17, disappeared near the border with 
Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Working Group transmitted 32 newly-reported cases to the Government of India. The 
majority occurred between 1986 and 1994, mainly in 1992 and 1993. One case took place in 
2005 in Barmullah District. All victims were males last seen at their homes or at police stations 
in Punjab. 
<b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>177. The Government transmitted three communications to the Working Group, 
dated 31 January, 3 September and 9 September 2008, concerning five cases. The Working 
Group decided that in two cases, where the Government stated that the victims were at home, the 
replies could constitute clarifications, provided the source did not raise an objection within 
six months. In the other three cases, the information was insufficient to clarify the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>178. Based on information provided by the Government, the Working Group decided to clarify 
two cases, following the expiration of the six-month rule. 
</p>

</p>

</b>  See Annex 5 for the list of names of the newly-reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>179. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after its eighty-third and eighty-fifth sessions. 
</p>
<p>180. It was reported that there is an absence of domestic remedies to address enforced 
disappearances, particularly those that took place between 1984 and 1995 in Punjab. The 
Government of India has allegedly refused to take effective legislative, judicial and 
administrative measures to end enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>181. In 1997, the Supreme Court appointed the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) 
of India as its sui generis body to examine secret cremations and to redress fundamental human 
rights violations. However, the NHRC limited its mandate to secret cremations, ignoring the 
violations of the right to life and the right to liberty; territorially restricted its mandate to 
three crematoriums; and refused to investigate any disappearances, relying on police admissions 
to determine the status of victims, rather than hearing any evidence from family members. 
</p>
<p>182. In a separate allegation, it was reported that hundreds of unidentified graves have been 
uncovered from 2006 in Jammu and Kashmir. The graves of at least 940 persons have been 
found in 18 villages in Uri District alone. 
</p>
<p>183. These graves are believed to contain the remains of victims of unlawful killings, enforced 
disappearances, torture and other abuses which occurred from 1989. However, it was reported to 
the Working Group that the Indian Army has claimed that the graves belong to armed rebels and 
foreign militants killed lawfully in armed encounters with military forces and that there have 
been no investigations or exhumations of the gravesites. 
</p>
<p>184. No responses were received from the Government regarding both general allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>185. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 423 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 61 cases, 51 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 10 on the 
basis of information provided by the source; 362 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>186. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration, 
mainly the right to a prompt and effective remedy (art. 9), the obligation to investigate all cases 
of enforced disappearances (art. 13.1), the obligation to make available findings of investigations 
to those concerned (art. 13.4) and to conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long 
as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6). 
</p>
<p>187. The Working Group requests the Government to comment on the information contained in 
the general allegations, which may lead to the clarification of outstanding cases. </p>

<p>188. The Working Group transmitted three cases to the Government under its standard 
procedure. The first concerned <b>Marsaid Jamrong Thaib Tarab</b>, arrested at the Military District 
Command in Lampung in 1965. The second concerned <b>Kaswan Tarab</b>, arrested by the Military 
and last seen in detention on Buru Island, Maluku, in 1966. The third concerned <b>Simad Tarab</b>, 
arrested in 1965 by the Military and Police and taken to a factory in Central Java and last seen 
in 1966. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>189. The Government submitted one communication to the Working Group 
dated 27 November 2007, in response to a general allegation sent in 2007. 
</p>
<p>190. The Government stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;any serious human rights violations which occurred before this law [Act. No. 26/2000] 
was established must be investigated and decided on by the Ad Hoc Human Rights Court, 
additionally, it must be supported by a Presidential Decision and must follow a request 
from the Indonesian legislative. The Ad Hoc Human Rights Court mentioned above was 
not in fact created until a much later date, thus post-dating the aforementioned 
disappearances. Therefore, from the judicial perspective, the investigation results from the 
National Human Rights Commission concerned with the involuntary disappearances which 
occurred from 1997 to 1998, did not follow the prescribed steps necessary needed for the 
next investigative step to take place.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>191. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to Indonesia. 
The Government responded that it would not be possible to receive the Working Group during 
2007 and that greater benefit would be derived from a visit at a later date. A reminder letter was 
sent on 3 April 2008; the Government has not yet responded. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>192. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 165 cases to the Government. Of 
those, 3 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source; 162 remain 
outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>193. The Working Group reiterates its observations made in previous reports, since it received 
no information from the Government thereon. 
</p>
<p>194. The Working Group encourages the Government of Indonesia, in cooperation with the 
Government of Timor-Leste, to communicate with the Working Group to further the clarification 
of all outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>195. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration to 
conduct thorough and impartial investigations &#8220;for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced 
disappearance remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6). 
</p>
<p>196. The Working Group notes the Government&#8217;s reply to the request for a visit, in which it 
indicated that the visit could not take place at the proposed time, and looks forward to receiving 
proposed dates as soon as possible.

</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>209. The Working Group received one communication from the Government 
dated 7 August 2008, regarding the general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>210. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in Italy. This information was transmitted to the Government after its 
eighty-third session through the following general allegation. 
</p>
<p>211. In the context of one case of extraordinary rendition that occurred in Italy 
on 17 February 2003, which involved an enforced disappearance for a certain period of time, and 
in the context of the extraordinary rendition programmes carried out by the United States of 
America together with Egypt, where the person was secretly imprisoned and allegedly tortured, it 
was reported that: 
</p>
<p> (a) Under Italian criminal legislation, enforced disappearance is not codified as an 
autonomous offence; 
</p>
<p> (b) In addition, public servants that might be accused of acts that may qualify as 
enforced disappearance can invoke &#8220;State secrecy&#8221; in order not to testify or be submitted to a 
regular judgement. 
</p><p>212. On 3 August 2007, a new intelligence law was adopted (Legge No. 124) according to 
which State secrecy cannot be invoked in order to not be submitted to regular judgement for a 
series of serious crimes. However, grave human rights violations, including enforced 
disappearance, are not included in this list. The Working Group was also informed that 
according to this law, news, acts, activities, information, documents and places may be covered 
by State secrecy for at least 15 years. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>213. Allegedly, this provision, if applied to cases where an enforced disappearance has 
occurred, is not compatible with the aim of prevention and repression of the offence. 
</p>
<p>214. In a communication dated 7 August 2008, the Government of Italy stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The crime of enforced disappearance falls within Art. 6085 of the domestic criminal code, 
which is devoted to the offences of abduction, kidnapping and envisages, inter alia, the 
aggravating circumstance, in case such crimes are committed by a public official or civil 
servant, the detention penalty term will be increased.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>215. The Government reported that &#8220;by Act N. 124 adopted on 3 August 2007, the institute of 
the so-called &#8216;functional safeguards&#8217; introduced an ad hoc legal excuse, to be applied to the staff 
of the Intelligence Services for the State Security, who are authorized by the competent political 
Authority, to perform duties pursuing institutional objectives of the Service which, in principle, 
might fall under criminal conduct&#8221;. In this connection, the Government added that by art. 17, 
para. 2, of Act 124/07, it is envisaged that the legal excuse institute cannot cover &#8220;crimes aimed 
at endangering, attempting or affecting the right to life, the physical integrity, the personal and 
moral liberties, the health and the safety of individuals&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>216. The Government further reported that &#8220;by Art. 39 of Act 124/07, the prerequisites for the 
application of the State secrecy have been defined. The State secrecy is applied only as a last 
resort, when the State security is challenged and under threat. When such prerequisites emerge, 
the protection of the State secrecy is decided by the President of the Council of Ministers. 
Accordingly, there is &#8216;no possibility for the accused public official&#8217; to decide the applicability of 
the State secrecy: the public official may only, by jurisdictional action, initiate a parallel, 
interlocutory proceeding, aimed at getting a decision by the President of the Council of Ministers 
whether to confirm or not the State secrecy. However, at procedural level State secrecy does not 
interrupt penal actions.&#8221; The Government added that &#8220;procedurally, it is worth reiterating that the 
decision confirming the State secrecy has to be explicit and made solely by the President of the 
Council of Ministers: in light of the strict prerequisites defined by Law, neither the accused 
person, nor the witness may take this kind of decision&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>217. The Working Group notes that the response of the Government does not specifically 
address whether or not it conducted an extraordinary rendition programme, together with other 
countries, consisting of secretly transporting a person through various countries, a practice which 
amounts to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>218. The Working Group reminds the Government that following its general comment on 
article 4 of the Declaration, the crime of enforced disappearance shall be an offence and included 
in criminal law as an autonomous crime, and not incorporated in domestic legislation as part of 
other offences. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>277. The Working Group sent 118 cases to the Government under its standard procedure. These 
cases took place in Bardiya district between 1999 and 2004, mainly in 2002. They concerned 
members of an indigenous group, including 11 females, 5 of them minors, as well as 8 minor 
males. The Army is believed to be responsible for the majority of these disappearances. 
<b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>278. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group, 
concerning 23 outstanding cases, dated 30 November 2007. Based on the information received, 
which stated that two victims were in detention and one had been released, the Working Group 
applied the six-month rule to three cases. For the other 20 cases, the Government stated that the 
victims had either been killed or had been released. The information was insufficient to clarify 
the outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>279. The source provided additional information on three outstanding cases. On two cases, the 
source requested additional information from the Government concerning ongoing 
investigations. On the third case, which was clarified by the Government, the source informed 
that the victim had been released from prison. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>280. Based on information provided by the Government, the Working Group clarified 
three cases following the expiration of the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>281. Representatives of the Government met with the Working Group at its eighty-sixth session 
to discuss the implementation of the recommendations following the Working Group&#8217;s visit 
in 2004 and a possible follow-up visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>282. On 12 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a follow-up mission to Nepal. 
The Representatives of the Government orally informed the Working Group that the 
Government may consider a possible mission at a later stage. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>283. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government after its eighty-third session. 
</p>
<p>284. It was reported that the draft bill to provide for the amendment of the Civil Code, 
criminalizing the practice of enforced disappearance, fails in its effort to criminalize and provide 
for the prosecution of those responsible for enforced disappearances. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>285. The allegations reported that the definition of &#8220;causing disappearance&#8221; in the draft bill does 
not reflect the definition found in the Declaration, as it only covers a disappearance that is 
carried out by a person &#8220;having the authorization under the law to arrest, carry out an 
investigation or inquiry or implement laws&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>286. In addition, according to the allegation, the draft bill provides that no time limit will apply 
in the case of murder after disappearance, but if a case does not involve murder, no complaint 
can be made after six months from the date of the disappearance, when the person is released or 
when the release is made public, failing to take into account the continuous nature of enforced 
disappearances. Moreover, the letter of allegation indicates that the draft bill does not address the 
issue of the enforced disappearances that occurred during the 10 years of conflict. Although there 
was no specific crime of enforced disappearance under Nepalese law during this period, any act 
of enforced disappearance is a continuing crime as long as the perpetrators conceal the fate and 
whereabouts of the disappeared person. 
</p>
<p>287. Finally, with regard to penalties, the draft bill allegedly provides for a penalty of 
imprisonment of up to five years, which does not reflect the seriousness of the offence, in line 
with offences of similar gravity. 
</p>
<p>288. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>289. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 649 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 214 cases: 135 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 79 on the 
basis of information provided by the source; 435 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>290. The Working Group reiterates the observation made in 2007 regarding the Government&#8217;s 
obligations under the Declaration, &#8220;to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act 
of enforced disappearance&#8221; (art. 13), that &#8220;persons alleged to have committed any acts referred to 
in article 4, paragraph 1, shall be suspended from any official duties during the investigation&#8221; 
(art. 16.1) and persons &#8220;shall be tried only by the competent ordinary courts in each State, and 
not by any other special tribunal, in particular military courts&#8221; (art. 16.2). 
</p>
<p>291. The Working Group sent a letter to the Government of Nepal requesting a written report on 
the implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group following its country visit 
in 2004. The Working Group regrets that no written report was received. 
</p>
<p>292. The Working Group reaffirms its request to the Government of Nepal for a country visit 
aimed at clarifying the 435 outstanding cases. </p>

<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>296. The Working Group transmitted two newly-reported cases to the Government. These cases 
concerned<b> Faisal Farz </b>and<b> Masood Janjua</b>, reportedly disappeared in July 2005 between 
Islamabad and Peshawar. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>297. The Government submitted five communications, dated 11 April, 16 May, 20 August, 
29 August 2008 and 15 October 2008. The first three contained general information on the 
Government&#8217;s cooperation with the Working Group. The letter dated 29 August 2008 expressed 
the Government&#8217;s disagreement with the contents of the press release issued by the Working 
Group on the International Day of the Disappeared and also noted its ongoing cooperation with 
the Working Group. The latter contained information on one case which had been previously 
clarified by the source. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>298. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government in two separate allegations after the Working Group&#8217;s 
eighty-third and eighty-fifth sessions. 
</p>
<p>299. It was reported that the current situation in Pakistan represents a major obstacle for the 
proper implementation of the Declaration, inasmuch as the state of emergency and the amended 
Army Act could represent a threat for compliance in particular of articles 2.2 (obligation to 
prevent and eradicate enforced disappearance), 3 (obligation to take effective legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced 
disappearance), 7 (obligation not to invoke internal political instability nor any other public 
emergency to justify enforced disappearance), 10 (obligation to hold people deprived of their 
liberty in officially recognized places of detention and to bring them before a judicial authority 
promptly after detention), 13 (obligation to investigate cases of enforced disappearance), 14 
and 16 (obligation to try those accused of enforced disappearance before competent ordinary 
civil courts), and 18 (obligation not to adopt amnesty laws or similar measures that might have 
the effect of exempting perpetrators of enforced disappearances from any criminal proceedings 
or sanctions) of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>300. It was also reported that key rights have been suspended. 
</p>
<p>301. It was also alleged that the Supreme Court was investigating some 600 cases of 
&#8220;disappearances&#8221;. While some of these cases reportedly concerned terrorism suspects, many 
involved political opponents of the Government. The Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice 
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, publicly stated that it had overwhelming evidence that Pakistan&#8217;s </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>intelligence agencies were detaining terror suspects and other opponents. The retroactive 
application of the Army Act will allegedly allow substantial impunity of those tried for having 
terror suspects disappear. 
</p>
<p>302. In a separate allegation, it was reported that the Government of Pakistan has created two 
committees in the Balochistan province, one for missing persons and one for internally displaced 
persons. However, the names of the committee members to investigate cases of missing persons 
have yet to be announced. 
</p>
<p>303. It was also reported that disappearances are still occurring in Balochistan, even after the 
Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement that military operations in the province would cease. It has been 
alleged that 39 persons, mostly young people, still remain missing after being arrested in the first 
quarter of 2008.  
</p>
<p>304. According to the reports received, military personnel attacked and raided different houses 
and hostels of Khuzdar Degree College in Khuzdar and arrested more than 200 persons. Ten 
persons are still missing. In another incident, army officials raided the house of the district 
president of a nationalist group. His whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>305. In a separate incident, three persons were reportedly arrested by military personnel in 
May 2008. Their charred bodies were later found in the centre of a market place in Dera Bugti. 
</p>
<p>306. No responses were received from the Government regarding both general allegations. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>307. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 118 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 24 cases: 18 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 6 on the basis 
of information provided by the source; 94 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>308. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration, to 
prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances (art. 2), to &#8220;take effective legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced 
disappearance&#8221; (art. 3), that &#8220;no circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of 
war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify 
enforced disappearances&#8221; (art. 7), to investigate all cases of enforced disappearances (art. 13.1), 
and that persons who are alleged to have committed an enforced disappearance &#8220;shall not benefit 
from any special amnesty or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from 
any criminal proceedings or sanction&#8221; (art. 18.1). 
</p>
<p>309. The Working Group also reminds the Government that, according to its general comment 
on the definition of enforced disappearance, a detention, followed by an extrajudicial execution 
is an enforced disappearance proper, as long as such detention or deprivation of liberty was </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>carried out by government agents and, subsequent to the detention, or even after the execution 
was carried out, State officials refuse to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the person concerned 
or refuse to acknowledge the act having been perpetrated at all.

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>314. The Working Group sent two cases under its urgent action procedure to the Government. 
The first case concerned <b>Flavio Arante</b>, last seen at a military detachment in Negros Oriental in 
January 2008. The second concerned <b>James Balao</b>, disappeared in Baguio City in 
September 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>315. The Working Group transmitted four newly-reported cases to the Government. They 
concerned <b>Gloria Soco</b>, <b>Celina Palma</b>, <b>Ariel Beloy</b> and <b>Prudencio Calubid</b>, members of the 
National Democratic Front of the Philippines Negotiating Panel, stopped on a highway in 
Quezon Province and allegedly taken away by military officers in June 2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>316. The Working Group received two communications from the Government, 
dated 19 November 2007 and 15 October 2008, concerning five outstanding cases. The first 
communication indicated that investigations on four cases were closed. In the second 
communication, the Government informed that an <i>amparo</i> petition had been dismissed by the 
Court of Appeals for lack of factual basis and for failure to substantiate the allegations, but that 
the investigation was ongoing. The information was insufficient to clarify the outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>317. Information was received from the source concerning 12 outstanding cases. The source 
indicated that 10 habeas corpus petitions had been requested, and 6 had been denied. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>318. Following the expiration of the six-month rule, the Working Group decided to clarify 
two cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>319. On 29 August 2008, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention to the Government of 
the Philippines, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
(listed as an urgent appeal under the other mandates&#8217; records). The letter concerned four human 
rights activists who received threatening messages on their mobile phones, warning them to 
cease their investigations into the disappearance of a 46-year-old man. 
</p>
<p>320. No response was received from the Government concerning this prompt intervention. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>321. Information was submitted by credible sources concerning obstacles reportedly 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was transmitted to the 
Government after its eighty-third session. 
</p>
<p>322. It was reported that there is a pattern of impunity and complicity of government forces in 
the Central Luzon region of the Philippines. Since 2001, more than 70 persons have allegedly 
been victims of enforced disappearances, a number of those previously disappeared have 
surfaced after being detained and tortured by military officers, and no perpetrators have been 
punished. 
</p>
<p>323. It was also reported that the Court of Appeals in Manila did not allow an official from a 
human rights group to testify on the disappearance of an activist farmer. The Assistant Solicitor 
General allegedly filed a manifestation to stop the official from giving testimony. The letter of 
allegation states that the Court ruled that the official could not testify because the information 
presented had already been discussed during the summit on extrajudicial killings organized by 
the Supreme Court recently. According to the information received, the testimony would show 
that this case is not an isolated incident as claimed by the military, but rather that there is a 
pattern of disappearances in the region. 
</p>
<p>324. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>325. On 24 May 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to the Philippines. 
No response has been received from the Government.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>326. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 780 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 161 cases, 126 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 35 on the 
basis of information provided by the source; 619 remain outstanding. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>327. The Working Group expresses concern that during the period under review, two urgent 
actions were sent to the Government. 
</p>
<p>328. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under the Declaration, to 
prevent ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal against those involved in the investigation 
(art. 13.3), to take steps &#8220;to ensure that any ill treatment, intimidation, reprisal or any other form 
of interference on the occasion of the lodging of a complaint or during the investigation 
procedure is appropriately punished&#8221; (art. 13.5) and that &#8220;investigations should be conducted for 
as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified&#8221; (art. 13.6). 
</p>
<p>329. The Working Group reaffirms its request to the Government of the Philippines for a 
country visit aimed at clarifying the 619 outstanding cases.

<p>two cases concerned <b>Khusein Motsolgov</b> and <b>Akhmet Kartoev</b>, arrested in Nazran region in 
Ingushetia by officials from the State Security Forces on 5 May and 22 May 2007, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>332. The Working Group received nine communications from the Government of the 
Russian Federation dated 24 August 2007, 18 September 2007, 22 October 2007, 
29 December 2007, 26 March 2008, 30 June 2008, 4 August 2008, 25 August 2008 and 
21 October 2008. In the first six communications, the Russian Federation provided additional 
information on 24 outstanding cases of enforced disappearance. However, the information 
submitted was insufficient to clarify the outstanding cases. The last three communications could 
not be translated by the Secretariat in time for consideration by the Working Group for inclusion 
in the present report. 
</p>
<p>333. The Government of Uzbekistan provided information on the case of <b>Abdulaziz 
Murodullayevich Boymatov</b> which could constitute a clarification provided the source did not 
raise an objection within six months. It is to be noted that, according to the methods of work of 
the Working Group, the case of <b>Abdulaziz Murodullayevich Boymatov </b>was accounted under 
the Russian Federation, where he was arrested. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>334. Information was received from sources regarding the case of <b>Abdulaziz Murodullayevich 
Boymatov</b>.<b> </b>The source requested additional time in order to confirm the information provided by 
the Government regarding his whereabouts. Therefore, the Working Group decided to extend the 
period of consideration of this case, and suspend the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>335. The Government of the Russian Federation indicated that it continued to be in agreement 
in principle with the visit and asked that the time for the visit be reviewed after the completion of 
the process of assessment of the mandates of special procedures by the Human Rights Council. 
On 4 June 2008, the Working Group reiterated its interest to undertake the visit to the 
Russian Federation and the first quarter of 2009 was suggested as possible dates. The 
Government of the Russian Federation has not yet responded to the renewed request. 
</p>

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>351. The Working Group sent 43 cases under its urgent action procedure to the Government, 
concerning 39 men and 4 women disappeared between February and October 2008. The majority 
of disappearances took place in Trincomalee and are attributed to the military, the police, 
security forces and paramilitary groups working with the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>352. The Working Group transmitted 169 newly-reported cases to the Government. The alleged 
disappearances took place mainly between 2006 and 2008, mainly in Colombo, Trincomalee and 
Jaffna. The military, police, criminal investigation department and paramilitary groups working 
with the Government are allegedly responsible for these disappearances, which include one 
woman and one minor. Other cases concern men who disappeared in Jaffna. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>353. The Working Group received three communications from the Government, 
dated 3 October 2007, 28 August and 2 September 2008, concerning four outstanding cases. 
Concerning two cases, the Government stated that no complaints of disappearances had been 
reported to the police and that the national identification card numbers did not correspond with 
their records. The information was insufficient to clarify the outstanding cases. For two cases, 
the Government provided the address of the victims. As a result, the Working Group applied the 
six-month rule. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>354. The Working Group received one communication from a source regarding an urgent 
action, indicating that the person had been released. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  See Annex 5 for the list of names of the newly-reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>355. Following the information received by the source, the Working Group decided to clarify 
one case. 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>356. Representatives of the Government of Sri Lanka met with the Working Group at its 
eighty-fourth session to discuss developments connected to its outstanding cases and the request 
for a visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>357. On 15 July 2008, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the Government 
of Sri Lanka, together with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders. It concerned human rights defenders who were questioned by the Colombo 
Crime Division on the history, objectives and details of their work, after they distributed two 
leaflets during a public demonstration. Further questioning took place at the Colombo Crime 
Division Office, and information about the staff members and their families was also recorded. 
</p>
<p>358. On 12 September 2008, the Working Group sent a second prompt intervention letter, 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (listed as an 
urgent appeal under the mandate&#8217;s records). It concerned the prolonged interrogation of a human 
rights defender working on enforced disappearances, as well as a reported defamation campaign 
against him. 
</p>
<p>359. On 6 October, the Working Group sent a third prompt intervention letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders. It concerned the bombing of a human rights lawyer&#8217;s 
premises. He had reportedly been taking cases of enforced disappearance to court. 
</p>
<p>360. On 4 September 2008, the Government responded to the first letter. The Government 
indicated that investigations were launched based on information received concerning the 
distribution of pamphlets &#8220;attempting to excite feelings of disaffection amongst public in 
contempt of the administration of justice. [&#8230;] The material contained in the pamphlet was 
reportedly &#8220;provocative in nature, would have aroused feelings of hatred towards security forces 
and the police [&#8230;]&#8221; and &#8220;could have possibly influenced the public to precipitate an inimical 
situation. [&#8230;] In the pamphlet in question, certain statements were made against armed forces 
and the police and their activities in the performance of their duties. [&#8230;] Therefore, it was 
necessary to investigate the nature of the publication and to seek legal advice from the Attorney 
General&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>361. In addition, the Government stated that in the course of the investigations, no arrests or 
detentions were made and that there were no threats or intimidations on those who were 
subjected to questioning. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>362. No response was received from the Government regarding the other two letters. 
</p>
<p><b>Press release 
</b></p>
<p>363. On 11 June 2008, the Working Group issued a press release deploring the large number of 
cases of disappearances in Sri Lanka. The Working Group called upon the Sri Lankan authorities 
to take effective measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearances, carry out 
thorough investigations and bring the perpetrators to justice. Finally, the Working Group 
reiterated its request to conduct a country visit. 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>364. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested to undertake a mission to Sri Lanka. 
The Government replied stating that it would not be possible to schedule a visit during the 
proposed dates, and that the interest of the Working Group would be given due consideration. 
Notwithstanding several reminders, no dates have yet been set. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>365. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 12,675 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 6,570 cases, 6,530 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 40 on 
the basis of information provided by the source; 378 were found to be duplications and were 
therefore deleted; 5,727 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>366. The Working Group remains gravely concerned at the increase in reported cases of 
enforced disappearances in the country, which led to the issuance of a related press release. The 
Working Group is alarmed that 212 cases were reported during 2008. 
</p>
<p>367. The Working Group is concerned that many other cases may be occurring in the country 
and are not being reported because of fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>368. In light of the increasing number of cases, the Working Group would like to reiterate its 
request to conduct a mission to Sri Lanka as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>369. The Working Group encourages the Government to report on the further implementation of 
the recommendations emanating from the Working Group visits in 1991, 1992 and 1999. 
</p>
<p>370. The Working Group reminds the Government of Sri Lanka of its obligations  
under the Declaration to &#8220;take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to 
prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction&#8221; 
(art. 3). </p>

<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p>371. One case was sent to the Government of the Sudan under the urgent action procedure. The 
case concerned <b>Saida Asil Nur Oshar</b>, allegedly arrested on 6 September 2008, by members of 
the National Intelligence and Security Service in El Geneina in West Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>372. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
allegedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>373. Credible sources reported that following an attack on 10 May 2008 by rebel forces on 
Omdurman (one of the three towns that form the Sudanese capital of Khartoum) the Sudanese 
authorities arrested hundreds of men, women and children, many of whom were subjected to 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>374. Many of those arrested were picked up in public locations, such as on public transport 
and on the street. State agents are reported to have transferred an unknown number of detainees 
to locations outside Khartoum, such as Shandi to the north of the capital and Port Sudan in 
eastern Sudan. 
</p>
<p>375. Allegedly, many relatives of arrested or disappeared individuals reported that they have 
been unable to get information on the whereabouts of their loved ones, and that the authorities 
have refused to acknowledge that they are in detention. 
</p>
<p>376. Reportedly, relatives who have tried to locate detainees contacted the media or the 
National Intelligence and Security Services Information Office have themselves been harassed 
and risked being arrested. 
</p>
<p>377. No reply was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>378. A request for a visit was sent to the Government of the Sudan on 20 December 2005. 
On 3 April 2008, the Working Group reiterated its interest to undertake the visit. However, no 
reply has yet been received. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>379. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 382 cases to the Government. It 
clarified 209 cases, 205 on the basis of information provided by the Government and 4 on the 
basis of information provided by the source; 173 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>380. A summary of the situation in the country appears in E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>381. The Working Group reiterates its concern about the possibility of underreporting of cases 
that may be occurring in Darfur as well as in other parts of the country. 
</p>
<p>382. The Working Group also reiterates its request for an invitation from the Government of the 
Sudan to conduct a country visit to assist the Government in preventing disappearances and in 
clarifying the 173 outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p>383. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under articles 2 (obligation 
to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearance), 3 (obligation to take effective legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of disappearance), 10 
(persons deprived of liberty should be held in officially recognized places of detention, and be 
brought before a judicial authority), 13.3 (protection against ill-treatment, intimidation or 
reprisal) and 13.5 (ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal should be punished) of the Declaration.

<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>390. The Working Group transmitted seven newly-reported cases to the Government. Five 
concerned <b>Maneeya Loneeya</b>, <b>Wae-asi Wae-su</b>,<b> Arhamah Waedorloh</b>,<b> Mayataeng Marano 
</b>and<b> Marudin Wava</b>, who disappeared in Yala Province between 2004 and 2007. The other two 
concerned <b>Ibrohim Sae</b>, disappeared in Narathiwat Province, and <b>Arun Mong</b>, disappeared in 
Songhkhla Province. The police, the army and security forces are reportedly responsible for 
these disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>391. The Working Group received two communications from the Government, 
dated 22 November 2007 and 3 September 2008. The first concerned 10 outstanding cases. In 
six cases, the Government stated that there was no evidence to prove that the victims are still </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>alive or being detained. In three cases, the Government provided additional information on 
ongoing investigations. The information was insufficient to clarify the outstanding cases. The 
latter communication expressed the Government&#8217;s disagreement with the contents of the press 
release issued by the Working Group on the International Day of the Disappeared and noted its 
ongoing cooperation with the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>392. Information was received from the source concerning nine outstanding cases, requesting 
the Government to provide substantive and detailed information concerning the investigations 
currently being carried out. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p>393. On 26 February 2008, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the 
Government, together with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
(listed as an urgent appeal under that mandate&#8217;s records). The letter concerned the wife of a 
human rights lawyer who disappeared in 2004. The Department of Special Investigation decided 
to transfer the witness protection she was receiving from civilian officers to police officers, who 
were on trial in connection with her husband&#8217;s disappearance. As a result, she withdrew from the 
programme, and concern was expressed for her physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>394. On 1 October 2008, the Government responded, indicating that she was placed under 
Thailand&#8217;s witness protection programme in 2004, and that her protection remains the 
responsibility of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), Ministry of Justice, and not the 
police authorities. 
</p>
<p>395. The Government also noted that there has been concrete progress on the case, after the 
appointment of the new director of the DSI, who was allegedly the superior officer of the police 
officers currently accused in connection with the lawyer&#8217;s disappearance. The Government 
informed that it does not condone the case of suspected disappearance reported to the authorities 
and that all cases have been investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>396. Information was submitted by credible sources to the Working Group concerning obstacles 
reportedly encountered in the implementation of the Declaration. This information was 
transmitted to the Government. 
</p>
<p>397. It was reported that five of the suspects in the case of disappeared lawyer 
Somchai Neelapaichit are senior and mid-ranking police officers. There are reports that there has 
been a lack of police cooperation with Department of Special Investigation investigations and 
that there are other measures which may curtail or impede the investigation. 
</p>
<p>398. It was also reported that witness protection provided to the wife of Mr. Neelapaichit was 
withdrawn, replaced with police officers and later reinstated, but still under review, in possible 
contravention of article 13.3 of the Declaration. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>399. It was also reported that one police officer was convicted and four were acquitted. The 
family of Mr. Neelapaichit appealed the judgement and have been waiting over two years for the 
appeal decision. There is also concern that pending the appeal decision of the four police 
defendants, they have been allowed to resume police jobs, in contravention with article 16 (1) of 
the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>400. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>401. Since its establishment, the Working Group transmitted 58 cases to the Government; of 
those, 1 case was clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government, 2 cases were 
discontinued, and 55 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>402. The Working Group reminds the Government of its obligations under article 13.3 of the 
Declaration, to prevent ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal against those involved in the 
investigation, and article 13.5, to take steps &#8220;to ensure that any ill treatment, intimidation, 
reprisal or any other form of interference on the occasion of the lodging of a complaint or during 
the investigation procedure is appropriately punished&#8221;.

<p><b>Standard cases 
</b></p>
<p>409. The Working Group transmitted one reported case of disappearance to the Government. 
The case concerned <b>Fathollah Manochehri Fouladvand</b>, allegedly arrested in a district of 
Hakkari Province in Turkey on 17 January 2007 by Iranian Security Officers and taken to 
Tehran. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group sent a copy of this case to 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>410. The Working Group reviewed four communications from the Government of Turkey 
dated 2 October 2007, 30 January, 26 May and 13 October 2008, on 36 cases. On three cases the 
Working Group applied the six-month rule. 
</p>
<p>411. In the first communication, the Government of Turkey provided information on seven 
cases, with death certificates related to three of them, to which the Working Group applied the 
six-month rule. The information related to the other four cases was considered insufficient to 
clarify them. 
</p>
<p>412. Regarding the communications dated 30 January, 26 May and 13 October 2008, the 
Working Group decided that the responses were considered insufficient to clarify the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Clarifications 
</b></p>
<p>413. The Working Group clarified eight cases where the six-month rule expired as no 
observations were received from the source. 
</p>
<p><b>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

<p><b>Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>422. The Working Group received one communication from the Government 
dated 4 August 2008 regarding the general allegation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>General allegation 
</b></p>
<p>423. The Working Group received information from credible sources concerning obstacles 
encountered in the implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance in the United States of America. This information was transmitted to 
the Government after its eighty-third session through the following general allegation. 
</p>
<p>424. It was reported that one case of extraordinary rendition, which occurred in Italy 
on 17 February 2003, involved an enforced disappearance for a certain period of time. The 
Working Group was informed that this case took place in the context of extraordinary rendition 
programmes that were allegedly carried out by the United States of America together with Egypt, 
where the person was secretly imprisoned and reportedly tortured. 
</p>
<p>425. In a communication dated 4 August 2008, the Government of the United States of America 
stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;While the Government of the United States is not in a position to comment on 
specific alleged intelligence activities, the Government would like to emphasize that the 
United States does not transport individuals from one country to another for the purpose of 
interrogation using torture. Furthermore, the United States has not transported individuals, 
and will no transport individuals to a country where the Government believes they will be 
tortured.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations  
</b></p>
<p>426. The Working Group reminds the Government of its general comment on the definition of 
enforced disappearance, especially that intentionality is irrelevant in the sense that any act of 
enforced disappearance has the consequence of placing the persons subjected thereto outside the 
protection of the law, regardless of the pursued purpose.

information on the case of <b>Abdulaziz Murodullayevich Boymatov</b>, which could constitute 
a clarification provided the source did not raise an objection within six months. It is to be 
noted that the case of <b>Abdulaziz Murodullayevich Boymatov </b>was registered under the 
Russian Federation, where he was arrested. 
</p>
<p>429. Regarding the communication dated 19 July 2008, the Working Group decided that the

<p>444. All outstanding cases were retransmitted and no response was received from the 
Government. A summary of the situation in the country appears in E/CN.4/2006/56 and Corr. 1. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  AREAS OF CONCERN, CONCLUSIONS AND  
RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>445. In 2008, the Working Group transmitted 1,203 newly-reported cases of disappearance 
to 27 Governments, 83 of which allegedly occurred during 2008. The Working Group used the 
urgent action procedure in 69 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months 
preceding the receipt of the report by the Working Group. During the reporting period, the 
Working Group was able to clarify 54 cases of disappearance. The Working Group is grateful for 
the cooperation received from a number of Governments. Nevertheless, it remains concerned 
that of the 79 States with outstanding cases, some Governments (Burundi, Guinea, Israel, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles and Timor-Leste, as well as the Palestinian Authority), have 
never replied to the Working Group&#8217;s communications. Some Governments provide responses 
that do not contain relevant information. The Working Group urges those Governments to fulfil 
their obligations under the Declaration and the resolutions of the General Assembly, the 
Commission on Human Rights and its successor, the Human Rights Council. The cooperation of 
Governments is indispensable for discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons 
around the globe. 
</p>
<p>446. The Working Group reminds States that enforced disappearance is a continuing offence for 
as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim remains unclarified. 
</p>
<p>447. The Working Group reminds States of their obligations under the Declaration to prevent 
impunity by taking lawful and appropriate steps to bring to justice those alleged to have 
committed enforced disappearances. In this regard, trials should be carried out by competent 
ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>448. The Working Group is aware of the fact that in certain circumstances, enforced 
disappearances may amount to crimes against humanity. It therefore calls upon all competent 
authorities to take all possible steps, in such cases, to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice. 
</p><p>449. The Working Group continues to be concerned about measures being taken while 
addressing terrorism and its implications relating to enforced disappearances. These include the 
enactment of legislation that restricts personal freedoms and weakens due process, random 
arrests committed during military operations, arbitrary detentions and extraordinary renditions, 
which amount to enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>450. The Working Group calls on States to take specific legislative, administrative, judicial or 
other measures to prevent and terminate enforced disappearances. States should also take 
specific measures under criminal law to define enforced disappearances as a separate criminal 
offence and to bring their existing legislation in line with the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>451. The Working Group reminds States of their obligation to ensure that every person having 
knowledge or legitimate interest has the right to complain to a competent and independent 
authority and to have that complaint promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated. The 
Working Group calls on States to consider establishing special independent investigating bodies </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to deal with matters of enforced disappearance. The Working Group also calls upon States, when 
responding to cases of disappearances in their country, to inform the Working Group of the 
specific steps taken to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance. 
</p>
<p>452. The Working Group also reminds States of its general comment referring to article 19, 
which states that &#8220;In addition to the punishment of the perpetrators and the rights to monetary 
compensation, the right to obtain redress for acts of enforced disappearance under article 19 of 
the Declaration also includes the &#8216;means for as complete a rehabilitation as possible&#8217;.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>453. The Working Group would like to emphasize the right to truth, which should be enjoyed 
by all victims of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>454. States ought to take specific measures to promote truth and reconciliation in their societies, 
as a means to ensure non-repetition of human rights violations, particularly enforced 
disappearances. Reconciliation takes place at various levels of society, between victims and 
perpetrators, among groups and at the national level. The Working Group stresses that measures 
taken to promote reconciliation should not be used as a substitute for bringing perpetrators to 
justice, in accordance with the principles provided for in the general comment on article 18 of 
the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>455. The question of disappearance has a special resonance with women. The serious economic 
hardships which usually accompany a disappearance are most often borne by them. When 
women are the victims of disappearance, they become particularly vulnerable to sexual and other 
forms of violence. In addition, it is they who are most often at the forefront of the struggle to 
resolve the disappearances of members of their family, making them susceptible to intimidation, 
persecution and reprisals. 
</p>
<p>456. The Working Group notes that children are also victims of disappearances, both directly 
and indirectly. The disappearance of a child, his/her wrongful removal, and the loss of a parent 
through disappearance are serious violations of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>457. The Working Group calls upon States to take specific measures to prevent and punish 
threats, intimidation and reprisals against all victims of enforced disappearances, including 
family members, witnesses and human rights defenders working on these cases. 
</p>
<p>458. Country visits are an integral part of the fulfilment of the Working Group&#8217;s mandate, as 
they allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing enforced 
disappearances, assist States in reducing obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration, and 
ensure access to those family members who might not be able to attend the Working Group&#8217;s 
sessions in Geneva. It would like to thank the States that have extended invitations to visit their 
countries or hosted the Working Group&#8217;s sessions. However, because informal confirmation and 
even standing invitations are not sufficient, the Working Group calls on all States with pending 
requests for visits to respond with specific dates as soon as possible. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>459. The Working Group also remains committed to assisting States in ensuring that their 
legislation and other measures are in conformity with the Declaration, by providing their 
expertise in this regard. 
</p>
<p>460. The Working Group notes with satisfaction that 79 countries have signed and five have 
ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. The Working Group is committed to cooperating with the committee under the 
Convention when it enters into force, and believes that the committee will complement its work 
in preventing enforced disappearances. It calls on countries that have not signed and/or ratified 
the Convention to do so and to accept the competence of the committee under article 31 and the 
inter-State complaint mechanism under article 32 of the Convention. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>REVISED METHODS OF WORK OF THE WORKING GROUP ON 
ENFORCED OR INVOLUNTARY DISAPPEARANCES 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Adopted on 4 December 2008) 
Mandate 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group&#8217;s methods of work are based on its mandate as stipulated originally in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) and as developed by the then 
Commission<b> </b>and the Human Rights Council in numerous further resolutions. The parameters of 
its work are laid down in the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human 
Rights, Economic and Social Council resolution 1235 (XLI) and the Declaration on the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance, adopted by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the 
Declaration&#8221;). 
</p>
<p><b>Definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p> As defined in the preambular part of the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when 
persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their liberty 
by officials of different branches or levels of Government or by organized groups or private 
individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of 
the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts of the persons 
concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which places such persons 
outside the protection of the law. 
</p>
<p><b>Basic mandate 
</b></p>
<p> The basic mandate of the Working Group is humanitarian in nature, aimed at assisting 
families in determining the fate and whereabouts of their disappeared relatives who are placed 
outside the protection of the law. To this end, the Working Group endeavours to establish a 
channel of communication between the families and the Governments concerned, with a view to 
ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly identified individual cases which families, 
directly or indirectly, have brought to the Group&#8217;s attention are investigated with a view to 
clarifying the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p><b>The Declaration 
</b></p>
<p> In addition to its original mandate, the Working Group has been entrusted by the General 
Assembly, the then Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, with various 
tasks. In particular, the Working Group is to monitor States&#8217; compliance with their obligations 
deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance<b> </b>and 
to provide to Governments assistance in its implementation. States are under an obligation to 
take effective measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance by making them 
continuing offences under criminal law and establishing civil liability of those responsible. The 
Declaration also refers to the right to a prompt and effective judicial remedy, as well as 
unhampered access of national authorities to all places of detention, the right to habeas corpus, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the maintenance of centralized registers of all places of detention, the duty to investigate fully all 
alleged cases of disappearance, the duty to try alleged perpetrators of acts of disappearance 
before ordinary (not military) courts, the exemption of the criminal offence of acts of enforced 
disappearances from statutes of limitation, special amnesty laws and similar measures leading to 
impunity. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group reminds the Governments of these obligations not only in the context 
of clarifying individual cases but also that of taking action of a more general nature. It draws the 
attention of Governments and non-governmental organizations to general or specific aspects of 
the Declaration, it recommends ways of overcoming obstacles to the realization of the 
Declaration, it discusses with representatives of Governments and non-governmental 
organizations how to solve specific problems in the light of the Declaration, it assists 
Governments by carrying out on-the-spot visits, organizing seminars and providing similar 
advisory services. The Working Group also makes observations on the implementation of the 
Declaration when the concerned Government has not fulfilled its obligations related to the rights 
to truth, justice and reparation. The Working Group adopts general comments whenever it 
considers that a provision of the Declaration requires further clarification or interpretation. 
</p>
<p><b>Admissibility of reports on disappearances 
</b></p>
<p> Reports on disappearances are considered admissible by the Working Group when they 
originate from the family or friends of the disappeared person. Such reports may, however, be 
channelled to the Working Group through representatives of the family, Governments, 
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other reliable sources. 
They must be submitted in writing with a clear indication of the identity of the sender; if the 
source is other than a family member, it must have direct consent of the family to submit the case 
on its behalf, and it must also be in a position to follow up with the relatives of the disappeared 
person concerning his or her fate. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group does not deal with situations of international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>Elements for admissibility 
</b></p>
<p> In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful investigations, the Working Group 
provides them with information containing at least a minimum of basic data. In addition, the 
Working Group constantly urges the senders of reports to furnish as many details as possible 
concerning the identity of the disappeared person and the circumstances of the disappearance. 
The Group requires the following minimum elements: 
</p>
<p> (a) Full name of the disappeared person and, if possible, age, gender, nationality, and 
occupation or profession; 
</p>
<p> (b) Date of disappearance, i.e. day, month and year of arrest or abduction, or day, 
month and year when the disappeared person was last seen. When the disappeared person was 
last seen in a detention centre, an approximate indication is sufficient (for example, March or 
spring 1990); </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Place of arrest or abduction, or where the disappeared person was last seen 
(indication of town or village, at least); 
</p>
<p> (d) Parties, acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, presumed to have carried out the arrest or abduction or to be 
holding the disappeared person in unacknowledged detention; 
</p>
<p> (e) Steps taken by the family to determine the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared 
person, or at least an indication that efforts to resort to domestic remedies were frustrated or have 
otherwise been inconclusive; 
</p>
<p> (f) A case should be submitted to the Working Group by a reliable source, which, if 
other than a family member, must indicate whether the reported victim's family has given their 
direct consent that this case be submitted to the Working Group on their behalf. 
</p>
<p> If a case is not admitted, the Working Group sends a response to the source indicating that 
the information received did not fulfil the established requirements, in order to permit the source 
to provide all relevant information. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication with Governments 
</b></p>
<p> In transmitting cases of disappearance, the Working Group deals exclusively with 
Governments, basing itself on the principle that Governments must assume responsibility for any 
violation of human rights on their territory. 
</p>
<p><b>Perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group operates on the basis that, and in accordance with the definition 
contained in the Preamble of the Declaration, for purposes of its work, enforced disappearances 
are only considered as such when the act in question is perpetrated by State actors or by private 
individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on behalf of, or with the 
support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government. Based on the above, the 
Working Group does not admit cases when they are attributed to persons or groups not acting on 
behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the Government, 
such as terrorist or insurgent movements fighting the Government in its own territory. 
</p>
<p><b>Standard procedure 
</b></p>
<p> Reported cases of disappearances are placed before the Working Group for detailed 
examination during its sessions. Those which fulfil the requirements outlined above are 
transmitted, upon the Group&#8217;s specific authorization, to the Governments concerned with the 
request that they carry out investigations in order to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, and inform the Group about the results. These cases are communicated by 
letter from the Group&#8217;s Chairman to the Government concerned through the Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p> Any substantive additional information which the sources submit on an outstanding case is 
placed before the Working Group and, following its approval, transmitted to the Government 
concerned.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent actions 
</b></p>
<p> Cases that occurred within the three months preceding receipt of the report by the Group 
are transmitted to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the country concerned by the most direct 
and rapid means. Their transmission can be authorized by the Chairman on the basis of a specific 
delegation of power given to him by the Group. Cases which occurred prior to the three-month 
limit, but not more than one year before the date of their receipt by the Secretariat, provided that 
they had some connection with a case which occurred within the three-month period, can be 
transmitted between sessions by letter, upon authorization by the Chairman. The Working Group 
provides the source with a copy of the summary of each urgent action, thus helping it to enter 
into communication with the authorities on the case concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>Pregnancy 
</b></p>
<p> In the case of the disappearance of a pregnant woman, the child presumed to have been 
born during the mother&#8217;s captivity should be mentioned in the description of the case of the 
mother. The child would be treated as a separate case when witnesses reported that the mother 
had actually given birth to a child during detention. 
</p>
<p><b>Situations of vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p> With respect to reported cases of disappearances, the Working Group highlights the 
condition of people in situations of vulnerability, including women, children, the elderly, persons 
with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b>Cases concerning two or more countries 
</b></p>
<p> Reports on a disappearance indicating that officials from one country are directly 
responsible for or involved in a disappearance in another country, or in cases where officials 
from more than one country were directly responsible for or involved in the disappearance would 
be communicated to all Governments concerned. However, the case would only be counted in 
the statistics of the country in which the person was reportedly arrested, detained, abducted or 
last seen. The same principles are applied with respect to the transmission of general allegations 
and prompt interventions. 
</p>
<p><b>Government replies 
</b></p>
<p> All replies received from Governments concerning reports of disappearances are examined 
by the Working Group and summarized in the Group&#8217;s annual report to the Human Rights 
Council. Any information given on specific cases is forwarded to the sources of those reports, 
who are invited to make observations thereon or to provide additional details on the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>Reminders 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group reminds every Government concerned once a year of the cases which 
have not yet been clarified and three times a year of all urgent action cases transmitted since the 
previous session. On request, the Working Group provides to the Government concerned or the 
source, to the extent possible, updated information on specific cases. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Clarification 
</b></p>
<p> Clarification occurs when the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons are clearly 
established as a result of investigations by the Government, inquiries by non-governmental 
organizations, fact-finding missions by the Working Group or by human rights personnel from 
the United Nations or from any other international organization operating in the field, or by the 
search of the family, irrespective of whether the person is alive or dead. 
</p>
<p><b>The six-month rule 
</b></p>
<p> Any reply of the Government containing detailed information on the fate or whereabouts 
of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source. If the source does not respond within six 
months of the date on which the Government&#8217;s reply was communicated to it, or if it contests the 
Government&#8217;s information on grounds which are considered unreasonable by the Working 
Group, the case is considered clarified and is accordingly listed under the heading &#8220;Cases 
clarified by the Government&#8217;s response&#8221; in the statistical summary of the annual report. If the 
source contests the Government&#8217;s information on reasonable grounds, the Government is so 
informed and invited to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>Closed cases 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group may consider a case closed when the competent authority specified in 
the relevant national law pronounces, with the concurrence of the relatives and other interested 
parties, on the presumption of death of a person reported disappeared or preferably, a declaration 
of absence as a result of enforced disappearance. Presumption of death and a declaration of 
absence as a result of enforced disappearance should at all times respect the right to integral 
reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p> In exceptional circumstances, the Working Group may decide to<b> </b>discontinue the 
consideration of cases where the families have manifested, freely and indisputably, their desire 
not to pursue the case any further, or when the source is no longer in existence or is unable to 
follow up the case and steps taken by the Working Group to establish communication with other 
sources have proven unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p><b>Outstanding cases 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group considers cases as outstanding for as long as they have not been 
clarified, closed or discontinued in accordance with the methods of work. This principle is not 
affected by changes of Government in a given country nor in the event of State succession. 
</p>
<p><b>Reopening of cases 
</b></p>
<p> If sources provide well-documented information that a case has been considered clarified, 
discontinued, or closed erroneously, because the Government&#8217;s reply referred to a different 
person, does not correspond to the reported situation or has not reached the source within the 
six-month period referred to above, the Working Group transmits the case to the Government </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>anew, requesting it to comment. In such instances, the case in question is again listed among the 
outstanding cases and a specific explanation is given in the Group&#8217;s report to the Human Rights 
Council, describing the above-mentioned errors or discrepancies. 
</p>
<p><b>General allegations 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group regularly transmits to the Governments concerned a summary of 
allegations received from relatives of disappeared persons and non-governmental organizations 
with regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration in their respective 
countries, inviting them to comment thereon if they so wish. 
</p>
<p><b>Prompt intervention 
</b></p>
<p> Cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of disappeared persons, 
witnesses to disappearances or their families, members of organizations of relatives and other 
non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders or individuals concerned with 
disappearances are transmitted to the pertinent Governments, with the appeal that they take steps 
to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected. Cases of that nature, which require 
prompt intervention, are transmitted directly to the Ministers for Foreign Affairs by the most 
direct and rapid means. To that end, the Working Group has authorized its Chairman to transmit 
such cases between sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>Cooperation with other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p> If a case or allegation contains information relevant to other thematic mechanisms of the 
Council, the information is transmitted to the mechanism concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>Country missions 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group carries out visits to countries on invitation, but also takes the initiative 
of approaching Governments with a view to carrying out visits to countries,<b> </b>when<b> </b>considered 
appropriate. Such visits are intended to enhance the dialogue between the authorities most 
directly concerned, the families or their representatives and the Working Group, and to assist in 
the clarification of the reported disappearances. The Working Group also undertakes visits to 
examine the practices carried out by Governments to clarify cases of enforced disappearances, as 
well as the programmes and measures adopted to implement the Declaration and to guarantee the 
rights of the victims, including the right to integral reparation. The Working Group reports to the 
Council on its country visits in an addendum to its annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p> With regard to countries in which visits have been carried out, the Working Group 
periodically reminds the Governments concerned of the observations and recommendations 
formulated in the respective reports, requesting information on the consideration given to them, 
and the steps taken for their implementation or the constraints which might have prevented their 
implementation. The Working Group may also take the initiative to carry out follow-up visits. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Meetings 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group meets three times a year to consider the information brought to its 
attention since its previous session. Its meetings are held in private. However, the Working 
Group works intersessionally and regularly meets with representatives of Governments, 
non-governmental organizations, family members and witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b>Reports 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group reports annually to the Human Rights Council on the activities which 
it has carried out from the end of Council&#8217;s previous session up until the last day of the Working 
Group&#8217;s third annual session. It informs the Council of its communications with Governments 
and non-governmental organizations, its meetings and missions. Reports on missions are 
contained as addenda to the main report. The Working Group reports on all cases of 
disappearance received by the Group during the year, on a country-by-country basis, and on the 
decision it has taken thereon. It provides the Council with a statistical summary for each country 
of cases transmitted to the Government, clarifications, and the status of the person concerned on 
the date of clarification. It includes graphs showing the development of disappearances in 
countries with more than 100 transmitted cases as of the date of the adoption by the Working 
Group of its annual report. The Working Group includes conclusions and recommendations in its 
report and makes observations on the situation of disappearances in individual countries. The 
Working Group further reports on the implementation of the Declaration and the obstacles 
encountered therein, and periodically reports on broader issues surrounding the phenomenon of 
enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>Participation of experts 
</b></p>
<p> When the information under consideration concerns a country to which one of the 
members of the Working Group is a national, that member does not participate in the discussion. 
</p>
<p><b>Titles

<p> Titles are for reference only and should not be considered as part of the methods of work.
