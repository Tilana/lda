<p><b>Resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council 
at its eleventh session 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Resolutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>11/1. Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to  
the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a  
communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations and that 
recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the 
human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in 
June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), the World Conference 
reiterated the principle of &#8220;First Call for Children&#8221; and emphasized that the rights of the child 
should be a priority in the United Nations system-wide action on human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the almost universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and the ratification by more than 120 States of each of the two Optional Protocols to the 
Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of Council resolution 10/14 of 26 March 2009, in which the Council 
celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and called for 
effective implementation of the Convention by all States parties to ensure that all children may 
fully enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with interest </i>general comment No. 5 (2003) of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child, in which the Committee emphasized that the special and dependent status of children 
creates real difficulties for them in pursuing remedies for breaches of their rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that procedures allowing for individual communications have been established for 
other core international human rights treaties, namely, the International Covenants on Civil and 
Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also</i> that children and their representatives lack a communications procedure under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child by which communications concerning the effective 
implementation of the rights set out in the Convention can be considered by an appropriate 
committee of independent experts, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the view of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, expressed by its 
Chairperson in her oral report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session, that the 
development of a communications procedure for the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
would significantly contribute to the overall protection of children&#8217;s rights, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Decides</i> to establish an open-ended working group of the Human Rights Council to 
explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child to provide a communications procedure complementary to the reporting procedure under 
the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also</i> <i>decides </i>that the working group shall hold its first session for five working days 
in Geneva before the end of 2009, within existing resources; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further decides </i>to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child to attend the session of the working group as a resource person and, where appropriate, 
relevant United Nations special procedures and other relevant independent experts, and also 
invites them to submit inputs to the working group for its consideration; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests </i>the working group to submit a report on progress made to the Council for 
consideration at its thirteenth session.  
</p>

</p>
<p><b>11/2.  Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming also that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to 
the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human 
rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of 
violence against women and girls,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the 
Cairo Programme of Action, the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the 
General Assembly entitled &#8220;Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the 
twenty-first century&#8221;, and the Declaration adopted at the forty-ninth session of the 
Commission on the Status of Women,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further </i>Council resolutions 6/30 of 14 December 2007 on integrating the 
human rights of women throughout the United Nations system, and 7/24 of 28 March 2008 on 
the elimination of violence against women, all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on the elimination of violence against women, General Assembly resolution 63/155 of 
30 January 2009 on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against 
women and all other Assembly resolutions relevant to the elimination of all forms of violence 
against women, and Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and 
1820 (2008) of 19 June 2008 on women, peace and security,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and 
disadvantage, can lead to the particular targeting or vulnerability to violence of girls and some 
groups of women, such as women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and 
internally displaced women, migrant women, women living in rural or remote communities, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>destitute women, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, 
widows and women in situations of armed conflict, women who are otherwise discriminated 
against, including on the basis of HIV status, and victims of commercial sexual exploitation,  </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the recognition by the ad hoc international 
criminal tribunals that rape can constitute a war crime, a crime against humanity or a constitutive 
act with respect to genocide or torture,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance of a comprehensive, well-coordinated, effective and adequately 
resourced response by the United Nations system to all forms of violence against women and 
girls, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> the need for renewed political will and enhanced efforts to overcome 
obstacles and challenges faced by States in addressing, preventing, investigating, prosecuting 
and punishing the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the holding of the Council&#8217;s panel discussion on 5 June 2008 on the theme 
&#8220;Violence against women: identification of priorities&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> <i>also</i> the report of the Secretary-General on the intensification of efforts to 
eliminate all forms of violence against women (A/63/214), 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Stresses </i>that &#8220;violence against women&#8221; means any act of gender-based violence that 
results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, 
</p>
<p>including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in 
public or private life;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly condemns </i>all acts of violence against women and girls, whether they be 
perpetrated by the State, private persons or non-State actors, and calls for the elimination of all 
forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general community and where 
perpetrated or condoned by the State, in accordance with the Declaration on the Elimination of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women, and stresses the need to treat all forms of violence against women and 
girls as a criminal offence, punishable by law, and the duty to provide access to just and effective 
remedies and specialized assistance to victims, including medical and psychological assistance, 
as well as effective counselling;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses </i>that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and must exercise due diligence to prevent, 
investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and 
provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the 
enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic 
legislation, including measures to enhance the protection of victims, to investigate, prosecute, 
punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, 
whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations of 
armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant international human rights 
instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish existing laws, regulations, customs 
and practices which constitute discrimination against women, to remove gender bias in the 
administration of justice, and to take action to investigate and punish persons who perpetrate acts 
of violence against women and girls; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to support initiatives undertaken by women&#8217;s and 
non-governmental organizations on the elimination of violence against women and girls and to 
establish and/or strengthen, at the national level, collaborative relationships with relevant 
non-governmental and community-based organizations, and public and private sector 
institutions, aimed at the development and effective implementation of provisions and policies 
relating to violence against women and girls, including in the area of support services, assistance 
redress and empowerment of victims;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States and the United Nations system to give attention to, and encourages 
greater international cooperation in, systematic research and the collection, analysis and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>dissemination of data, including data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant information, 
on the extent, nature and consequences of violence against women and girls and on the impact 
and effectiveness of policies and programmes for combating this violence, and, in this context, 
welcomes the establishment of the Secretary-General&#8217;s coordinated database on violence against 
women, and urges States and the United Nations system to regularly provide information for 
inclusion in the database; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> States to supply information on all forms of violence against women and 
girls in their reports submitted to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and other relevant treaty bodies; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also encourages</i> States to implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) 
and 1820 (2008) to contribute to their efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
and girls; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, including her latest report on the political economy of 
women&#8217;s human rights (A/HRC/11/6); </p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> the Special Rapporteur to consider in future reporting the needs of 
women who experience multiple forms of discrimination, and to examine effective measures to 
respond to those situations; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, its causes and consequences throughout its work, and in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Encourages States to ensure that eliminating violence against women and girls is 
given due attention in the work of the Council, including relevant Council processes and debates, 
including the universal periodic review; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Requests the special procedures of the Council to ensure that due consideration is 
given to violence against women and girls within their respective mandates; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Encourages all relevant stakeholders to give due attention to all forms of violence 
against women and girls in their work with the Council and its mechanisms;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
convene, in 2010 within existing resources, in cooperation with other relevant entities of the 
United Nations system, an expert workshop, open to the participation of Governments, regional 
organizations, relevant United Nations bodies, civil society organizations and experts from 
different legal systems, to discuss specific measures for overcoming obstacles and challenges 
that States may face in preventing, investigating, prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of 
violence against women and girls, as well as measures for providing protection, support, 
assistance and redress for victims, and requests the Office to prepare a summary report thereon 
to be submitted to the Council;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Invites the Office of the High Commissioner to include violence against women and 
girls in its reporting on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations 
system;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests </i>United Nations organs and bodies, specialized agencies and 
intergovernmental organizations, and encourages the human rights treaty bodies, to continue to 
give consideration to violence against women and girls within their respective mandates;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Calls upon </i>relevant United Nations entities within their respective mandates to 
support, upon request, the follow-up by States to relevant recommendations of the special 
procedures, concluding observations of treaty bodies and outcomes of the universal periodic 
review to prevent violence against women and girls, protect victims of such violence and 
prosecute the perpetrators;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Stresses</i> that challenges and obstacles remain in the implementation of international 
standards and norms to address the inequality between men and women, and violence against 
women in particular, and pledges to intensify action to ensure their full and accelerated 
implementation;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Decides </i>to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all forms of 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, as a matter of high priority, in conformity 
with its annual programme of work. 
</p>
<p><i>27th meeting 
17 June 2009</i> 
</p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote. See chap. III.] 
</p>
<p><b>11/3.  Trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 and 63/194 of 
18 December 2008, and also its resolution 8/12 of 18 June 2008, in which the Council extended 
the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and declarations, 
including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention, and 
recalling the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of 
the Prostitution of Others, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that women and girl victims are often </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their 
gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these forms of 
discrimination may themselves fuel trafficking in persons,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the 
enjoyment of them, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted 
international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of 
origin, transit and destination for it to be eradicated, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent 
trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for 
their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of 
trafficking in women and children, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also </i>the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and 
children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of existing legislation, the 
lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics and the lack of 
resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in 
persons in some parts of the world, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and 
reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and 
multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full 
enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, 
transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children (A/HRC/10/16), presented to the Council at its 
tenth session, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation also </i>of the report of the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the latest developments within the United Nations 
relating to combating trafficking in persons and on the relevant activities of the Office 
(A/HRC/10/64), and taking note of<b> </b>the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human 
Rights and Human Trafficking contained in that report, presented to the Council at its 
tenth session, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the meeting of the Open-ended Interim Working Group on Trafficking in 
Persons of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, held in Vienna on 14 and 15 April 2009, and the recommendations resulting 
there from, and the interactive dialogue on the theme &#8220;Taking collective action to end human 
trafficking&#8221; of the General Assembly, held on 13 May 2009, which included a discussion on the 
advisability of a global plan of action against human trafficking, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming especially</i> the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies and 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the vulnerability of victims to 
human rights violations, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Affirms</i> that it is essential to place the protection of human rights at the centre of 
measures taken to prevent and end trafficking in persons, and to protect, assist and provide 
access to adequate redress to victims, including the possibility of obtaining compensation from 
the perpetrators; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reiterates its concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The high number of people, especially women and children, in particular from 
developing countries and countries with economies in transition, who are being trafficked to 
developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and others 
who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard for 
dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international 
law and contrary to international standards; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the purposes of 
exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation, for trafficking in 
women as brides and for sex tourism, child pornography, paedophilia and any other forms of 
sexual exploitation of children; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and the 
denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> Governments: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To take appropriate measures to address the root factors, including external factors, 
that encourage trafficking in persons for prostitution and other forms of commercialized sex, 
forced marriages and forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the 
removal of organs, including by strengthening existing legislation or by considering the 
enactment of anti-trafficking legislation and the adoption of national plans of action; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and penalize 
traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by imposing sanctions 
against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without making accusations by or the 
participation of the victims of trafficking a precondition to the prosecution of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full respect for 
their human rights, including, where appropriate, through legislation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To provide resources, as appropriate, for the comprehensive protection and 
assistance to victims of trafficking, including access to adequate social, necessary medical and 
psychological care and services, including those related to HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal 
assistance in a language that they can understand and helplines, and to cooperate in this regard, 
as appropriate, with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not 
penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as a result of 
actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are victims of exploitation, 
and encourages Governments to provide trafficked persons with access to specialized support 
and assistance, regardless of their immigration status; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To devise, enforce and strengthen effective gender- and age-sensitive measures to 
combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking, especially in women and children, including for 
sexual and labour exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy that integrates 
a human rights perspective, and to draw up, as appropriate, national plans of action in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that 
fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in persons, including the 
demand created by sex tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and to enhance, in this 
regard, preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked 
persons and to ensure their accountability; 
</p>

<p><b>11/4.  Promotion of the right of peoples to peace 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on the promotion of the right of peoples to peace adopted 
by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 39/11 of 12 November 1984, entitled 
&#8220;Declaration of the Right of Peoples to Peace&#8221;, and the United Nations Millennium Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Determined </i>to foster strict respect for the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter 
of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian 
character, and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for 
all without distinction of race, sex, language or religion,  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i>, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, its full 
and active support for the Organization and the enhancement of its role and effectiveness in 
strengthening international peace, security and justice and in promoting the solution of 
international problems, and the development of friendly relations and cooperation among States,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the obligation of all States to settle their international disputes by peaceful 
means in such a manner that international peace, security, human rights and justice are not 
endangered,  
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizin</i>g its objective of promoting better relations among all States and contributing 
to creating conditions in which their people can live in true and lasting peace, free from any 
threat to or attack against their security,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the obligation of all States to refrain, in their international relations, from the 
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or 
from acting in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> its commitment to peace, security and justice, respect for human rights 
and the continuing development of friendly relations and cooperation among States,  
</p>
<p><i> Rejecting</i> the use of violence in the pursuit of political aims, and stressing that only 
peaceful political solutions can assure a stable and democratic future for all peoples around the 
world,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of ensuring respect for the Purposes and Principles of the 
Charter and international law, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and political 
independence of States,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue of which 
they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural 
development,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> <i>further</i> the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly 
Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are mutually 
interlinked and reinforcing,  
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that human rights include social, economic and cultural rights and the right to 
peace, a healthy environment and development, and that development is, in fact, the realization 
of these rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, domination and 
exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental rights, is contrary to the Charter and an 
impediment to the promotion of world peace and cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights 
and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> of the aim of creating conditions of stability and well-being, which are 
necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of 
the equal rights and self-determination of peoples,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> <i>also</i> that life without war is the primary international prerequisite for the 
material well-being, development and progress of countries and for the full implementation of 
the rights and fundamental human freedoms proclaimed by the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> <i>further</i> that international cooperation in the field of human rights contributes to 
the creation of an international environment of peace and stability,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the peoples of our planet have a sacred right to peace;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that the preservation of the right of peoples to peace and the 
promotion of its implementation constitute a fundamental obligation of all States;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of peace for the promotion and protection of all human rights 
for all;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also stresses</i> that the deep fault line that divides human society between the rich and 
the poor and the ever-increasing gap between the developed world and the developing world 
pose a major threat to global prosperity, peace, human rights, security and stability;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Further stresses</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are the 
pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations for collective security and well-being; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that ensuring the exercise of the right of peoples to peace and its 
promotion demand that the policies of States be directed towards the elimination of the threat of 
war, particularly nuclear war, the renunciation of the use or threat of use of force in international 
</p>
<p>relations and the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means on the basis of the 
Charter of the United Nations;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Affirms</i> that all States should promote the establishment, maintenance and 
strengthening of international peace and security and an international system based on respect for

freedoms, including the right to development and the right of peoples to self-determination;  
</p>

Charter in their relations with all other States, irrespective of their political, economic or social 
systems or of their size, geographical location or level of economic development;  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Reaffirms</i> the duty of all States, in accordance with the Principles of the Charter, to 
use peaceful means to settle any dispute to which they are parties and the continuance of which 
is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, and encourages States 
to settle their disputes as early as possible, as an important contribution to the promotion and 
protection of all human rights of everyone and all peoples;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Underlines</i> the vital importance of education for peace as a tool to foster the 
realization of the right of peoples to peace, and encourages States, United Nations specialized 
agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to contribute actively to 
this endeavour;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its request</i> to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
convene, before February 2010, and taking into account previous practices, a workshop on the 
right of peoples to peace, with the participation of experts from all regions of the world, in order

<p><b>11/5. The effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and other relevant international human rights 
instruments, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>all resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on 
the effects of structural adjustment and economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full 
enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, including 
Commission resolutions 1998/24 of 17 April 1998, 1999/22 of 23 April 1999, 2000/82 of 
26 April 2000, 2004/18 of 16 April 2004 and 2005/19 of 14 April 2005, as well as Council 
resolution 7/4 of 27 March 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> its resolution S-10/1 of 23 February 2009 on the impact of the global 
economic and financial crises on the universal realization and effective enjoyment of human 
rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international 
cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian 
character, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the 
international community to make all efforts to help alleviate the external debt burden of 
developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to 
attain the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights of their people, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to 
deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income 
developing countries, through various national and international measures designed to make their 
debt sustainable in the long term, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with concern</i> that the total external debt of low- and middle-income countries had 
risen to 2,983 billion United States dollars by 2006, from 1,951 billion dollars in 1995, and that, 
by 2007, the total debt service payments of developing countries had risen to 523 billion dollars, 
from 220 billion in 1995, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced by the 
most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is unsustainable </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-centred sustainable 
development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely constrained their capacity to 
promote social development and to provide basic services to realize economic, social and 
cultural rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing countries 
continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official development 
assistance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing developing 
countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable human development, 
and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Welcomes</i> the report of the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and 
other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (A/HRC/11/10); 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the proposed elements for a conceptual framework 
for understanding the relationship between foreign debt and human rights, and encourages the 
independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial 
obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights to continue to develop them with a view to addressing the debt crisis in a just, 
equitable and sustainable manner; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Welcomes</i> the areas of focus identified by the independent expert for the 
period 2009-2010, in particular the development of the draft general guidelines on foreign debt 
and human rights and the issue of illegitimate debt, and, in that regard, calls on the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist the independent expert in the 
organization and holding of regional consultations on these issues, including through the 
allocation of sufficient budgetary resources; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recalls</i> that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, 
social and cultural development of its people, and, to that end, has the right and responsibility to 
choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific 
prescriptions for economic policy; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Recognizes</i> that structural-adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, 
impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social 
services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these 
programmes; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Affirms</i> that the current global financial and economic crises should not result in a 
decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that 
would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses</i> its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall 
debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that 
the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-term debt burden; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Reiterates </i>its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt 
sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the 
above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the 
form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their 
exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Regrets</i> the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable 
foreign debt burden of middle- and low-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, 
little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt 
resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries 
and the poor in them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and 
equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing 
countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as 
tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Acknowledges</i> that, in least developed countries and in several low- and 
middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable 
barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium 
Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Recognizes</i> that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be 
directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, 
including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set 
out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where 
appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace 
alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official 
development assistance; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Recalls</i> <i>once again</i> the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the 
Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily 
indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of 
those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Urges</i> the international community, including the United Nations system, the 
Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for 
the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major 
United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World 
Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the 
International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the 
</p>
<p>question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted 
poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recalls</i> the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to 
General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, 
equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing 
burdens of developing countries; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Stresses</i> the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to 
be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan 
agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative 
frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to 
ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people&#8217;s legislative 
bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in 
the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the 
follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for 
macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a 
consistent way, in the realization of broader social development goals, taking into account the 
national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a 
way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Also stresses</i> that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should 
maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development 
efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced 
development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Further stresses</i> that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and 
cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as 
dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Calls upon</i> States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue 
to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily 
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing 
programmes; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Calls upon</i> creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and debtors 
alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to development 
projects, loan agreements or Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to 
food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment 
cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth 
programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Urges</i> States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent 
measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by 
HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research 
and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Reiterates </i>its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and 
for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political 
dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within 
the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 
</p>
<p> 23. <i>Reiterates </i>its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of 
least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign 
debt; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with trade 
and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and 
foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to 
the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its 
attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to continue to seek the views and suggestions of 
States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, regional 
economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non-governmental 
organizations on the draft general guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for 
consideration, and urges them to respond to his requests;  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Encourages</i> the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his 
mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, 
independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Council and its 
Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to 
development in his work towards the elaboration of the draft general guidelines; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to report to the General Assembly on the issue of 
the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the 
full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary 
assistance, in particular all the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 
</p>
<p> 29. <i>Urges</i> Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, 
non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent 
expert in the discharge of his mandate; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Requests </i>the independent expert to submit an analytical report on the implementation 
of the present resolution to the Council in 2009 in accordance with its annual programme of 
work, and to submit a progress report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session;

</p>
<p><i>27th meeting 
17 June 2009 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote. See chap. III.] </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>GUIDELINES FOR THE ALTERNATIVE CARE OF CHILDREN 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  PURPOSE 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present Guidelines are intended to enhance the implementation of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and of relevant provisions of other international instruments regarding the 
protection and well-being of children who are deprived of parental care or who are at risk of 
being so. 
</p>
<p>2. Against the background of these international instruments and taking account of the 
developing body of knowledge and experience in this sphere, the Guidelines set out desirable 
orientations for policy and practice. They are designed for wide dissemination among all sectors 
directly or indirectly concerned with issues relating to alternative care, and seek in particular to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Support efforts to keep children in, or return them to, the care of their family or, 
failing this, to find another appropriate and permanent solution, including adoption and <i>kafala </i>of 
Islamic law; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure that, while such permanent solutions are being sought, or in cases where they 
are not possible or are not in the best interests of the child, the most suitable forms of alternative 
care are identified and provided, under conditions that promote the child&#8217;s full and harmonious 
development; 
</p>
<p> (c) Assist and encourage governments to better implement their responsibilities and 
obligations in these respects, bearing in mind the economic, social and cultural conditions 
prevailing in each State; and 
</p>
<p> (d) Guide policies, decisions and activities of all concerned with social protection and 
child welfare in both the public and private sectors, including civil society. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND PERSPECTIVES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The child and the family 
</b></p>
<p>3. The family being the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the 
growth, well-being and protection of children, efforts should primarily be directed to enabling </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the child to remain in or return to the care of his/her parents, or when appropriate, other close 
family members. The State should ensure that families have access to forms of support in the 
care-giving role. 
</p>
<p>4. Every child and young person should live in a supportive, protective and caring 
environment that promotes his/her full potential. Children with inadequate or no parental care are 
at special risk of being denied such a nurturing environment. 
</p>
<p>5. Where the child&#8217;s own family is unable, even with appropriate support, to provide 
adequate care for the child, or abandons or relinquishes the child, the State is responsible for 
protecting the rights of the child and ensuring appropriate alternative care, with or through 
competent local authorities and duly authorized civil society organizations. It is the role of the 
State, through its competent authorities, to ensure the supervision of the safety, well-being and 
development of any child placed in alternative care and the regular review of the appropriateness 
of the care arrangement provided. 
</p>
<p>6. All decisions, initiatives and approaches falling within the scope of the present Guidelines 
should be made on a case-by-case basis, with a view notably to ensuring the child&#8217;s safety and 
security, and must be grounded in the best interests and rights of the child concerned, in 
conformity with the principle of non-discrimination and taking due account of the gender 
perspective. They should respect fully the child&#8217;s right to be consulted and to have his/her views 
duly taken into account in accordance with his/her evolving capacities, and on the basis of 
his/her access to all necessary information. Every effort should be made to enable such 
consultation and information provision to be carried out in the child&#8217;s preferred language. 
</p>
<p>6.bis In applying the present Guidelines, determination of the best interests of the child shall be 
designed to identify courses of action for children deprived of parental care, or at risk of being 
so, that are best suited to satisfying their needs and rights, taking into account the full and 
personal development of their rights in their family, social and cultural environment and their 
status as subjects of rights, both at the time of the determination and in the longer term. The 
determination process should take account of, inter alia, the right of the child to be heard and to 
have his/her views taken into account in accordance with his/her age and maturity. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. States should develop and implement comprehensive child welfare and protection policies 
within the framework of their overall social and human development policy, with attention to the 
improvement of existing alternative care provision, reflecting the principles contained in the 
present Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>8. As part of efforts to prevent separation of children from their parents, States should seek to 
ensure appropriate and culturally sensitive measures: 
</p>
<p> (a) To support family care-giving environments whose capacities are limited by factors 
such as disabilities; drug and alcohol misuse; discrimination against families with indigenous or 
minority backgrounds; and those living in armed conflict regions or under foreign occupation; 
</p>
<p> (b) To provide appropriate care and protection for vulnerable children, such as child 
victims of abuse and exploitation; abandoned children; children living on the street; children 
born out of wedlock; unaccompanied and separated children; internally displaced and refugee 
children; children of migrant workers; children of asylum-seekers; or children living with or 
affected by HIV/AIDS and other serious illnesses. 
</p>
<p>9. Special efforts should be made to tackle<b> </b>discrimination on the basis of any status of the 
child or parents, including poverty, ethnicity, religion, sex, mental and physical disability, 
HIV/AIDS status or other serious illnesses, whether physical or mental, birth out of wedlock, and 
socio-economic stigma, and all other statuses and circumstances that can give rise to 
relinquishment, abandonment and/or removal of a child. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Alternative care 
</b></p>
<p>10. All decisions concerning alternative care should take full account of the desirability, in 
principle, of maintaining the child as close as possible to his/her habitual place of residence, in 
order to facilitate contact and potential reintegration with his/her family and to minimize 
disruption of his/her educational, cultural and social life. 
</p>
<p>11. Decisions regarding children in alternative care, including those in informal care, should 
have due regard for the importance of ensuring children a stable home and of meeting their basic 
need for safe and continuous attachment to their caregivers, with permanency generally being a 
key goal. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>12. Children must be treated with dignity and respect at all times and must benefit from 
effective protection from abuse, neglect and all forms of exploitation, whether on the part of care 
providers, peers or third parties, in whatever care setting they may find themselves. 
</p>
<p>13. Removal of a child from the care of the family should be seen as a measure of last resort 
and should be, whenever possible, temporary and for the shortest possible duration. Removal 
decisions should be regularly reviewed and the child&#8217;s return to parental care, once the original 
causes of removal have been resolved or have disappeared, should be in the child&#8217;s best interests, 
in keeping with the assessment foreseen in paragraph 48 below. 
</p>
<p>14. Financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such 
poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from parental care, for 
receiving a child into alternative care, or for preventing his/her reintegration, but should be seen 
as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to the family. 
</p>
<p>15. Attention must be paid to promoting and safeguarding all other rights of special pertinence 
to the situation of children without parental care, including, but not limited to, access to 
education, health and other basic services, the right to identity, freedom of religion or belief, 
language and protection of property and inheritance rights. 
</p>
<p>16. Siblings with existing bonds should in principle not be separated by placements in 
alternative care unless there is a clear risk of abuse or other justification in the best interests of 
the child. In any case, every effort should be made to enable siblings to maintain contact with 
each other, unless this is against their wishes or interests. 
</p>
<p>17. Recognizing that, in most countries, the majority of children without parental care are 
looked after informally by relatives or others, States should seek to devise appropriate means, 
consistent with the present Guidelines, to ensure their welfare and protection while in such 
informal care arrangements, with due respect for cultural, economic, gender and religious 
differences and practices that do not conflict with the rights and best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p>18. No child should be without the support and protection of a legal guardian or other 
recognized responsible adult or competent public body at any time. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. The provision of alternative care should never be undertaken with a prime purpose of 
furthering the political, religious or economic goals of the providers. </p>
<p>20. Use of residential care should be limited to cases where such a setting is specifically 
appropriate, necessary and constructive for the individual child concerned and in his/her best 
interests. 
</p>
<p>21. In accordance with the predominant opinion of experts, alternative care for young children, 
especially those under the age of 3 years, should be provided in family-based settings. 
Exceptions to this principle may be warranted in order to prevent the separation of siblings and 
in cases where the placement is of an emergency nature or is for a predetermined and very 
limited duration, with planned family reintegration or other appropriate long-term care solution 
as its outcome. 
</p>
<p>22. While recognizing that residential care facilities and family-based care complement each 
other in meeting the needs of children, where large residential care facilities (institutions) 
remain, alternatives should be developed in the context of an overall deinstitutionalization 
strategy, with precise goals and objectives, which will allow for their progressive elimination. To 
this end, States should establish care standards to ensure the quality and conditions that are 
conducive to the child&#8217;s development, such as individualized and small-group care, and should 
evaluate existing facilities against these standards. Decisions regarding the establishment of, or 
permission to establish, new residential care facilities, whether public or private, should take full 
account of this deinstitutionalization objective and strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>Measures to promote application 
</b></p>
<p>23. States should, to the maximum extent of their available resources and, where appropriate, 
in the framework of development cooperation, allocate human and financial resources to ensure 
the optimal and progressive implementation of the present Guidelines throughout their respective 
territories in a timely manner. States should facilitate active cooperation among all relevant 
authorities and the mainstreaming of child and family welfare issues within all ministries directly 
or indirectly concerned. 
</p>
<p>24. States are responsible for determining any need for, and requesting, international 
cooperation in implementing the present Guidelines. Such requests should be given due </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>consideration and should receive a favourable response wherever possible and appropriate. The 
enhanced implementation of the present Guidelines should figure in development cooperation 
programmes. When providing assistance to a State, foreign entities should abstain from any 
initiative inconsistent with the Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>25. Nothing in the present Guidelines should be interpreted as encouraging or condoning lower 
standards than those that may exist in given States, including in their legislation. Similarly, 
competent authorities, professional organizations and others are encouraged to develop national 
or professionally-specific guidelines that build upon the letter and spirit of the present 
Guidelines. </p>
<p><b>III.  SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES 
</b></p>
<p>26. The present Guidelines apply to the appropriate use and conditions of alternative formal 
care for all persons under the age of 18 years, unless under the law applicable to the child 
majority is attained earlier. Only where indicated do the Guidelines also apply to informal care 
settings, having due regard for both the important role played by the extended family and 
community and the obligations of States for all children not in the care of their parents or legal 
and customary caregivers, as set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>27. Principles in the present Guidelines are also applicable, as appropriate, to young persons 
already in alternative care and who need continuing care or support for a transitional period after 
reaching the age of majority under applicable law. 
</p>
<p>28. For the purposes of the present Guidelines, and subject notably to the exceptions listed in 
paragraph 29 below, the following definitions shall apply: 
</p>
<p> (a) Children without parental care: all children not in the overnight care of at least one of 
their parents, for whatever reason and under whatever circumstances. Children without parental 
care who are outside their country of habitual residence or victims of emergency situations may 
be designated as: 
</p>
<p>(i) &#8220;Unaccompanied&#8221; if they are not cared for by another relative or an adult who 
by law or custom is responsible for doing so; or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(ii) &#8220;Separated&#8221; if they are separated from a previous legal or customary primary 
caregiver, but who may nevertheless be accompanied by another relative. 
</p>
<p> (b) Alternative care may take the form of: 
</p>
<p>(i) Informal care: any private arrangement provided in a family environment, 
whereby the child is looked after on an ongoing or indefinite basis by 
relatives or friends (informal kinship care) or by others in their individual 
capacity, at the initiative of the child, his/her parents or other person without 
this arrangement having been ordered by an administrative or judicial 
authority or a duly accredited body; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Formal care: all care provided in a family environment which has been 
ordered by a competent administrative body or judicial authority, and all care 
provided in a residential environment, including in private facilities, whether 
or not as a result of administrative or judicial measures. 
</p>
<p> (c) With respect to the environment where it is provided, alternative care may be: 
</p>
<p>(i) Kinship care: family-based care within the child&#8217;s extended family or with 
close friends of the family known to the child, whether formal or informal in 
nature; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Foster care: situations where children are placed by a competent authority for 
the purpose of alternative care in the domestic environment of a family other 
than the children&#8217;s own family, that has been selected, qualified, approved 
and supervised for providing such care; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Other forms of family-based or family-like care placements; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Residential care: care provided in any non-family-based group setting, such 
as places of safety for emergency care, transit centres in emergency 
</p>
<p>situations, and all other short and long-term residential care facilities 
including group homes; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(v) Supervised independent living arrangements for children. 
</p>
<p> (d) With respect to those responsible for alternative care: 
</p>
<p>(i) Agencies are the public or private bodies and services that organize 
alternative care for children; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Facilities are the individual public or private establishments that provide 
residential care for children. 
</p>
<p>29. The scope of alternative care as foreseen in the present Guidelines does not extend, 
however, to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Persons under the age of 18 years who are deprived of their liberty by decision of a 
judicial or administrative authority as a result of being alleged as, accused of or recognized as 
having infringed the law, and whose situation is covered by the United Nations Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice and the United Nations Rules for the 
Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty; 
</p>
<p> (b) Care by adoptive parents from the moment the child concerned is effectively placed 
in their custody pursuant to a final adoption order, as of which moment, for the purposes of the 
present Guidelines, the child is considered to be in parental care. The Guidelines are, however, 
applicable to pre-adoption or probationary placement of a child with the prospective adoptive 
parents, as far as they are compatible with requirements governing such placements as stipulated 
in other relevant international instruments; 
</p>
<p> (c) Informal arrangements whereby a child voluntarily stays with relatives or friends for 
recreational purposes and reasons not connected with the parents&#8217; general inability or 
unwillingness to provide adequate care. 
</p>
<p>30. Competent authorities and others concerned are also encouraged to make use of the present 
Guidelines, as applicable, at boarding schools, hospitals, centres for children with mental and 
physical disabilities or other special needs, camps, the workplace and other places which may be 
responsible for the care of children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PREVENTING THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE CARE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Promoting parental care 
</b></p>
<p>31. States should pursue policies that ensure support for families in meeting their 
responsibilities towards the child and promote the right of the child to have a relationship with 
both parents. These policies should address the root causes of child abandonment, 
relinquishment and separation of the child from his/her family by ensuring, inter alia, the right to 
birth registration, access to adequate housing and to basic health, education and social welfare 
services, as well as by promoting measures to combat poverty, discrimination, marginalization, 
stigmatization, violence, child maltreatment and sexual abuse, and substance abuse. 
</p>
<p>32. States should develop and implement consistent and mutually reinforcing family-oriented 
policies designed to promote and strengthen parents&#8217; ability to care for their children. 
</p>
<p>33. States should implement effective measures to prevent child abandonment, relinquishment 
and separation of the child from his/her family. Social policies and programmes should, 
inter alia, empower families with attitudes, skills, capacities and tools to enable them to provide 
adequately for the protection, care and development of their children. The complementary 
capacities of the State and civil society, including non-governmental and community-based 
organizations, religious leaders and the media should be engaged to this end. These social 
protection measures should include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Family strengthening services, such as parenting courses and sessions, the promotion 
of positive parent-child relationships, conflict resolution skills, opportunities for employment, 
income-generation and, where required, social assistance; 
</p>
<p> (b) Supportive social services, such as day care,<b> </b>mediation and conciliation services, 
substance abuse treatment, financial assistance, and services for parents and children with 
disabilities. Such services, preferably of an integrated and non-intrusive nature, should be 
directly accessible at community level and should actively involve the participation of families 
as partners, combining their resources with those of the community and the carer; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) Youth policies aiming at empowering youth to face positively the challenges of 
everyday life, including when they decide to leave the parental home, and preparing future 
parents to make informed decisions regarding their sexual and reproductive health and to fulfil 
their responsibilities in this respect. 
</p>
<p>34. Various complementary methods and techniques should be used for family support, 
varying throughout the process of support, such as home visits, group meetings with other 
</p>
<p>families, case conferences and securing commitments by the family concerned. They should be 
directed towards both facilitating intrafamilial relationships and promoting the family&#8217;s 
integration within its community. 
</p>
<p>35. Special attention should be paid, in accordance with local laws, to the provision and 
promotion of support and care services for single and adolescent parents and their children, 
whether or not born out of wedlock. States should ensure that adolescent parents retain all rights 
inherent to their status both as parents and as children, including access to all appropriate 
services for their own development, allowances to which parents are entitled, and their 
inheritance rights. Measures should be adopted to ensure the protection of pregnant adolescents 
and to guarantee that they do not interrupt their studies. Efforts should also be made to reduce 
stigma attached to single and adolescent parenthood. 
</p>
<p>36. Support and services should be available to siblings who have lost their parents or 
caregivers and choose to remain together in their household, to the extent that the eldest sibling 
is both willing and deemed capable of acting as the household head. States should ensure, 
including through the appointment of a legal guardian, a recognized responsible adult or, where 
appropriate, a public body legally mandated to act as guardian, as stipulated in paragraph 18 
above, that such households benefit from mandatory protection from all forms of exploitation 
and abuse, and supervision and support on the part of the local community and its competent 
services, such as social workers, with particular concern for the children&#8217;s health, housing, 
education and inheritance rights. Special attention should be given to ensuring the head of such a 
household retains all rights inherent to his/her child status, including access to education and 
leisure, in addition to his/her rights as a household head. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>37. States should ensure opportunities for day care, including all-day schooling, and respite 
care which would enable parents better to cope with their overall responsibilities towards the 
family, including additional responsibilities inherent in caring for children with special needs. 
</p>
<p><b>Preventing family separation 
</b></p>
<p>38. Proper criteria based on sound professional principles should be developed and 
consistently applied for assessing the child&#8217;s and family&#8217;s situation, including the family&#8217;s actual 
and potential capacity to care for the child, in cases where the competent authority or agency has 
reasonable grounds to believe that the well-being of the child is at risk. 
</p>
<p>39. Decisions regarding removal or reintegration should be based on this assessment and made 
by suitably qualified and trained professionals, on behalf of or authorized by a competent 
authority, in full consultation with all concerned and bearing in mind the need to plan for the 
child&#8217;s future. 
</p>
<p>40. States are encouraged to adopt measures for the integral protection and guarantee of rights 
during pregnancy, birth and the breastfeeding period, in order to ensure conditions of dignity and 
equality for the adequate development of the pregnancy and care of the child. Therefore, support 
programmes should be provided to future mothers and fathers, particularly adolescent parents, 
who have difficulties in exercising their parental responsibilities. Such programmes should aim 
at empowering mothers and fathers to exercise their parental responsibilities in conditions of 
dignity, and at avoiding their being induced to surrender their child because of their 
vulnerability. 
</p>
<p>41. When a child is relinquished or abandoned, States should ensure that this may take place in 
conditions of confidentiality and safety for the child, respecting his/her right to access 
information on his/her origins where appropriate and possible under the law of the State. 
</p>
<p>42. States should formulate clear policies to address situations where a child has been 
abandoned anonymously, which indicate whether and how family tracing should be undertaken 
and reunification or placement within the extended family pursued. Policies should also allow 
for timely decision-making on the child&#8217;s eligibility for permanent family placement and for 
arranging such placements expeditiously. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>43. When a public or private agency or facility is approached by a parent or legal guardian 
wishing to relinquish a child permanently, the State should ensure that the family receives 
counselling and social support to encourage and enable them to continue to care for the child. If 
this fails, a social worker or other appropriate professional assessment should be undertaken to 
determine whether there are other family members who wish to take permanent responsibility for 
the child, and whether such arrangements would be in the child&#8217;s best interests. Where such 
arrangements are not possible or in the child&#8217;s best interests, efforts should be made to find a 
permanent family placement within a reasonable period. 
</p>
<p>44. When a public or private agency or facility is approached by a parent or caregiver wishing 
to place a child in care for a short or indefinite period, the State should ensure the availability of 
counselling and social support to encourage and enable them to continue to care for the child. A 
child should be admitted to alternative care only when such efforts have been exhausted and 
acceptable and justified reasons for entry into care exist. 
</p>
<p>45. Specific training should be provided to teachers and others working with children, in order 
to help them to identify situations of abuse, neglect, exploitation or risk of abandonment and to 
refer such situations to competent bodies. 
</p>
<p>46. Any decision to remove a child against the will of his/her parents must be made by 
competent authorities, in accordance with applicable law and procedures and subject to judicial 
review, the parents being assured the right of appeal and access to appropriate legal 
representation. 
</p>
<p>47. When the child&#8217;s sole or main carer may be the subject of deprivation of liberty as a result 
of preventive detention or sentencing decisions, non-custodial remand measures and sentences 
should be taken in appropriate cases wherever possible, the best interests of the child being given 
due consideration. States should take into account the best interests of the child when deciding 
whether to remove children born in prison and children living in prison with a parent. The 
removal of such children should be treated in the same way as other instances where separation 
is considered. Best efforts should be made to ensure that children remaining in custody with their 
parent benefit from adequate care and protection, while guaranteeing their own status as free 
individuals and access to activities in the community. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Promoting family reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>48. In order to prepare and support the child and the family for his/her possible return to the 
family, his/her situation should be assessed by a duly designated individual or team with access 
to multidisciplinary advice, in consultation with the different actors involved (the child, the 
family, the alternative caregiver), so as to decide whether the reintegration of the child in the 
family is possible and in the best interests of the child, which steps this would involve and under 
whose supervision. 
</p>
<p>49. The aims of the reintegration and the family&#8217;s and alternative caregiver&#8217;s principal tasks in 
this respect should be set out in writing and agreed on by all concerned. 
</p>
<p>50. Regular and appropriate contact between the child and his/her family specifically for the 
purpose of reintegration should be developed, supported and monitored by the competent body. 
</p>
<p>51. Once decided, reintegration of the child in his/her family should be designed as a gradual 
and supervised process, accompanied by follow-up and support measures that take account of the 
child&#8217;s age, needs and evolving capacities, as well as the cause of the separation. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  FRAMEWORK OF CARE PROVISION 
</b></p>
<p>52. In order to meet the specific psychoemotional, social and other needs of each child without 
parental care, States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the legislative, policy and 
financial conditions exist to provide for adequate alternative care options, with priority to 
family- and community-based solutions. 
</p>
<p>53. States should ensure the availability of a range of alternative care options, consistent with 
the general principles of the present Guidelines, for emergency, short-term and long-term care. 
</p>
<p>54. States should ensure that all entities and individuals engaged in the provision of alternative 
care for children receive due authorization to do so from a competent authority and be subject to 
the latter&#8217;s regular monitoring and review in keeping with the present Guidelines. To this end, 
these authorities should develop appropriate criteria for assessing the professional and ethical 
fitness of care providers and for their accreditation, monitoring and supervision. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>55. With regard to informal care arrangements for the child, whether within the extended 
family, with friends or with other parties, States should, where appropriate, encourage such 
carers to notify the competent authorities accordingly so that they and the child may receive any 
necessary financial and other support that would promote the child&#8217;s welfare and protection. 
Where possible and appropriate, States should encourage and enable informal caregivers, with 
the consent of the child and parents concerned, to formalize the care arrangement after a suitable 
lapse of time, to the extent that the arrangement has proved to be in the child&#8217;s best interests to 
date and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  DETERMINATION OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE FORM OF CARE 
</b></p>
<p>56. Decision-making on alternative care in the best interests of the child should take place 
through a judicial, administrative or other adequate and recognized procedure, with legal 
safeguards, including, where appropriate, legal representation on behalf of children in any legal 
proceedings. It should be based on rigorous assessment, planning and review, through 
established structures and mechanisms, and carried out on a case-by-case basis, by suitably 
qualified professionals in a multidisciplinary team, wherever possible. It should involve full 
consultation at all stages with the child, according to his/her evolving capacities, and with his/her 
parents or legal guardians. To this end, all concerned should be provided with the necessary 
information on which to base their opinion. States should make every effort to provide adequate 
resources and channels for the training and recognition of the professionals responsible for 
determining the best form of care so as to facilitate compliance with these provisions. 
</p>
<p>57. Assessment should be carried out expeditiously, thoroughly and carefully. It should take 
into account the child&#8217;s immediate safety and well-being, as well as his/her longer-term care and 
development, and should cover the child&#8217;s personal and developmental characteristics, ethnic, 
cultural, linguistic and religious background, family and social environment, medical history and 
any special needs. 
</p>
<p>58. The resulting initial and review reports should be used as essential tools for planning 
decisions from the time of their acceptance by the competent authorities onwards, with a view to, 
inter alia, avoiding undue disruption and contradictory decisions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>59. Frequent changes in care setting are detrimental to the child&#8217;s development and ability to 
form attachments, and should be avoided. Short-term placements should aim at enabling an 
appropriate permanent solution to be arranged. Permanency for the child should be secured 
without undue delay through reintegration in his/her nuclear or extended family or, if this is not 
possible, in an alternative stable family setting or, where paragraph 20 above applies, in stable 
and appropriate residential care. 
</p>
<p>60. Planning for care provision and permanency should be carried out from the earliest 
possible time, ideally before the child enters care, taking into account the immediate and 
longer-term advantages and disadvantages of each option considered, and should comprise 
short- and long-term propositions. 
</p>
<p>61. Planning for care provision and permanency should be based on, notably, the nature and 
quality of the child&#8217;s attachment to his/her family; the family&#8217;s capacity to safeguard the child&#8217;s 
well-being and harmonious development; the child&#8217;s need or desire to feel part of a family; the 
desirability of the child remaining within his/her community and country; his/her cultural, 
linguistic and religious background; and relationships with siblings, with a view to avoiding their 
separation. 
</p>
<p>62. The plan should clearly state, inter alia, the goals of the placement and the measures to 
achieve them. 
</p>
<p>63. The child and his/her parents or legal guardians should be fully informed about the 
alternative care options available, the implications of each option and their rights and obligations 
in the matter. 
</p>
<p>64. The preparation, enforcement and evaluation of a protective measure for a child should be 
carried out, to the greatest extent possible, with the participation of his/her parents or legal 
guardians and potential foster carers and caregivers, with respect to his/her particular needs, 
convictions and special wishes. At the request of the child, parents or legal guardians, other 
important persons in the child&#8217;s life may also be consulted in any decision-making process, at the 
discretion of the competent authority. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>65. States should ensure that any child who has been placed in alternative care by a properly 
constituted court, tribunal or administrative or other competent body, as well as his/her parents 
or others with parental responsibility, are given the opportunity to make representations on the 
placement decision before a court, are informed of their rights to make such representations and 
are assisted in doing so. 
</p>
<p>66. States should ensure the right of any child who has been placed in temporary care to 
regular and thorough review - preferably at least every three months - of the appropriateness of 
his/her care and treatment, taking into account notably his/her personal development and any 
changing needs, developments in his/her family environment, and the adequacy and necessity of 
the current placement in these lights. The review should be carried out by duly qualified and 
authorized persons, and fully involve the child and all relevant persons in the child&#8217;s life. 
</p>
<p>67. The child should be prepared for all changes of care settings resulting from the planning 
and review processes. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  PROVISION OF ALTERNATIVE CARE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Policies 
</b></p>
<p>68. It is a responsibility of the State or appropriate level of government to ensure the 
development and implementation of coordinated policies regarding formal and informal care for 
all children who are without parental care. Such policies should be based on sound information 
and statistical data. They should define a process for determining who has responsibility for a 
child, taking into account the role of the child&#8217;s parents or principal caregivers in his/her 
protection, care and development. Presumptive responsibility, unless shown to be otherwise, is 
with the child&#8217;s parents or principal caregivers. 
</p>
<p>69. All State entities involved in the referral of, and assistance to, children without parental 
care, in cooperation with civil society, should adopt policies and procedures which favour 
information-sharing and networking between agencies and individuals in order to ensure 
effective care, aftercare and protection for these children. The location and/or design of the 
agency responsible for the oversight of alternative care should be established so as to maximize 
its accessibility to those who require the services provided. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>70. Special attention should be paid to the quality of alternative care provision, both in 
residential and family-based care, in particular with regard to the professional skills, selection, 
training and supervision of carers. Their role and functions should be clearly defined and 
clarified with respect to those of the child&#8217;s parents or legal guardians. 
</p>
<p>71. In each country, the competent authorities should draw up a document setting out the rights 
of children in alternative care in keeping with the present Guidelines. Children in alternative care 
should be enabled to understand fully the rules, regulations and objectives of the care setting and 
their rights and obligations therein. 
</p>
<p>72. All alternative care provision should be based on a written statement of the provider&#8217;s aims 
and objectives in providing the service and the nature of their responsibilities to the child that 
reflects the standards set by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the present Guidelines 
and applicable law. All providers should be appropriately qualified or approved in accordance 
with legal requirements to provide alternative care services. 
</p>
<p>73. A regulatory framework should be established to ensure a standard process for the referral 
or admission of a child to an alternative care setting. 
</p>
<p>74. Cultural and religious practices regarding provision of alternative care, including those 
related to gender perspectives, should be respected and promoted to the extent that they can be 
shown to be consistent with the children&#8217;s rights and best interests. The process of considering 
whether such practices should be promoted should be carried out in a broadly participatory way, 
involving the cultural and religious leaders concerned, professionals and those caring for 
children without parental care, parents and other relevant stakeholders, as well as the children 
themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Informal care 
</b></p>
<p>75. With a view to ensuring that appropriate conditions of care are met in informal care 
provided by individuals or families, States should recognize the role played by this type of care 
and take adequate measures to support its optimal provision on the basis of an assessment of 
which particular settings may require special assistance or oversight. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>76. Competent authorities should, where appropriate, encourage informal carers to notify the 
care arrangement and should seek to ensure their access to all available services and benefits 
likely to assist them in discharging their duty to care for and protect the child. 
</p>
<p>77. The State should recognize the de facto responsibility of informal carers for the child. 
</p>
<p>78. States should devise special and appropriate measures designed to protect children in 
informal care from abuse, neglect, child labour and all other forms of exploitation, with 
particular attention to informal care provided by non-relatives, by relatives previously unknown 
to the child or far from the child&#8217;s habitual place of residence. 
</p>
<p><b>2. General conditions applying to all forms of 
formal alternative care arrangements 
</b></p>
<p>79. The transfer of a child into alternative care should be carried out with the utmost sensitivity 
and in a child-friendly manner, in particular involving specially trained and, in principle, 
non-uniformed personnel. 
</p>
<p>80. When a child is placed in alternative care, contact with his/her family, as well as with other 
persons close to him or her, such as friends, neighbours and previous carers, should be 
encouraged and facilitated, in keeping with the child&#8217;s protection and best interests. The child 
should have access to information on the situation of his/her family members in the absence of 
contact with them. 
</p>
<p>81. States should pay special attention to ensuring that children in alternative care because of 
parental imprisonment or prolonged hospitalization have the opportunity to maintain contact 
with their parents and receive any necessary counselling and support in that regard. 
</p>
<p>82. Carers should ensure that children receive adequate amounts of wholesome and nutritious 
food in accordance with local dietary habits and relevant dietary standards, as well as with the 
child&#8217;s religious beliefs. Appropriate nutritional supplementation should also be provided when 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>83. Carers should promote the health of the children for whom they are responsible and make 
arrangements to ensure that medical care, counselling and support are made available as 
required. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. Children should have access to formal, non-formal and vocational education in accordance 
with their rights, to the maximum extent possible in educational facilities in the local 
community. 
</p>
<p>85. Carers should ensure that the right of every child, including children with disabilities, 
living with or affected by HIV/AIDS or having any other special needs, to develop through play 
and leisure activities is respected and that opportunities for such activities are created within and 
outside the care setting. Contacts with the children and others in the local community should be 
encouraged and facilitated. 
</p>
<p>86. The specific safety, health, nutritional, developmental and other needs of babies and young 
children, including those with special needs, should be catered for in all care settings, including 
ensuring their ongoing attachment to a specific carer. 
</p>
<p>87. Children should be allowed to satisfy the needs of their religious and spiritual life, 
including by receiving visits from a qualified representative of their religion, and to freely decide 
to participate or not in religious services, religious education or counselling. The child&#8217;s own 
religious background should be respected, and no child should be encouraged or persuaded to 
change his/her religion or belief during a care placement. 
</p>
<p>88. All adults responsible for children should respect and promote the right to privacy, 
including appropriate facilities for hygiene and sanitary needs, respecting gender differences and 
interaction, and adequate, secure and accessible storage space for personal possessions. 
</p>
<p>89. Carers should understand the importance of their role in developing positive, safe and 
nurturing relationships with children, and be able to do so. 
</p>
<p>90. Accommodation in all alternative care settings should meet the requirements of health and 
safety. 
</p>
<p>91. States must ensure through their competent authorities that accommodation provided to 
children in alternative care, and their supervision in such placements, enable them to be 
effectively protected against abuse. Particular attention needs to be paid to the age, maturity and 
degree of vulnerability of each child in determining his/her living arrangements. Measures aimed </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>at protecting children in care should be in conformity with the law and not involve unreasonable 
constraints on their liberty and conduct in comparison with children of similar age in their 
community. 
</p>
<p>92. All alternative care settings should provide adequate protection to children from abduction, 
trafficking, sale and all other forms of exploitation. Any consequent constraints on their liberty 
and conduct should be no more than are strictly necessary to ensure their effective protection 
from such acts. 
</p>
<p>93. All carers should promote and encourage children and young people to develop and 
exercise informed choices, taking account of acceptable risks and the child&#8217;s age, and according 
to his/her evolving capacities. 
</p>
<p>94. States, agencies and facilities, schools and other community services should take 
appropriate measures to ensure that children in alternative care are not stigmatized during or 
after their placement. This should include efforts to minimize the identification of the child as 
being looked after in an alternative care setting. 
</p>
<p>95. All disciplinary measures and behaviour management constituting torture, cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment, including closed or solitary confinement or any other forms of physical 
or psychological violence that are likely to compromise the physical or mental health of the 
</p>
<p>child, must be strictly prohibited in conformity with international human rights law. States must 
take all necessary measures to prevent such practices and ensure that they are punishable by law. 
Restriction of contact with members of the child&#8217;s family and other persons of special 
importance to the child should never be used as a sanction. 
</p>
<p>96. Use of force and restraints of whatever nature should not be authorized unless strictly 
necessary for safeguarding the child&#8217;s or others&#8217; physical or psychological integrity, in 
conformity with the law and in a reasonable and proportionate manner and with respect for the 
fundamental rights of the child. Restraint by means of drugs and medication should be based on 
therapeutic needs and should never be employed without evaluation and prescription by a 
specialist. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>97. Children in care should be offered access to a person of trust in whom they may confide in 
total confidentiality. This person should be designated by the competent authority with the 
agreement of the child concerned. The child should be informed that legal or ethical standards 
may require breaching confidentiality under certain circumstances. 
</p>
<p>98. Children in care should have access to a known, effective and impartial mechanism 
whereby they can notify complaints or concerns regarding their treatment or conditions of 
placement. Such mechanisms should include initial consultation, feedback, implementation and 
further consultation. Young people with previous care experience should be involved in this 
process, due weight being given to their opinions. This process should be conducted by 
competent persons trained to work with children and young people. 
</p>
<p>99. To promote the child&#8217;s sense of self-identity, a life story book comprising appropriate 
information, pictures, personal objects and mementoes regarding each step of the child&#8217;s life 
should be maintained with the child&#8217;s participation and made available to the child throughout 
his/her life. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Legal responsibility for the child 
</b></p>
<p>100. In situations where the child&#8217;s parents are absent or are incapable of making day-to-day 
decisions in the best interests of the child, and the child&#8217;s placement in alternative care has been 
ordered or authorized by a competent administrative body or judicial authority, a designated 
individual or competent entity should be vested with the legal right and responsibility to make 
such decisions in the place of parents, in full consultation with the child. States should ensure 
that a mechanism is in place for designating such an individual or entity. 
</p>
<p>101. Such legal responsibility should be attributed by the competent authorities and be 
supervised directly by them or through formally accredited entities, including non-governmental 
organizations. Accountability for the actions of the individual or entity concerned should lie with 
the designating body. 
</p>
<p>102. Persons exercising such legal responsibility should be reputable individuals with relevant 
knowledge of children&#8217;s issues, an ability to work directly with children, and an understanding of 
any special and cultural needs of the children to be entrusted to them. They should receive </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>appropriate training and professional support in this regard. They should be in a position to make 
independent and impartial decisions that are in the best interests of the children concerned and 
that promote and safeguard each child&#8217;s welfare. 
</p>
<p>103. The role and specific responsibilities of the designated person or entity should include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensuring that the rights of the child are protected and that, in particular, the child has 
appropriate care, accommodation, health-care provision, developmental opportunities, 
psychosocial support, education and language support; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensuring that the child has access to legal and other representation where necessary, 
consulting with the child so that the child&#8217;s views are taken into account by decision-making 
authorities, and advising and keeping the child informed of his/her rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) Contributing to the identification of a stable solution in the child&#8217;s best interests; 
</p>
<p> (d) Providing a link between the child and various organizations that may provide 
services to the child; 
</p>
<p> (e) Assisting the child in family tracing; 
</p>
<p> (f) Ensuring that, if repatriation or family reunification is carried out, it is done in the 
best interests of the child; 
</p>
<p> (g) Helping the child to keep in touch with his/her family, when appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Agencies and facilities responsible for formal care 
</b></p>
<p>104. Legislation should stipulate that all agencies and facilities must be registered and 
authorized to operate by social welfare services or another competent authority, and that failure 
to comply with such legislation constitutes an offence punishable by law. Authorization should 
be granted and regularly reviewed by the competent authorities on the basis of standard criteria 
covering, at a minimum, the agency&#8217;s or facility&#8217;s objectives, functioning, staff recruitment and 
qualifications, conditions of care and financial resources and management. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>105. All agencies and facilities should have written policy and practice statements consistent 
with the present Guidelines, setting out clearly their aims, policies, methods and the standards 
applied for the recruitment, monitoring, supervision and evaluation of qualified and suitable 
carers to ensure that those aims are met. 
</p>
<p>106. All agencies and facilities should develop a staff code of conduct, consistent with the 
present Guidelines, that defines the role of each professional and of the carers in particular and 
includes clear reporting procedures on allegations of misconduct by any team member. 
</p>
<p>107. The forms of financing care provision should never be such as to encourage a child&#8217;s 
unnecessary placement or prolonged stay in care arrangements organized or provided by an 
agency or facility. 
</p>
<p>108. Comprehensive and up-to-date records should be maintained regarding the administration 
of alternative care services, including detailed files on all children in their care, staff employed 
and financial transactions. 
</p>
<p>109. The records on children in care should be complete, up to date, confidential and secure, 
and include information on their admission and departure and the form, content and details of the 
care placement of each child, together with any appropriate identity documents and other 
personal information. Information on the child&#8217;s family should be included in the child&#8217;s file as 
well as in the reports based on regular evaluations. This record should follow the child 
throughout the alternative care period and be consulted by duly authorized professionals 
responsible for his/her current care. 
</p>
<p>110. The above-mentioned records could be made available to the child, as well as to the 
parents or guardians, within the limits of the child&#8217;s right to privacy and confidentiality, as 
appropriate. Appropriate counselling should be provided before, during and after consultation of 
the record. 
</p>
<p>111. All alternative care services should have a clear policy on maintaining the confidentiality 
of information pertaining to each child, which all carers are aware of and adhere to. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>112. As a matter of good practice, all agencies and facilities should systematically ensure that, 
prior to employment, carers and other staff in direct contact with children undergo an appropriate 
and comprehensive assessment of their suitability to work with children. 
</p>
<p>113. Conditions of work, including remuneration, for carers employed by agencies and facilities 
should be such as to maximize motivation, job satisfaction and continuity, and hence their 
disposition to fulfil their role in the most appropriate and effective manner. 
</p>
<p>114. Training should be provided to all carers on the rights of children without parental care and 
on the specific vulnerability of children, in particularly difficult situations, such as emergency 
placements or placements outside their area of habitual residence. Cultural, social, gender and 
religious sensitization should also be assured. States should also provide adequate resources and 
channels for the recognition of these professionals in order to favour the implementation of these 
provisions. 
</p>
<p>115. Training in dealing appropriately with challenging behaviour, including conflict resolution 
techniques and means to prevent acts of harm or self-harm, should be provided to all care staff 
employed by agencies and facilities. 
</p>
<p>116. Agencies and facilities should ensure that, wherever appropriate, carers are prepared to 
respond to children with special needs, notably those living with HIV/AIDS or other chronic 
physical or mental illnesses, and children with physical or mental disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Foster care 
</b></p>
<p>117. The competent authority or agency should devise a system, and should train concerned 
staff accordingly, to assess and match the needs of the child with the abilities and resources of 
potential foster carers and to prepare all concerned for the placement. 
</p>
<p>118. A pool of accredited foster carers should be identified in each locality, who can provide 
children with care and protection while maintaining ties to family, community and cultural 
group. 
</p>
<p>119. Special preparation, support and counselling services for foster carers should be developed 
and made available to carers at regular intervals, before, during and after the placement. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>120. Carers should have, within fostering agencies and other systems involved with children 
without parental care, the opportunity to make their voice heard and to influence policy. 
</p>
<p>121. Encouragement should be given to the establishment of associations of foster carers that 
can provide important mutual support and contribute to practice and policy development. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Residential care 
</b></p>
<p>122. Facilities providing residential care should be small and organized around the rights and 
needs of the child, in a setting as close as possible to a family or small group situation. Their 
objective should generally be to provide temporary care and to contribute actively to the child&#8217;s 
family reintegration or, if this is not possible, to secure his/her stable care in an alternative family 
setting, including through adoption or <i>kafala </i>of Islamic law, where appropriate. 
</p>
<p>123. Measures should be taken so that, where necessary and appropriate, a child solely in need 
of protection and alternative care may be accommodated separately from children who are 
subject to the criminal justice system. 
</p>
<p>124. The competent national or local authority should establish rigorous screening procedures to 
ensure that only appropriate admissions to such facilities are made. 
</p>
<p>125. States should ensure that there are sufficient carers in residential care settings to allow 
individualized attention and to give the child, where appropriate, the opportunity to bond with a 
specific carer. Carers should also be deployed within the care setting in such a way as to 
implement effectively its aims and objectives and ensure child protection. 
</p>
<p>126. Laws, policies and regulations should prohibit the recruitment and solicitation of children 
for placement in residential care by agencies, facilities or individuals. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Inspection and monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>127. Agencies, facilities and professionals involved in care provision should be accountable to a 
specific public authority, which should ensure, inter alia, frequent inspections comprising both 
scheduled and unannounced visits, involving discussion with and observation of the staff and the 
children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>128. To the extent possible and appropriate, inspection functions should include a component of 
training and capacity-building for care providers. 
</p>
<p>129. States should be encouraged to ensure that an independent monitoring mechanism is in 
place, with due consideration for the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for 
the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Paris Principles). The monitoring mechanism 
should be easily accessible to children, parents and those responsible for children without 
parental care. The functions of the monitoring mechanism should include: 
</p>
<p> (a) Consulting in conditions of privacy with children in all forms of alternative care, 
visiting the care settings in which they live and undertaking investigations into any alleged 
situation of violation of children&#8217;s rights in those settings, on complaint or on its own initiative; 
</p>
<p> (b) Recommending relevant policies to appropriate authorities with the aim of improving 
the treatment of children deprived of parental care and ensuring that it is in keeping with the 
preponderance of research findings on child protection, health, development and care; 
</p>
<p> (c) Submitting proposals and observations concerning draft legislation; 
</p>
<p> (d) Contributing independently to the reporting process under the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, including to periodic State party reports to the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child with regard to the implementation of the present Guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Support for aftercare 
</b></p>
<p>130. Agencies and facilities should have a clear policy and carry out agreed procedures relating 
to the planned and unplanned conclusion of their work with children to ensure appropriate 
aftercare and/or follow-up. Throughout the period of care, they should systematically aim at 
preparing the child to assume self-reliance and to integrate fully in the community, notably 
through the acquisition of social and life skills, which are fostered by participation in the life of 
the local community. 
</p>
<p>131. The process of transition from care to aftercare should take into consideration the child&#8217;s 
gender, age, maturity and particular circumstances and include counselling and support, notably </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>to avoid exploitation. Children leaving care should be encouraged to take part in the planning of 
aftercare life. Children with special needs, such as disabilities, should benefit from an 
appropriate support system, ensuring, inter alia, avoidance of unnecessary institutionalization. 
Both the public and private sectors should be encouraged, including through incentives, to 
employ children from different care services, particularly children with special needs. 
</p>
<p>132. Special efforts should be made to allocate to each child, whenever possible, a specialized 
person who can facilitate his/her independence when leaving care. 
</p>
<p>133. Aftercare should be prepared as early as possible in the placement and, in any case, well 
before the child leaves the care setting. 
</p>
<p>134. Ongoing educational and vocational training opportunities should be imparted as part of 
life skill education to young people leaving care in order to help them to become financially 
independent and generate their own income. 
</p>
<p>135. Access to social, legal and health services, together with appropriate financial support, 
should also be provided to young people leaving care and during aftercare. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII. CARE PROVISION FOR CHILDREN OUTSIDE THEIR 
COUNTRY OF HABITUAL RESIDENCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Placement of a child for care abroad 
</b></p>
<p>136. The present Guidelines should apply to all public and private entities and all persons 
involved in arrangements for a child to be sent for care to a country other than his/her country of 
habitual residence, whether for medical treatment, temporary hosting, respite care or any other 
reason. 
</p>
<p>137. States concerned should ensure that a designated body has responsibility for determining 
specific standards to be met regarding, in particular, the criteria for selecting carers in the host 
country and the quality of care and follow-up, as well as for supervising and monitoring the 
operation of such schemes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>138. To ensure appropriate international cooperation and child protection in such situations, 
States are encouraged to ratify or accede to the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on 
Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental 
Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Provision of care for a child already abroad 
</b></p>
<p>139. The present Guidelines, as well as other relevant international provisions, should apply to 
all public and private entities and all persons involved in arrangements for a child needing care 
while in a country other than his/her country of habitual residence, for whatever reason. 
</p>
<p>140. Unaccompanied or separated children already abroad should in principle enjoy the same 
level of protection and care as national children in the country concerned. 
</p>
<p>141. In determining appropriate care provision, the diversity and disparity of unaccompanied or 
separated children (such as ethnic and migratory background or cultural and religious diversity) 
should be taken into consideration on a case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p>142. Unaccompanied or separated children, including those who arrive irregularly in a country, 
should not be, in principle, deprived of their liberty solely for having breached any law 
governing access to and stay within the territory. 
</p>
<p>143. Child victims of trafficking should neither be detained in police custody nor subjected to 
penalties for their involvement under compulsion in unlawful activities. 
</p>
<p>144. As soon as an unaccompanied child is identified, States are strongly encouraged to appoint 
a guardian or, where necessary, representation by an organization responsible for his/her care 
and well-being to accompany the child throughout the status determination and decision-making 
process. 
</p>
<p>145. As soon as an unaccompanied or separated child is taken into care, all reasonable efforts 
should be made to trace his/her family and re-establish family ties, when this is in the best 
interests of the child and would not endanger those involved. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>146. In order to assist in planning the future of an unaccompanied or separated child in a 
manner that best protects his/her rights, relevant State and social service authorities should make 
all reasonable efforts to procure documentation and information in order to conduct an 
assessment of the child&#8217;s risk and social and family conditions in his/her country of habitual 
residence. 
</p>
<p>147. Unaccompanied or separated children must not be returned to their country of habitual 
residence: 
</p>
<p> (a) If, following the risk and security assessment, there are reasons to believe that the 
child&#8217;s safety and security are in danger; 
</p>
<p> (b) Unless, prior to the return, a suitable caregiver, such as a parent, other relative, other 
adult caretaker, a Government agency or an authorized agency or facility in the country of origin, 
has agreed and is able to take responsibility for the child and provide him/her with appropriate 
care and protection; 
</p>
<p> (c) If, for other reasons, it is not in their best interests, according to the assessment of the 
competent authorities. 
</p>
<p>148. With the above aims in mind, cooperation among States, regions, local authorities and civil 
society associations should be promoted, strengthened and enhanced. 
</p>
<p>149. The effective involvement of consular services or, failing that, legal representatives of the 
country of origin should be foreseen, when this is in the best interests of the child and would not 
endanger the child or his/her family. 
</p>
<p>150. Those responsible for the welfare of an unaccompanied or separated child should facilitate 
regular communication between the child and his/her family, except where this is against the 
child&#8217;s wishes or is demonstrably not in his/her best interests. 
</p>
<p>151. Placement with a view to adoption or <i>kafala</i> of Islamic law should not be considered a 
suitable initial option for an unaccompanied or separated child. States are encouraged to consider 
this option only after efforts to determine the location of his/her parents, extended family or 
habitual carers have been exhausted. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  CARE IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Application of the Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>152. The present Guidelines should continue to apply in situations of emergency arising from 
natural and man-made disasters, including international and non-international armed conflicts, as 
well as foreign occupation. Individuals and organizations wishing to work on behalf of children 
without parental care in emergency situations are strongly encouraged to operate in accordance 
with the Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>153. In such circumstances, the State or de facto authorities in the region concerned, the 
international community and all local, national, foreign and international agencies providing or 
intending to provide child-focused services should pay special attention: 
</p>
<p> (a) To ensure that all entities and persons involved in responding to unaccompanied or 
separated children are sufficiently experienced, trained, resourceful and equipped to do so in an 
appropriate manner; 
</p>
<p> (b) To develop, as necessary, temporary and long-term family-based care; 
</p>
<p> (c) To use residential care only as a temporary measure until family-based care can be 
developed; 
</p>
<p> (d) To prohibit the establishment of new residential facilities structured to provide 
simultaneous care to large groups of children on a permanent or long-term basis;  
</p>
<p> (e) To prevent the cross-border displacement of children, except under the circumstances 
described in paragraph 159 below; 
</p>
<p> (f) To make cooperation with family tracing and reintegration efforts mandatory. 
</p>
<p><b>Preventing separation 
</b></p>
<p>154. Organizations and authorities should make every effort to prevent the separation of 
children from their parents or primary caregivers, unless the best interests of the child so require, 
and ensure that their actions do not inadvertently encourage family separation by providing 
services and benefits to children alone rather than to families. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>155. Separations initiated by the child&#8217;s parents or other primary caregivers should be prevented 
by: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensuring that all households have access to basic food and medical supplies and 
other services, including education; 
</p>
<p> (b) Limiting the development of residential care options and restricting their use to those 
situations where it is absolutely necessary. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Care arrangements 
</b></p>
<p>156. Communities should be supported to play an active role in monitoring and responding to 
care and protection issues facing children in their local context. 
</p>
<p>157. Care within a child&#8217;s own community, including fostering, should be encouraged, as it 
provides continuity in socialization and development. 
</p>
<p>158. As unaccompanied or separated children may be at heightened risk of abuse and 
exploitation, monitoring and specific support to carers should be foreseen to ensure their 
protection. 
</p>
<p>159. Children in emergency situations should not be moved to a country other than that of their 
habitual residence for alternative care except temporarily for compelling health, medical or 
safety reasons. In that case, this should be as close as possible to their home, they should be 
accompanied by a parent or caregiver known to the child, and a clear return plan should be 
established. 
</p>
<p>160. Should family reintegration prove impossible within an appropriate period or be deemed 
contrary to the child&#8217;s best interests, stable and definitive solutions, such as <i>kafala</i> of Islamic law 
or adoption, should be envisaged; failing this, other long-term options should be considered, 
such as foster care or appropriate residential care, including group homes and other supervised 
living arrangements. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Tracing and family reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>161. Identifying, registering and documenting unaccompanied or separated children are 
priorities in any emergency and should be carried out as quickly as possible. 
</p>
<p>162. Registration activities should be conducted by or under the direct supervision of State 
authorities and explicitly mandated entities with responsibility for and experience in this task. 
</p>
<p>163. The confidential nature of the information collected should be respected and systems put in 
place for safe forwarding and storage of information. Information should only be shared among 
duly mandated agencies for the purpose of tracing, family reintegration and care. 
</p>
<p>164. All those engaged in tracing family members or primary legal or customary caregivers 
should operate within a coordinated system, using standardized forms and mutually compatible 
procedures, wherever possible. They should ensure that the child and others concerned would not 
be endangered by their actions. 
</p>
<p>165. The validity of relationships and the confirmation of the willingness of the child and family 
members to be reunited must be verified for every child. No action should be taken that may 
hinder eventual family reintegration, such as adoption, change of name, or movement to places 
far from the family&#8217;s likely location, until all tracing efforts have been exhausted. 
</p>
<p>166. Appropriate records of any placement of a child should be made and kept in a safe and 
secure manner so that reunification can be facilitated in the future. </p>

work under the annual World Health Assembly agenda item on the monitoring of the 
achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity is a health, development and human rights challenge, and that a human rights 
analysis of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and the integration of a human rights 
perspective in international and national responses to maternal mortality and morbidity could 
contribute positively to the common goal of reducing this rate, with a view to eliminating 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,

<p> <i>Welcoming</i> its initiative to hold an interactive dialogue at its eighth regular session on 
maternal mortality and the human rights of women, on 5 June 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity affects women and their 
families in all regions and cultures, and that it is exacerbated by factors such as poverty, gender 
inequality, age and multiple forms of discrimination, as well as factors such as lack of access to 
adequate health facilities and technology, and lack of infrastructure, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity, noting in this regard that the World Health Organization has assessed 
that over 1,500 women and girls die every day as a result of preventable complications occurring 
before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, and that, globally, maternal mortality is the 
leading cause of death among women and of girls of reproductive age; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that most instances of maternal mortality and morbidity are preventable, 
and that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is a health, development and human rights 
challenge that also requires the effective promotion and protection of the human rights of women 
and girls, in particular their rights to life, to be equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, 
receive and impart information, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from 
discrimination, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
including sexual and reproductive health;

<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> all States to renew their political commitment to eliminating preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels, and to </p>

 <p>

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also requests</i> States to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity 
initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements, including by 
honouring existing commitments and considering new commitments, and the exchange of

<p><b>11/117. Issuance of reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic 
Review in all official languages of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p> At its 18th meeting, on 18 June 2009, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt the 
following text and to submit it to the General Assembly as a matter of urgency, for its 
implementation: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bearing in mind </i>General Assembly resolutions 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and 
62/219 of 22 December 2007, Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 and 
8/1 of 18 June 2008, Council decision 9/103 of 24 September 2008 and President&#8217;s 
statements 8/1 of 24 September 2008 and 9/2 of 9 April 2008, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing </i>that the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review of the 
Human Rights Council adopted the reports on the review of 32 Member States at its fourth 
and fifth sessions, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned </i>that 13 of the reports adopted by the Working Group at its fourth session 
were not issued as official documents of the United Nations in the six official languages 
prior to their consideration and adoption by the Council at its eleventh session, and that the 
processing and issuance of two of the reports adopted by the Working Group at its fifth 
session remains delayed, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the importance of multilingualism in the work of the United Nations and 
the need to issue all reports of the Working Group in all official languages of the 
Organization, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> that all the reports adopted by the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review at its fourth and fifth sessions and the additional information 
submitted by the States under review before the adoption of the outcome by the Council 
shall be issued as official documents in all official languages of the United Nations prior to 
the twelfth session of the Council, and requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary 
measures to that effect; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recalls</i> that the Working Group should endeavour to apply in its reports the 
word limits established in the annex to President&#8217;s statement 9/2, bearing in mind that the 
Working Group is entrusted with the authority to decide on the adoption of reports that 
exceptionally exceed those word limits; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Decides</i> that all reports adopted by the Working Group shall be issued as 
official documents in all official languages of the United Nations, in a timely manner 
before their consideration by the Council, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure the 
necessary support to that effect.&#8221;
