<p><b>  27</b>/&#8230;  <b>The right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the standard 
</p>
<p>in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, and bearing in mind the 
</p>
<p>importance of the Optional Protocols thereto, as well as other human rights standards,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>in</i> <i>particular</i> article 31 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
</p>
<p>which outlines the right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate 
</p>
<p>to the age of the child,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>specifically</i> article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities, stipulating the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal basis 
</p>
<p>with others in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> relevant International Labour Organization conventions with respect to 
</p>
<p>child labour,  
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on the rights of the child,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and taking note 
</p>
<p>with interest of its general comment No. 17 (2013),1 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 67/17 of 28 November 2012, on sport as a 
</p>
<p>means to promote education, health, development and peace, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>stressed the use of sport as a vehicle to strengthen education, including physical education, 
</p>
<p>for children and young persons, and 67/296 of 23 August 2013, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>proclaimed 6 April as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace,  
</p>
<p><i>Bearing</i> <i>in mind </i>that the survival, protection, growth and development of children in 
</p>
<p>good physical and emotional health are the foundations of human dignity and human rights 
</p>
<p>and that play has been proven essential to the emotional and physical health and well-being 
</p>
<p>of the child, as well as for the development of creativity, imagination, self-confidence and 
</p>
<p>self-efficacy,  
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the fundamental importance of the right of children to engage in 
</p>
<p>play and recreational activities for their well-being, health and development,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that, with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, States should 
</p>
<p>take steps to ensure the allocation of available resources to the maximum extent possible 
</p>
<p>and, where needed, within the framework of international cooperation,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Encourages</i> States to take specific measures to respect, protect, promote and 
</p>
<p>fulfil the right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities, and in particular: 
</p>
<p>(a) To strengthen the evidence base of data and information on how play and 
</p>
<p>recreational activities, including sport, are critical elements that support the development 
</p>
<p>and well-being of the child; 
</p>
<p>(b) To position play and recreation as both a right of the child and a means to 
</p>
<p>secure children&#8217;s entitlement to optimum development;   
</p>
<p>(c) To affirm the importance of the right of the child to engage in self-directed 
</p>
<p>and non-compulsory play, initiated by children themselves; 
</p>
<p>(d) To introduce or revise national and local legislation, policies, regulations and 
</p>
<p>guidelines to guarantee sufficient access to play and recreational activities for every child, 
</p>
<p>regardless of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic 
</p>
<p>or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status; 
</p>
<p>(e) To adopt measures aimed at reducing the necessity for children living in 
</p>
<p>poverty to work, in order to enable them to enjoy their right to play and recreational 
</p>
<p>activities; 
</p>
<p>(f) To establish, where appropriate, frameworks and minimum standards of care 
</p>
<p>and protection for children participating in play and recreational activities, including sport, 
</p>
<p>to protect children from potential harm; 
</p>
<p>(g) To establish safety and accessibility standards for all play and recreational 
</p>
<p>facilities, toys and games equipment, in order to ensure the protection of children from 
</p>
<p>recreational material which might be injurious to their health and well-being;   
</p>
<p>(h) To address social norms which attach low value to the right to play and 
</p>
<p>recreational activities by raising public awareness on its significance; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>(i) To provide guidance and support to parents and caregivers on how to create 
</p>
<p>safe and inclusive environments that facilitate children&#8217;s play and recreational activities, 
</p>
<p>including on their responsible use of digital technology; 
</p>
<p>(j) To strengthen the digital inclusion of children and to ensure that all 
</p>
<p>legislative and policy measures governing the Internet take into consideration their best 
</p>
<p>interests, including by promoting their safety and protecting them from cyberbullying, 
</p>
<p>pornography, cybergrooming and other harmful content or practices, as well as by 
</p>
<p>educating them on the responsible use of digital technology; 
</p>
<p>(k) To work to ensure the provision of adequate space to facilitate safe and 
</p>
<p>inclusive play and recreational activities, including in schools and communities; 
</p>
<p>(l) To promote the provision of a school curriculum that allows for sufficient 
</p>
<p>opportunity for play and recreational activities, including physical education and sport; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also encourages</i> States to ensure that effective, safe and child-sensitive 
</p>
<p>counselling, reporting and complaints mechanisms are accessible to all children, that they 
</p>
<p>pursue the best interests of the child at all times and that they comply with international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Further encourages</i> States to take active measures to restore and protect the 
</p>
<p>right of the child to play and recreation in forced displacement, post-conflict and disaster 
</p>
<p>situations, with a view to promoting resilience and psychological healing; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Encourages</i> international cooperation in the realization of the right of the 
</p>
<p>child to play and recreation, through the active engagement of States, United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies, funds and programmes, civil society organizations and other international, 
</p>
<p>national and local partners; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Recommends</i> that the celebration of the International Day of Sport for 
</p>
<p>Development and Peace emphasize, through specific events, the right of the child to engage 
</p>
<p>in play and recreational activities.
