<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>1. From 14 to 16 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, James Anaya, met with representatives of 
the Sami parliaments and Governments of Norway, Sweden and Finland at a conference in 
Rovaniemi, Finland, to discuss cross-border and other issues affecting the Sami people in 
the S&#225;pmi region of the Nordic countries. The present note contains general information on 
the conference and some initial impressions. A full report on the situation of the Sami 
people in the Nordic countries, with conclusions and recommendations, will be presented 
by the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council and made public at a later date. 
</p>
<p>2. The conference gathered indigenous representatives of the Sami parliaments, State 
officials from the Nordic countries in which Sami people live, and Sami non-governmental 
organizations from the Nordic countries, as well as from the Russian Federation. The 
conference provided a unique and valuable opportunity for consultation and dialogue 
regarding issues concerning the entire S&#225;pmi region.  
</p>
<p>3. This was the first time that a Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples has 
examined issues concerning one indigenous group living across several State borders, and 
represents a new approach for examining the human rights situation of a specific 
indigenous people. The Special Rapporteur hopes that it will be regarded as a good practice 
for addressing the human rights concerns of indigenous peoples who continue to live in 
their traditional territories that cross the formal boundaries of States. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation to the Sami 
Parliamentary Council, a cooperative body representing the S&#225;mi parliaments of Norway, 
Finland and Sweden, and which includes as observers the S&#225;mi Council and S&#225;mi people 
living in the Russian Federation, for initiating and organizing the conference. The Special 
Rapporteur is also grateful to the Sami parliaments and non-governmental organizations for 
their invaluable contribution to the conference and for the information that they provided 
on the current human rights situation of the Sami in the Nordic countries. The Special 
Rapporteur was inspired by the strength and the vitality of the Sami culture and by the 
resolve of Sami representatives when confronting the ongoing human rights challenges that 
the Sami people face. 
</p>
<p>5. The Governments of the Nordic countries are also to be commended for their 
openness and willingness to hold genuine and constructive discussions on the current 
situation of the Sami people. The Special Rapporteur considers this to have been an 
extremely fruitful and important discussion, and notes with approval the sincere attention 
paid by the Governments to the important issues raised at the conference. 
</p>
<p>6. The conference focused in particular on issues of self-determination, the rights to 
land, water and natural resources, and the situation of youth, with a particular focus on 
education and language. The implementation by the Governments of the relevant 
recommendations made by the various United Nations human rights bodies, including the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Human Rights Committee, 
was also assessed.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite the expressed commitment of the 
Governments of Norway, Sweden and Finland to protect the rights of the Sami people, the 
challenges ahead in S&#225;pmi are significant, and that overcoming the harm inflicted by the 
discrimination and extensive assimilation policies carried out throughout history in the 
Nordic countries will require serious commitment, political will and hard work. 
</p>
<p>8. One positive development is the initiative to develop and conclude a Sami 
convention to establish a common framework in the Nordic region for advancing the 
effective enjoyment of the rights of the Sami people and for providing still needed 
measures to redress historical patterns of discrimination and oppression. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates the importance of restarting negotiations on the proposed convention </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/37/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>with the full support of Norway, Sweden and Finland and the full participation, on an equal 
footing, of Sami leaders from each Nordic country. Such a convention will be a milestone 
along the path towards the strengthening and consolidation of protections for the rights of 
the Sami so that they can maintain and develop their language, culture, livelihoods and 
society.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is committed to engage further in a constructive dialogue 
with the Governments of Norway, Sweden and Finland and the Sami parliaments and 
organizations to address the concerns raised during the conference and to develop potential 
solutions to meet ongoing challenges.  
</p>
<p>10. In his report, the Special Rapporteur will detail and evaluate the concerns raised at 
the conference by Sami leaders and the Government responses, and will make appropriate 
recommendations with the hope of advancing practical and workable solutions grounded in 
applicable international standards.
