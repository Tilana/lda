NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 – NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
Hercules Offshore, LLC was formed in July 2004 as a Delaware limited liability company. On November 1,
2005 in connection with its initial public offering, Hercules Offshore, LLC was converted to a Delaware
corporation named Hercules Offshore, Inc. (the “Conversion”). Upon the Conversion, each outstanding
membership unit of the limited liability company was converted into 350 shares of common stock of the
corporation. All of the financial results reported in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q predate this
Conversion. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the “Company” are to Hercules Offshore,
LLC for periods prior to the Conversion and to Hercules Offshore, Inc. for periods after the Conversion.
The Company provides shallow-water drilling and liftboat services to the oil and gas exploration and
production industry primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico through its Contract Drilling Services and Marine
Services segments. The Company owns, through its subsidiaries Hercules Drilling, LLC (“Drilling”) and
Hercules Liftboats, LLC (“Liftboats”), nine jackup drilling rigs, one platform rig and 46 liftboat vessels. One of
the jackup rigs was severely damaged in a hurricane and is likely to be declared a constructive total loss.
For the period from inception (July 27, 2004) to September 30, 2004 (“period from inception to September 30,
2004”), the Company owned five jackup drilling rigs and four platform rigs that were purchased from Parker
Drilling Company (“Parker”) on August 2, 2004 for $39,250,000. The consolidated results of operations for the
period from inception to September 30, 2004 include the operation during such period of the five jackup rigs
acquired from Parker. Three of the four platform rigs were sold in November 2004 and the fourth was
classified as an asset held for sale as of September 30, 2005 (see Assets Held for Sale).
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial statements and do not include all annual
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated
interim financial statements have not been audited. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30,
2005, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and the
period from inception to September 30, 2004 have been reflected. The consolidated results of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the full year. The accompanying consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s prospectus dated
October 26, 2005 included in the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-126457)
declared effective on October 26, 2005.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Table of Contents
Revenue Recognition
Revenue generated from the operation of the Company’s drilling rigs and liftboats is recognized under
dayrate contracts as services are performed. Certain contracts include provisions for the recovery of direct
costs, including mobilization and demobilization costs, extra labor and extra catering. Under most of its
liftboat contracts, the Company receives a variable rate for reimbursement of costs such as catering, fuel,
rental equipment and other items. Revenue for recovery of these costs is recognized when the costs are
incurred. For certain Contract Drilling Services contracts, the Company may receive lump-sum fees for the
mobilization of equipment and personnel. Mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig
from one market to another under contracts longer than one month are recognized over the term of the related
drilling contract.
The Company records reimbursements from customers for “out-of-pocket” expenses as revenues and the
related cost as direct operating expenses. Total revenues from such reimbursements included $1,371,656,
$218,611 and $3,698,578 for the three months ended September 30, 2005, the period from inception to
September 30, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation arrangements are accounted for using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (“APB Opinion
25”) and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for options granted to employees is
measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of shares at the date of grant over the exercise price an
employee must pay to acquire the shares. No compensation cost has been recognized in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation cost using the alternative fair
value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123 described below, pro forma net income would not be materially
different than that reported in the accompanying financial statements.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123R”), which
replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion 25. SFAS
No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on the fair values beginning with the first interim period in fiscal
year 2006, with early adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS
No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company must determine the
appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for
compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include
prospective or retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive option, prior periods may be restated either
as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock as the requisite service
is rendered on or after the required effective date beginning with the first quarter of adoption of SFAS
No. 123R , while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options
and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. The Company is evaluating the requirements of
SFAS No. 123R and expects to adopt the standard using the prospective method.
The impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on the Company’s consolidated statement of
operations will be determined primarily by the number of stock options granted to employees in future
periods. Options granted prior to the Company’s initial public offering in November 2005 (see NOTE 9) will
continue to be accounted for using the intrinsic value method and, as such, the Company will incur no
compensation expense for them upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Management of the Company monitors the accounts receivable from its customers for any collectability
issues. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on reviews of individual customer accounts,
recent loss experience, current economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. Accounts deemed
uncollectable are charged to the allowance. During the period from inception (July 27, 2004) to December 31,
2004, the Company recorded a provision for bad debts of $519,165. During the second quarter of 2005, the
Company recorded an additional provision for bad debts of $318,967. The Company received payment for the
full amount of the receivable of $838,132 during September 2005, and the allowance was reversed. There was
no allowance at September 30, 2005.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for property and
equipment and items that substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets are capitalized at cost and
depreciated. Routine expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, except for
expenditures for drydocking the Company’s liftboats. Drydock costs are capitalized at cost in other non-
current assets on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized on the straight-line method (see below).
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company has a plan for disposal and those assets meet the
held for sale criteria of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. During
the first quarter of 2005, the Company’s Contract Drilling Services segment committed to a plan to sell Rig 41,
a platform rig, in connection with the Company’s efforts to dispose of certain non-strategic assets. The rig has
been idle since being acquired on August 2, 2004. The rig was classified as an asset held for sale in March
2005. The estimated fair value of the rig less its selling costs exceeded the rig’s carrying value of
approximately $2,000,000 at September 30, 2005 and, as such, no loss has been recognized for the three or
nine months ended September 30, 2005. In October 2005, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to
sell Rig 41 for $3,443,750, net of commissions, and received a non-refundable deposit of $181,250. The
Company expects the sale of the rig to close in the first quarter of 2006, and anticipates that a gain on the sale
of the rig will be recorded at that time. During the second quarter of 2005, the Company’s Marine Services
segment committed to a plan to sell the Moonfish, a liftboat, in connection with the Company’s effort to
dispose of certain non-strategic assets. The liftboat had been idle since being acquired on June 1, 2005. The
Moonfish was sold in August 2005. No gain or loss was recognized on the transaction.
Other Assets
Other assets consist of drydocking costs for liftboats, financing fees and unrealized gain on hedge
transactions. The drydock costs are capitalized at cost and amortized on the straight-line method over 12
months. Drydocking costs, net of accumulated amortization, at September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004
were $2,926,496 and $452,256, respectively. Accumulated amortization of drydocking costs at September 30,
2005 and December 31, 2004 was $2,006,778 and $149,228, respectively. Amortization expense for drydocking
costs was $1,148,595, $0 and $2,142,795 for the three months ended September 30, 2005, the period from
inception to September 30, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively.
Financing fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the applicable debt instrument. Unamortized
deferred financing fees at September 30, 2005 were $4,085,389, net of accumulated amortization of $222,030.
Unamortized deferred financing fees at December 31, 2004 were $1,577,793, net of accumulated amortization
of $215,283. All unamortized deferred financing fees outstanding at December 31, 2004 were expensed in
conjunction with the refinancing of the Company’s long-term debt in June 2005, and the portion outstanding
as of the date of the refinancing, totaling $2,190,709, is included in the loss on early retirement of debt in the
statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2005. The amortization expense related to
the deferred financing fees is included in interest expense on the statement of operations. Amortization
expense for financing fees was $222,030,
Table of Contents

HERCULES OFFSHORE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
$70,307 and $714,071 for the three months ended September 30, 2005, the period from inception to
September 30, 2004 and the nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively. All financing fees at
September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004 relate to debt obtained through credit agreements dated July 30,
2004, October 1, 2004 and June 29, 2005 (see NOTE 5).
The Company entered into several transactions to hedge its variable rate debt with the purpose and effect of
fixing the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding principal of the term loan (see NOTE 5). The cumulative
unrealized gain on these hedging instruments was $321,504 at September 30, 2005 and is recorded in other
assets and accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet (see NOTE 6).
Income Taxes
The Company was a limited liability company until its conversion to a Delaware corporation on November 1,
2005. Prior to the Conversion, the Company elected to be taxed as a partnership. As such, the members of the
Company were taxed on their proportionate share of net income prior to the Conversion and no provision or
liability for income taxes is included in the Company’s accompanying financial statements. When the
Company became a taxable entity in the Conversion, a provision of approximately $10,800,000 was made
reflecting the tax effect of the difference between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities as of
November 1, 2005, the effective date of the Conversion.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair values because of the short-
term nature of the instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt is equal to the fair market value
because the debt bears interest at market rates.

The Company calculates earnings per unit and earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of units or shares outstanding. Share-based information contained herein assumes that the
Company had effected the conversion of each outstanding member unit into 350 shares of common stock for
all periods prior to the Conversion. Diluted earnings per unit and earnings per share include the dilutive
effects of any outstanding stock options calculated under the treasury method. Options with an exercise price
equal to or in excess of the average market price of the Company’s units are excluded from the calculation of
the dilutive effect of stock options for diluted earnings per unit and earnings per share calculations. On a
member units basis, there were no options outstanding with dilutive effects for the period from inception to
September 30, 2004 and there were 2,022 and 1,342 options outstanding with dilutive effects for the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2005, respectively. On a share basis, there were no options
outstanding with dilutive effects for the period from inception to September 30, 2004 and there were 707,778
and 469,582 options outstanding with dilutive effects for the three and nine month periods ended
September 30, 2005, respectively.
NOTE 3 – ASSET ACQUISITIONS
During January 2005, the Company completed the purchase of two jackup drilling rigs, Rig 25 and Rig 30, for
$21,500,000 and $20,000,000, respectively. These purchases were partially funded by a $25,000,000 term loan
under the Lehman Credit Agreement (as defined in NOTE 5 below). In connection with this new term loan, the
Lehman Credit Agreement was amended in January 2005 to increase the amount of credit available to the
Company from $28,000,000 to $53,000,000 (see NOTE 5).
In June 2005, the Company purchased 17 liftboats from Superior Energy Services, Inc. for $19,725,000. One of
these liftboats was being held for sale and was sold in August 2005 (see NOTE 1). The transaction was funded
by an increase in the Company’s term loan under the Comerica Credit Agreement (as defined in NOTE 5),
which was amended to increase the amount of credit available to the Company under the term loan to
$47,000,000. In June 2005, the Company purchased a jackup rig, Rig 16, from Transocean, Inc. for $20,000,000.
A $2,000,000 refundable escrow account was funded by the Company in May 2005. The Company funded the
purchase price with proceeds from its new term loan under the Company’s senior secured credit agreement
(see NOTE 5).
In August 2005, the Company purchased the liftboat Whale Shark from CS Liftboats, Inc. for $12,500,000. The
Company funded the purchase with available cash.
In September 2005, the Company purchased Rig 31 from Hydrocarbon Capital II LLC for $12,600,000. The
Company funded the purchase with available cash.

Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. term loan
On July 30, 2004, Drilling entered into a credit agreement with Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (the “Lehman
Credit Agreement”) providing for a $28,000,000 term loan. On January 4, 2005, the Lehman Credit Agreement
was amended, providing for an additional $25,000,000 term loan, which increased the total amount
outstanding under the Lehman Credit Agreement to $53,000,000. The term loan bore interest at 12.5% per
annum with interest payable monthly. The term loan was repaid in full in June 2005.
Comerica Bank term loan
On October 1, 2004, Liftboats entered into a credit agreement with Comerica Bank providing for a $28,000,000
term loan and a $4,000,000 revolving credit line (the “Comerica Credit Agreement”). At December 31, 2004, the
entire balance of the term loan was outstanding and no amount was drawn on the revolving credit line. The
term loan and the revolving credit line bore interest at a prime rate determined by the agent to the Comerica
Credit Agreement plus a margin derived from the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA. The average interest rates
for the period ended December 31, 2004 were approximately 5.7 percent under the term loan and 6.1 percent
under the revolving credit line. The Comerica Credit Agreement was amended on June 1, 2005 to increase the
amount of credit available to Liftboats by $20,000,000, of which $19,725,000 was used to fund the Superior
liftboat acquisition (see NOTE 3). The term loan was repaid in full in June 2005.
Senior secured credit agreement
In June 2005, the Company entered into a senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial
institutions. This agreement provides for a $140,000,000 term loan and a $25,000,000 revolving credit facility.
The Company may seek commitments to increase the amount available under the credit agreement by an
additional $25,000,000 if the amount outstanding under the term loan is no more than $105,000,000 and the
Company’s leverage ratio, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional $25,000,000 of borrowings, is
no greater than 2.5 to 1.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The revolving credit facility provides for swing line loans of up to $2,500,000 and for the issuance of up to
$5,000,000 of letters of credit. The revolving loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the
Company, either (1) the highest of (a) Comerica Bank’s base rate, (b) the three-month certificate of deposit rate
plus 0.5% and (c) the Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, in each case plus 2.25%, or (2) LIBOR plus 3.25%.
The Company may repay the revolving loans at any time without premium or penalty. The revolving loans
mature in June 2008. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% on the average daily amount
of the unused commitment amount of the revolving credit facility and a letter of credit fee of 3.25%, plus a
fronting fee of 0.13% with respect to the undrawn amount of each issued letter of credit. As of September 30,
2005, no amounts were outstanding and no letters of credit had been issued under the revolving credit facility.
The term loan bears interest at a rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either (1) the highest of
(a) Comerica Bank’s base rate, (b) the three-month certificate of deposit rate plus 0.5% and (c) the Federal
funds effective rate plus 0.5%, in each case plus 2.25%, or (2) LIBOR plus 3.25%. Principal payments of
$350,000 are due quarterly, and the outstanding principal balance of the term loans is payable in full in June
2010. The Company may prepay the term loans at any time without premium or penalty, except that the
prepayments made during the first year with proceeds for debt issuance or in connection with a repricing of
the term loan will be made at 101% of the principal repaid. The Company is required to make prepayments on
the term loan in certain cases. As of September 30, 2005, the entire principal amount of the original
$140,000,000 term loan was outstanding and the interest rate was 6.82%. The Company used $45,000,000 of
the proceeds from its initial public offering in November 2005 to repay a portion of the outstanding principal
amount. See NOTE 9.
The credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage. Other covenants
contained in the agreement restrict, among other things, repurchases of equity interests, mergers, asset
dispositions, guaranties, debt, liens, acquisitions, dividends, distributions, investments, affiliate transactions,
prepayments of other debt and capital expenditures. Management believes that the Company is in compliance
in all material respects with its covenants under the credit agreement. The credit agreement contains
customary events of default.
Amounts outstanding under the Lehman Credit Agreement and Comerica Credit Agreement were repaid with
proceeds from the new senior secured term loan, and the Company terminated the credit agreements upon
the repayment. All unamortized deferred financing fees outstanding at December 31, 2004 were expensed in
conjunction with the refinancing of the Company’s long-term debt in June 2005, and the portion outstanding
as of the date of the refinancing is included in loss on early retirement of debt in the consolidated statements
of operations.
NOTE 6 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
In July 2005, the Company entered into several transactions to hedge its variable rate debt with the purpose
and effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding principal of the term loan. The Company
entered into two floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps on a total of $70,000,000 of the term loan principal under
which the Company receives an interest rate of three-month LIBOR and pays a fixed coupon over three years,
with the terms of the swaps matching those of the term loan. The Company also entered into two purchased
interest rate caps hedging interest payments made on a total of $20,000,000 of the term loan principal at a
strike price of 5.0% over three years. The counterparty is obligated to pay the Company in any quarter that
actual LIBOR resets above the strike price, with the terms of the caps matching those of the term loan. All
hedge transactions have payment dates of October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1. These hedging
arrangements effectively fix the interest rate on $70,000,000 of the principal amount at 7.54% for three years
and cap the interest rate on $20,000,000 of the principal amount at 8.25% for three years. These hedge
transactions are being accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended by SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (an amendment of FASB Statement no. 133)”, and SFAS No. 149,
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”. The cumulative net

gain on these hedging instruments was $321,504 at September 30, 2005 and is included in other assets and
accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2005. The
Company did not recognize a gain or loss due to hedge ineffectiveness in its consolidated statements of
operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 related to these hedging instruments.
NOTE 7 – SEGMENTS
The Company’s operations are aggregated into two reportable segments: (i) Contract Drilling Services and
(ii) Marine Services. The Contract Drilling Services segment consists of jackup rigs used in support of
offshore drilling activities. The Marine Services segment consists of liftboats used in offshore support
services. Accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described under “Nature of Business
and Significant Accounting Policies” in NOTE 1. The Company eliminates intersegment revenue and
expenses, if any.

NOTE 8 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits in the normal course of business. Management does
not believe any accruals are necessary in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”.
Insurance
The Company is self-insured for the deductible portion of its insurance coverage. Management believes
adequate accruals have been made on known and estimated exposures up to the deductible portion of the
Company’s insurance coverage. Management believes that claims and liabilities in excess of the amounts
accrued are adequately insured.
The Company maintains insurance coverage that includes physical damage, third party liability, maritime
employers liability, pollution and other coverage. The primary marine package provides for hull and
machinery coverage for the Company’s rigs and liftboats up to a scheduled value for each asset. Rig
coverages include a $1.0 million deductible per occurrence; liftboat deductibles vary from $150,000 to
$500,000 per occurrence, depending on the insured value of the particular vessel. There is no deductible in
the event of a total loss of the vessel. The protection and indemnity coverage under the primary marine
package has a $5.0 million limit per occurrence with excess liability up to $100.0 million. The primary marine
package also provides coverage for cargo and charterer’s legal liability. Vessel pollution is covered under a
Water Quality Insurance Syndicate policy. In addition to the marine package, the Company has separate
policies providing coverage for general domestic liability, employer’s liability, domestic auto liability and
non-owned aircraft liability, with customary deductibles and coverage. Insurance premiums under the
Company’s program are approximately $5.5 million for the twelve-month policy period ending July 31, 2006.
Recent Hurricanes
In August 2005, two of the Company’s jackup rigs, Rig 21 and Rig 25, sustained damage during Hurricane
Katrina. The Company believes that Rig 25 is likely to be declared a constructive total loss under its insurance
policies. If the rig is not declared a constructive total loss, the rig would require substantial repairs before
returning to work. The Company does not believe that it could complete such repairs prior to 2007. Salvage
efforts are still ongoing on Rig 25. Rig 21 suffered extensive damage to its mat as a result of the storm. The
rig is currently in drydock in a shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi undergoing repairs to a section of the
mat. The rig is expected be ready for service in the second quarter of 2006 and all repairs are expected to be
within insured values. As a result of the damage to Rig 21, the Company recognized a $1,000,000 loss in the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 representing its insurance deductible. The loss is included
in operating expenses for drilling services in the consolidated statements of operations.
NOTE 9 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Initial Public Offering
The Company completed its initial public offering of 10,580,000 shares of common stock at $20.00 per share
on November 1, 2005. The Company offered 6,250,000 shares of common stock, while the remaining 4,330,000
shares were offered by selling stockholders. The Company received approximately $115.1 million of proceeds
from the offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. The Company
used $44,000,000 of the proceeds to complete the acquisition of a fleet of liftboats from Danos & Curole
Marine Contractors, LLC (“Danos & Curole”), discussed below. In addition, the Company repaid $45,000,000
of the senior secured term loan plus accrued interest of $273,750, discussed below. The remaining proceeds
are being used for general corporate purposes, including refurbishment of and upgrades to Rig 16 and Rig 31.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Liftboat Acquisitions from Danos & Curole
In November 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of a fleet of liftboats and related assets from
Danos & Curole for $44,000,000. Three of these liftboats are located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and are
currently operating under short-term contracts. Four liftboats are currently operating in Nigeria. Danos &
Curole will continue to operate these four vessels under an operating agreement until the Company has
established its own operations in Nigeria. This operating agreement expires in September 2006 and can be
terminated earlier by the Company upon 30 days’ notice to Danos & Curole.
An additional liftboat subject to the purchase agreement, the Andre Danos, was damaged as a result of
Hurricane Katrina. Danos & Curole is currently salvaging the vessel. The Company has agreed to reimburse
Danos & Curole up to $500,000 of the salvage costs. Danos & Curole insured the Andre Danos for $3,600,000,
with a deductible of $1,500,000. Once the vessel is salvaged, Danos & Curole and its insurers will determine
whether the vessel is a constructive total loss or can be repaired. If the vessel is determined to be a
constructive total loss, a portion of the $44,000,000 purchase price equal to the amount of insurance proceeds
Danos & Curole recovers, net of the deductible, will be refunded by Danos & Curole to the Company. However,
if the vessel can be repaired, Danos & Curole will conduct the repairs until the insurance proceeds received
are completely expended, and will thereafter deliver the vessel to the Company in such condition without
additional payment of any consideration. The Company believes the liftboat is likely to be declared a
constructive total loss.
Senior Secured Term Loan Paydown
In November 2005, the Company repaid $45,000,000 of the principal amount outstanding under its senior
secured term loan. The Company paid $273,750 of accrued interest and expensed $1,291,921 of debt issuance
costs in connection with the repayment. The Company will record a loss from the early retirement of debt in
the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1,291,921.
Rig Sale Agreement
In November 2005, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Rig 41 for $3,443,750, net of
commissions. The buyer paid a $181,250 non-refundable deposit, and the Company expects the sale to close
in the first quarter of 2006. The Company expects to recognize a gain of approximately $1,400,000 on the sale
for the excess of the purchase price over the rig’s carrying value.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2005 and for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2005 and for the period from inception (July 27, 2004) to September 30, 2004 (“period from
inception to September 30, 2004”) included elsewhere herein. The following information contains forward-
looking statements. Please read “Forward-Looking Statements” below for a discussion of certain limitations
inherent in such statements.
OVERVIEW
We provide shallow-water drilling and liftboat services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production
industry primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We provide these services to major integrated energy companies
and independent oil and natural gas operators. We report our business activities in two business segments,
Contract Drilling Services and Marine Services:
•
•
Contract Drilling Services. We own a fleet of nine jackup rigs, eight of which are capable of drilling in
maximum water depths ranging from 85 to 250 feet. The other rig was severely damaged in Hurricane
Katrina as described below and is likely to be declared a constructive total loss under our insurance
policies. Under most of our contract drilling service agreements, we are paid a fixed daily rental rate
called a “dayrate,” and we are required to pay all costs associated with our own crews as well as the
upkeep and insurance of the rig and equipment.
Marine Services. We own a fleet of 46 liftboats with leg lengths ranging from 105 to 260 feet. Our
liftboats are used to provide a wide range of offshore support services, including platform maintenance,
platform construction, well intervention and decommissioning services, and can be moved from location
to location within a short period of time. Under most of our liftboat contracts, we are paid a fixed dayrate
for the rental of the vessel, which typically includes the costs of a small crew of four to eight employees,
and we also receive a variable rate for reimbursement of other operating costs such as catering, fuel,
rental equipment and other items.
Our revenues are affected primarily by dayrates, fleet utilization and the number and type of units in our fleet.
Utilization and dayrates, in turn, are influenced principally by the demand for rig and liftboat services from the
exploration and production sectors of the oil and natural gas industry. Our contracts in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico tend to be short-term in nature and are heavily influenced by changes in the supply of units relative to
the fluctuating expenditures for both drilling and production activity.
Our operating costs are primarily a function of fleet configuration and utilization levels. The most significant
direct operating costs for our Contract Drilling Services segment are wages paid to crews, maintenance and
repairs to the rigs, and marine insurance. These costs do not vary significantly whether the rig is operating
under contract or idle, unless we believe that the rig is unlikely to work for a prolonged period of time, in
which case we may decide to “cold-stack” the rig. Cold-stacking is a common term used to describe a rig that
is expected to be idle for a protracted period and typically for which routine maintenance is suspended and
the crews are either redeployed or laid-off. When a rig is cold-stacked, operating expenses for the rig are
reduced because the crew is smaller and maintenance activities are suspended. Rigs that have been cold-
stacked typically require a lengthy reactivation project that can involve significant expenditures, particularly if
the rig has been cold-stacked for a long period of time.
The most significant costs for our Marine Services segment are the wages paid to crews and regulatory
drydocking costs. Unlike our Contract Drilling Services segment, a significant portion of the expenses
incurred with operating each liftboat are paid for or reimbursed by the customer under contractual terms and
prices. This includes fuel, catering expenses, offshore communications and crane overtime. We record
reimbursements from customers as revenues and the related expenses as operating costs. Our liftboats are
required to undergo regulatory inspections every year and to be drydocked two out of every five years; the
drydocking expenses and time of drydock vary depending on the condition of the vessel. All costs associated
with regulatory inspections, including related drydocking costs, are deferred and amortized over 12 months.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Initial Public Offering
We completed our initial public offering of 10,580,000 shares of common stock at $20.00 per share on
November 1, 2005. We offered 6,250,000 shares of common stock, while the remaining 4,330,000 shares were
offered by selling stockholders. We received approximately $115.1 million of proceeds from the offering, net
of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses. We used $44.0 million of the proceeds
to complete the acquisition of a fleet of liftboats from Danos & Curole Marine Contractors, LLC (“Danos &
Curole”), discussed below. In addition, we repaid $45.0 million of the senior secured term loan plus accrued
interest of $0.3 million, discussed below. The remaining proceeds are being used for general corporate
purposes, including refurbishment of and upgrades to Rig 16 and Rig 31.
On November 1, 2005, in connection with our initial public offering, we converted from a limited liability
company to a corporation (the “Conversion”). Upon the Conversion, each outstanding membership unit of the
limited liability company was converted into 350 shares of common stock of the corporation. Prior to the
Conversion, we elected to be taxed as a partnership. As such, the members of our company were taxed on
their proportionate share of net income prior to the Conversion and no provision or liability for income taxes
is included in our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. When we became
a taxable entity in the Conversion, a provision of approximately $10.8 million was made reflecting the tax
effect of the difference between the book and tax basis of our assets and liabilities as of November 1, 2005, the
effective date of the Conversion.
Liftboat Acquisitions from Danos & Curole
In November 2005, we completed the acquisition of a fleet of liftboats and related assets from Danos & Curole
for $44.0 million. Three of these liftboats, which have leg lengths ranging from 130 to 230 feet, are located in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and are currently operating under short-term contracts.
Four liftboats, which have leg lengths ranging from 130 to 170 feet, are currently operating in Nigeria. Danos &
Curole will continue to operate these four vessels under an operating agreement until we have established our
own operations in Nigeria. This operating agreement expires in September 2006 and can be terminated by us
earlier upon 30 days’ notice to Danos & Curole.
An additional liftboat subject to the purchase agreement, the Andre Danos, was damaged as a result of
Hurricane Katrina. Danos & Curole is currently salvaging the vessel. We have agreed to reimburse Danos &
Curole up to $0.5 million of the salvage costs. Danos & Curole insured the Andre Danos for $3.6 million, with
a deductible of $1.5 million. Once the vessel is salvaged, Danos & Curole and its insurers will determine
whether the vessel is a constructive total loss or can be repaired. If the vessel is determined to be a
constructive total loss, a portion of the $44.0 million purchase price equal to the amount of insurance
proceeds Danos & Curole recovers, net of the deductible, will be refunded by Danos & Curole to us. However,
if the vessel can be repaired, Danos & Curole will conduct the repairs until the insurance proceeds received
are completely expended, and will thereafter deliver the vessel to us in such condition without additional
payment of any consideration. We believe the liftboat is likely to be declared a constructive total loss.
Senior Secured Term Loan Paydown
In November 2005, we repaid $45.0 million of the principal amount outstanding under our senior secured term
loan. We paid $0.3 million of accrued interest and expensed $1.3 million of debt issuance costs in connection
with the repayment. We will record a loss from the early retirement of debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 of $1.3
million.
Rig Sale Agreement
In November 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Rig 41 for $3.4 million, net of commissions.
The buyer paid a $0.2 million non-refundable deposit, and we expect the sale to close in the first quarter of
2006. We expect to recognize a gain of approximately $1.4 million on the sale for the excess of the purchase
price over the rig’s carrying value.

RECENT HURRICANES
18
Two of our jackup rigs, Rig 21 and Rig 25, sustained damage during Hurricane Katrina. After the storm, we
discovered Rig 25 submerged in approximately 15 feet of water. It appears from our preliminary examination
of the rig that its legs have been sheered off below the hull, its derrick has been destroyed and the electrical
power control systems have been irreparably damaged. Through our preliminary salvage efforts, we have
determined that the rig’s jacking systems have been damaged and that seawater has breached the watertight
areas of the hull and is likely to have damaged the rig’s mechanical systems. We believe that a complete
survey of the rig is likely to reveal that the total repair costs to the rig will exceed $40 million. This would
result in the rig being declared a constructive total loss under our insurance policies.
We have commenced the salvage and removal of Rig 25, the cost of which is covered by our insurance,
subject to a single deductible of $1.0 million. If Rig 25 is declared a constructive total loss, we would receive
the rig’s total insured value of $50.0 million, which would not be subject to a deductible. In this case, because
the insurance proceeds would exceed the carrying value of the rig, which was $20.8 million as of
September 30, 2005, we would recognize a gain equal to the excess. Under the terms of our senior secured
credit agreement, we would be required to either apply the proceeds to the acquisition of additional long-term
productive assets or reduce the outstanding principal amount of our term loan within one year of our receipt
of the insurance proceeds.
If Rig 25 is not declared a constructive total loss, based on our preliminary analysis of the damage to the rig
described above we believe that the rig would require substantial repairs before returning to work. We do not
believe that we could complete such repairs prior to 2007.
As a result of the damage to Rig 25, the contract for the rig with our customer was terminated as of August 30,
2005, and the contract revenue that we had been generating ceased on that date. Prior to termination, the rig
was contracted at a dayrate of approximately $41,000. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005,
Rig 25 operated a total of 235 days and contributed revenues of $9.8 million.
Rig 21 suffered extensive damage to its mat as a result of the storm. The rig is currently in drydock in a
shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi undergoing repairs to a section of its mat. We expect the rig to be
available for service in the second quarter of 2006. The cost of the repairs is covered by our insurance,
subject to a $1.0 million deductible. We accrued the $1.0 million insurance deductible in operating expenses
for drilling services during the third quarter of 2005. The completion of the repairs to Rig 21 could be delayed
if, among other things, the magnitude of the damage is greater than originally expected or the repairs are
delayed by supply shortages, shipyard unavailability, unforeseen engineering issues or adverse weather.
Rig 21 was working under a contract that provides for a force majeure dayrate that is slightly less than the
operating dayrate if operations were to cease as a result of a storm like Hurricane Katrina, but the term of the
force majeure period is not specified in the contract. The rig began to earn this rate when operations ceased
and the rig was evacuated in advance of the hurricane. We suspended the operation of the contract as of
September 14, 2005 and have recognized no additional revenues under the contract since that date. Rig 21 will
not earn any additional revenues until the time that we have completed the repairs and the rig is returned to
service. In addition, the customer may terminate the current contract for Rig 21, and we may be required to
market the rig to other parties in 2006 following the completion of the repairs. For the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2005, Rig 21 operated a total of 250 days and contributed revenues of $11.6 million.
We expect that the operating expenses for both Rig 25 and Rig 21 for the fourth quarter of 2005 will be reduced
as the rigs will not be operational during that period.
None of our rigs or liftboats sustained any material damage during Hurricane Rita in September 2005.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies are those that are important to our results of operations, financial condition and
cash flows and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts
would be reported under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the
preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q. We apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and
economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe
that our policies are generally consistent with those used by other companies in our industry.
We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest
assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant
accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We believe
that our more critical accounting policies include those related to property and equipment, revenue
recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred charges. Inherent in such policies are certain key
assumptions and estimates.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment represents 74.4% of our total assets as of September 30, 2005. Property and
equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures that substantially increase the
useful lives of our assets are capitalized and depreciated, while routine expenditures for maintenance items
are expensed as incurred, except for expenditures for drydocking our liftboats. Drydock costs are capitalized
at cost in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet and amortized on the straight-line
method (see “—Deferred Charges” below). Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
useful life of the asset, which we estimate to be 15 years for our rigs and liftboats. We review our property and
equipment for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of any asset may not be recoverable. For property and equipment, the determination of recoverability is made
based on the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets being reviewed. Any actual
impairment charge would be recorded using the estimated discounted value of future cash flows. Our
estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the application of our property and equipment accounting
policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and
operations. Using different estimates, assumptions and judgments, especially those involving the useful lives
of our rigs and liftboats and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations, would result in
different carrying values of assets and results of operations. For example, a prolonged downturn in the
drilling industry in which utilization and dayrates were significantly reduced could result in an impairment of
the carrying value of our jackup rigs.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are generated from our rigs and liftboats working under dayrate contracts as the services are
provided. Some of our contracts also allow us to recover additional direct costs, including mobilization and
demobilization costs, additional labor and additional catering costs. Under most of our liftboat contracts, we
receive a variable rate for reimbursement of costs such as catering, fuel, rental equipment and other items.
Revenue for the recovery or reimbursement of these costs is recognized when the costs are incurred except
for mobilization revenues, which are amortized over the related drilling contract.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable represents approximately 13.3% of our assets and 58.4% of our current assets as of
September 30, 2005. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable from our customers to identify any
collectability issues. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established when a review of customer accounts
indicates that a specific amount may not be collected. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based
on the actual amount we believe is not collectable. No allowance was deemed necessary at September 30,
2005.
Table of Contents
Deferred Charges
20
All of our liftboats are required to undergo regulatory inspections on an annual basis and to be drydocked
two out of every five years to ensure compliance with U.S. Coast Guard regulations for vessel safety and
vessel maintenance standards. Costs associated with these inspections, which generally involve setting the
vessels on a drydock, are deferred, and the costs are amortized over 12 months. As of September 30, 2005,
our net deferred charges related to regulatory inspection costs totaled $2.9 million. The amortization of the
regulatory inspection costs was reported as part of our depreciation and amortization expense.

(1) Utilization is defined as the total number of days our rigs or liftboats, as applicable, were under contract, known
as operating days, in the period as a percentage of the total number of available days in the period. Days during
which our rigs and liftboats are undergoing major refurbishments, upgrades or construction, which include Rig 16,
Rig 31 and the Whale Shark, or cold-stacked units, which include three of our liftboats, are not counted as
available days. Days during which our liftboats are in the shipyard undergoing drydocking or inspection are
considered available days for the purposes of calculating utilization.
(2) Average revenue per rig or liftboat per day is defined as revenue earned by our rigs or liftboats, as applicable, in
the period divided by the total number of operating days for our rigs or liftboats, as applicable, in the period.
(3) Average operating expense per rig or liftboat per day is defined as operating expenses, excluding depreciation
and amortization, incurred by our rigs or liftboats, as applicable, in the period divided by the total number of
available days in the period.
Includes a $1.0 million loss for accrual of the deductible for insurance proceeds to repair Rig 21 for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2005.

Table of Contents
Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2005 versus the Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2005
We have presented below a comparison of the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 to the three-
month period ended June 30, 2005 because we believe it provides the most meaningful comparative analysis
of our results of operations of recent periods and provides meaningful trend information over those periods.
We have not provided a comparison of the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 to the period from
inception to September 30, 2004. We do not believe such a comparison would be meaningful since our results
of operations for the period from inception to September 30, 2004 include only the results from five rigs for a
two-month period as compared with the results from nine rigs and 39 liftboats for a full three-month period in
the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
Revenues
Consolidated. Total revenues for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 (the “Current Quarter”)
were $42.2 million compared with $37.1 million for the three-month period ended June 30, 2005 (the “Prior
Quarter”), an increase of $5.1 million, or 14%. This increase resulted primarily from higher jackup dayrates
and additional operating days in our Marine Services segment, primarily due to the acquisition of the
Superior liftboats in June 2005. Total revenues included $1.3 million in reimbursements from our customers
for expenses paid by us in the Current Quarter compared with $0.9 million in the Prior Quarter.
Contract Drilling Services Segment. Revenues for our Contract Drilling Services segment were $28.2 million
for the Current Quarter compared with $26.3 million for the Prior Quarter, an increase of $1.9 million, or 7%.
This increase resulted primarily from higher average dayrates and utilization for our fleet partially offset by
reduced utilization on two of our rigs that sustained damage during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.
Average revenue per rig per day was $49,471 in the Current Quarter compared with $43,653 in the Prior
Quarter, with average utilization of 95.5% in the Current Quarter compared with 94.5% in the Prior Quarter.
Revenues for our Contract Drilling Services segment included $0.7 million in reimbursements from our
customers for expenses paid by us in the Current Quarter compared with $0.5 million in the Prior Quarter.
Marine Services Segment. Revenues for our Marine Services segment were $13.9 million for the Current
Quarter compared with $10.8 million in the Prior Quarter, an increase of $3.1 million, or 29%. This increase
resulted primarily from additional operating days in the Current Quarter, with 2,566 operating days in that
quarter compared with 1,766 operating days in the Prior Quarter. Approximately 660 of the additional
operating days were attributable to the Superior liftboats acquired in June 2005. Average revenue per liftboat
per day was $5,432 in the Current Quarter compared with $6,109 in the Prior Quarter, with average utilization
of 79.7% in the Current Quarter compared with 73.8% in the Prior Quarter. The average revenue per liftboat per
day was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita where we experienced 374 days of weather
resulting in half dayrates. Average revenue per liftboat per day was also negatively impacted by the Superior
liftboats acquired in June 2005, which are smaller and earned lower average dayrates than the remaining fleet.
The increase in average utilization was attributable to increased activity in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
and Hurricane Rita. Revenues for our Marine Services segment included $0.6 million in reimbursements from
our customers for expenses paid by us in the Current Quarter compared with $0.4 million in the Prior Quarter.
Operating Expenses
Consolidated. Total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the Current Quarter
were $21.8 million compared with $17.9 million in the Prior Quarter, an increase of $3.9 million, or 22%. This
increase resulted primarily from increased rig and liftboat operating expenses as described below.
Contract Drilling Services Segment. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for our
Contract Drilling Services segment were $14.0 million in the Current Quarter compared with $12.1 million in
the Prior Quarter, an increase of $1.9 million, or 16%. This increase resulted primarily from higher insurance
expense due to increasing insurance coverage on our jackup rig fleet and a $1.0 million deductible recorded
for damage sustained by one of our rigs during Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. We also incurred increased
maintenance costs due to increased activity on our rigs. Average operating expenses per rig per day were
$23,483 in the Current Quarter compared with $18,988 in the Prior Quarter.
Table of Contents
23
Marine Services Segment. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for our Marine
Services segment were $7.8 million for the Current Quarter compared with $5.8 million in the Prior Quarter, an
increase of $2.0 million, or 34%. This increase resulted from $2.0 million in additional expenses associated
with the Superior liftboats acquired in June 2005.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense in the Current Quarter was $3.8 million compared with $2.9 million in
the Prior Quarter, an increase of $0.9 million, or 31%. This increase resulted primarily from $0.5 million in
additional amortization of regulatory inspections and related drydockings and $0.3 million in depreciation
expense for the Superior liftboats acquired in June 2005 and the Whale Shark liftboat acquired in August 2005
in our Marine Services segment.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, in the Current Quarter were
$4.0 million compared with $2.9 million in the Prior Quarter, an increase of $1.1 million, or 38%. This increase
resulted primarily from $2.2 million in additional expenses for our corporate offices related to our initial
public offering partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in expense in our Contract Drilling Services
segment. The decrease in our Contract Drilling Services segment was due primarily to the collection of a bad
debt in the Current Quarter of $0.8 million. In addition, there was $0.3 million in bad debt expense in the Prior
Quarter.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the Current Quarter was $2.7 million compared with $2.5 million in the Prior Quarter, an
increase of $0.2 million, or 8%. This increase resulted from the increase in borrowings associated with the
$140.0 million term loan in June 2005, partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate on our overall
borrowings.
Other Income
Other income in the Current Quarter was $0.2 million compared with $0.1 million in the Prior Quarter, an
increase of $0.1 million. This increase is due primarily to higher cash balances resulting in increased interest
income.
Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2005
Revenues
Consolidated. Total revenues for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 were $113.3 million. Total
revenues were positively impacted by increasing jackup dayrates and additional operating days in our Marine
Services segment as a result of the Superior liftboat acquisition and higher activity levels following Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita. Total revenues included $3.7 million in reimbursements from our customers for
expenses paid by us.
Contract Drilling Services Segment. Revenues for our Contract Drilling Services segment were $79.4 million
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. Average revenue per rig per day was $44,552 and
average utilization was 96.4%. Revenues for our Contract Drilling Services segment included $2.0 million in
reimbursements from our customers for expenses paid by us.
Marine Services Segment. Revenues for our Marine Services segment were $33.9 million for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2005. Average revenue per liftboat per day was $5,859 and average utilization was
76.0%. Our fleet increased from 22 to 39 liftboats in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. Average
Table of Contents
24
revenue per liftboat per day was negatively impacted by the Superior liftboats acquired in June 2005, which
are smaller and earned lower average dayrates than the remaining fleet. Revenues for our Marine Services
segment included $1.7 million in reimbursements from our customers for expenses paid by us.
Operating Expenses
Consolidated. Total operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2005 were $55.6 million. Operating expenses in our Contract Drilling Services segment
were impacted by increasing labor costs attributable to wage increases paid to our crews, and increasing
insurance costs, including a $1.0 million deductible accrued for the repair of Rig 21. Operating expenses in
our Marine Services segment were impacted by expenses associated with the Superior liftboats acquired in
June 2005 and additional expenses due to higher utilization on the remaining fleet.
Contract Drilling Services Segment. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for our
Contract Drilling Services segment were $37.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005.
Average operating expenses per rig per day were $20,216. Average labor costs per rig per day, which include
wages and benefits paid to crews, were $10,802. Average rig maintenance expenses per rig per day, excluding
capitalized costs, were $2,936. Average insurance expense per rig was $1,756 per day. Other rig expenses,
which include catering, rentals, communications, and mobilization costs, averaged $4,722 per rig per day.
Marine Services Segment. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for our Marine
Services segment were $18.2 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. Operating
expenses on our liftboats averaged $2,395 per liftboat per day in the period, ranging from $1,181 per liftboat
per day for the smaller vessels to $3,509 per liftboat per day for the larger vessels. Average labor costs per
liftboat per day, which includes wages and benefits paid to crews, were $1,286. Average maintenance
expenses per liftboat per day, excluding capitalized costs, were $320. Average insurance expense per liftboat
per day was $200. Other operating expenses, which include catering, rentals and communication costs,
averaged $589 per liftboat per day.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Total depreciation and amortization expenses were $9.1 million for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2005. Results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 included $4.0 million of
depreciation expense for our drilling fleet, $3.0 million of depreciation expense for our liftboat fleet and $2.0
million of amortization of regulatory inspections and related drydockings.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $9.1 million for the nine-
month period ended September 30, 2005. Our Contract Drilling Services and Marine Services segments
incurred general and administrative expenses of $3.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively. General and
administrative expenses for our corporate office were $4.4 million. Expenses related to our initial public
offering totaling $2.2 million are included in our corporate general and administrative expense.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $7.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. Results for the period
included $2.0 million of interest expense associated with the $28.0 million in borrowings incurred in the
acquisition of five drilling rigs in August 2004, $1.0 million associated with the $28.0 million in borrowings
incurred in the acquisition of 22 liftboats in October 2004, $1.6 million associated with $25.0 million of
borrowings incurred in the acquisitions of Rig 25 and Rig 30 in January 2005, $0.1 million associated with the
$20.0 million in borrowings incurred in the acquisition of Superior liftboats in June 2005 and $2.9 million
associated with $140.0 million in borrowings incurred in refinancing our debt in June 2005.

inception to September 30, 2004. Total operating expenses included expenses in our Contract Drilling
Services segment for five jackup rigs beginning on August 2, 2004. Average operating expenses per rig were
$16,522 per day. Average labor costs per rig, which include wages and benefits paid to crews, were $9,402 per
day. Rig maintenance expenses per rig, excluding capitalized costs, were $2,083 per day. Average insurance
expense per rig was $1,014 per day. Other rig expenses, which included catering, rentals, communications,
and mobilization costs, averaged $4,023 per rig per day.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Total depreciation and amortization expenses were $0.4 million for the period from inception to
September 30, 2004.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $0.4 million for the
period from inception to September 30, 2004.
OUTLOOK
Our industry is cyclical and is typically driven by general economic activity and changes in actual or
anticipated oil and natural gas prices. In addition, most of our rigs and liftboats are located in the shallow
waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is a market characterized by short-term contracts for our rigs and
liftboats to support drilling and production primarily of natural gas. Throughout 2005, oil and natural gas
prices have been high relative to historical levels and, as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our
rigs and liftboats.
In addition to the favorable commodity price environment, two other factors have positively impacted the
market conditions for our rigs and liftboats. First, a number of jackup rigs have been mobilized out of the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico over the past five years, and several of our competitors have announced the mobilization
of a number of additional rigs from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to international locations in 2006. Second,
because of the significant damage to rigs, production platforms and pipelines in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, demand for our liftboats for inspection and repair work has increased
significantly compared to the beginning of 2005. We anticipate that the additional inspection and repair work
will continue into early 2006.
We believe that the current favorable market conditions will continue for at least the near term. However,
demand for our rigs and liftboats could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including among
others increases in the supply of rigs and liftboats in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, unexpected changes in oil and
natural gas prices, increases in insurance costs for both our assets and for our customers’ production assets,
the cost and availability of labor and regulatory changes.

According to ODS-Petrodata, as of November 30, 2005, there were 43 higher specification jackup rigs under
construction. We do not anticipate that these rigs will compete directly with our fleet, but may indirectly
impact us through competition in other markets. In addition, 11 idle jackups in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico owned
by our competitors have been cold stacked for all of 2005, and in some cases, several years earlier. We
believe that these idle jackup rigs will require extensive capital expenditures to refurbish and bring back into
service, but given the current tight market conditions, our competitors may begin reactivating at least some of
these rigs. There are also five liftboats under construction in the U.S. that are targeted for use in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico. Once delivered, these liftboats may impact the demand for our liftboat fleet.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources and Uses of Cash
Sources and Uses of Cash for the Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2005
Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 was $37.7
million, which was primarily attributable to net income of $29.6 million plus depreciation and amortization of
$9.1 million, an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $15.6 million and a $2.8 million
loss on the early retirement of debt, partially offset by a $19.4 million increase in accounts receivable and
other current assets. The increase in accounts receivable was due to increased revenue from higher average
dayrates for our Contract Drilling Services segment and the revenue from the Superior liftboats acquired in
June 2005.
Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 was $117.7 million.
The net cash investments during the period included the acquisition in January 2005 of Rig 25 and Rig 30 for
an aggregate of $41.5 million, the acquisitions in June 2005 of the Superior liftboats for an aggregate of $19.8
million and Rig 16 for $20.0 million, the acquisition in August 2005 of the Whale Shark liftboat for $12.5
million and the acquisition in September 2005 of Rig 31 for $12.6 million. The acquisition of Rig 25 was
funded in part by a $2.0 million deposit paid in 2004, which was applied towards the purchase price at
closing. Capital expenditures for our rigs and liftboats included $3.4 million for the refurbishment of Rig 16,
$4.6 million for drydockings of liftboats and $2.3 million for general rig refurbishments.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2005 totaled $82.3
million. This amount included borrowings of $45.0 under two of our credit facilities for the acquisitions of Rig
25 and Rig 30 and the Superior liftboats and $140.0 million under our new senior secured term loan. In
addition, we received contributions from owners totaling $4.3 million. We repaid $101.0 million outstanding
under our then-existing credit facilities with proceeds from our new term loan. We also paid $6.0 million in
fees and expenses in connection with our debt agreements.
Sources and Uses of Cash for the Period from Inception to September 30, 2004
Net cash used in operating activities for the period from inception to September 30, 2004 was $4.3 million,
which was primarily attributable to net income of $2.1 million plus depreciation and amortization of $0.4
million and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $4.0 million, offset by a $10.8
million increase in accounts receivable and other current assets. The increase in both current assets and
current liabilities were attributable to the start-up of our business activities.
Net cash used in investing activities for the period from inception to September 30, 2004 was $40.3 million.
The net cash investments during the period included the acquisition in August 2004 of five jackup rigs and
four platform rigs from Parker Drilling for $39.3 million.
Table of Contents
27
Net cash provided by financing activities for the period from inception to September 30, 2004 totaled $49.0
million. This amount included borrowings of $28.0 under our term loan and contributions from owners
totaling $22.0 million. We also paid $1.0 million in fees and expenses in connection with our debt
agreements.
Liquidity and Financing Arrangements
Contributions from owners and borrowings from our creditors represented our primary source of liquidity for
the period from inception through September 30, 2004. For the same period, our primary use of cash was the
acquisition of the jackup and platform rigs from Parker Drilling for $39.3 million. Contributions from owners,
borrowings from our creditors and cash from operations represented our primary sources of liquidity for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2005. For the same period, our primary uses of cash were the
acquisition of Rig 25 from Parker Drilling for $21.5 million, the acquisition of Rig 30 from Porterhouse
Offshore L.P. for $20.0 million, the acquisition of 17 liftboats from Superior Energy for $19.8 million, the
acquisition of Rig 16 from Transocean for $20.0 million, the acquisition of the Whale Shark from CS Liftboats,
Inc. for $12.5 million, and the acquisition of Rig 31 from Hydrocarbon Capital II LLC for $12.6 million.
We believe that our current cash on hand and our cash flow from operations for the period ending
September 30, 2006, together with availability under our revolving credit facility and insurance recoveries, will
be adequate during such period to repay our debts as they become due, to make normal recurring capital
additions and improvements, to meet working capital requirements, to refurbish Rig 16 and Rig 31, to repair
Rig 21 and, if it is not declared a constructive total loss, Rig 25 and otherwise to operate our business. Our
ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures in the future will
depend on our ability to generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our future cash flows may be insufficient
to meet all of our debt obligations and commitments, and any insufficiency could negatively impact our
business. To the extent we are unable to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due or at maturity with cash
on hand or from other sources, we will need to refinance our debt, sell assets or repay the debt with the
proceeds from further equity offerings. Additional indebtedness or equity financing may not be available to us
in the future for the refinancing or repayment of existing indebtedness, and we can provide no assurance as
to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that could be realized by us from any such asset sale.
Cash
Cash balances as of September 30, 2005 totaled $16.8 million. This represented an increase of $2.3 million
from the cash balances of $14.5 million as of December 31, 2004. The increase was due to aggregate
borrowings of $185.0 million under our various term loans, contributions from owners totaling $4.3 million
and cash flow generated from operations of $37.7 million. The amounts were partially offset by debt
repayments of $101.0 million and the acquisition of rigs and liftboats for a total of $115.6 million.
Debt
Our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations, and our revolving credit facility is a
source of liquidity. As of September 30, 2005, we had outstanding long-term debt of $140.0 million, including
current maturities of $1.4 million.
In June 2005, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. This
agreement provides for a $140.0 million term loan and a $25.0 million revolving credit facility. We may seek
commitments to increase the amount available under the credit agreement by an additional $25.0 million if the
amount outstanding under the term loan is no more than $105.0 million and our leverage ratio, after giving
effect to the incurrence of the additional $25.0 million of borrowings, is no greater than 2.5 to 1. We used
$54.6 million of the proceeds from the term loan to repay all outstanding amounts under the credit facility of
our drilling company subsidiary and $47.5 million of the proceeds to repay all outstanding amounts under the
credit facility of our liftboat company subsidiary, in each case including accrued interest, fees and applicable
prepayment premiums. We terminated both of those credit facilities in connection with the repayment. In
addition, we used $20.0 million of the remaining proceeds from the term loan to fund the purchase price of
Rig 16. In connection with the repayment of the two credit facilities, we recognized in the second quarter of
2005 pretax charges of $2.8 million, consisting of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of deferred financing
costs related to the retired debt.

The revolving credit facility provides for swing line loans of up to $2.5 million and for the issuance of up to
$5.0 million of letters of credit. The revolving loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the
highest of (a) Comerica Bank’s base rate, (b) the three-month certificate of deposit rate plus 0.5% and (c) the
Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, in each case plus 2.25%, or (2) LIBOR plus 3.25%. We may prepay the
revolving loans at any time without premium or penalty. The revolving loans mature in June 2008. We are
required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50% on the average daily amount of the unused commitment amount of
the revolving credit facility and a letter of credit fee of 3.25%, plus a fronting fee of 0.13%, with respect to the
undrawn amount of each issued letter of credit. As of September 30, 2005, no amounts were outstanding and
no letters of credit had been issued under the revolving credit facility.
The term loan bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (1) the highest of (a) Comerica Bank’s base
rate, (b) the three-month certificate of deposit rate plus 0.5% and (c) the Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%,
in each case plus 2.25%, or (2) LIBOR plus 3.25%. As of September 30, 2005, the entire principal amount of
the $140.0 million term loan was outstanding, and the interest rate was 6.58%. In accordance with the credit
agreement, in July 2005, we entered into hedge transactions with the purpose and effect of fixing the interest
rate on $70.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan at 7.54% for three years. In addition,
we entered into hedge transactions with the purpose and effect capping the interest rate on an additional $20.0
million of such principal amount at 8.25% for three years. Principal payments of $350,000 are due quarterly,
and the outstanding principal balance of the term loan is payable in full in June 2010. We may prepay the term
loan at any time without premium or penalty, except that prepayments made during the first year with
proceeds from debt issuances or in connection with a repricing of the term loan will be made at 101% of the
principal repaid.
We are required to prepay the term loan with:
•  the proceeds from sales of certain assets;
•  the proceeds from casualties or condemnations of assets to the extent that the net cash proceeds from any
such casualty or condemnation exceed $1.0 million and are not reinvested within one year;
•  the net proceeds of certain debt for borrowed money;
•  25% of the net proceeds of any public or private offering of our equity securities, provided that holders of the
term loan may reject the mandatory prepayment; and
•  50% of excess cash flow if either our leverage ratio is above 3.0 to 1.0 or the outstanding principal balance of
the term loan is greater than $110.0 million.
We repaid $45.0 million of the outstanding amount under the term loan, together with the accrued and unpaid
interest of $0.3 million, with proceeds from our initial public offering.
Our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by our liftboats, rigs and substantially all of our other
personal property, including the equity of our subsidiaries. All of our material subsidiaries guarantee our
obligations under the agreement and have granted similar liens on substantially all of their assets.
The credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to leverage and interest coverage. Other covenants
contained in the agreement restrict, among other things, repurchases of equity interests, mergers, asset
dispositions, guaranties, debt, liens, acquisitions, dividends, distributions, investments, affiliate transactions,
prepayments of other debt and capital expenditures. We are currently in compliance with our covenants under
the credit agreement. The credit agreement contains customary events of default.

Capital Expenditures
29
We expect to spend approximately $7.5 million to upgrade Rig 16 and expect to complete the upgrade in the
first quarter of 2006. The commissioning of the Whale Shark is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
of 2005 for total expenditures of $0.5 million. We expect to spend approximately $15.0 million to refurbish and
upgrade Rig 31 and to complete the project by the third quarter of 2006. Additionally, we expect the cost to
repair Rig 21 to be within insured values.
Over the remainder of 2005 and in 2006, we will continue to incur expenditures to upgrade and refurbish our
rigs and our liftboats. In addition, we are required to inspect and drydock our liftboats on a periodic basis to
meet U.S. Coast Guard requirements. Through the first nine months of 2005, we spent approximately $5.7
million on rig refurbishments and $4.6 million on liftboat drydockings. We expect these amounts to increase
as we acquire additional rigs and liftboats and as our fleet ages. The amount of expenditures is impacted by a
number of factors, including among others our ongoing maintenance expenditures, adverse weather, changes
in regulatory requirements and operating conditions. In addition, from time to time we agree to perform
modifications to our rigs and liftboats as part of a contract with a customer. When market conditions allow,
we attempt to recover these costs as part of the contract cash flow.
The timing and amounts we actually spend in connection with our plans to upgrade and refurbish other
selected rigs and liftboats are subject to our discretion and will depend on our view of market conditions and
our cash flows. From time to time, we may review possible acquisitions of rigs, liftboats or businesses, joint
ventures, mergers or other business combinations, and we may have outstanding from time to time bids to
acquire certain assets from other companies. We may not, however, be successful in our acquisition efforts. If
we do complete any such acquisitions, we may make significant capital commitments for such purposes. Any
such transactions could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash. We would likely fund the
cash portion of such transactions, if any, through cash balances on hand, the incurrence of additional debt,
sales of assets, equity interests or other securities or a combination thereof. If we acquire additional assets,
we would expect that the ongoing capital expenditures for our company as a whole would increase in order to
maintain our equipment in a competitive condition.
Our ability to fund capital expenditures would be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate in our business,
we experience poor results in our operations or we fail to meet covenants under our senior secured credit
facility.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other
than statements of historical fact, included in this quarterly report that address activities, events or
developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking
statements. These include such matters as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
our ability to enter into new contracts for our rigs and liftboats and future utilization rates for the units;
expected useful lives of our rigs and liftboats;
our plans regarding increased international operations;
future capital expenditures and refurbishment and repair costs;
expected repair time for Rig 21 and declaration of Rig 25 as a constructive total loss;
expected time to complete the refurbishment of Rig 16 and Rig 31 and the commissioning of the Whale
Shark;
sufficiency of funds for required capital expenditures, working capital and debt service;
liabilities under laws and regulations protecting the environment;
expected outcomes of litigation, claims and disputes and their expected effects on our financial condition

expectations regarding improvements in offshore drilling activity, demand for our rigs and liftboats,
inspection and repair work for our liftboats, operating revenues, operating and maintenance expense,
insurance expense and deductibles, interest expense, debt levels and other matters with regard to
outlook.
We have based these statements on our assumptions and analyses in light of our experience and perception
of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are
appropriate in the circumstances. Forward-looking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and
uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results, and actual future results could differ materially
from those described in such statements. Although it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to
face many risks and uncertainties. Among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially
are the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our prospectus dated October 26, 2005
related to our initial public offering, which was filed with the SEC on October 27, 2005, and the following:
•
•
•
•
oil and natural gas prices and industry expectations about future prices;
demand for offshore jackup rigs and liftboats;
our ability to enter into and the terms of future contracts;
uncertainties relating to the extent of the damage to Rig 21 and Rig 25 and the other rigs and liftboats in
our fleet;

our inability to achieve our plans or carry out our strategy.
Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Any of these factors, or a combination of
these factors, could materially affect our future financial condition or results of operations and the ultimate
accuracy of the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our
future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected
in the forward-looking statements. Management cautions against putting undue reliance on forward-looking
statements or projecting any future results based on such statements or present or prior earnings levels. In
addition, each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement, and we
undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate debt. All of the debt under our term loan
is at variable rates. As of September 30, 2005, the interest rate for the $140.0 million outstanding under the
term loan was 6.82%. In accordance with the credit agreement, in July 2005, we entered into hedge
transactions with the purpose and effect of fixing the interest rate on $70.0 million of the outstanding principal
amount of the term loan at 7.54% for three years. In addition, we entered into hedge transactions with the
purpose and effect of capping the interest rate on an additional $20.0 million of such principal amount at
8.25% for three years. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate
debt outstanding as of September 30, 2005 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $1.4
million.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of
the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In the course of this evaluation, management
considered certain internal control areas in which we have made and are continuing to make changes to
improve and enhance controls. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and President and our
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective, in all material
respects, with respect to the recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, within the time periods
specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, for information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Prior to the closing of our initial public offering, on November 1, 2005, we converted from a Delaware limited
liability company into a Delaware corporation. At the time of the Conversion, our 68,351 outstanding
membership interests were automatically converted into a total of 23,922,850 shares of common stock, on the
basis of a conversion ratio of 350 shares of common stock for each membership interest. The issuance of
common stock to our members in the Conversion was exempt from registration under the Securities Act by
virtue of the exemption provided under Section 3(a)(9) thereof as the common stock was exchanged by us
with our existing security holders exclusively where no commission or other remuneration was paid or given
directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange. The issuance of common stock was also exempt from
registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(2) thereof as a transaction not involving a public
offering.
On November 1, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of 10,580,000 shares of our common stock at
an initial offering price of $20.00 per share. Each share of common stock includes a right to purchase Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock under the Rights Agreement dated as of October 31, 2005 between us
and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent. We sold 6,250,000 shares of common stock at
an aggregate offering price of $125.0 million, while selling stockholders sold the remaining 4,330,000 shares
at an aggregate offering price of $86.6 million. The offering commenced on October 27, 2005 pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-126457; the “Registration Statement”) that the SEC
declared effective on October 26, 2005. Credit Suisse First Boston LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
served as joint bookrunning managers of the offering. Simmons & Company International, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Howard Weil Incorporated served as co-managers. We registered under the Registration
Statement the offering of a number of shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of
$211,600,000.
The net proceeds to us from the offering, after payment by us of $8.8 million in underwriting discounts and
commissions and $1.2 million in estimated offering expenses, were approximately $115.1 million. No offering
expenses were paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors, officers or their associates, persons owning
ten percent or more of any class of our equity securities or any other affiliates of our company. We used $45.3
million of the net proceeds to repay $45.0 million outstanding principal amount of our senior secured term
loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the repayment date of $0.3 million, and $44.0 million to
complete the acquisition of a fleet of liftboats and related assets from Danos & Curole Marine Contractors,
LLC. We also have used approximately $1.8 million of the net proceeds from November 1, 2005 to
November 30, 2005 for the refurbishment of Rig 16 and Rig 31. No net offering proceeds received by us have
been paid directly or indirectly to any of our directors, officers or their associates, persons owning ten
percent or more of any class of our equity securities or any other affiliates of our company. The remaining
proceeds remain invested in Eurodollar overnight deposits pending application of the funds to general
corporate purposes. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by
selling stockholders.
ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION.
