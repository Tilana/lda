international humanitarian law that constitute crimes with a fair, equitable, independent and 
impartial judicial process through which these violations can be investigated and made public in 
accordance with international standards of justice, fairness and due process of law, and to 
encourage victims to participate in judicial as well as truth and reconciliation processes, 
including by taking appropriate measures to ensure the protection of, and support and assistance 
to, victims as well as witnesses, such as contact points and child- and gender-sensitive 
procedures, paying special attention to crimes of sexual violence,

Human Rights to strengthen its capacity and expertise to provide support for international 
commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, and encourages continued endeavours as the 
Office seeks to play an effective and much stronger protection role at the country level. 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner for Human Rights to ensure the wide 
dissemination of the updated Set of Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights 
through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/2005/102 and Add.1), and to continue to support 
judicial mechanisms and commissions of inquiry, and to provide, upon request, technical and 
legal assistance in developing national legislation and institutions to combat impunity in 
accordance with international standards of justice, fairness and due process of law.
