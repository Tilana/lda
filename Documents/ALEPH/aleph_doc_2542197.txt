Item 4.02(a) Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit
Report or Completed Interim Review (September 30, 2013 10-Q).
On November 17, 2014, HK Battery Technology Inc. (the "Company"), after consultation with the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the previously issued
unaudited quarterly financial statements as of and for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, as
presented  in  the  Company's  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  filed  with  the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  for  the  same  period  (the  "September  30,  2013  10-Q")(SEC
Accession No. 0001078782-13-002311), should no longer be relied upon. The Company will file
an amendment to the September 30, 2013 10-Q on Form 10-Q/A (the "Amendment") restating its
financial statements for this period.
The following discussion describes the adjustments to be made in the Amendment:
During  the  Company’s  closing  process  for  the  period  ended  September  30,  2014,  accounting
errors  were  discovered  that  required  restatement  of  amounts  previously  reported  in  the
September 30, 2013 10-Q, related to a $4,000,000 loan from Lianyungang Hybrid Kinetic New
Energy Co., Ltd. It was discovered that the Company did not record the loan payable amount as
of  September  30,  2013.  This  caused  the  financial  statements  contained  in  the  September  30,
2013  10-Q  to  understate  cash  and  total  liabilities.  The  loan  was  properly  reflected  in  the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012
and the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2014 and
June 30, 2014.
