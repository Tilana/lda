<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Spain was held at the 5th meeting, on 5 May 2010. The delegation of Spain 
was headed by the Secretary of State for Constitutional and Parliamentarian Affairs, Jos&#233; de 
Francisco. At its 9th meeting, held on 7 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the report 
on Spain. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Spain: Chile, India and South Africa. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Spain: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/ESP/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Spain through the troika. Those questions 
are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Spain acknowledged that the preparation of the national report had 
allowed the Government to identify areas for improvement, raise awareness of pending 
issues and compare Spain&#8217;s experience with those of other United Nations Member States. 
It felt persuaded that the conclusions would be useful for the improvement of existing 
protection mechanisms.   
</p>
<p>6. Its recent history has caused Spain to closely link the protection and development of 
human rights to the strengthening of democracy.  Fundamental rights are a core element of 
the rule of law. For the current Administration, the promotion of human rights is a political 
priority. That commitment is apparent at the international and national levels, as well as in 
legislative and public policy initiatives. It is also reflected in the Government&#8217;s 
establishment of the Ministry for Equality, which is entrusted with, among other 
responsibilities, the eradication of discrimination and gender-based violence.   
</p>
<p>7. At the international level, Spain has ratified most international and regional human 
rights treaties, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (2006), 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto 
(2007) and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance (2009). Currently, Congress is acting to authorize the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  </p>


<p>8. There have also been important improvements in domestic legislation, such as the 
recent adoption of several legal instruments, including the law against gender violence 
(2004), the reform of the Civil Code to permit same-sex marriage (2005), the organic law 
for effective gender equality (2007) and the law on personal autonomy and attention to 
persons in a dependency situation (2006).  
</p>
<p>9. Regarding human rights policies, the delegation highlighted the adoption of the 
Human Rights Plan of 2008, which is based on equality, non-discrimination and 
integration, and includes human rights guarantees.  Additionally, a follow-up commission 
has been established.   
</p>
<p>10. Spain&#8217;s commitment to the Millennium Development Goals is reflected in the ever-
increasing percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to development 
cooperation.  This year, Spanish cooperation should reach 0.51 per cent of GDP, and the 
Government remains committed to achieving the goal of 0.7 per cent of GDP. The 
delegation stressed that Spain is aware of the importance of the work of the Human Rights 
Council to consolidate and promote human rights, and referred to the country&#8217;s contribution 
to the Office of the High Commissioner.   
</p>
<p>11. Immigrants constitute 10 per cent of the Spanish population. Spain is unequivocally 
committed to formulating a body of public policy on integration based on an intercultural 
model and dialogue among cultures.  
</p>
<p>12. Spain&#8217;s presidency of the European Union (EU) has prompted actions to further 
involve EU institutions in the promotion of human rights. Thus, Spain is striving to achieve 
EU ratification of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms.    
</p>
<p>13. The delegation indicated that Spain is the European State that has suffered most 
from terrorism to date. Spain has never renounced the rule of law or international law in its 
response to terrorist acts.   
</p>
<p>14. Concerning the preparation of the report, the role of civil society was acknowledged 
by the delegation. The inclusion of economic, social and cultural rights issues was only one 
example of the positive input from civil society representatives.   
</p>
<p>15. Since the issuance of the national report, there have been a number of noteworthy 
developments that assist in gaining an up-to-date perspective on the human rights situation. 
In March 2010, the Official Bulletin published two instruments of ratification.  The first 
one related to the Convention on Cluster Munitions (March 19), and the second pertained to 
Protocol No. 13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances. Furthermore, 
on 24 March in Geneva, the President launched an initiative to establish an international 
commission against capital punishment. In addition, on 30 March, the Government adopted 
a report on the measures necessary to bring Spanish legislation into line with the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. 
The Organic Law on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Voluntary Pregnancy 
Interruption was also adopted in March 2010.   
</p>
<p>16. Before concluding its introductory statement, the delegation mentioned the fact that, 
on 29 January, the current Administration had adopted the Programme for the Resettlement 
of Refugees for 2010 and that the national mechanism for preventing torture had been put 
in place. Following the EU pattern, the Ombudsman will be entrusted with that 
responsibility. </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

African countries did not include sufficient human rights guarantees. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Sweden raised questions about measures taken to reinforce the implementation of 
existing legislation to combat domestic violence, and about measures whereby it would 
implement legislation granting refugee status on the basis of mistreatment based on gender </p>


<p>or sexual orientation, in order to address concerns that that legislation might have adverse 
effects in terms of limiting individuals&#8217; right to apply for asylum.

incommunicado detention, as recommended by several international mechanisms. Slovenia 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>67. Paraguay welcomed Spain&#8217;s cooperation with international monitoring bodies in the 
European and United Nations systems. It also stated that the Human Rights Plan 2008-2012 
had provided for the establishment of a commission to follow up the Plan and the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993. It emphasized that any internal immigration 
policy needed to specifically consider the rights of migrants. Paraguay made a 
recommendation.

violence against migrants and persons of different ethnic or religious backgrounds, as well 
as the untimely and inadequate response of authorities. Azerbaijan made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>73. Italy raised questions about the achievements and challenges in the field of 
promoting human rights education and, given the unemployment rate, about how a balance 
could be achieved between reducing public expenditure and ensuring the protection of 
economic and social rights. It noted that, notwithstanding the efforts made to combat 
gender violence, the phenomenon had not been eradicated. Italy made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>74. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya stated that the establishment of an Ombudsman was 
insufficient in itself, and therefore that a national human rights institute should be 
established in accordance with the Paris Principles. It indicated that foreigners were not 
guaranteed the right to practice their religious beliefs. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
requested information about the implementation of the recommendations of the national 
institution established to combat racism and xenophobia.   
</p>
<p>75. Burkina Faso praised the effort made by Spain during its presidency of the European 
Union to achieve a global moratorium on the execution of the death penalty by 2015, as 
well as the country&#8217;s efforts to achieve recognition of the human right to water. It 
mentioned efforts aimed at asylum and refugee policy, integration policy, combating racism 
and xenophobia, and promoting the rights of foreigners. Burkina Faso made a 
recommendation.

<p>76. Guatemala welcomed the establishment of the Forum for the Social Integration of 
Migrants and Spain&#8217;s commitment to promoting a public policy aimed at combating racism 
and xenophobia. It encouraged Spain to share results achieved in combating discriminatory 
incidents against migrants, as well as best practices related to the fight against human 
trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Guatemala made a recommendation.

<p>77. Japan stated that the high unemployment rate for migrant workers could lead to 
other problems. It noted the strategic plan for citizenship and the integration of migrant

reports referred to the disadvantaged position of women in society and violence against 
women, and made a recommendation in that regard.   
</p>
<p>78. Jordan commended Spain for its efforts in promoting understanding and tolerance 
among cultures through the Alliance of Civilizations. It noted Spain&#8217;s achievements in 
adopting a legislative and institutional framework for the promotion of human rights; the

emerging rights, which had contributed to the development of international law. Jordan 
made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>79. The delegation of Spain proceeded to respond to specific questions that had been 
raised.  Concerning the issue of migrant affairs, it elaborated on the current legal and 
institutional framework.  Specifically, it explained that the Law 2/2009 had broadened the 
scope of the rights recognized for migrant workers.   
</p>
<p>80. Moreover, the human rights plan of action had incorporated a comprehensive 
strategy for combating racism and xenophobia, including data collection and assistance 
networks for supporting victims.   
</p>
<p>81. The delegation stated that equal opportunity policies comprised the categories of 
gender-based violence, equal opportunity for men and women, and non-discrimination </p>


<p>based on other grounds.  The Government was committed to submitting a bill to Congress 
in that regard. With regard to gender-based violence, the delegation explained that Spain 
had adopted an organic law providing for an institutional mechanism and an observatory to 
monitor implementation. It was worth noting that the number of victims had dropped by 8 
per cent since the law had entered into force. The legislation also provided for special 
attention to migrant women, and the law on the rights of foreigners had been amended to 
include the possibility of ending expulsion procedures for women victims of gender-based 
violence and enabling them to apply for residence and work permits.  
</p>
<p>82. Regarding the rights of foreigners, the delegation further clarified that, as a result of 
the adoption of Law 4/2000 and the amendments thereto, the rights enjoyed by foreigners 
were nearly the same as those enjoyed by Spanish citizens, except for political rights. 
However, some bilateral agreements with third countries provided foreigners with the right 
to vote at the local level.  
</p>
<p>83. In concluding, the delegation recalled that it had extended a standing invitation to all 
special procedures of the Council and paid homage to the victims of terrorism.
