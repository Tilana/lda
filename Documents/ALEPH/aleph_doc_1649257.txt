FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This annual report on Form 20-F contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not based on historical facts and reflect our expectations for future events and results. Most facts are 
uncertain because of their nature. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “predicts,” 
“prognosticate,” “project,” “target,” “achieve” and “intend,” among other similar expressions, are understood as forward-looking statements. These factors may 
include the following:
•
drilling and exploration activities;
•
•
•
•
•
future production rates;
import and export activities;
liquidity, cash flow and uses of cash flow;
projected capital expenditures;
dates by which certain areas will be developed or will come on-stream; and
allocation of capital expenditures to exploration and production activities.
•
  
Actual results are subject to certain factors out of the control of the Company and may differ materially from the anticipated results. These factors may
include the following:
•
changes in international crude oil and natural gas prices;
•
•
•
competition;
limitations on our access to sources of financing;
significant political, economic and social developments in Colombia and other countries where we do business;
• military operations, terrorist acts, wars or embargoes;
•
•
•
regulatory developments, including regulations related to climate change;
natural disasters;
technical difficulties; and
other factors discussed in this document as “Risk Factors.”
•
  
Most of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially from
projected results. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report.
ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES
We are a Colombian company, all of our Directors and executive officers and some of the experts named in this annual report reside outside the United
States.  All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for 
you to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce against us or them judgments in U.S. courts obtained in such 
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.  Colombian courts will determine whether to enforce a U.S. judgment 
predicated on the U.S. securities laws through a proceeding known as exequatur. The Colombian Supreme Court will enforce a foreign judgment, without 
reconsideration of the merits only if the judgment satisfies the following requirements:
1
•
•
•
•
•
•
a treaty exists between Colombia and the country where the judgment was granted or there is reciprocity in the recognition of foreign judgments 
between the courts of the relevant jurisdiction and the courts of Colombia;
the foreign judgment does not relate to “in rem rights” vested in assets that were located in Colombia at the time the suit was filed and does not 
contravene or conflict with Colombian laws relating to public order other than those governing judicial procedures;
the foreign judgment, in accordance with the laws of the country where it was rendered, is final and is not subject to appeal and a duly certified 
and authenticated copy of the judgment has been presented to a competent court in Colombia;
the foreign judgment does not refer to any matter upon which Colombian courts have exclusive jurisdiction;
no proceeding is pending in Colombia with respect to the same cause of action, and no final judgment has been awarded in any proceeding in 
Colombia on the same subject matter and between the same parties; and
in the proceeding commenced in the foreign court that issued the judgment, the defendant is served in accordance with the laws of such 
jurisdiction and in a manner reasonably designated to give the defendant an opportunity to defend against the action.
The United States and Colombia do not have a bilateral treaty providing for automatic reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and 
commercial matters. The Colombian Supreme Court has in the past accepted that reciprocity exists when it has been proven that either a U.S. court has enforced 
a Colombian judgment or that a U.S. court would enforce a foreign judgment, including a judgment issued by a Colombian court. However, such enforceability 
decisions are considered by Colombian courts on a case-by-case basis.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Ecopetrol,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or the “Corporate Group” are used in this annual
PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION
report to refer to Ecopetrol S.A. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
In this annual report, references to “US$” or “U.S. dollars” are to United States dollars and references to “Ps$,” “Peso” or “Pesos” are to Colombian
Pesos, the functional currency under which we prepare our financial statements. Certain figures shown in this annual report have been subject to rounding 
adjustments and, accordingly, certain totals may therefore not precisely equal the sum of the numbers presented. In this annual report a billion is equal to one 
with nine zeros.
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles for Colombian state-owned entities issued by the
Colombian National Accounting Office (Contaduría General de la Nación), or CGN, and other applicable legal provisions.
Our consolidated financial statements at and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the selected financial data at and for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 have been prepared under Public Accounting Regime (Régimen de Contabilidad Pública), or RCP, as 
adopted by the CGN in September, 2007 and applicable to Ecopetrol beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 1 to our consolidated 
financial statements. We refer to RCP as Colombian Government Entity GAAP. Colombian Government Entity GAAP differs in certain significant respects 
from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual 
report provides a description of the principal differences between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP as they relate to our audited 
consolidated financial statements and provides a reconciliation of net income and shareholders’ equity for the years and dates indicated therein. As a state-
owned company, our consolidated financial statements are periodically reviewed by the CGN. However, the review of our accounts by the CGN does not 
constitute an audit.
The accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of Ecopetrol and our consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010 have been prepared from accounting records, which are maintained under the historical cost convention as modified in 1992, to comply with the 
legal provisions of the CGN.
2
Certain line items from our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 related to the presentation of the consolidated Balance
Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Financial, Economic, Social and Environmental Activities have been reclassified in order to make the presentation of 
such financial statements comparable to that of the financial statements as of December 31, 2012. The main reclassifications were under cost of sales, marketing 
and projects, accounts payable and related parties, Taxes, contributions and duties payable, Deposits held in trust and Other assets. See Note 34 to our 
consolidated financial statements for a description of the principal differences.
Our consolidated financial statements were consolidated line by line and all transactions and significant balances between affiliates have been
eliminated. These financial statements include the financial results of the following companies:

This annual report translates certain Peso amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise
indicated, such Peso amounts have been translated at the rate of Ps$1,768.23 per US$1.00, which corresponds to the Tasa Representativa del Mercado, or 
Representative Market Exchange Rate, for December 31, 2012. The Representative Market Exchange Rate is computed and certified by the Superintendencia 
Financiera, or Superintendency of Finance, the Colombian banking and securities regulator, on a daily basis and represents the weighted average of the buy and 
sell foreign exchange rates negotiated on the previous day by financial institutions authorized to engage in foreign exchange transactions. The Superintendency 
of Finance also calculates the Representative Market Exchange Rate for each month for purposes of preparing financial statements and converting amounts in 
foreign currency to Pesos. Such conversion should not be construed as a representation that the Peso amounts correspond to, or have been or could be converted 
into, U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate. On April 26, 2013, the Representative Market Exchange Rate was Ps$1,830.84 per US$1.00.

PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING RESERVES
The estimates of our proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas included in this annual report have been calculated according to the technical
definitions required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  Our hydrocarbon net proved reserves have been audited in 2012 by Ryder Scott 
Company L.P., DeGolyer and MacNaughton and Gaffney, Cline & Associates Inc., which we refer to collectively as the External Engineers, and their reserves 
reports are included as exhibits herein. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. See “Item 4.  Information on the Company—Overview by 
Business Segment—Exploration and Production—Reserves” for additional information on our reserves estimates.
The following table sets forth the percentage of our estimated net proved reserves audited by External Engineers and the percentage calculated
internally for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are based on the SEC average 
price methodology for purposes of both Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP.  See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks related to 
our business” for a description of the risks’ relating to our reserves and our reserve estimates.

RISK FACTORS
Risks related to our business 
  
Our crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty and may prove to be incorrect over time, which could adversely affect 
our ability to generate revenue.
Reserves estimates are prepared using generally accepted geological and engineering evaluation methods and procedures. Estimates are based on
geological, topographic and engineering facts. Actual reserves and production may vary materially from estimates shown in this annual report, and downward 
revisions in our reserve estimates could lead to lower future production which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
  
Our business depends substantially on international prices for crude oil and refined products, and prices for these products are volatile. A sharp decrease in 
such prices could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.
As of December 2012, nearly 96% of our revenues came from sales of crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Most prices for products developed
and sold by us are quoted in U.S. dollars and consequently, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Peso exchange rate have a direct effect on our Peso-denominated 
financial statements.
8
Crude oil prices have traditionally fluctuated as a result of a variety of factors including, among others, the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
competition within the oil and natural gas industry;
changes in international prices of natural gas and refined products;
long-term changes in the demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products;
regulatory changes;
inventory levels;
increase in the cost of capital;
adverse economic conditions;
global or regional financial crises, such as the global financial crisis of 2008;
development of new technologies;
global and regional economic and political developments in oil producing regions, particularly in the Middle East;
the willingness and ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and its members to set production levels and 
prices;
local and global demand and supply for crude oil, oil products and natural gas;
trading activity in oil and natural gas and transactions in derivative financial instruments related to oil and gas;
development or availability of alternative fuels;
• weather conditions;
•
•
natural events or disasters; and
terrorism and armed conflict.
A significant and sustained decrease in crude oil prices could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a 
reduction of international crude oil prices could result in a delay or a change in our capital expenditure plan, in particular delaying exploration and development 
activities, thereby delaying the development of reserves and affecting future cash flows. 
  
Our operations are subject to certain operational risks that, if materialized, may result in the disruption or shutdown of our operation activities, as well as in 
damages to the environment and to third parties.
Our exploration, production, refining and transportation activities are subject to industry-specific operating risks, some of which, despite our internal
procedures, are beyond our control. Our operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled due to adverse or abnormal weather conditions, natural disasters, 
equipment failures or accidents, oil or natural gas spills or leaks, shortages or delays in the availability or in the delivery of equipment, delays or cancellation of 
environmental licenses or other government authorizations, fires, explosions, blow-outs, surface cratering, pipeline failures, theft and damage to our 
transportation infrastructure, sabotage, terrorist attacks and criminal activities.
The occurrence of any of these operating risks could result in substantial losses or slowdowns to our operations, including injury to our employees,
destruction of property, equipment and infrastructure, clean-up responsibilities, third-party liability claims, government investigations and imposition of fines, 
withdrawal of environmental licenses and other government permits, suspension or shutdown of our activities and loss of revenue. The occurrence of any of 
these events may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
  
We are exposed to the credit risks of our customers and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers could adversely affect our cash 
flow and results of operations.
Our customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant negative effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems 
encountered by our customers could limit our ability to collect amounts owed to us, or to enforce the performance of obligations owed to us under contractual 
arrangements. In addition, many of our customers finance their activities through their cash flows from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of 
equity.
The combination of declining cash flows as a result of declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit
facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of our customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make 
payments or perform on their obligations to us.
Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating expenses. Therefore, the risk we face in doing
business with these customers may increase. Other customers may also be subject to regulatory changes, which could increase the risk of defaulting on their 
obligations to us. For example, constraints on foreign currency transactions by the Venezuelan government have resulted in delays by PDVSA Gas to make 
payments to its providers, including us. Financial problems experienced by our customers could result in the impairment of our assets, a decrease in our 
operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail our customers’ future use of our products and services, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues. 
  
Achieving our long-term growth prospects depends on our ability to execute our Strategic Plan, in particular discovering additional reserves and 
successfully developing them.
We describe our Strategic Plan under “Item 4.  Information on the Company—The Company—Strategic Plan.” The ability to achieve our long-term
growth objectives depends on discovering or acquiring new reserves as well as successfully developing them. Our exploration activities expose us to the 
inherent risks of drilling, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive crude oil or natural gas reserves. The costs associated with 
drilling wells are often uncertain, and numerous factors beyond our control may cause drilling operations to be curtailed, delayed or cancelled.
If we are unable to conduct successful exploration and development of our exploration activities, or if we do not acquire properties having proved 
reserves, our level of proved reserves will decline. Failure to secure additional reserves may impede us from achieving production targets, and may have a 
negative effect on our results of operation and financial condition. 
  
Our current and planned investments outside Colombia are exposed to political and economic risks.
As part of our Strategic Plan, we have begun to operate through business partners, subsidiaries or affiliates outside of Colombia. As of the date hereof,
we have investments and subsidiaries incorporated in Peru, Brazil, Bermuda, Panama, the Cayman Islands, Switzerland, Spain, the United Kingdom and the 
United States, and we are analyzing investments in other countries. In connection with making investments, we are and will be subject to risks relating to 
economic and political conditions, governmental economic actions, such as exchange or price controls or limits on the activities to be performed by us, 
increases in tax rates, contractual changes, and social and environmental challenges.
9
In addition, we cannot predict the positions of foreign governments relating to the oil and gas industry, land tenure, protection of private property,
environmental regulation or taxation; nor can we assure you that future governments will maintain a generally favorable business climate and economic 
policies. Any changes in the economic policies or regulations by the governments of the countries where we own investments may adversely affect our 
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  
Our participation in deep water drilling in conjunction with our business partners involves certain risks and costs, which may be outside of our control.
In association with our business partners, we have undertaken deep water exploratory drilling in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Brazil. Additionally, as of
December 31, 2012, we were involved in 19 off-shore exploratory and production projects in Colombia that involve deep-water drilling, of which we act as 
operators in four, while Equion acts as operator in two. Our deep water drilling activities present several risks such as the risk of spills, explosions in platforms 
and drilling operations, and natural disasters. The occurrence of any of these events or other incidents could result in personal injuries, loss of life, severe 
environmental damage with the resulting containment, clean-up and repair expenses, equipment damage and liability in civil and administrative proceedings. 
Heightened risks and costs associated with deep water drilling may have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
As a result of the oil spill in the Macondo field in the U.S. Gulf Coast in April 2010, significant concerns regarding the safety of deep water drilling
had been raised and regulation in different countries has changed. In association with our business partners, which act as operators, we are currently drilling and 
have plans to drill exploratory wells in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Brazil. Since we have no control over these types of foreign government regulations, they may 
negatively impact the timing of our deep water drilling operations and consequently our results of operations and financial condition. 
  
Our drilling activities are capital intensive and may not be productive.
Drilling for crude oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive crude oil or
natural gas reservoirs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is high and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled 
as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•
unexpected drilling conditions;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
pressure or irregularities in formations;
security problems;
theft;
sabotage;
terrorist attacks;
equipment failures or accidents;
fires, explosions, blow-outs and surface cratering;
title problems;
delays or cancellation of environmental licenses;
other adverse weather conditions and natural disasters; and
shortages or delays in the availability or in the delivery of equipment.
10
Certain of our future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could reduce the ratio at which we replace our reserves,
which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves risks, 
exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because of the percentage of our capital budget 
devoted to higher-risk exploratory projects, it is likely that we may in the future experience significant exploration and dry hole expenses. 
  
Increased competition from local and foreign crude oil companies may have a negative impact on our ability to gain access to additional crude oil and 
natural gas reserves in Colombia.
The ANH is the governmental entity responsible for promoting oil and gas investments in Colombia, establishing terms of reference for exploration
rounds and assigning exploration blocks to oil and gas companies. Prior to the enactment of Decree Law 1760 of 2003, we had an automatic right to explore any 
territory in Colombia and to enter into joint venture agreements with foreign and local oil companies. Under current regulations, we are entitled to bid for any 
exploration blocks offered for exploration by the ANH and we compete under the same conditions as other domestic and foreign oil and gas companies, 
receiving no special treatment. We or other oil companies may request the ANH to directly assign exploration blocks which have not been previously reserved 
by that Agency, depending on exceptional situations that are defined on Accord 04 of 2012. Our ability to obtain access to potential production fields also 
depends on our ability to evaluate and select potential hydrocarbon-producing fields and to adequately bid for these exploration fields.
Our strategies include international expansion where we face competition from local market players and international oil companies that have
experience exploring in other countries.
If we are unable to adequately compete with local and foreign oil companies, or if we cannot enter into joint ventures with market players with
properties where we could potentially find additional reserves, we may be conducting exploration activities in less attractive blocks, and we could reduce our 
market share participation. If we fail to maintain our current market position in Colombia, our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely 
affected. 
  
Our future performance depends on the successful development and deployment of new technologies and the knowledge to apply and improve them.
Technology, knowledge and innovation are essential to our business, especially for improvements in the production of heavy crude oil, the exploitation 
of mature fields and the development of non-conventional hydrocarbons. If we do not develop the right technology or do not obtain the expertise to operate new 
technology or to improve our processes, do not have access to, or deploy the knowledge necessary to apply and improve such technology effectively, the 
execution of our Strategic Plan, our profitability and our earnings may be adversely affected. 
  
Legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and other drilling activities for non-conventional oil and gas reserves could increase 
the cost of implementing our Strategic Plan and the future costs of doing business or cause delays and adversely affect our operations.
Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the 
hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.  Our Strategic Plan contemplates the 
use of hydraulic fracturing in the production of oil and natural gas from certain reservoirs, especially shale formations. We currently do not have information 
about any proposals of regulations concerning of hydraulic fracturing beyond the regulation already in place, which has allowed the use of this technique of 
reservoir stimulation for decades in Colombia. However, various initiatives in regions outside of Colombia with substantial shale gas resources have been or 
may be proposed or implemented to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid 
constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. If Colombia adopts similar regulations, 
which is something we cannot anticipate right now, the imposition of stringent regulatory and permitting requirements related to the practice of hydraulic 
fracturing in Colombia could significantly increase the cost of or cause delays in the implementation of our Strategic Plan and adversely affect our operations.
11
We may be subject to substantial risks relating to our development of exploration activities outside Colombia.
We began exploration activities outside Colombia in 2006 through our Brazilian subsidiary, Ecopetrol Oleo é Gas Do Brasil Ltda. Our foreign
subsidiaries have subsequently entered into a number of joint venture exploration agreements with regional and international oil companies to explore blocks in 
Peru, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The results of operations and financial condition of our subsidiaries in these countries may be adversely affected not only 
by risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration and production but also by fluctuations in their local economies, political instability and government actions, 
including: imposition of price controls; imposition of restrictions on hydrocarbon exports; fluctuation of local currencies against the Peso; nationalization of oil 
and gas reserves; increases in export tax and income tax rates for crude oil and oil products; and unilateral (governmental) institutional and contractual changes, 
including controls on investments and limitations on new projects.
We have limited experience exploring outside Colombia, where we are the incumbent operator. We may face new and unexpected risks involving
environmental requirements that exceed those currently faced by us. Additionally, we may be exposed to legal disputes with foreign regulators. For example, we 
were awarded block Tucano-156 in Brazil in the 8th round of 2006. However, in August 2011, the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (Ministério de Minas 
e Energía) confirmed that the government would not sign any contract awarded in the 8th round of 2006, after the National Energy Policy Council (Conselho 
Nacional de Política Energética) decided to annul the bidding process. We may also experience the imposition of restrictions on hydrocarbon exploration and 
export, or increases in export tax or income tax rates for crude oil and natural gas.
If one or more of these risks described above were to materialize, we might not achieve the strategic objectives in our international operations, which
may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
  
We may incur losses and spend time and money defending pending lawsuits and arbitrations.
We are currently a party to several legal proceedings filed against us. We are also subject to labor-related lawsuits filed by current and former
employees in connection with pension plans and retirement benefits. As of December 31, 2012, we were a party to 2,658 legal proceedings relating to civil, 
administrative, environmental, tax, and labor claims filed against us of which 659 met the accounting threshold for an accrual provision. We allocate substantial 
amounts of money and time to defend these claims. These claims involve substantial sums of money as well as other remedies. See Notes 19 and 31 to our 
consolidated financial statements and “Item 8. Financial Information—Legal Proceedings.” 
  
Our natural gas production may not be able to keep up with our natural gas commitments.
We are party to certain natural gas supply contracts that have firm gas commitments. If we are unable to deliver natural gas to supply these contract 
clients, such as due to cuts in operations, delays in new projects for production facilities or the acceleration of the decline in our gas production, we may be 
required to compensate such contract customers for our failure to supply natural gas. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Marketing and Supply—
Natural Gas Distribution.” Both situations may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
During 2012, delays in the start of new projects, mainly the Planta de Gas Cupiagua and those for increasing the production capacity at the Guajira
fields resulted in fines claimed by our clients. Such delays were mainly caused by the process to obtain environmental licenses for building the pipeline 
Cupiagua – Cusiana, landslides due to weather conditions and isolated strikes by workers in the project area from other oil and gas companies. During 2010, 
2011 and 2012, the fines paid in compensation for non-delivery of natural gas were Ps$85.2 billion (approximately US$44.5 million), Ps$2.5 billion 
(approximately US$1.3 million) and Ps$9.2 billion (approximately US$5.2 million), respectively. 
  
We are not permitted by law to own more than 25% of a natural gas transportation company, which may not allow us to transport new natural gas reserves 
to distribution points and to our customers.
We discovered natural gas reserves in the Cusiana and Cupiagua fields for which transportation capacity is limited. New natural gas transportation
infrastructure may not be available to transport natural gas from new or existing fields to consumption areas. Furthermore, we are prohibited by law from 
holding more than 25% of the equity of any natural gas transportation company and consequently there can be no assurance that the transportation capacity 
necessary to transport natural gas is built by third parties. Due to the limited number of natural gas transportation companies currently operating in Colombia we 
may be required to enter into agreements on terms that are not as favorable to us as they could be if there were multiple transportation companies.
If we are unable to obtain transportation services to transport natural gas from new discoveries to our customers or to regions where natural gas is 
demanded, we may not be able to develop these reserves, which may result in impairment of the related assets and would not allow us to recover the capital 
expenditures invested to make these natural gas discoveries.
12
In addition, at the end of 2011, we had five medium-term supply contracts with gas-fired power plants that required us to deliver natural gas in
Barrancabermeja.  In 2012, four of those contracts ended and we currently have only a medium-term supply contract,  with one gas-fired power plant that 
requires us to deliver natural gas in Barrancabermeja. If we were unable to find the necessary transportation, we could be unable to meet our obligation with 
those power generators, which could result in us having to pay monetary fines. 
  
Our operations could be affected by conflicts with labor unions.
In the past, we have been affected by strikes and work stoppages promoted by our own and our industry’s labor unions. These strikes have been both
politically and contract-related, especially during collective bargaining negotiations. In April 2009, we entered into an agreement with the Unión Sindical 
Obrera de la Industria del Petróleo, or USO, one of our industry labor unions, to restore trust between USO and us with open communication and transparency 
as the main principles.
Additionally, on August 22, 2009, as a result of consensual negotiations, we entered into a new five-year collective bargaining agreement with three of
the most significant industry labor unions: USO, Asociación de Directivos Profesionales, Técnicos y Trabajadores de las Empresas de la Rama de Actividad 
Económica del Recurso Natural del Petróleo y sus Derivados de Colombia, or ADECO, and Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de Empresas Operadoras, 
Contratistas, Subcontratistas de Servicios y Actividades de la Industria del Petróleo y Similares, or SINDISPETROL. The new collective bargaining agreement 
was effective as of July 1, 2009 and covers salaries, healthcare, education, housing, transportation, meals, cultural activities, union rights and guarantees, among 
other aspects. Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de Empresas Operadoras, or SINCOPETROL, the Company’s labor union, neither presented any list of 
claims to us nor objected to the bargaining agreement, and as a result, we do not have a labor conflict with SINCOPETROL.
During 2011, there were two work stoppages promoted by USO in Barrancabermeja in support of the protests by employees at Pacific Rubiales, an
unaffiliated oil and gas company in Colombia. On June 19, 2012 and December 22, 2012, USO members protested the creation of our subsidiary Cenit 
Transporte y Logística de Hidrocarburos S.A.S, or Cenit.  These protests did not materially affect our operations. See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management 
and Employees—Employees.”
We cannot assure you that we will not experience labor unrest in the future. In the event relations with our labor unions deteriorate, which could result
in strikes, work stoppages or even sabotage, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
  
We may not be able to achieve our corporate goals if we face difficulty in finding competent successors to our current management and employees.
Our growth strategy and the successful achievement of our corporate goals depend on the competence of our management and employees, and our 
ability to retain top talent. However, if our managers and employees decide to retire or leave us for other reasons, it may be difficult for us to find adequate 
successors with the required skills, knowledge, leadership and qualifications for the job. In addition, we may face difficulties in retaining our key managers and 
employees because of the high level of competition for human resources with experience and knowledge in the oil and gas industries. Furthermore, our 
compensation structure may not be able to meet industry levels and as a result our key employees may leave for jobs offering higher compensation. We also 
may face difficulties acquiring or developing the optimal set of professional skills and talent required to reach and sustain our performance under international 
standards. These difficulties, in turn, may negatively affect our results. See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Employees.” 
  
Our activities may be interrupted or affected by external factors, such as abnormal weather conditions, natural disasters and third-party acts.
We are exposed to several risks that may partially interrupt our activities. These risks include, among others, fire disasters, explosions, natural disasters
such as earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, tropical storms, hurricanes and floods, criminal acts and acts of terror, malfunction of pipelines and 
emission of toxic substances.
For instance, in 2011 we were affected by weather conditions that intensified the strength of the average rain season in Colombia, causing landslides
due to the abnormal concentration of water in the soil. These abnormal landslides affected transportation of crude oil by trucks, transportation of crude oil, 
natural gas and products by pipelines and the normal operation of our production fields and Reficar, which experienced floods at its facilities also as a result of 
torrential rains.
13
As a result of the occurrence of any of the above, our activities could be significantly affected or paralyzed. These risks could result in property
damage, loss of revenue, loss of life, pollution and harm to the environment, among others. If any of these occur, we may be exposed to economic sanctions, 
fines or penalties, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. On December 23, 2011, our Salgar-Cartago pipeline ruptured. 
We believe that this incident occurred as a result of a creep movement as a consequence of severe weather conditions in the area, causing the surrounding soil to 
exercise strong pressure on the pipeline, causing it to rupture. The spilled gasoline from the pipeline subsequently came into contact with a heat source which 
ignited it causing several explosions, resulted in 33 fatalities, 77 injuries, and damaged and destroyed property. On December 11, 2011, our Caño Limón – 
Coveñas oil pipeline ruptured as a result of a soil motion caused by the heavy rainy season. While the accident did not result in any fatalities, it resulted in crude 
oil spilling into the Iscala creek. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Transportation Infrastructure—Incidents at Transportation Facilities.” 
  
We conduct exploration and production activities in areas classified as indigenous reserves and Afro-Colombian lands.
We carry out and plan to carry out exploration and production activities in areas classified by the Government as indigenous reserves (resguardos) and 
Afro-Colombian lands (territorios colectivos). We may not begin to explore for or produce hydrocarbons in these regions until we reach an agreement with the 
indigenous or Afro-Colombian communities living on these lands. Generally these consultations last between four and six months, but may be significantly 
delayed if we cannot reach an agreement. For example, we conduct operations in areas of the Northeastern region, which are inhabited by the U’wa community. 
Commencement of operations on two blocks in this region have been delayed for 20 years and ten years, respectively as of December 2012 because the 
community has refused to participate in the consultation process and the applicable legislation does not contemplate any alternatives in such a case. Similarly, 
some of our exploration operations in the Southern region have been delayed for seven years as a result of the presence of the Kofan community who oppose 
our presence and activities in the reservation. We may be exposed to similar delays due to opposition from local communities in other countries where we carry 
out exploration activities in indigenous reserves, such as Peru. If our activities endanger the conservation and preservation of these cultural minorities or their 
identities or beliefs, we may not be able to explore regions with good prospects. We may face similar risks in other jurisdictions where we have initiated 
exploration activities, which could have a negative effect on our operations. 
  
Our operations are subject to social risks.
Our activities are subject to social risks, including protests by communities surrounding our operations. For example, during the construction of the
Bicentenario oil pipeline, construction was suspended as a result of lockouts used by communities in the area of influence of the oil pipeline to demand greater 
participation of the Government and social investment, as well as greater participation of private companies in the development plans of towns in the 
departments of Arauca and Casanare. While we are committed to operating in a socially responsible manner, we may face opposition from local communities 
with respect to our current and future projects and such opposition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
  
Currency fluctuations and an appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of 
operations given that approximately 65% of our revenues are derived from foreign sales.
Approximately 65% of our sales are made in the international markets. The impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, especially the Peso/U.S. dollar
rate on our operations has been and may continue to be material. In addition, a substantial share of our liquid assets are held in U.S. dollars or indexed to foreign 
currencies and gain value when the Peso depreciates against the U.S. dollar and lose value when the Peso appreciates against the U.S. dollar. We control our 
currency risk using natural hedging when possible, by maintaining funds in U.S. dollars and Pesos to meet our expenses in its respective currency. In addition, 
the obligations derived from our U.S. dollar-denominated debt are naturally hedged by our funds in the same currency. This situation partially mitigates any 
adverse effect that currency risk may have over the financial statements of the Company.
The U.S. dollar/Peso exchange rate has shown some instability in the last several years, particularly with the Peso experiencing significant fluctuations
during the last twelve months. The Peso appreciated 2.7% on average against the U.S. dollar in 2012, and depreciated 0.6%, on average, during the first three 
months of 2013. When the Peso appreciates against the U.S. dollar, our revenues from exports, when translated into Pesos, decrease. However, imported goods, 
oil services and interest on external debt denominated in U.S. dollars become less expensive for us. Conversely, when the Peso depreciates against the U.S. 
dollar, our revenues from exports, when translated into Pesos, increase, and our imports and external debt service become more expensive. We cannot assure 
you that measures adopted by the government of Colombia and the Colombian Central Bank (Banco de la República de Colombia) such as the purchase of U.S. 
dollars in the foreign exchange market in response to the appreciation of the Peso, and  the government’s intervention through the purchase of significant 
amounts of U.S. dollars in the spot market to pay interest and principal on foreign bonds coming due or to increase the size of the oil-stability fund will be 
sufficient to control this instability. Future volatility in the exchange rate of the Peso to the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our financial condition and results 
of operations and our ability to comply with our obligations under our indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions to our shareholders.
14
Our ability to access the credit and capital markets on favorable terms to obtain funding for our capital projects may be limited due to the deterioration of 
these markets and the authorizations we need before incurring any financial indebtedness.
We expect to make significant expenditures in capital and operations to reach the corporate goals established by our Strategic Plan. See “Item 4.
Information on the Company—The Company—Strategic Plan.” Our ability to fund these expenditures is dependent on our ability to access the capital necessary 
to finance the construction of these facilities on terms acceptable to us. In recent years, domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions have 
been weak and volatile and have contributed significantly to a substantial deterioration in the credit and capital markets. A new financial crisis or an expansion 
of the current European sovereign debt crisis could also make it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to access international capital markets and finance our 
operations and capital expenditures in the future on terms acceptable to us. These conditions, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector 
and the re-pricing of credit risk, can make it difficult for us to obtain funding for our capital needs on favorable terms. As a result, we may be forced to revise 
the timing and scope of these projects as necessary to adapt to existing market and economic conditions, or access the financial markets on terms less favorable, 
therefore negatively affecting our results of operation and financial condition.
In addition, under applicable regulation, the Government, through the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, must authorize all indebtedness of 
governmental entities and Nation-controlled companies through a majority equity stake. Consequently, all of our own indebtedness and our subsidiaries’ 
indebtedness, except for our foreign subsidiaries or those subsidiaries in which we hold minority interest, must be previously authorized by the Colombian 
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit. As such, our indebtedness is subject to the Government’s time frames and policies, and we cannot assure you that such 
authorizations would be granted in a timely fashion or at all. 
  
We may be exposed to increases in interest rates, thereby increasing our financial costs.
We may incur debt locally and in the international capital markets and, consequently, may be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates. If market
interest rates increase, our financing expenses may increase, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Financial markets have not recovered from the recent global economic crisis and remain vulnerable to the European sovereign debt crisis that affects
the liquidity of commercial banks and investment funds. If recovery falters or takes a few years longer than expected, the costs of raising funds in debt and 
equity capital markets may increase and impair our ability to obtain capital on terms acceptable to us. 
  
We are subject to extensive environmental regulations in Colombia and in the other countries in which we operate and under certain of our credit 
agreements, we are under an obligation to comply with international environmental standards.
Our operations are subject to extensive national, state and local environmental regulations in Colombia. Environmental rules and regulations are 
applicable to our exploration, production, refining, transportation, supply and marketing activities, as well as the biofuels we produce. These regulations 
establish, among other things, quality standards for hydrocarbon products, air emissions and greenhouse gases, water discharges and waste disposal, 
environmental standards for abandoned crude oil wells, remedies for soil, water pollution and the general storage, handling, transportation and treatment of 
hydrocarbons in Colombia. Currently, all exploratory projects drilling in areas that do not yet have a license must undergo an environmental impact assessment 
and must receive an environmental license from the Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry of the Environment routinely inspects our crude oil fields, 
refineries and other production sites and may decide to open investigations which may result in fines, restrictions on operations or other sanctions in connection 
with potential non-compliance with environmental laws.
We are also subject to regional environmental regulations issued by the corporaciones autónomas regionales, or regional environmental authorities,
which oversee compliance with each region’s environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these national or regional environmental regulations, 
we could be subject to administrative and criminal penalties, including warnings, fines and closure orders of our facilities. See “Item 4. Information on the 
Company—Overview by Business Segment—Environmental Matters.”
15
Environmental compliance has become more stringent in Colombia in recent years and as a result we have allocated a greater percentage of our
expenditures for compliance with these laws and regulations. If environmental laws continue to impose additional costs and expenses on us, and as new laws 
and regulations relating to climate change become applicable to us, we may need to reduce our investments on strategic projects in order to allocate funds to 
environmental compliance. We are exposed to delays in obtaining environmental licenses from ANLA (Asociación Nacional de Licencias Ambientales, the 
government agency which is in charge of environmental licenses), which can lead to cost overruns or to changes in the investment plans of the company. These 
additional costs may have a negative impact on the profitability of the projects we intend to undertake or may make them economically unattractive, in turn 
having a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to foreign environmental regulations for the exploratory activities conducted by us outside Colombia. Failure to comply with foreign 
environmental regulations may result in investigations by foreign regulators, which could lead to fines, warnings or temporary suspensions of our operations, 
which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Under certain of our credit agreements, we are under an obligation to comply with international environmental standards established by our lenders or 
by multilateral institutions. Failure to comply with such environmental standards could result in an event of default under the relevant credit agreements that we, 
or our subsidiaries, have entered into, which would affect our financial condition. For instance, the credit agreements executed by Ecopetrol in order to finance 
purchases of U.S. goods and services and the credit facilities executed by Reficar for the financing of its expansion and modernization project, include an 
obligation to comply with the U.S.-Exim Environmental Procedures and Guidelines, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) Common Approaches on Environment and Officially Supported Export Credits. 
  
Our activities face operational risks that may affect the health and safety of our workforce and of the local communities.
Some of our operations are developed in remote and dangerous locations which involve health and safety risks that could affect our workforce. Under
Colombian law and industrial safety regulations we are required to have health and safety practices that minimize risks and health issues faced by our 
workforce. Failure to comply with health and safety regulations may lead to investigations by health officials that could result in lawsuits or fines.
We may be required to incur additional costs and expenses to allocate funds to industrial safety and health compliance under Colombian law and
industrial safety regulations. Additionally, if any operational incident occurs that affects local communities in nearby areas, we will need to incur additional 
costs and expenses in order to return affected areas to normality. These additional costs may have a negative impact on the profitability of the projects we may 
decide to undertake.
In addition, we may be subject to foreign health and safety regulations for our exploratory activities conducted outside Colombia. Foreign health and
safety regulations may be more severe than those established under Colombian law and, therefore, we may be required to make additional investments to 
comply with those regulations. 
  
We have made significant investments in acquisitions and we may not realize the expected value.
We have acquired interests in several companies in Colombia and abroad. See “Item 4. Information on the Company.” Obtaining the expected benefits
of the acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to (1) obtain the expected operational and financial results from these acquisitions, (2) manage disparate 
operations and integrate distinct corporate cultures and (3) manage our objectives as a corporate group. These efforts may not succeed. Our failure to 
successfully obtain the expected results from our acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
  
Our subsidiaries Reficar and Oleoducto Bicentenario are currently engaged in their own construction projects. If they or any other material project is 
delayed or if its costs exceed our initial estimate, it could affect our operating results and financial condition.
Reficar has raised US$3.5 billion through a limited-recourse project financing in which we have acted as sponsor and have provided both a
construction guarantee and a debt service guarantee to the project lenders. If the construction project of the upgraded refinery is delayed because of operational 
problems, due to, but not limited to, labor productivity or unavailability of construction material in the development of the project, or if the upgraded refinery 
does not reach the expected performance level in terms of the quality of products and/or volumes produced, the project lenders could request that we act on the 
guarantees and assume the payment obligations of Reficar, which would require us to make additional capital contributions thereby affecting our operating 
results and financial condition. Additionally, delays in the implementation of the project may result in larger capital expenditures, which could increase the 
overall cost of the project and impact our financial position.
16
In February 2013, Reficar requested contributions from Ecopetrol under the Construction Support Agreement in an amount of US$500 million, of
which US$250 million has already been provided, with the remaining amount to be supplied throughout the rest of the year. As the project’s budget and 
schedule are being revised, we may be required to provide additional funding in excess of this amount. Any increase in the project’s capital expenditures is 
expected to be funded under the Construction Support Agreement between Reficar and Ecopetrol.
Oleoducto Bicentenario is in the first phase of construction of the Araguaney-Coveñas pipeline, which connects the Araguaney and Banadía loading
facilities, and which is expected to be the largest of its kind in Colombia. Its estimated investment of US$2,035 million is expected to be financed by the project 
partners’ equity participation amounting to a 30% interest and the remaining 70% through loans from local banks, which have approved Ps$2.1 trillion and of 
which Ps$1,295 billion (approximately US$732 million) has been drawn. The first phase of the construction is expected to permit the evacuation of at least 110 
thousand bpd, with a pipeline of 230 kilometers in length and a diameter of 42 inches. Delays in the completion of the first phase of this project due in part to 
events such as lockouts from communities in the areas of project construction demanding more social investment from the government, security issues, attacks 
by guerrilla groups, and unfavorable weather conditions could affect our production in certain fields and would prevent us from having the necessary 
infrastructure for crude oil transportation, negatively impacting our financial position.
Other investment projects that are part of our Strategic Plan could face similar planning and implementation problems, which could impact the
competitiveness of our programs and projects, affecting our results and expected financial condition. 
  
Our results may be affected by the performance of our business partners, as many of our operations are executed under association and joint venture 
agreements with business partners.
Many of our operations are executed through associations, joint ventures and other agreements with our business partners. Consequently, we depend on 
the performance of our business partners. The poor performance of any of our business partners, especially in those projects in which we do not act as operators, 
could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of not finding business partners with the 
appropriate skills and performance that we require for our projects. 
  
Our insurance policies do not cover all liabilities and may not be available for all risks.
Our insurance policies do not cover all liabilities, and insurance may not be available for all risks. There can be no assurance that incidents will not 
occur in the future, that insurance will adequately cover the entire scope or extent of our losses or that we will not be found liable in connection with claims 
arising from these and other events, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
A failure in our information technology systems or cyber security attacks may adversely affect our financial results.
We depend on the reliability and security of our information technology systems to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities,
process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, and for many other activities related to our business. 
Our information technology systems may fail or have other significant shortcomings due to operational system flaws or employee misuse, tampering or 
manipulation. In addition, we may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, 
monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or 
reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. Although we have not experienced any material losses relating to failure of our 
information technology systems or cyber incidents, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. 
  
Risks relating to our ADSs 
  
Holders of our ADSs may encounter difficulties in exercising their voting rights.
The procedures established in the Deposit Agreement provide that holders of our ADSs are entitled to instruct our current depositary, JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., to vote on shareholder matters by giving instructions, in advance of a shareholders’ meeting, to such depositary. Under Colombian law, Ecopetrol is 
not required to request proxies from our existing shareholders and, therefore, shareholders may not receive notice in time to instruct the depositary to vote their 
shares.
17
Pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, holders of our ADSs can instruct the depositary to vote the common shares separately. However, this issue has 
been subject to different regulatory interpretations, which may limit the ability of the depositary to vote separately. Under prior regulatory interpretations, the 
depositary could be required to vote the underlying common shares in a single block (presumably reflecting the majority vote of the ADS holders). In the future, 
the Colombian regulatory authorities may change their interpretation as to how the voting rights should be exercised by ADS holders, and such possible 
interpretation could adversely affect the value of the common shares and ADSs 
  
Our ADSs holders may be subject to restrictions on foreign investment in Colombia.
Colombia’s International Investment Statute regulates the manner in which non-Colombian residents can invest in Colombia and participate in the
Colombian securities market. Among other requirements, Colombian law requires foreign investors to register certain foreign exchange transactions with the 
Colombian Central Bank and outlines the necessary procedures to authorize certain types of foreign investments. Colombian law requires that certain foreign 
exchange transactions, including international investment in foreign currency between Colombian residents and non-Colombian residents, must be made 
through authorized foreign exchange market participants. Any income or expenses under our American Depositary Receipt, or ADR, program must be made 
through the foreign exchange market.
Investors acquiring our ADRs are not required to register with the Colombian Central Bank, as they will benefit from the registration to be obtained by
the custodian for our common shares underlying the ADRs in Colombia. If investors in ADRs choose to surrender their ADRs and withdraw common shares, 
they must register their investment in the common shares as a portfolio investment through their local representative, which may be a brokerage firm, trust 
company or investment management companies supervised by the Superintendency of Finance. Investors will only be allowed to transfer dividends abroad after 
their foreign investment registration procedure with the Colombian Central Bank has been completed. Investors withdrawing common shares could incur 
expenses and/or suffer delays in the application process. The failure of a non-resident investor to report or register foreign exchange transactions with the 
Colombian Central Bank relating to investments in Colombia on a timely basis may prevent the investor from remitting dividends, or initiate an investigation 
that may result in a fine. In the future, the Government, the Colombian Congress or the Colombian Central Bank may amend Colombia’s International 
Investment Statute or the foreign investment rules, which could result in more restrictive rules and could negatively affect trading of our ADSs.
Additionally, Colombia currently has a floating exchange rate system; however, other restrictive rules for the exchange rate system could be
implemented in the future. In the event that a more restrictive exchange rate system is implemented, the depositary may experience difficulties converting Peso 
amounts into U.S. dollars to remit dividend payments. See “Item 10. Additional Information—Exchange Controls.” 
  
Holders of our ADSs may not be able to effect service of process on us, our directors or executive officers within the United States, which may limit your 
recovery in any foreign judgment you obtain against us.
We are a mixed economy company organized under the laws of Colombia. In addition, most of our Directors and executive officers reside outside the
United States. All or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible 
for you to effect service of process within the United States upon us or these persons or to enforce judgments against us or them in U.S. courts obtained in such 
courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Colombian courts determine whether to enforce a U.S. judgment 
predicated on the U.S. securities laws through a procedural system known as exequatur. For a description of these limitations, see “Enforcement of Civil 
Liabilities.” 
  
The protections afforded to minority shareholders in Colombia are different from those in the United States, and may be difficult to enforce.
Under Colombian law, the protections afforded to minority shareholders are different from those in the United States. In particular, the legal
framework with respect to shareholder disputes is substantially different under Colombian law than U.S. law and there are different procedural requirements for 
commencing shareholder lawsuits, such as shareholder derivative suits. As a result, it may be more difficult for our minority shareholders to enforce their rights 
against us or our Directors or controlling shareholder than it would be for shareholders of a U.S. company.
18
ADRs do not have the same tax benefits as other equity investments in Colombia.
Although ADRs represent Ecopetrol’s common shares, for Colombian tax purposes, ADRs are securities different from their underlying assets.
Therefore, ADR holders are not entitled to the tax benefits granted to holders of the common shares. Such tax benefits are, among others, those relating to 
dividends and profits derived from sale of Colombian common shares. For further information see “Item 10. Additional Information—Taxation—Colombian 
Tax Considerations.” 
  
Judgments of Colombian courts with respect to our ADSs will be payable only in Pesos.
If proceedings are brought in the courts of Colombia seeking to enforce the rights of ADS holders of common shares, we will be required to discharge 
our obligation amounts in Pesos. Under Colombian laws, an obligation in Colombia to pay amounts denominated in foreign currency may only be satisfied in 
Colombian currency at the Representative Market Exchange Rate of the date the judgment is obtained, and such amounts are then adjusted to reflect exchange 
rate variations through the effective payment date. 
  
The relative volatility and illiquidity of the Colombian securities markets may substantially limit our investors’ ability to sell our ADSs at the price and time 
they desire.
Investing in securities that are traded in emerging markets, such as Colombia, often involves greater risk when compared to other world markets, and
these investments are generally considered to be more speculative in nature.
The Colombian securities market is substantially smaller, less liquid, more concentrated and can be more volatile than other securities markets. The 
Colombian Stock Exchange (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia), or BVC, had a market capitalization of approximately Ps$483,295 billion (US$273,321 million 
using the closing rate for 2012) as of December 31, 2012, a 19.6% increase when compared with the amount at the end of 2011, a daily average trading volume 
of approximately Ps$188,212 million (US$104,665 million, using the average exchange rate for 2012), a 15.8% increase when compared to the volume in 2011. 
In contrast, the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, had a market capitalization of US$14 trillion as of December 31, 2012, and a daily trading volume of 
approximately US$37 billion in 2012.
As of December 31, 2012, our shares represented the highest market capitalization of the BVC with 43% of the total. In addition, they had the second 
highest trading volume in the BVC, averaging Ps$26,146 million traded per day. In the last quarter of 2012, our shares represented 26.6% of the Índice General 
de la Bolsa de Valores de Colombia, or IGBC, stock market index, 12.61% of the COL20, a stock market index that includes the top 20 traded stocks in the 
BVC, and 20.2% of the COLCAP, a stock price volatility index.
Given the current ownership structure of our shares, it may be difficult for you to purchase large quantities of shares from a single shareholder. We
cannot assure you that a liquid trading market for our ADSs will develop or, if developed, that it will be maintained. Without a liquid trading market, the ability 
of investors in our ADSs to sell them at the desired price and time could be substantially limited. 
  
We are not required to disclose as much information to investors as a U.S. issuer is required to disclose.
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Superintendency of Finance and the BVC. The corporate disclosure requirements that apply to us
may not be equivalent to the disclosure requirements that apply to a U.S. issuer and, as a result, you may receive less interim information about us than you 
would receive from a U.S. issuer. 
  
Risks relating to Colombia’s political and regional environment 
  
Colombia has experienced internal security issues that have had or could have a negative effect on the Colombian economy and on us.
Colombia has experienced internal security issues, primarily due to the activities of guerrillas, paramilitary groups, drug cartels and criminal bands
known as Bacrim. From time to time, guerrillas target crude oil and multi-purpose pipelines, including the Oleoducto Transandino, Caño Limón-Coveñas and 
Ocensa pipelines, and other related infrastructure disrupting our activities and those of our business partners. During 2011 and 2012, these attacks have 
intensified. On several occasions, guerilla attacks have resulted in unscheduled shut-downs of transportation systems in order to repair sections of pipelines that 
have been damaged and to undertake clean-up activities, as well as in deferral of production in certain fields. Guerrilla groups and other illegal armed groups 
also attacked natural gas transportation infrastructure. Although we do not have any interest in natural gas transportation assets, these attacks have affected our 
natural gas production. These activities, their possible escalation and the effects associated with them have had and may have, in the future, a negative impact on 
the Colombian economy or on us, which may affect our customers, employees, assets or the environment, with resulting containment, clean-up and repair 
expenses. In the context of this complex security situation, allegations and court judgments have been levied against members of the Colombian Congress and 
on government officials for possible ties with illegal groups. This situation may have a negative impact on the credibility of the Colombian government, which 
could in turn have a negative impact on the Colombian economy or on us in the future.
19
Recently, the Colombian government began negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the largest guerrilla group in 
Colombia, with a view to end the armed conflict. This is the latest attempt in a series of unsuccessful negotiations between the Colombian government and the 
FARC. While the process is ongoing, military operations and hostilities continue. If the negotiations fail, the intensity of the internal armed conflict could 
increase, resulting in a deterioration of Colombia’s national security and, consequently, negatively affecting our operating results. 
  
There have been certain events in Colombia and abroad, which have resulted in political tensions between Colombia and some of its neighboring countries.
Diplomatic relations between Colombia and some of its neighboring countries, in particular Ecuador and Venezuela, have been very tense in the past. 
These political tensions were heightened by the Colombian Government’s allegations that neighboring countries are supporting the guerilla groups, as well as 
by claims made by Venezuela stating that the Colombian army has entered its territory while in pursuit of FARC members. The Colombian army and air force 
continue to combat FARC members in the Colombian territory, including Colombia’s borders with neighboring countries. Although relations with these 
countries have stabilized recently, there can be no assurance that similar allegations could not be made again that may result in new and heightened tensions 
with Colombia’s neighbors, which have had in the past, and could have in the future, a negative impact on Colombia’s economy and general security situation. 
  
Companies operating in Colombia, including us, are subject to the prevailing economic conditions and the investment climate in Colombia, which may be 
less stable than the prevailing economic conditions and investment climate in developed countries.
Market prices of securities issued by Colombian companies, including us, are subject to the prevailing economic conditions in Colombia. A large
portion of our assets and operations are located in Colombia and most of our sales are currently derived from our crude oil and natural gas production and the 
production of our refineries located in Colombia. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations depend to a significant extent on 
macroeconomic and political conditions prevailing from time to time in Colombia and on the rates of exchange between the Peso and the U.S. dollar.
In the past, economic growth in Colombia has been negatively affected by lower foreign direct investment, high inflation rates and the perception of
political instability.
The investment and security climate in Colombia continues to be tied to the results and performance of President Juan Manuel Santos’s economic, 
security and social policies and the perception of such policies by foreign investors. Since his election in 2011, President Juan Manuel Santos has continued 
policies to increase foreign investment in Colombia as well as to improve relations with neighboring countries, which have resulted in economic stability for 
Colombia. In 2012, Colombia’s annual gross domestic product increased by 4% due principally to an increase of 5.9% in crude oil and mining production. In 
2011, Colombia’s annual gross domestic product increased by 6.6% due principally to an increase of 14.4% in crude oil and mining production.
If the perception of improved overall security in Colombia deteriorates or if foreign direct investment declines, the Colombian economy may face a
downturn, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the market price of our shares and American Depositary 
Shares, or ADSs, may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies, particularly those affecting economic growth, exchange rates, interest rates, 
inflation and taxes. The Colombian government has changed monetary, fiscal, taxation, labor and other policies over time and has thus influenced the 
performance of the Colombian economy. We have no control over the extent and timing of government intervention and policies.
20
Adverse developments in the global economy restricting the credit markets may materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations and 
financial condition.
The downturn in the world’s major economies over the past several years and the constraints in the credit markets have heightened, and could continue 
to heighten, a number of material risks to our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our future prospects. Continued weakness in, and 
uncertainty about, global economic conditions, and in particular the economic conditions in the United States, could cause businesses to postpone spending in 
response to tighter credit, negative financial news or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on the demand for goods and 
international trade which, in turn, could adversely affect the demand for our products. For example, the recent challenges faced by the European Union to 
stabilize some of its member economies, such as Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have had international implications affecting the stability of 
global financial markets, which have hindered economies worldwide. Many member nations in the European Union are addressing the issues with controversial 
austerity measures. If the European Union monetary policy measures are insufficient to restore confidence and stability to the financial markets, any recovery of 
the global economy, including the U.S. and European Union economies, could be hindered or reversed, which could negatively affect our business, results of 
operations and financial condition. There could also be a number of follow-on effects from these economic developments and negative economic trends to our 
business, including customer insolvencies, decreased customer demand, decreased customer liquidity due to tightening in the credit markets and decreased 
customer ability to fulfill their payment obligations.
The recent economic problems affecting the banking system and financial markets and the recent uncertainty in global economic conditions has
resulted in a number of adverse effects including tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, extreme volatility in credit, 
equity, currency and fixed income markets, instability in the stock market and high unemployment.
Financial markets have also recently been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, as well as the U.S. federal government’s debt ceiling and the 
federal deficit. These concerns have also renewed discussions relating to a potential downgrade of the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States. 
Any actions taken by the U.S. federal government regarding the debt ceiling or the federal deficit or any action taken or threatened by ratings agencies, could 
significantly impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could lead to a recession. Our business is closely tied to general economic 
conditions in the United States, Colombia and other Latin American countries, and any such economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
  
Developments and the perception of risk in other countries, especially emerging market countries, may adversely affect the market price of Colombian 
securities, including our ADSs.
Securities issued by Colombian companies may be affected by economic and market conditions in other countries, including other Latin American and
emerging market countries. Although economic conditions in Latin American countries and in other emerging market countries may differ significantly from 
economic conditions in Colombia, investors’ reactions to developments in these other countries may have an adverse effect on the market value of securities of 
Colombian issuers.
Due to past financial crises in several emerging market countries (such as the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Russian financial crisis of 1998 and the
Argentine financial crisis of 2001), the world financial crisis of 2009 and the recent sovereign debt crises in certain European countries, investors may view 
investments in emerging markets with heightened caution. In the past, as a result of crises in other countries, flows of investments into Colombia have been 
reduced. Crises in other countries, especially in emerging market countries, may hamper investor enthusiasm for securities of Colombian issuers. If Latin 
America experiences a new slow-down or if the price for securities of Latin American issuers falls, the price for our ADSs could follow this trend and could be 
adversely affected. 
  
Our controlling shareholder’s interests may be different from those of our minority shareholders.
Colombian Law 1118 of 2006 requires the Nation to maintain the majority of our outstanding capital stock. The Nation currently holds 88.49% of our
outstanding capital stock, making it our controlling shareholder. The Nation as our controlling shareholder has majority voting rights at the shareholders’ 
meeting to elect the members of our Board of Directors and approve decisions. The Nation could propose and approve decisions that do not necessarily benefit 
minority shareholders.
Our controlling shareholder may approve dividends at the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting, notwithstanding the interest of minority
shareholders, in an amount that results in us having to reduce our capital expenditures, thereby negatively affecting our prospects, results of operations and 
financial condition. See “Item 8. Financial Information—Dividends.”
21
Additionally, given our controlling shareholder’s interests, it may undertake projects, approve decisions or make announcements about its intentions
related to its holding of our capital stock which may not be in our best interest or in the best interest of our minority shareholders, including holders of our 
ADSs, and could impact the price of our shares or ADSs. 
  
Our operations are subject to extensive regulation.
The Colombian hydrocarbons industry is subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the Government in matters including the award of
exploration and production blocks by the National Hydrocarbon Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos), or ANH, the imposition of specific drilling and 
exploration obligations, restrictions on production, price controls, capital expenditures and required divestments. Existing regulation applies to virtually all 
aspects of our operations in Colombia and abroad. The commercialization activities of some of our products also face extensive regulation. Such regulation is 
subject to change by the applicable regulator affecting our ability to commercialize our products. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Overview by 
Business Segment—Regulation.”
The terms and conditions of the agreements with the ANH under which we explore and produce crude oil and natural gas generally reflect negotiations
with the ANH and other governmental authorities and may vary by fields, basins and hydrocarbons discovered.
We are required, as are all oil companies undertaking exploratory and production activities in Colombia, to pay a percentage of our production to the
Government as royalties. The oil and gas reserve figures included in this annual report are net of such royalties. The Government has modified the royalty 
program for crude oil and natural gas production several times in the last 20 years, as it has modified the regime regulating new contracts entered into with the 
Government. Since 2002, the royalty regime for contracts being entered into for crude oil is tied to a scale that begins at 8% for production of up to 5,000 bpd, 
and increases up to 25% for production above 600,000 bpd. Royalties for natural gas production are also subject to a sliding scale depending on whether the 
field is on- or off-shore and range between 8% and 25%.
In the future, the Government may once again amend royalty payment levels for new contracts and such changes could have an adverse effect on our
future exploration and production contracts in Colombia. 
  
The Government may delay the reimbursement of gasoline and diesel fuel price differentials.
The Government regulates domestic prices of liquid fuels according to international market conditions in order to align domestic prices with trends in 
international prices. When domestic prices of liquid fuels are lower than international parity prices, the Government is responsible for reimbursing importers or 
refiners for the difference, which is called the fuel price differential, pursuant to Law 1151 of 2007. Currently, the fuel price differential is calculated on a 
monthly basis and reported on a quarterly basis, with the corresponding cash payment to be made during the subsequent quarter. In cases of payment delays, 
refiners are entitled to receive interest on past due amounts.
Historically, when domestic prices of liquid fuels were higher than international parity prices, the Government lowered domestic prices. However,
towards the end of 2008 as international prices decreased, the Government decided not to lower domestic prices. Instead, the Government kept domestic prices 
high and allocated the positive difference between domestic fuel prices and the international parity prices to a Fuels Stabilization Fund (Fondo de Estabilización 
de Precios de los Combustibles), or FEPC. Similar to the approach followed by other countries, the FEPC is funded with these excess payments when 
international prices are low and depleted when international prices are high in order to mitigate domestic price volatility.
During 2010, oil refiners, including us, were entitled to fuel price differential payments from the Ministry of Mines and Energy indexed to international 
prices. However, such payments due to us by the Ministry of Mines and Energy were not made until the fourth quarter of 2011. Similarly, during 2011, the fuel 
price differential payments corresponding to the first three quarters of the year were not paid until December 2011. The fuel price differential payments due to 
us as of December 31, 2011, equal Ps$571.8 billion and those for 2012 equal Ps$1,381.5 billion. In April 2013, the Ministry of Mines and Energy paid the 
corresponding amounts due to us for the fourth quarter of 2011 and first three quarters of 2012, amounting to Ps$1,271.9 billion. The amount due to us, 
corresponding to the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, is equivalent to Ps$390.3 billion.
22
Delays in price differential payments make it difficult to determine when we will collect the amount of any fuel price differentials that become due in
the future. Any material delay in the payment of these fuel price differentials by the Government or a significant amendment to Law 1151 of 2007 imposing 
additional responsibilities on us with respect to fuel price differentials could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. On 
September 30, 2011, the Ministry of Mines and Energy established a new methodology to calculate domestic prices of gasoline and diesel fuel, which sets the 
maximum monthly variation in refiners’ revenues at 1.5%. Currently, the Colombian Congress is discussing a bill to introduce a new methodology to calculate 
fuel price differentials, and determine the maximum retail price of gasoline and diesel, including the revenues for the Colombian refineries. There can be no 
assurance that this bill, if enacted into law, will not negatively affect the amount and timeliness of the fuel price differential payments, which in turn could affect 
our financial condition and results of operations. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Gasoline and Diesel Price Differentials.” 
  
New or higher taxes resulting from changes in tax regulations or the interpretation thereof in Colombia could adversely affect our results of operations and 
financial condition.
New tax laws and regulations, and uncertainties in the interpretation with respect to existing and future tax policies pose risks to us. In recent years, the 
Colombian Congress and tax authorities have imposed additional taxes and enacted modifications to taxes related to financial transactions, income, value added 
tax, or VAT, and taxes on net worth. Changes in tax-related laws and regulations, and interpretations thereof, can affect tax burdens by increasing tax rates and 
fees, creating new taxes, limiting tax deductions, and eliminating tax-based incentives and non-taxed income. In addition, tax authorities and tax courts may 
interpret tax regulations differently than we do, which could result in tax litigation and associated costs and penalties. For Colombian income tax purposes and, 
as a general rule, dividends that are distributed from profits taxed at the corporate level are not taxed or subject to withholding tax at the shareholder level. Tax 
treaty rules might also apply on dividend distributions when a shareholder is a resident in a country that has executed a tax treaty with Colombia. However, this 
tax treatment may change in the future, and any change could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

ITEM 4.
Information on the Company
THE COMPANY
We are a vertically integrated oil company with presence in Colombia, Peru, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf Coast. We divide our operations into four
business segments: exploration and production; transportation and logistics; refining and petrochemicals; and marketing and supply. We are the largest 
corporation in Colombia, as measured by revenues, profits, assets, shareholders’ equity, sales, net income and net worth, and we play a key role in the local 
hydrocarbon market. Our operation does not include natural gas transportation activities due to legal restrictions. 
  
Corporate History
Ecopetrol is a mixed economy company, incorporated on August 25, 1951, and existing under the laws of Colombia. We have an unlimited term of
duration. Our legal name is Ecopetrol S.A. Our principal executive offices are located at Carrera 13 No. 36-24 Bogota, Colombia and our telephone number is 
+571 234 4000.
In 1951, we were incorporated as the Empresa Colombiana de Petróleos as a result of the reversion of the De Mares concession to the Government by
the Tropical Oil Company. We began our operations as a governmental industrial and commercial company, responsible for administering Colombia’s 
hydrocarbon resources. In the same year, we began operating the crude oil fields at La Cira-Infantas and the pipeline that connected that field with the 
Barrancabermeja refinery and the port of Cartagena. Three years later, the first national seismic study was performed under the De Mares concession which led 
to the discovery of the Llanito crude oil field in 1960.
In 1961, we assumed the direct operation of the Barrancabermeja refinery and continued its transformation into an industrial complex. International 
Petroleum Colombia Limited or Intercol began the construction of a new facility in Mamonal, Cartagena, where the pipeline terminal of the Andean National 
Corporation was already located and which also included a loading port. In December 1957, the Cartagena refinery began operations, and in 1974 it was 
acquired by us.
In 1970, we adopted our first bylaws that transformed us into a governmental industrial and commercial company, linked to the Ministry of Mines and
Energy. Decree Law 1760 of 2003 renamed us Ecopetrol S.A. and transformed us from an industrial and commercial company into a state-owned corporation 
by shares linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, in order to make us more competitive. Prior to our reorganization our capital expenditures program and 
access to the credit markets were limited by the Government, which was making its decisions based on its budgetary needs and not on our growth prospects.
We have been undergoing a two-step transformation process since 2003: (1) first, from a wholly state-owned entity to a state-owned entity
characterized by shares, and then (2) to a mixed economy company, which incorporates private capital, pursuant to law 1118 of 2006, with the initial public 
offering in November 2007. This two-step process has resulted in a substantial change in the legal framework to which we are subject and in the nature of our 
relationship with the Nation.
In 2006, the Colombian Congress authorized us to issue up to 20% of our voting capital stock in Colombia, subject to the condition that the Nation
control at least 80% of our voting capital stock. On November 13, 2007, we placed 4,087,723,771 shares in the BVC, trading under the symbol 
“ECOPETROL,” which resulted in 482,941 new shareholders and raised approximately Ps$5,723 billion for the sale of 10.1% of our capital stock. On 
September 30, 2011, we issued a total of 644,185,868 shares in an offering directed exclusively to investors in Colombia. Of the 219,054 investors participating 
in this offering, 73% were new stockholders. The aggregate proceeds of this offering were Ps$2.38 trillion. As a result of the two offerings made by us, the 
Nation currently controls 88.49% of our voting capital stock. Since September 18, 2008, our ADSs have been trading on the NYSE under the symbol “EC.” On 
December 4, 2009, our ADSs began trading on the Lima Stock Exchange under the symbol “EC.” Since March 16, 2011 our ADS’s were delisted from the 
Lima Stock Exchange. In addition, on August 13, 2010, our ADSs began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “ECP.” Each ADS 
represents 20 common shares of the Company.

private pipeline that will run from the Casanare Department to the port of Coveñas. The new pipeline is linked to facilitate oil exports from the Llanos region. 
We have, indirectly, a 55.97% ownership of the company and five other shareholders own the remaining 44.03%.
The transactions described above were funded mainly through cash on hand and cash flow from our operations. 
  
In January 2011, we increased our participation in Invercolsa S.A., a holding company with investments in natural gas transportation and distribution 
companies in Colombia, to 43.35% based on a final judgment of a court, which ordered the defendant, who had been the legal representative of Invercolsa, to 
return to us approximately 145 million shares of Invercolsa, which he had illegally bought in 1997 as part of the divestment of natural gas investments 
belonging to us.
In June 2012, we incorporated Cenit as our wholly-owned subsidiary. In October, 2012, we transferred all of our direct interests in Ocensa, ODC,
Oleoducto Bicentenario, ODL and Serviport to Cenit and in April 2013, we transferred our crude oil and products transportation assets to it. This new subsidiary 
performs all of our hydrocarbon transport activities, pursuant to transport agreements between Cenit, us and other producers and distributors in Colombia. We 
continue operating Cenit’s transportation infrastructure in accordance with an operation and maintenance agreement. See “Item 4. Overview by Business 
Segment—Transportation and Logistics—Cenit.”
In 2012, we undertook a process of reorganization, consisting of the following actions:
• On May 11, 2012, Ecopetrol Pipelines International (EPI) merged with Ecopetrol Transportation Company Limited (ETI) and Ecopetrol
Transportation Investments Limited, with EPI as the surviving entity.
• On July 12, 2012, Ecopetrol S.A. transferred to Ecopetrol Global Energy S.L.U. all of its shares in Ecopetrol America Inc.

We are committed to our goal of producing 1 million gross Clean Barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2015 and 1.3 million gross Clean Barrels of oil
equivalent per day in 2020, aligned with our principal stakeholders in a sustainable way in three categories: economic, social and environmental, with an 
average return on capital employed, or ROCE, of 17%. We use the term “Clean Barrels” to refer to the production of crude oil barrels without accidents or 
environmental incidents and in harmony with our stakeholders. We continue approaching operational excellence as a commitment to work systematically in a 
healthy, clean and safe manner, maximizing the use of resources, striving to exceed our clients’ and interest groups’ expectations.
Our Strategic Plan contemplates investments of US$84.7 billion for the period 2012-2020 and US$75 billion between 2013 and 2020, to be allocated as
Upstream: Investments in exploration and production are expected to be US$71 billion which corresponds to 84% of the total investment plan. Our 
operations in Colombia are expected to receive approximately 90% of our total investment in this segment. The additional 10% is expected to be destined to 
projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil. Out of the US$71 billion, US$13 billion is expected to be invested in the exploration and development of new 
reserves. Furthermore, our implementation of the latest technology to accomplish a better recovery factor requires an investment of US$35 billion, which is 
expected to result in 3,400 million boe by 2020. Our development plan is mainly concentrated on certain current fields including: Castilla, Chichimene, Apiay, 
Casabe, La Cira-Infantas, Rubiales, Quifa, Putumayo, Arauca and Catatumbo. Incorporation of proved reserves (1P) of crude oil equivalent between 2011 - 
2020 is estimated at 6,200 million gross barrels. The expected ROCE is 26%
Midstream and Downstream: We plan to make an investment in refining of US$9 billion for 2013–2020, which represents 11% of our Strategic Plan, 
to complete the modernization of the Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries. The ROCE is estimated at 8% for the period 2020 – 2025. We expect to invest 
US$4.5 billion in transportation and logistics in order to complete our network’s expansion, mainly through our participation in the Bicentenario Pipeline, the 
expansion of the Ocensa Pipeline, increasing the evacuation capacity from the Magdalena Medio crudes and the enlargement of the Pozos Colorados – Galán 
system. The ROCE is estimated at 11% by 2020.
The investments that our Strategic Plan envisions are subject to market analysis, conceptual engineering and financial feasibility. We currently expect 
to fund the investments contemplated by our Strategic Plan as follows: 75% from our cash generation from operations, 11% from a primary equity issuance and 
14% from debt. We believe that we should be able to access local and international debt markets if the need arises, although we can make no assurances that 
these external sources of financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – Liquidity 
and Capital Resources.” We are also authorized by Law 1118 of 2006 to issue up to 20% of additional equity, of which we have so far issued 11.51%, leaving 
us with the ability to issue an additional 8.49%, which could be used as an additional source of funding for our Strategic Plan. In our Strategic Plan, we have 
adopted a conservative criteria that does not take into account the high prices on the market and long-term estimates about the West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, 
and Brent prices, whereby we used a fixed price of US$80 per barrel for WTI reference and $90 for Brent reference. We further assume and expect that the 
dividend payout ratio will be close to 70% which, compared to other global oil and gas companies, surpasses the average of between 35-50%. Our Strategic 
Plan assumes a profitability close to 17% of ROCE by 2020.
We expect to meet the goals of our Strategic Plan together with our joint venture partners with whom we have built long-term relationships. We are
also working on making progress on our Strategic Plan with foreign governmental authorities in countries where we already have operations or where we intend 
to develop operations.
In addition, we maintain strategic initiatives with respect to each of our different segments, as outlined below.
Exploration and Production 
  
Become an international player with the capacity to incorporate reserves and increase production of crude oil and natural gas in a sustainable way
We aim to develop a competitive advantage in heavy crudes, increasing our capacity to add reserves and produce oil and gas in a sustainable way. Our
2012 review of our Strategic Plan confirmed our assessment that we believe we have the potential to produce 1.3 gross million boepd by 2020 from our 
operations in Colombia and abroad. Furthermore, in the near term we plan to continue to focus on infill drilling and water injection projects and continue to 
develop the enhanced oil recovery technology. In 2012, capital expenditures amounted to Ps$8.2 trillion (approximately US$ 4.5 billion) in our Exploration and 
Production segment.
27
National Exploration: We expect to invest in 3D seismic and stratigraphic wells, as well as to explore prospects in other materials, especially in the
heavy crude belt located in the Llanos, Caguan-Putumayo and Piedemonte Llanero regions. We believe there is a likelihood of finding oil and gas in the 
Caribbean offshore, especially in the north area. However, we expect offshore exploration in the Caribbean to contribute to production starting around 2020.
International Exploration: We continue to believe that the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil exhibit a high potential for exploration and production growth. In
the Gulf of Mexico, we intend to focus on the following plays: Miocene subsalt, Paleogene and Jurassic. Ecopetrol is also seeking to balance the risk of its 
investment portfolio with short-term development projects. In Brazil, our focus is on the Santos and Ecuatorian borders as well as the Presal Plays.
Conventional Hydrocarbons: With higher certainty and a better understanding of the risks associated with this segment, production of conventional 
hydrocarbons could reach 1.1 gross million boepd by 2020. We have assessed potential improvements in our recovery factor, mainly through the use of infill 
drilling and water-injection methodologies which, we believe, have fewer associated risks and better economic results.
Unconventional Hydrocarbons: In our 2012 Strategic Plan, we gave more emphasis to the potential presented by unconventional reservoirs, as defined
by the Colombian law, including shale oil, shale gas and tight reservoirs, among others. 
  
Refining and Petrochemicals 
  
Produce cleaner and more valuable products, ensuring profitability through synergies and taking advantage of market opportunities by adding greater value to 
the refining streams while increasing production of petrochemicals.
For 2012, capital expenditures in our Refining and Petrochemical segment were Ps$ 4.4 trillion (approximately US$2.4 billion). 
  
Refining: We seek to be the competitive choice in Colombia for products supply, intending to meet a ROCE of 8% for the period 2020 – 2025. We aim
to complete modernization projects at our refineries that encourage value creation and operational excellence with a particular focus on: (1) ensuring the 
completion of the projects at Barrancabermeja and Cartagena refineries, (2) developing our reputation as producer of clean fuels, and capitalizing and 
developing market opportunities within the local, regional and international markets, (3) becoming the preferred alternative for raw material supply within the 
petrochemical business, (4) growing sustainably and profitably by turning heavy crude oils into our competitive advantage, maximizing their worth in the chain 
and optimizing their performance to achieve the expected value of projects, (5) refining margin maximization by optimizing the integrated performance within 
the supply chain, and (6) finding opportunities to use raw materials, supplies and technologies that add value and align with the regulatory framework and 
business competitive development.
Petrochemical: Our strategy will focus on consolidating our current position in the market, and improving the competitiveness and reliability of our
existing infrastructure, identifying feasible options for a cost-efficient operation, maximizing the margin of our petrochemicals through integrated performance 
optimization in our supply chain and seeking alternatives that allow us to guarantee the availability and logistics for competitive raw materials within the 
petrochemical industry. 
  
Transportation and Logistics 
  
Foster profitable growth and development across the entire value chain
Our strategy for transportation and logistics seeks to turn this sector into a facilitator for the development of the entire value chain, providing solutions,
ensuring the efficiency of crude oil flows and their derivatives for use by our company and for third parties. During 2012, capital expenditures in our 
Transportation and Logistics segment amounted to Ps$ 2.7 trillion (approximately US$ 1.5 billion).
We aim to accomplish: (1) an increase in the total capacity of crude oil transportation by more than 100%, from 850 thousand to 1.7 million barrels per
day, (2) an increase in the total capacity of refining products transportation by 65%, from 415 thousand to 680 thousand barrels per day, (3) diversification of 
our risks and investments through strategic alliances with system users and third parties, (4) development of our customer service for internal and external 
clients, (5) profitable growth with 11% ROCE by 2020 and (6) leveraging of our competitive advantage in heavy crude oil.
28
Create a new transportation subsidiary
In June 2012, we incorporated Cenit as a wholly-owned subsidiary specializing in logistics and transportation of hydrocarbons within Colombia. With
the incorporation of Cenit, we aim to enhance the strategic and logistical framework of Colombia’s oil industry in response to the increase in hydrocarbon 
production and higher sales of crudes and refined products, both within Colombia and on the international markets. Cenit is expected to operate with an open 
model in which all interested parties will have the opportunity to access its transportation infrastructure. See “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—
Transportation and Logistics—Cenit.” 
  
Marketing and Supply 
  
Focus on the importance of the market and clients and define our key products and markets
Our Strategic Plan sets out guidelines for sales and marketing that cut across our operational areas and emphasizes the importance of defining our
markets, our clients and the need to define key products. Our strategy is focused on supplying the local market and exporting crude oil, refined products, 
petrochemical products and natural gas to end-users, including refineries and wholesalers, in order to improve our margins. We also intend to increase our 
market participation in crude oil and refined products in Asia and Europe. 
  
Develop and consolidate the Corporate Group’s basket of products through alternative energy
We intend to participate in the Colombian renewable energy market in partnership with local investors, with whom we have undertaken the
development of refineries to process sugar cane and palm oil for biofuels. We plan to produce 450 thousand tons of biofuels by 2020 (including biodiesel from 
Ecodiesel Colombia S.A., or Ecodiesel, in which we have a 50% share, and ethanol from Bioenergy S.A.).
OVERVIEW BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
Exploration and Production 
  
Summary 
  
Our exploration and production business segment includes exploration, development and production activities in Colombia and abroad. We began local
exploration in 1955 and international exploration in 2006. We conduct exploration and production activities directly and through joint ventures with third 
parties. As of December 31, 2012, we were the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas, the largest operator and we maintained the largest acreage under 
exploration in Colombia.

We have divided Ecopetrol S.A.’s production activities in Colombia into six administrative regions. The administrative regions, and their respective
2012 production results, prior to deducting royalties, are as follows:
Northeastern Region – The Northeastern region is comprised of two areas: one located in the north of Colombia along the Atlantic coast and the other
located in the Piedemonte Llanero. The Northeastern region covers approximately 541,404 acres and includes the natural gas fields located at La Guajira and the 
crude oil and natural gas fields located in Cusiana-Cupiagua. In 2012, the Northeastern region had a total production of approximately 47.8 thousand bpd of 
crude oil, 548.1 million cubic feet per day or mcfpd of natural gas and 3.2 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process.
Mid-Magdalena Valley Region – The Mid-Magdalena Valley region runs along the Magdalena river valley and covers approximately 997,839 acres. It 
includes the crude oil fields located in the Santander department and part of the Antioquia, Cesar and Boyacá departments near the Barrancabermeja refinery. In 
2012, the Mid-Magdalena Valley region had a total production of approximately 100.3 thousand bpd of heavy and light crude oil, 33.7 mcfpd of natural gas and 
1.6 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process.
Central Region – For the year 2012 this region was divided in two: the Central Region and the Eastern Region. The Central region includes the western
part of the Meta department. It covers approximately 74,264 acres and in 2012 had a total production of approximately 177.9 thousand bpd of heavy and 
medium crude oil, 0.5 mcfpd of natural gas and 1.5 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process.
Eastern Region – The Eastern region is located in Colombia’s central area and includes the northeastern and eastern part of the Meta department.
While this administrative region was formally created in October 2011, it completed its first full year in operation at the end of 2012. Operations in this region 
are made up mainly of joint venture fields that originally belonged to the Central Region. It covers approximately 645,093 acres and in 2012 had a total 
production of approximately 130.4 thousand bpd of heavy and medium crude oil.
Catatumbo-Orinoquía Region – The Catatumbo-Orinoquía region is located in the eastern part of Colombia and runs along the border with Venezuela,
The map below indicates the location of our operations in Colombia.
covering approximately 1,197,310 acres. It includes the Caño Limón crude oil field, with a total production in 2012 of approximately 69.6 thousand bpd of 
crude oil, 2.6 mcfpd of natural gas and 0.04 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process.
Southern Region – The Southern region is located on the southwestern region of Colombia and covers approximately 917,781 acres. It includes the 
Orito, Guando and Tello and San Francisco fields located mainly in the Cundinamarca, Huila and Putumayo departments. In 2012, the Southern region had a 
total production of approximately 56.9 thousand bpd of crude oil, 5.9 mcfpd of natural gas and 0.5 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process.
In addition to the administrative regions mentioned above, we have established a minor fields area that covers some of our smaller fields throughout 
Colombia. The main purpose of this minor fields area is to establish strategies to improve efficiency in the production of reserves from these fields. The total 
production of the minor fields area during 2012 was 5.9 thousand bpd of crude oil and 3.3 mcfpd of natural gas. This production corresponds to fields located in 
the Mid-Magdalena Valley, Central, Catatumbo-Orinoquía and the Southern regions.
31
Our exploration plan in Colombia is focused on exploration of existing production sites in close proximity, exploration of currently producing basins 
and exploration of frontier areas, including off-shore areas primarily operated by our business partners, which we believe have the potential for large findings. 
Our exploration strategy outside of Colombia is focused on locating prospects and establishing joint ventures with experienced operators.
During 2012, we drilled 23 gross wildcats exploratory wells (A3-A2), 15 in Colombia and eight overseas.  A2 exploratory wells are drilled adjacent to 
and at deeper or at shallower depths than proven oil deposits in a productive oil field. We drill A3 exploratory wells to find oil deposits in fields where no wells 
have yet proven productive. We discovered hydrocarbon presence in 11 productive wells, of which nine are located in Colombia and two in the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Ten wells were dry, of which five were located in Colombia and five overseas. As of December 31, 2012, two wells were under evaluation, of which one is 
located in Colombia and the remaining one in Brazil. 
  
Exploration Activities in Colombia
We conduct exploration in Colombia on our own and through joint ventures with regional and global oil and gas companies. We also benefit from sole
risk contracts when commercial reserves are found. In the case of sole risk contracts, we do not take any exploration risk. See “Contractual Arrangements for 
the Exploration and Production of Crude Oil and Natural Gas in Colombia.”
In 2012, we acquired 2,590 equivalent kilometers of seismic data in Colombia, including 935 equivalent kilometers acquired by Hocol. Ecopetrol S.A.
acquired 1,655 equivalent kilometers, corresponding to 229.7 kilometers of 2D seismic and 1,425.7 equivalent kilometers of 3D seismic data.  Ecopetrol 
directly acquired 748 of those kilometers of seismic and 907 kilometers were acquired by our business partners.
Ecopetrol S.A. drilled a total of seven wildcats exploratory wells (A3-A2) in 2012. Evidence of hydrocarbons was discovered in five of the wells 
(Tisquirama Este-1, Caronte, Aullador-1, Embrujo-1 ST-2 and Mapalé). One well was dry and the remaining were under evaluation. Hocol drilled eight A3 
wells. Evidence of hydrocarbons was found in four of the Hocol wells (Pintado, Dorcas, Mamey and Merlín 6), while the other four were dry.
During 2012, Ecopetrol S.A. signed 12 exploration and production contracts with the ANH and business partners corresponding to blocks awarded to
Ecopetrol S.A. in the Colombia Open Round 2012. These blocks cover a total area of more than four million hectares and are located in the Llanos (provinces of 
Arauca, Casanare and Meta), Mid-Magdalena Valley (Cundinamarca and Caldas provinces) and Sinu-San Jacinto (Antioquia and Cordoba provinces) basins, 
and the Guajira offshore field. Ecopetrol S.A. has a 100% stake in six of the contracts. 
  
Exploration Activities Outside of Colombia
Our international exploration strategy is focused on participating in bidding rounds to secure blocks available for exploration and entering into joint
ventures with international and regional oil companies. We believe exploring outside Colombia allows us to diversify our risks and improve the possibilities of 
increasing our crude oil and natural gas reserves.
In 2012, we drilled eight international gross exploratory wells through our subsidiaries and partners as follows: 
  
•
Brazil: During the second half of 2012, a concession in which Ecopetrol Brasil is a partner, drilled three wells. Ecopetrol Brasil thus acquired a 
30% interest in the blocks BM-S-72 (the Sabiá prospect), BM-S-63 (the Canário prospect) and BM-S-71 (the Jandaia prospect), operated by Vanco 
(with a 40% working interest), Brasoil and Panoro (each with 15% working interest). As of December 31, 2012, Sabiá and Canário were declared 
dry and Jandaia was under evaluation.
• Gulf of Mexico: Ecopetrol America drilled three wells in the Gulf of Mexico, two of which encountered hydrocarbons and one was declared dry. 
The Parmer well was drilled with our partners Apache Deepwater LLC, as operator, and Stone Energy Offshore LLC. Ecopetrol America has a 
30% working interest in this well. The second discovery was the Dalmatian well, in which Ecopetrol America has a 30% working interest, drilled 
with our partner Murphy Exploration and Production Company, as operator. Ecopetrol America had a 30% working interest in the Candy Bars 
well, with our partner Statoil as operator, which was declared dry.

•
Peru: Savía Perú S.A., or Savía Perú, in which we have a 50% ownership interest, drilled two wells off the Peruvian coast. As of December 31, 
2012, these wells showed presence of hydrocarbons but were commercially unsuccessful.
As of December 31, 2012, we acquired 23,908 kilometers of additional seismic equivalent: 13,908 kilometers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and 10,000
kilometers in Brazil, an increase of 18.7% compared with seismic data as of December 31, 2011.

Production
As part of our Strategic Plan, we take into account the increase of the recovery factor in the fields currently held by Ecopetrol S.A., including those that
were discovered more than 20 years ago. Our target is to invest in these fields in order to increase our average daily production of hydrocarbons and reserves. 
Around 88% of the fields of Ecopetrol S.A. are in primary recovery. Secondary recovery (waterflooding) is or has been implemented in 8% of the fields. 
Finally, tertiary or enhanced oil recovery has been applied in 4% of the fields. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the productivity ratio of several 
directly operated fields and other fields currently held through joint ventures with other oil companies. All figures for crude oil and natural gas production are 
shown prior to deducting royalties, except when specifically stated otherwise.
Our total average consolidated daily production of hydrocarbons in 2012, prior to deducting royalties, totaled 754 thousand boepd, of which 635
thousand bpd corresponded to crude oil and 119 thousand boepd corresponded to natural gas. This production includes the production contribution from our 
subsidiaries and affiliates, Hocol, Equion, Ecopetrol America Inc. and Savía Perú on the basis of our participation. Ecopetrol S.A.’s production amounted to 
93.1% of total consolidated production, Hocol 3.3%, Equion 2.4%, Savía Perú 0.9% and Ecopetrol America 0.3%.
34
During 2012, we produced 745 thousand boepd in Colombia through Ecopetrol S.A., Hocol and Equion, out of which 627 thousand boepd
corresponded to crude oil and 118 thousand boepd corresponded to natural gas.
During 2011, our consolidated average daily production of hydrocarbons totaled 724 thousand boepd, out of which 616 thousand bpd corresponded to 
crude oil and 108 thousand boepd corresponded to natural gas. In 2010, our consolidated average daily production of hydrocarbons totaled 616 thousand boepd, 
out of which 516 thousand bpd corresponded to crude oil and 100 thousand boepd corresponded to natural gas.
Ecopetrol S.A.’s crude oil production during 2012 consisted of approximately 48% light and medium crudes (above 15º American Petroleum Institute,
or API, gravity) and 52% of heavy crudes, with a gravity equal or lower than API gravity 15°. In 2011, approximately 51% of the crude oil production 
corresponded to light and medium crudes while the remaining 49% to heavy crudes. During 2010, production distribution was approximately 56% of light and 
medium crudes and 44% of heavy crudes.
As of December 31, 2012, we were the largest participant in the Colombian hydrocarbons industry, with approximately 66% of crude oil production
and approximately 58% of natural gas production. Our production volume in 2012 in Colombia includes Ecopetrol S.A. and Hocol’s production along with our 
share in Equion’s production.
We undertake development drilling in producing regions, drilling 210 gross development wells operated by us in Colombia in 2012, 27% less than in
2011 and 4% less than in 2010. Of the total gross development wells drilled by Ecopetrol S.A. and through joint ventures in 2012, 16 wells were dry in the 
Eastern Region, two in the minor fields, one in the Catatumbo Orinoquía Region, one in the Mid-Magdalena Valley Region and one was dry in the Southern 
Region. In 2011, Ecopetrol S.A. had seven dry development wells and in 2010 it had three.
35
The following table sets forth the number of gross and net productive and dry development wells drilled exclusively by us and in joint ventures for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Production Activities in Colombia
Our average daily production of crude oil in Colombia reached 627 thousand bpd in 2012, a 2.9% increase compared to 2011. The increase in our
average daily production is due to a 7.7% increase in production from fields operated by us, which totaled 349 thousand bpd in 2012 compared to 324 thousand 
bpd in 2011.
36
During 2011, we had an average daily production of crude oil of 609 thousand bpd of crude oil, which represents a 19.9% growth compared to 2010.
This increase was due to (1) a 19.7% increase in production from fields developed with our business partners, which totaled 285 thousand bpd in 2011 from 238 
thousand bpd in 2010, and (2) a 20.0% increase in production from fields operated by us, for a total of 324 thousand bpd in 2011 compared to 270 thousand bpd 
in 2010.

We consider as crude oil wells those which main operation is directed towards oil production, although many of these wells produce gas associated
with oil production that, in some cases, have a commercial purpose. Natural gas wells are those which operations are directed only towards production of 
commercial gas. The above table reflects the productive wells that directly contribute to hydrocarbons production, and therefore excludes wells used for 
injection, disposal, captation, or other similar activities.

Light Crude Oil
•
Natural Gas
Purchases of crude oil from the ANH and our business partners are allocated to our Marketing and Supply segment.
Light crude oil has API gravity 35° or higher and tends to have a higher sales price in the international market. We develop and produce light crude oil 
in the Cusiana, Cupiagua, Pauto, Floreña and Rancho Hermoso fields. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, Ecopetrol S.A.’s production of light crude oil (on a stand-
alone basis) was 60 thousand, 61 thousand and 48 thousand bpd, respectively. 
  
Heavy Crude Oil
We consider heavy crudes as those with API gravity below 15°. Ecopetrol S.A. (on a stand-alone basis) develops, upgrades and produces heavy crude
in the Central, Eastern and Mid-Magdalena Valley regions. Ecopetrol S.A.’s production of heavy crude oil increased from 24 thousand bpd in 2000 to 304 
thousand bpd in 2012 and production from 2011 to 2012 increased 9.1% as a result of the development of the Rubiales, Castilla and Chichimene fields. In 2011, 
Ecopetrol S.A.’s production of heavy crudes amounted to 278 thousand bpd, compared to 210 thousand bpd produced in 2010, mainly as a result of the 
development of the same fields. We are committed to developing our heavy crude reserves as they are a key element of our growth strategy.
Our most important heavy crude oil projects are: 
  
•
Cubarral. The Cubarral block is located in the Central region and is comprised of the Castilla and Chichimene fields. Together, these fields in 
2012 produced approximately 156 thousand bpd, a 9.9% increase compared with 2011 production.
Rubiales - Quifa. The Rubiales and Quifa fields are located in the Eastern region and are developed in joint venture with Metapetroleum. The 
Rubiales and Quifa fields increased our production from 113.2 thousand bpd in 2011 to 124.9 thousand bpd in 2012. In 2011, we, along with 
Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp., started the Synchronized Thermal Additional Recovery, or STAR, technology pilot project in the Quifa field to 
begin testing the use of in situ combustion-based technology which is expected to increase the recovery factor in Colombia’s heavy oil fields.
In 2012, our average daily production of natural gas in Colombia reached 118 thousand boepd, a 9.3% increase when compared to 2011 production.
When compared to 2010, natural gas production increased by 9.1% in 2011.

 (1) Conversion between mcfpd and boepd is performed at 5,700 mcfpd to 1 boepd.
(2) The Eastern region is included for 2012, the first full year in which it operated its fields after its creation in 2011.
(3) Equion production figures correspond to its equivalent daily productions since its month of acquisition.
40
Northeastern Region
The largest production of natural gas in Colombia is located in the Northeastern region, which we develop primarily under joint venture contracts. We
developed the Guajira natural gas reserves with our partner Chevron. The Cusiana reserve is developed along with Equion and Total. Additionally, Ecopetrol 
S.A. directly operated the reserves in the Cupiagua field.
Natural gas production in the Northeastern region averaged 548.1 mcfpd and 3.2 bpd of liquids from the natural gas process in 2012. The natural gas 
produced from these fields is used to supply local demand and to meet our commitments to supply natural gas to Venezuela. See “—Marketing and Supply—
Natural Gas Distribution.” We continue re-injection of natural gas in the Cusiana field. This production outcome was leveraged by Chuchupa and Ballena assets 
operated by Chevron, which represented a production of 339.0 mcfpd in 2012 and 363.3 mcfpd in 2011. 
  
Lifting and Production Costs
Our consolidated average production costs on a Peso basis increased to Ps$23,088 during 2012 from Ps$21,605 during 2011 and Ps$18,940 during
2010, mainly due to: (1) increased costs from joint ventures, related to higher volumes of water production and related disposal costs, (2) high-price clauses in 
our joint venture agreements, which assign additional production to us when oil prices are higher than a reference price (the “High-Price Clauses”), (3) a 2.62% 
increase in production volumes and (4) an increase in direct operation costs. Our consolidated average lifting costs on a dollar basis increased to US$11.93 in 
2012 from US$10.43 in 2011 and US$9.83 in 2010, as a result of the above-mentioned factors and a 2.7% appreciation of the average exchange rate of the Peso 
against the U.S. dollar.
Our consolidated average lifting costs differ from our consolidated average production costs because our lifting costs do not include costs related to
self-consumption of hydrocarbons included in the production process, such as by our small refineries and natural gas liquid plants.
The following table sets forth our crude oil and natural gas average sales price, aggregate average lifting costs and aggregate average unit production
costs for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

(1) Corresponds to our average sales price on a consolidated basis.
(2) Unit production costs correspond to consolidated average costs on total production volumes net of royalties. Production costs do not include costs related to
transport, commercialization and administrative expenses.
(3) Lifting costs per barrel are calculated based on total production, which are net of royalties, and correspond to our lifting costs on a consolidated basis.
(4) We calculate aggregate average lifting cost by taking our production cost and dividing it by our produced volumes net of royalties as the denominator.
  
Reserves 
  
Our proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas, net of royalties to the Nation, at December 31 2012, totaled 1,876.7 million boe, which represents a
1.1% increase from the 1,856.7 million boe registered in 2011. Our crude oil proved reserves in 2012 were 1,370.3 million barrels of crude oil and, in 2011, 
1,371.0 million barrels. Our natural gas proved reserves increased to 2,886 billion cubic feet, or bcf, from 2,768 bcf of reserves in 2011. In 2011, our proved 
reserves increased 8% from the 1,714 million boe registered in 2010. The increase in our reserves in 2012 is mainly due to (1) a 44.2 million boe increase 
corresponding to revisions of previous estimates, (2) a 65.3 million boe increase corresponding to improved recovery, (3) a 142.8 million boe increase 
corresponding to extensions and discoveries and (4) a 232.4 million boe decrease corresponding to production.

Hydrocarbon reserves were calculated in accordance with SEC regulations and the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or
FASB. Ecopetrol’s reserves process is supervised and coordinated by the Director of Reserves, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. The Reserves 
Directorate is comprised of reserves coordinators, who are petroleum engineers with experience of more than 15 years in reservoir characterization, field 
development, estimation and reporting of reserves and that have supervision and supporting responsibilities with the professionals involved in the estimation 
and reporting process.
Reserves are first estimated internally. This process is supervised and coordinated by the corporate manager of reservoirs, a geologist who holds a 
master’s degree in geology and has more than 20 years of experience in projects associated with reservoir characterization and development, estimation, and 
reporting of reserves. The employees involved in the reserves process meet the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or SPE, qualifications for reserves estimators. 
Internally estimated reserves are submitted to an external audit process, which was conducted by the External Engineers (Ryder Scott, DeGolyer and 
MacNaughton and Gaffney, Cline & Associates). These firms have audited 99% of our total net proved reserves for 2012, 2011, and 2010. According to our 
corporate policy, we report the reserves values obtained from the External Engineers.
The reserves process ends when the Reserves Directorate consolidates the results and presents them to the Reserves Committee, whose members are
the Chief Financial Officer, the Exploration and Production Executive Vice-President and the Vice-President of Strategy. Results are presented to the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors and finally approved by the Board of Directors.
The audit process was conducted in accordance with SEC definitions and rules set forth in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X and the disclosure
guidelines contained in the SEC’s Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting final rule dated December 31, 2008 and effective as of January 1, 2010. The 
information presented below and elsewhere in this annual report is based on an external audit of 99% of our total reserves, prepared by the External Engineers 
under SEC definitions and rules. The remaining 1% corresponds to our own internal calculations, conducted using SEC definitions and rules, as described 
above. Our crude oil and natural gas net proved reserves include reserves from our subsidiaries located in the United States (Gulf of Mexico) and Peru, and 
Equión and Hocol’s assets in Colombia.
The reserves information presented in this section is based on the SEC’s definitions and rules used for U.S. GAAP purposes. See “Item 5. Operating
and Financial Review and Prospects—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Oil and Gas Reserves” and Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements.

The above-referenced reserve amounts, net of royalty payments to the Nation, are the same amounts used to reconcile Note 35 to our consolidated
financial statements under FASB ASC 932.
The Company’s revisions, on a consolidated basis, during 2012 amounted to 44.2 million boe, corresponding primarily to the following: 
  
•
Pauto Field: Sales of liquids from the natural gas process, volumes associated with our gas processing plant, better production performance and 
new development projects focused in gas conversion activities and drilling, representing a 19.4 million boe increase.
•
Caño Limón Field: Better production performance, representing a 13.9 million boe increase.
43
The revisions described above represented 75% of the additions to reserves revisions in 2012, while the revisions with respect to the remaining 10.9
million boe resulted from varying increases and decreases from a variety of fields, including Apiay, Quifa and others.
The Company’s improved recovery during 2012 amounted to 65.3 million boe, which corresponded mainly to new proved areas under waterflooding in
the La Cira-Infantas, Casabe and Tibu fields.
The Company’s extensions and discoveries during 2012 amounted to 142.8 million boe, which corresponded to 16.2 million boe of newly discovered
fields and 126.6 million boe of extensions of proved acreage. The newly discovered fields corresponded mainly to Ecopetrol S.A.’s Cajua, Chipiron fields, 
Hocol’s Mamey-Bonga fields and Ecopetrol America’s Dalmatian field.
In terms of extensions of proved acreage (126.6 million boe) in 2012, 70% was associated with activities in the following fields: 25.5 million boe was
associated with the Castilla field, where the Company plans additional drilling activities in order to cover new proved areas, 47.8 million boe was associated 
with new sales agreements permitting increases in future gas sales in the Cupiagua field and 15.4 million boe was associated with new proved areas in the Quifa 
and Chichimene fields. The remaining 30% corresponds to smaller changes in several other fields.
In terms of proved undeveloped reserves, during 2012 the Company added approximately 101 million boe and converted 212 million boe. Total proved 
undeveloped reserves decreased by 111.5 million boe to 498.5 million boe at December 31, 2012 when compared to 610 million boe at December 31, 2011. At 
December 31, 2012, 88% of our total proved undeveloped reserves corresponded to crude oil.
The additions in the Company’s proved undeveloped reserves in 2012 correspond to revisions of previous estimates (17%), improved recovery (26%) 
and extensions and discoveries (57%). Revisions of previous estimates correspond primarily to variations in economic factors, adjustments based on production 
behavior and updated development plans in several fields, mainly in Pauto, Caño Limon, Apiay and Quifa.
The increases due to improved recovery are associated mainly with the waterflood projects of the La Cira Infantas, Casabe and Tibu fields, as
described above. The Company’s extensions and discoveries relate mainly to extensions of proved acreage, corresponding to projects previously described in 
the Castilla, Cupiagua, Chichimene and Quifa fields.
Of the total amount of proved undeveloped reserves that we had at the end of 2011 (610 million boe), we converted approximately 212 million boe, or 
35%, to proved developed reserves during 2012, which resulted mainly from (1) crude oil projects, primarily associated with the development of heavy crude oil 
fields in Castilla, Rubiales, Chichimene and Quifa in the Central region, which represented approximately 59% of the total conversion and (2) availability of a 
new compression facilities for gas processing in the Chuchupa field, which represented 18% of the total conversion. The remaining 23% is associated with 
development execution in other fields such as the Casabe, Cira Infantas, Apiay fields, among others. The amount of investment made during 2012 to convert 
proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves was US$2,155 million. 
  
Present Activities
During the first quarter of 2013, Ecopetrol S.A. drilled five stratigraphic wells, out of which two exhibited evidence of hydrocarbons (Segua 1 and
Circe 1). In addition, two wells evidenced hydrocarbon presence (Pastinaca 1 and Venus 2), from a total of three A3/A2 wells drilled by Ecopetrol S.A.
During the first quarter of 2013, Hocol drilled one A3/A2 well (Canario Sur 1) which evidenced presence of hydrocarbons. 
  
Regarding offshore activity, Ecopetrol America placed the most competitive bids for six blocks in the “Central Planning Area Lease Sale 227” round 
held in New Orleans.  Ecopetrol America partnered with Murphy Exploration and Production in two blocks; with Anadarko US Offshore Corporation, MCX 
Gulf of Mexico LLC and JX Nippon Oil Exploration (U.S.A) Limited in two blocks, and in two blocks Ecopetrol America has 100% interest.

Contractual Arrangements for the Exploration and Production of Crude Oil and Natural Gas in Colombia
To address the country’s exploration and production needs, Colombia has modified the contractual regime governing the exploration, development and
production of hydrocarbons on a number of occasions since its introduction in 1970. The exploration and production contracts entered into with our business 
partners provide for the production split, the length of the exploration and production terms, and royalty payments.
Under Colombian law, an existing contract cannot be modified because of a change to the contractual regime, except in the case of public order
regulations. As a result, contracts that were executed prior to the issuance of a new contractual regime remain in full force and are not affected by the 
subsequent regime. At December 31, 2012, we were party to 114 agreements with partners and 27 exploration and production agreements with the ANH in 
which we do not have any partners.
Under joint venture contracts entered into before March 1994, which include the Cusiana and Cupiagua crude oil fields, among others, the private
investor explored a previously agreed upon area at its own risk and expense. Thereafter, we had the option to become a joint venture partner by reimbursing the 
investor 50% of the exploration costs of oil wells within commercially viable fields and 50% interest of all future development costs related to those fields. 
Once we became a partner, we had a 50% interest in the production of the field. If we decided not to become a joint venture partner within a certain period of 
time, the private investor had the right to enter into a sole risk contract for the field’s crude oil production until it had recovered 200% of its investment and 
100% of its total costs. Thereafter, we could participate in the development of the field and all future costs and expenses were automatically shared with our 
partner, as if we had elected to become a joint venture partner in the field.
Beginning in 1994, modifications were made to standard joint venture contracts to maintain the private investor’s share of production at 50% until
aggregate production exceeded 60 million barrels. Thereafter, our share increased gradually, up to a maximum of 70% of production. In 1995, further 
modifications to the standard joint venture contracts required us to pay for half of the exploration costs, not only for wells that ultimately proved to be 
productive, but also for dry wells, stratigraphic wells and seismic exploration in fields that became commercially viable. The modifications also provided for 
competitive bidding for the right to explore and develop marginal fields (defined according to certain technical, financial and operational criteria). In the bidding 
process, private companies presented bids based on percentages of production they would pay us in exchange for the rights to develop these fields. Winning 
bidders were responsible for all future investment and operating costs related to the field.
The standard joint venture contract was once again modified in 1997 in order to promote private sector activity in the development of inactive areas
and small fields and in the exploration for natural gas. These modifications extended the exploration periods, increased the levels of reimbursement for private 
companies’ exploration costs and provided for the reimbursement of exploration costs in real terms and denominated in U.S. dollars.
In 1999, Colombia adopted two additional modifications to the standard terms, applicable to new joint venture contracts: 
  
•
Reduction of Our Initial Participation. Our initial participation under the joint venture contracts signed after this reform, was reduced from 50% to 
30%. As of December 31, 2012, we had 37 joint venture contracts outstanding in which our participation was greater than or equal to 50%, and 17 
joint venture agreements where our participation was less than 50%.
• Modified R Factor. The Government modified the formula used to determine the increase in our share of total production, or the R Factor. The R
Factor is calculated by dividing accumulated revenues in cash by investments and costs. If the R Factor increases above a certain profitability 
threshold, then our share of production increases above the initial 30%. Pursuant to the 1999 modifications, we raised the profitability threshold at 
which the R Factor triggers an increase in our share from 1.0 to 1.5. Additionally, the R Factor was calculated prior to the 1999 modifications in 
constant U.S. dollars. The new calculation method was designed to prevent inflation from causing an increase in the R Factor and a corresponding 
increase in our share.
We have also entered into various types of arrangements in connection with our own crude oil and natural gas exploration and production projects.
These arrangements include: risk participation contracts, incremental production agreements, shared risk production contracts, risk services production 
contracts, discovered undeveloped fields contracts and sole risk contracts.

•
•
Risk-Participation Contracts. Under these contracts, we assume 20% of the exploration costs and risks at the beginning of the second year in 
exchange for a larger participation in the future production and equal representation on the executive committee of the joint venture. At December 
31, 2012, we had four risk participation contracts in effect.
Incremental Production Agreements. We currently have two types of incremental production agreements, the standard incremental production 
agreements, or SIPAs, and the development of incremental production project agreements, or DIPAs.
Under SIPAs, we calculate the total number of proved developed reserves available in a specific field or well and then establish a base production 
curve for the reserves. Any future production exceeding the curve, which we refer to as incremental production, results from extracting proved undeveloped 
reserves or probable reserves which require additional investments funded by our partners under the SIPA. We have the right to a previously specified 
percentage of the incremental production. Our percentage participation varies depending on the total amount invested by our partners and on the R Factor which 
cannot be lower than 1.5. The volume produced under the production curve is not shared with our partners. At December 31, 2012, we had five SIPAs in effect.
Under DIPAs, we must file a request with the Ministry of Mines and Energy to approve an incremental production project for a field that we directly 
operate. If the project is approved, we agree with our partners to develop the field and we determine mandatory investment thresholds for our partners. We are 
not required to fund any investment. The production from the field is distributed to us and our partners receive a percentage of the total production from the 
field that varies depending on the invested amount. Once the mandatory investment stage expires, we agree with our partners on the percentage of production, 
total costs and additional investments to be paid by each party. We pay 20% royalties to the Nation on the base production curve and variable royalties on any 
incremental production. Additionally, in the event of higher prices and large volumes, we have adjustment clauses to increase our share in the production. At 
December 31, 2012, we had one DIPA in effect.
ownership of 100% reserves.

•
•
•
Shared-Risk Production Contracts. Under these contracts, we remain as operators of the field and assume responsibility for 50% of all investments 
and costs. Private oil companies submit bids to enter into agreements with us based upon the production percentage they will assign to us. The 
successful bidder has the right to enter into the shared risk contract with us. At December 31, 2012, we had two shared risk production contracts 
outstanding.
Risk Service Production Contracts. We began using the risk service production contract in January 1998 to increase production through the use of 
new technologies in crude oil fields then operated by our partners. All investments in new technologies were made by our partners who received a 
previously specified fee per barrel. At December 31, 2012, we had one risk service contract outstanding for the development of the Rancho 
Hermoso field located in the Mirador formation.
• Discovered Undeveloped Fields Contracts. We have entered into discovered undeveloped fields contracts to promote exploration by private
companies of both undeveloped and inactive fields. Under these contracts, the contracting party assumes all costs and expenses for the 
development and operation of a field in exchange for a certain amount of production. At December 31, 2012, we had 16 discovered undeveloped 
fields contracts outstanding, of which, at March 1, 2013, two were terminated .
Sole Risk Contracts. We have entered into sole risk operations, where we benefit from successful exploratory efforts. Our partner in such 
operations has the right to the field’s crude oil production until it has recovered the percentage (which varies according to the agreement) of its 
investment and of its total costs. Thereafter, we participate in the development of the field, and all the future costs and expenses are automatically 
shared with our partner as if we had selected to become a joint venture partner in the agreement. As of December 31, 2012, we had 17 sole risk 
operations.
At December 31, 2012 we also had the following agreements: 
  
• One Service and Technical Cooperation Contract with the Universidad Industrial de Santander for research and development of the Colorado Field
which was terminated on March 10, 2013; and
• One Technical Alliance Agreement with a service company to support the operation of Casabe field in which we maintain operations and
Current Joint Venture Contractual Regime
In 2004, the authority to enter into exploration and production contracts was assigned to the ANH under a different exploration and production 
contractual scheme. We became an operator like any other company, competing with all other regional and international oil companies in Colombia for 
exploration and production opportunities under the same conditions and without any special rights. Decree Law 1760 of 2003 gave us the right to maintain in 
effect all contracts we had entered into prior to January 1, 2004, as well as to have absolute discretion as to whether or not such contracts would be extended 
after their stated termination date. If we decide not to extend the contracts, the production rights and assets related to the relevant block will revert to us and we 
would have the right, at no additional cost, to exploit the associated reserves indefinitely. Contracts entered into by us after January 1, 2004 that are not 
extended by the ANH will revert to the ANH and not to us.
In 2004, the ANH introduced two new model contracts to replace the previously used joint venture contracts: the exploration and production contract
and the technical evaluation agreement.
Exploration and Production Contracts. Under exploration and production contracts the contractor, including us, assumes all exploration and 
production activities. The contractor also assumes all risks and costs of exploration and is the sole owner of all production and assets involved in 
the exploration and production activities for the term of the contract. There is no partnership or joint venture between the contractor and the ANH.
•
•
Technical Evaluation Agreements. The scope of technical evaluation agreements is limited to exploration activities. Under this type of agreement, 
the contractor can evaluate a specific area and decide whether or not it will enter into an exploration and production contract. The contractor 
assumes all risks and costs of the activities and operations.
In June 2010, the Santiago de las Atalayas Contract, one of the most significant exploration and production contracts based on crude oil and natural gas 
output and reserves, expired. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the right to develop and commercialize the existing crude oil and natural gas reserves in the 
Cupiagua and Cupiagua Sur fields reverted back to us.
We entered into several agreements or “Convenios” with the ANH in areas directly operated by Ecopetrol S.A., where Ecopetrol S.A. holds total
exploration and production rights up to the point when revenue from the well falls below the costs of operations set by the company (the “economic limit”). 
Article 2 of Decree 2288 of 2004 (a regulatory decree pursuant to Decree Law 1760 of 2003), establishes that the ANH shall determine the general criteria 
according to which the agreements pertaining to the areas directly operated by Ecopetrol shall be subscribed.
Agreements must also be entered into between Ecopetrol with the ANH according to Article 2 of Decree 2288 of 2004, when joint venture contracts
subscribed before December 31, 2003, expire during their production phase. The purpose of these agreements is to define the terms and conditions under which 
Ecopetrol S.A. can exercise its exclusive right of exploration and production of hydrocarbons—granted by Decree Law 1760 of 2003—in the agreement area 
until the economic limit. Annex I presents a list of those agreements (Convenios).
We have entered into a number of exploration and production contracts with regional and international oil companies. Annex II includes a list of our 
contracts still in force as of December 31, 2012 with a complete description of their main characteristics, and Annex III includes a list of our contracts still in 
force as of December 31, 2012, which are in the exploration phase, with a complete description of their main characteristics. 
  
Management of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Joint Ventures
Every crude oil and natural gas joint venture has an executive committee that makes all technical, financial and operational decisions. All major
decisions must be made unanimously. Although we do not operate a number of these joint ventures, we have an active role in the decision-making process and 
development of the projects. As a result, we have direct control over the development of joint ventures, even for those joint ventures in which we have less than 
a majority economic interest. 
  
Refining and Petrochemicals 
  
Summary
Our two main refineries in Colombia are the Barrancabermeja refinery, which we directly own and operate, and Reficar, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
which we also operate. We also own and operate two other minor refineries — Orito and Apiay. Our refineries produce a full range of refined products, 
including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and heavy fuel oils, among others.
47
In 2012, we invested Ps$4.4 trillion (approximately US$2.4 billion) in refining and petrochemicals, an increase compared to the Ps$3.0 trillion
(approximately US$1.5 billion) invested in 2011, mainly due to the investments related to the expansion and modernization of the Reficar refinery. Investments 
in Ecopetrol S.A. in 2012 included 45 different projects, such as re-conversion, upgrading, equipment replacement and environmental projects.

At Barrancabermeja, we produce a variety of fuels, such as regular and premium unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, jet fuel, aviation fuel, LPG,
fuel oil and sulfur. We also produce petrochemicals and industrial products, including, paraffin waxes, lube base oils, low-density polyethylene, aromatics, 
asphalts, alkylates, cyclohexane and aliphatic solvents, as well as refinery grade propylene. The Barrancabermeja refinery supplies approximately 70% of the 
fuels consumed in Colombia.
The average conversion ratio for Barrancabermeja during 2012 was 76.5%. The gross refining margin decreased from US$11.22 per barrel in 2011 to 
US$10.87 per barrel in 2012 mainly due to the higher cost of crude oil as a result of the better crude oil export prices for Ecopetrol, to which they are indexed.
Barrancabermeja is currently undergoing a modernization process, (the Barrancabermeja Refinery Modernization Project, or PMRB), which aims to
modernize the Barrancabermeja refinery to process heavy Colombian crudes and to upgrade its processing configuration from medium to deep conversion. 
During 2012, the PMRB continued to make progress towards beginning the contracting phase of the main components of the project and the modification of the 
Crude Unit U-250 to be developed in 2013. We also advanced our forestry and fauna sustainable resettlement, in compliance with the local environmental 
authority. The project is in the process of approval for its Environmental Management Plan, and once this license is obtained, a comprehensive review will be 
conducted to update its schedule.

The following table sets forth the production of refined products of Barrancabermeja for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
During 2012, we delivered 62.9 thousand bpd of low sulfur gasoline (less than 300 parts per million sulfur content) and 76.3 thousand bpd of low
sulfur diesel to meet existing fuel quality standards. We delivered two low sulfur diesel qualities in 2012—less than 50 and less than 500 parts per million sulfur 
content. 
  
Reficar
As part of our Strategic Plan, we expect to increase the competitiveness and profitability of Reficar through the modernization of its facilities and 
processes, and the improvement of its reliability. We plan to increase the refinery’s production capacity to 165 thousand bpd by 2014 and improve refining 
margins by processing lower cost heavy crude oils, raising the conversion ratio, and producing a higher quality product slate. We also expect to satisfy existing 
environmental regulations for fuels by reducing sulfur content in gasoline and diesel fuel, thus complying with national and international fuel standards.
On December 30, 2011, with approval from the Ministry of Finance, Reficar executed the project financing agreements for the expansion and
modernization of the Reficar refinery in the amount of US$3.5 billion with a repayment term of 14 years. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” During 2012, Reficar drew US$2.67 billion under these financial agreements.
In February 2013, Reficar requested contributions from Ecopetrol under the Construction Support Agreement in an amount of US$500 million, of
which US$250 million has already been provided, with the remaining amount to be supplied throughout the rest of the year. As the project’s budget and 
schedule are being revised, we may be required to provide additional funding in excess of this amount. Any increase in the project’s capital expenditures is 
expected to be funded under the Construction Support Agreement between Reficar and Ecopetrol.

The following table sets forth the production of refined products of Reficar for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
In 2012, production by Reficar decreased to 75.2 thousand bpd, from 78.2 thousand bpd in 2011. Reficar’s operation suffered an unplanned production
stoppage at the fluid Catalytic Unit – FCC, between February and May 2012. The turnaround of its FCC unit had been initially planned for 45 days. However, 
damages in the rotor of the cracking unit’s gas compressors lengthen the turnaround to 90.65 days, disturbing the production of gasoline, LPG, butane and 
propylene. 
  
The average conversion ratio for Reficar during 2012 was 68.07%. The gross refining margin decreased from US$6.68 per barrel in 2011, to US$5.31
per barrel in 2012, mainly due to a longer cracker turnaround and lower prices of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, compared to 2011.
In 2011 we started to purchase low-sulfur gasoline and continued purchasing low-sulfur diesel and biodiesel to improve the quality of the diesel and
gasoline produced at Reficar. Reficar is currently purchasing biodiesel fuel in the local market and mixing it with its production of diesel to reduce sulfur 
content to meet local specifications. 
  
Petrochemicals and Other Products
We own and operate four petrochemical plants and one paraffin and lube plant located within Barrancabermeja, producing a variety of products,
including aromatics, cyclohexane, paraffin waxes, lube base oils, polyethylene and solvents. In 2012, we produced 36,882 tons of low-density polyethylene and 
774.5 thousand barrels of aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene, orthoxylene, heavy aromatics and cyclohexane), a 27% increase and 16% decrease compared to a 
production of 28,992 tons of low-density polyethylene and 926 thousand barrels of aromatics in 2011, respectively. 
  
Propilco 
  
During 2012, Propilco’s production totaled 410 thousand tons of petrochemical products, a 7.6% increase compared to the 381 thousand tons produced 
in 2011. The contribution margin in 2012 was 10.3% higher than in 2011, an increase from 260 per ton in 2011 to 287 per ton in 2012. The following table sets 
forth Propilco’s average capacity and throughput for each of the last three years.

In 2012, we incorporated Cenit as a wholly-owned subsidiary specializing in logistics and transportation of hydrocarbons within Colombia. The
creation of Cenit aims to enhance the strategic and logistical framework of Colombia’s oil industry in response to the increase in hydrocarbon production and 
higher sales of crudes and refined products, both within Colombia and in international markets. Furthermore, it aims to strengthen and expand the transportation 
network while maintaining high standards of industrial safety, reliability as well as contributing to the environmental preservation.
We expect the creation of Cenit to represent a signal of clear rules to the market, by separating Ecopetrol’s role as owner, planner, operator and user of
transportation systems. Cenit is expected to operate with an open model, in which all the interested parties will have the opportunity of accessing its 
transportation infrastructure. On the other hand, we have also ensured that Cenit will provide the capacity to meet our transportation needs.
This new hydrocarbon transportation framework is expected to produce significant advantages to Ecopetrol by allowing the company to focus on its
strategic business segments and allocate higher investment to other key segments, while Cenit takes the lead in finding and exploiting profitable opportunities in 
transportation and logistics.
We expect that Cenit will offer its customers a wide portfolio of services that include transportation, storage, logistics and multimodal transportation
services for hydrocarbons in Colombia. In addition, our Vice-Presidency of Transportation and Logistics will focus its efforts in the operation and maintenance 
of the infrastructure and strengthening our risk-management model to support its processes and develop the required infrastructure projects to meet the needs of 
our customers.
Cenit’s authorized and outstanding capital amounts to Ps.$1.3 billion and Ps.$10 million, respectively. In October 2012, we transferred our direct
interests in Ocensa, ODC, Oleoducto Bicentenario, ODL and Serviport to Cenit. On April 1, 2013, Ecopetrol completed the transfer of hydrocarbon transport 
and logistics assets to Cenit.
Beginning in the second half of 2012, Ecopetrol and Cenit have been working to finalize the transition process in order for Cenit to start operations in 
the first half of 2013. As part of that process, on April 1, 2013 we entered into a transportation agreement with Cenit, pursuant to which it will provide us with 
hydrocarbon transportation and logistics services through the transportation assets transferred to it as an in-kind capitalization. On April 1, 2013, we also 
entered into an operation and maintenance agreement with Cenit, pursuant to which we will perform the activities related to the operation of the transportation 
assets transferred to it, as well as their maintenance. In return, Cenit will pay us variable monthly installments for the services rendered. See “Item 7. Major 
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Agreements—Cenit.” 
  
Vice-Presidency of Transportation and Logistics
Along with the creation of Cenit and the transfer of the transportation assets to it during 2013, the Vice-Presidency of Transportation and Logistics
redefined its strategy, which is to be focused on strengthening our operations and maintenance services, comprehensive logistics solutions and risk management, 
in order to ensure customer satisfaction while adding value.
The transportation and logistics segment includes the transportation of crude oil, motor fuels, fuel oil and other refined products. Since 2009, our
Transportation and Logistics 
  
Summary 
  
Cenit
transportation and logistics segment has been transporting diesel and biofuels.
As of December 31, 2012, we, directly or indirectly with private sector participants, owned, operated and maintained an extensive network of crude oil 
and refined products pipelines connecting our own and third-party production centers and terminals to refineries, major distribution points and export facilities. 
We directly own 41% of the total crude oil pipeline shipping capacity, a 1% more than in 2011 and 99% of the total product pipeline shipping capacity in 
Colombia. When aggregated with the crude oil pipelines in which we own an interest, we own 77% of the oil pipeline shipping capacity in Colombia. The total 
length of our crude-oil pipelines decreased with respect to 2011 mainly due to a higher accuracy in our measurement during 2012 through the inline inspection 
method. Multi-purpose pipelines length increased mainly due to the construction of an alternative line in the Galán – Bucaramanga system.
51
By December 31, 2012, our network of crude oil and multi-purpose pipelines was approximately 8,760 kilometers in length. The transportation
network we own directly, in partnership with other companies, and in joint venture partnerships, consists of approximately 5,042 kilometers of main crude oil 
pipeline networks connecting various fields to the Barrancabermeja refinery and Reficar, as well as to export facilities. We directly own 3,029 kilometers of 
crude oil pipeline and an additional 2,013 kilometers of crude oil pipeline with our business partners. We also own 3,717 kilometers of multi-purpose pipelines 
for transportation of refined products from the Barrancabermeja refinery and from Reficar to wholesale distribution points.
During 2012, we met our customer satisfaction index goal, and we maintained our ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications for all
of our transportation processes. We also attained the certification by the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), which provides standards for 
hydrocarbons reception, storage, dispatch by pipes and pipelines and the import and export facilities of our docks.
We are currently developing our transportation infrastructure in order to meet our increased transportation needs in Colombia and any additional needs,
which may result from new discoveries. 
  
Special Programs
During 2012, our Vice-Presidency of Transportation and Logistics continued to focus its efforts on strengthening its practices in order to anticipate
potential natural events that may cause impairments to the transportation facilities and damages in the surrounding environment and communities. The 
following were some of the steps taken in order to ensure the continuity of the integrity and the contingency programs: 
  
Integrity Program:
This program is aimed at reinforcing our operational risk management model, enhancing the integrity of the transportation infrastructure and handling
the environmental conditions in the places where our systems operate. The program has strengthened the risk management model of the Vice-Presidency of 
Transportation and Logistics by improving risk identification, assessment and management, especially in relation to weather conditions and third-party damage.
In addition, new technologies to monitor the transportation infrastructure and its surroundings have been updated and incorporated into routine
inspections and maintenance practices, meeting the highest international standards. Pipeline replacement projects in areas susceptible to incidents with major 
consequences were executed.
Under this program, there was a decrease of 15% in very-high and high-risk levels at our transportation infrastructure and a decrease of 36% in
medium-risk levels when compared to 2011. 
  
Contingency Program:
During 2012, our contingency program carried out activities aimed at reducing the potential consequences of a loss of containment as a result of any
event in the transportation infrastructure that might impact nearby communities and the environment, by reinforcing our cooperation with the local communities 
and the local emergency services.
Those activities include (1) signing of contracts with 15 branches of the Colombian Red Cross to communicate emergency plans in 1,349 local
communities; (2) planning and execution of level I (operational drills, performed within Ecopetrol´s facilities, that triggers internal procedures of the company), 
level II (local and regional drills, involving emergency services and local authorities in the area of influence) , level III (national drills, with the participation of 
the Risk and Disaster Management Unit of the Colombian Presidency); (3) planning and execution of the Annual Expert Meeting to address our emergency 
response in coordination with the Risk and Disasters Management Unit of the Colombian Presidency; and (4) designing the structure of a new emergency-
response model for Ecopetrol.
In 2013, these programs will continue their planned activities in order to achieve those objectives to guarantee the welfare of local communities.

Pipelines 
  
In 2012, pipelines in which we own an interest transported a total of 916.2 thousand bpd of crude oil and 302.7 bpd of refined products for a total of 
1.22 million bpd in 2012, a 1.2% increase when compared to 2011. In 2011, pipelines transported a total of 1.20 million bpd of crude oil and refined products 
compared to 1.03 million bpd in 2010.
In October 2012, we transferred our interests in Ocensa, ODC, Oleoducto Bicentenario de Colombia, ODL and Serviport to Cenit, which is expected to
perform all of the hydrocarbon transportation activities that we used to perform directly. We have entered into a transportation agreement with Cenit, pursuant 
to which it will transport part of our crude oil and refined products, as well as those of certain third parties. See “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—
Transportation and Logistics—Cenit.”
The operation of our pipelines follows international standards and industry practices, such as remote operation, integral management, automatic ticket
transfer, health, safety and environmental policies and a high customer satisfaction index.

Oleoducto Bicentenario is in the first phase of construction of the Araguaney-Coveñas pipeline, which connects the Araguaney and Banadía loading
facilities, and which is expected to be the largest of its kind in Colombia. Its estimated investment of US$2,035 million is expected to be financed by the project 
partners’ equity participation amounting to a 30% interest and the remaining 70% through loans from local banks, which have approved Ps$2.1 trillion and of 
which Ps$1,295 billion (approximately US$732 million) has been drawn. The loan’s financial terms include an interest rate of DTF + 4.54% (DTF refers to the 
fixed term deposit rate), and a term of 12 years with a one-year grace period.
The first phase of the construction is expected to permit the evacuation of at least 110 thousand bpd, with a pipeline of 230 kilometers in length and a 
diameter of 42 inches, connecting Araguaney to Banadía. Delays in the completion of the first phase of this project due in part to events such as lockouts from 
communities in the areas of project construction demanding more social investment from the government, security issues, attacks by guerrilla groups, and 
unfavorable weather conditions could affect our production in certain fields and would prevent us from having the necessary infrastructure for crude oil 
transportation. During 2012, we completed the construction of 60.8% of the first phase and expect to complete this phase in third quarter of 2013.
In addition to the construction of the first phase of the Araguaney – Banadía pipeline, we adapted the Araguaney and Banadía stations, which by 2012 
were 55% and 47% completed, respectively, and the enlargement of the Coveñas station which was 43% completed in 2012. The next phases of the Oleoducto 
Bicentenario are awaiting internal approvals from shareholders and obtaining environmental licenses from governmental authorities.

At December 31, 2012, we owned 53 stations, 21 of them located in crude oil pipelines, 23 of them in refined products pipelines and nine in the ports
and riversides (not including those associated with the transportation network that belong to third parties and are operated by us). In addition, we have a nominal 
storage capacity associated with the transportation network of 19 million barrels of crude oil and 6 million barrels of refined products. We also sell storage 
capacity to third parties in our Pozos Colorados and Mansilla facilities and in the Coveñas port. We do not own any tankers. 
  
Theft of Hydrocarbons
In 2012, we achieved significant reductions in the theft of hydrocarbons. We believe the results in controlling the theft of both crude oil and refined oil
are evidence of the effectiveness of a structured strategy and strong teamwork. This effort has been recognized by third parties such as Accenture, which gave 
Ecopetrol its Innovation Award in 2012, and other governments which have shown interest in implementing our strategies in their own infrastructure of 
hydrocarbons transportation. Theft of refined products, which reached a peak of 7,270 bpd in 2002, was reduced to 23.9 bpd in 2012 mainly due to the efforts in 
the detection of illicit valves, the development of technologies and cooperation with the Colombian Army and law enforcement agencies. In 2012, theft of 
refined products was reduced by 70%, from 81 bpd to 23.9 bpd when compared to 2011. The theft of crude oil decreased from 419 bpd in 2011 to 413 bpd in 
2012, mainly due to our cooperation with the Colombian Army and local communities. 
  
Other Transportation Facilities
We have entered into transportation agreements with tanker-truck and barge companies in order to transport crude oil from locations that do not have
pipeline connections to refineries and export facilities. The volume of refined products that cannot be transported in pipelines or in tanker trucks because of 
capacity limitation is transported by barges. During 2012, 37.8 million barrels of crude oil and refined products were transported by tanker trucks and 7.4 
million barrels of crude oil and refined products were transported by barges. 
  
Export and Import Facilities
We currently have concessions granted by the Nation for four export docks for crude oil and refined products (Pozos Colorados, Coveñas, Tumaco and
Buenaventura). Our export capacity reached 1,456 million bpd for crude oil and 1,027 million bpd for refined products. Our import capacity reached 1,223 
million bpd.
Our crude oil loading facilities can load tankers of up to 350 thousand deadweight tonnage, or DWT. Adjacent to these loading facilities we also have 
crude oil storage facilities that are capable of storing 7.5 million barrels. Our docks used for import and export of refined products can load tankers of up to 85 
thousand DWT. Additionally, these facilities have storage capacity of up to 1.2 million barrels. 
  
New Transportation Projects 
  
Projects to Increase Transportation Capacity
During 2012, we increased capacity in our primary and secondary oil pipelines, loading facilities, refined products and gas pipelines due to several
projects carried out by the Vice-Presidency of Transportation and Logistics.
The nominal capacity of the main systems was increased as follows: our main oil pipeline systems increased from 1,109.5 thousand bpd in 2011 to
1,200 thousand bpd in 2012; and our main refined-products pipeline systems increased from 423.4 thousand bpd in 2011 to 426 thousand bpd in 2012, 
attributable to the increase in capacity of the Pozos Colorados – Galán line that offset the decrease in the capacity of the 16” Galán – Sebastopol line.
55
Increase of 12 thousand bdp in the nominal capacity of the Vasconia – GRB – Galan system, from 168 to 180 thousand bpd.
Increase of 12 thousand bpd in the nominal capacity of the Transandino Oil Pipeline, from 48 to 60 thousand bpd.
Increase of 14.5 thousand bpd in the nominal capacity of the 16” Ayacucho – Coveñas corridor, from 60.5 to 75 thousand bpd.
Increase in pumping capacity from 36 to 54 thousand bpd in the 12” Monterrey – Porvenir System.
Start of operations of the 14” Galán – Ayacucho line to evacuate the oil production from La Cira and Isla VI camps. Increase of 19 thousand bpd, 
from 16 thousand bpd to 35 thousand bpd.

the Santiago – El Porvenir oil pipeline, and with Mansarovar Energy Colombia for the Galán – Ayacucho – Coveñas oil pipeline.
In addition, a “ship or pay” and “ship and pay” capacity deal was signed with Occidental Petroleum de Colombia for the Galán – Ayachucho –
Coveñas system, as well as a capacity deal for the Araguaney – Porvenir system with Equion.
In connection with crude loading, “ship or pay” contracts were signed for the loading facility in Araguaney with Petrominerales and Metapetroleum,
along with capacity contracts with Metapetroleum Corp in Colombia and Petrominerales.

On December 23, 2011 our Salgar-Cartago pipeline ruptured. The experts believe this incident occurred as a result of creep movement caused by
severe weather conditions in the area, causing the surrounding soil to exercise strong pressure on the pipeline and rupturing it. Due to the rupture, approximately 
59,976 U.S. gallons of gasoline spilled into the surrounding area in La Divisa and Villa Carola in the Municipality of Dosquebradas, Risaralda. The spilled 
gasoline from the pipeline subsequently came into contact with a heat source which ignited it, causing several explosions that tragically resulted in 33 fatalities 
and 35 injuries, as well as damages to the neighboring houses and buildings.
In connection with this incident, the Corporación Autónoma Regional de Risaralda, or CARDER (the Regional Environmental Authority for the
Department of Risaralda), initiated a proceeding against Ecopetrol for alleged violation of the environmental regulation. In addition, the National Authority on 
Environmental Licensing – ANLA, has had more detailed involvement in the surveillance of Ecopetrol’s fulfillment of the environmental plan for the area.
We performed our own internal investigation of the incident, and additionally hired a local engineering firm as well as a highly renowned international
consultant to investigate the causes of the incident. Our internal investigation, the investigation conducted by the Colombian engineering firm and the one 
conducted by the international consultant, concurred that the origin of the rupture of the pipeline was the result of a creep movement caused by severe weather 
conditions in the area, causing the surrounding soil to exercise strong pressure on the pipeline
Notwithstanding that the causes of such incident cannot be attributed to Ecopetrol, based on objective responsibility criteria established by Colombian
Law, and based on principles of solidarity and social responsibility, Ecopetrol agreed to compensate the affected families for their injuries and loses. This 
compensation does not imply the admission of any guilt as to the incident or the damages caused. For these purposes, Ecopetrol and the affected families agreed 
on the extrajudicial settlement of the damages and executed conciliation contracts, which were further reviewed and approved by judges in the city of Pereira. 
Settlements were agreed to cover all injuries and losses for an approximate amount of Ps$12.9 billion.
Furthermore, during 2012 and 2013, Ecopetrol has developed several social programs agreed with and for the benefit of the affected communities.
These programs have represented as of December 31, 2012 contributions of approximately Ps$12 billion to assist those affected by the incident and to restore 
the environment and social infrastructure.
As of January 4, 2012, we had cleaned the affected water bodies and completed the majority of our remediation activities in connection with the spill.
In addition, as of December 31, 2012, we had planted 3,700 trees in the Aguazul Creek basin, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the CARDER.
In January 2012, we launched the Dosquebradas Project and have taken the following steps to ensure its continuity: 
  
• Health: We have sought to guarantee the physical and mental health of the affected people by making specialized surgery available and delivering
the required supplies and drugs.
•
•
Legal and Environment - Housing: As of March 18, 2013, we had agreed to settlements with 97% of the families of the deceased persons and the 
owners of collapsed houses. Also, affected soils including 3.76 km of the Aguazul creek riverside had been recovered.
Social: Activities held with the local community during 2012 included monitoring and comprehensive care of 129 families and the training of 172 
community leaders in risk management. Additionally, a school in the Aguazul village was built in record time, and an ecological park to promote 
health and sports in the Villa Carola Village and a healthcare center were finished, and the Youth Leadership Network was founded.
Incidents at Transportation Facilities 
  
Salgar-Cartago Multipurpose Pipeline Spill
Caño Limon – Coveñas Crude Oil Pipeline Spill
Due to natural causes occurring as a result of unusual movement of soil and the tensioning of the pipeline, resulting from severe weather conditions, on 
December 11, 2011, the Caño Limon - Coveñas oil pipeline ruptured and caused the spill of approximately 3,267 barrels of crude oil into the Iscala creek, which 
connects with the Pamplonita River that provides water to the city of Cucuta. The incident did not cause any fatalities or injuries.
57
We launched our own internal investigation and hired a highly renowned international consultant to investigate the causes of this incident. The
conclusions of the investigations support that the rupture occurred as a result of an unusual movement of soil and the tensioning of the pipeline. We believe 
investigations will continue for the foreseeable future, and we cannot provide any indication as to their outcome, including whether we will be found liable or 
subject to enforcement actions.
This incident has been subject to investigations by the competent authorities and has originated the filing of an ongoing class action against Ecopetrol
and the ongoing proceedings against employees of the company.
The Regional Environmental Authority of Norte de Santander, or Corporación Autónoma Regional de la Frontera Nororiental – CORPONOR, has
launched an investigation into the causes of the incident and has initiated enforcement actions against us for the alleged wrongful implementation of the 
contingency plan.
The Colombian General Comptroller’s office launched an investigation to determine if this incident might have caused a decrease in the assets of
Ecopetrol. 
  
At the same time, in 2012, the Colombian General Comptroller’s Office initiated an investigation to determine if there is a fiscal liability of Ecopetrol’s
President, the Vice-president of Transportation, and two other employees of the company due to the Caño Limon-Coveñas pipeline spill. The advisors to the 
employees of Ecopetrol representing them in front of the Colombian General Comptroller’s Office are optimistic regarding the final results of the proceedings; 
the worst case scenario could eventually imply civil liability of such employees and the risk of termination of their labor contracts.
As of the date of this annual report, no judgment or sanction against Ecopetrol or any of its employees has been issued. The different lawsuits and
proceedings are being handled by in house lawyers and by the employees’ counselors.
The legal counselors’ are optimistic as to the possible results of the proceedings underway, particularly due to the fact that there is technical evidence
that the causes of the incident are not imputable to Ecopetrol, and that Ecopetrol took care of the incident in a timely and efficient manner.
At the time of the incident, the pipeline was not in operation. We activated the corresponding contingency plan and called for the support of the
CREPAD, which is the regional committee for attention and prevention of disasters. Five hundred workers were assigned to the decontamination of the Iscala 
creek and the Pamplonita River. In addition, the authorities decided to close Cúcuta’s aqueduct gates as a preventive measure, while certified laboratories 
performed tests to determine its water quality.
In order to prevent the occurrence of another incident of this kind, as part of the strengthening of the contingency plans as well as the relationship with 
its stakeholders, Ecopetrol, national and local authorities are developing a project Ecopetrol has lead for the development of an alternative to the water supply in 
the intake of the aqueduct in Cúcuta, which project was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors in December 2011. In order to meet this commitment, 
as of December 31, 2011, we allocated a provision of Ps$67 billion. After basic engineering studies performed during 2012, the provision was updated and set 
at Ps$189 billion as of December 31, 2012.
We paid Ps$9.2 billion in 2012 for the decontamination of the Iscala creek and Pamplonita river and additional remediation activities. In 2011 we paid
Ps$17.2 billion for these activities.
As of January 4, 2012, we had cleaned the entirety of affected water bodies and the majority of our remediation activities in connection with the 
product spill were completed. Further analyses conducted by our research institute have shown recovery of the natural resources affected by the incident.
We have third-party general liability insurance coverage that applies to damages resulting from incidents such as the ones that occurred in
Dosquebradas and Cucuta.
Given the uncertainty of the outcome of current investigations and of potential future claims regarding these two incidents, we recorded in our financial
statements a provision for future payments and disbursements as if we had been found liable for all damages caused by the incidents. Nevertheless, the 
provision is only a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with the incident and not a definitive amount. We will continue to review the amount of any 
necessary accruals, potential asset impairments, or other related expenses and record the charges in the period in which the determination is made and an 
adjustment is required.

Marketing and Supply 
  
Summary 
  
We market a full range of refined and feed stock products locally including regular and high octane gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, natural gas and
petrochemical products, among others. Local sales of regular gasoline, LPG, jet fuel and diesel fuel as well as natural gas from the Guajira field are subject to 
government price regulation with reference to international benchmarks.
We are the main producer and supplier of refined products in Colombia. For regulated products, the Ministry of Mines and Energy establishes
maximum prices producers can charge and retail prices for these products pursuant to resolutions. The Ministry also establishes maximum wholesale and retail 
margins. For LPG, the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission establishes maximum prices as well as wholesale and retail margins.
Our crude oil export sales are made both in the spot market and through long-term contracts, primarily to refiners in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Far East,
Europe and the U.S. West Coast. 
  
Purchase Commitments with our Business Partners
We have signed a number of crude oil purchase contracts with certain of our business partners and third parties. Crude oil purchased from our business
partners is either processed in our refineries or exported. The purchase price is calculated based on international market prices. Consequently, part of our 
financial exposure depends on the international prices of oil. We believe that the risk of such exposure is naturally hedged since we either export the crude oil at 
international market prices or sell refined products at prices which are correlated with international market prices. Under most of our existing contracts, the 
purchases are subject to the pipeline capacity. During 2012, total volumes of crude oil we purchased from our business partners and third parties amounted to 
20.2% of our total crude oil volume sales.
The term of some of our purchase contracts is linked to the term of the joint venture agreements signed with our business partners. Other clauses of the
contracts such as price and place of delivery may be subject to renegotiation during the term of the contract. Certain purchase contracts not linked to joint 
venture agreements may be extended and renegotiated by the parties. 
  
Crude Oil Supply Commitments
As part of our transfer of assets to Reficar in April 2007, we extended a commercial offer to Reficar for the supply of crude oil. The commercial offer
has been periodically renewed and it is still in effect. Pursuant to the terms of the offer, Reficar has the option to purchase from us up to 200 thousand bpd of 
crude oil from our Caño Limón, Vasconia Blend, Cusiana and Castilla fields production according to the future requirements for the upgraded refinery. As we 
continue to operate Reficar, our operations committee evaluates and determines on a monthly basis the refinery’s crude oil mix needs, including the need for 
foreign crudes which we may import to meet our commitments. The purchase price for the delivered volumes is equal to an international benchmark index, 
subject to certain adjustments. 
  
Import of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel and Diluents
We are reducing sulfur emissions from fuels produced by us through blending with imported ultra-low sulfur diesel. Since January 2010, we supply
diesel with sulfur levels under 50 ppm (parts per million) to Bogota, Medellin and other cities around the country that also have bus-based mass-transportation 
systems, while in the rest of the country, we deliver diesel with sulfur levels under 500 ppm (parts per million). We expect that the quality (sulfur levels) of our 
diesel will continue improving in 2013 according to international standards. In 2012 we increased imports of ultra-low sulfur diesel by 1,233 bpd compared to 
2011 due to rising local demand, depletion of inventory in the country and additional requirements for the production of diesel according to the quality 
standards of sulfur content effective in 2013. Imports of low sulfur diesel decreased by 1,200 bpd when compared to 2011.
Until 2011, we managed gasoline sulfur levels under 1,000 ppm (parts per million) nationwide. Since 2011, we reduced these levels to under 300 ppm
(parts per million), an improvement that placed this type of gasoline as one of the grades with the lowest sulfur levels in Latin America.
We have also increased imports of naphtha, used as a diluent to allow our heavy crudes to be pumped through pipelines. In 2012, we imported 39.6
thousand bpd of naphtha as compared to 34.8 thousand bpd in 2011.
59
Natural Gas Distribution
Summary 
  
Development of natural gas reserves began in the 1970s with the discovery of the Guajira fields in the Northeastern region. Additional natural gas
reserves were discovered in the Piedemonte Llanero. In Colombia, we have been selling natural gas to local distribution companies, power generators and large 
customers, and have also been exporting natural gas to Venezuela. In 1986, we introduced a program known as “Natural Gas for Change,” which sought to 
increase local consumption. In 1993, the Government developed a regulatory framework for the distribution and marketing of natural gas. Between 1995 and 
1997, we connected our natural gas production fields with distribution points and major cities. In 1997, we transferred all of our natural gas transportation assets 
to a newly created company, Empresa Colombiana de Gas, or Ecogas. Ecogas had spun off from us in 1998. Thereafter, Ecogas transferred all of its assets to a 
new company, incorporated for such purpose, named Transportadora de Gas Internacional S.A. E.S.P., or TGI, formerly, Transportadora de Gas del Interior 
S.A.E.S.P., which is owned by Empresa de Energía Eléctrica de Bogotá.
Marketing of Natural Gas 
  
As a result of the growth of natural gas demand from Venezuela and the increase in domestic consumption of gas-powered plants in recent years, the
total demand for natural gas, including natural gas exports in 2012 was 1,090 gbtud, representing a 2.6% increase with respect to 1,062 gbtud demanded in 
2011. In 2010, demand was 1,061 gbtud while in 2009, demand was 1,035 gbtud.
We supplied 614 gbtud in 2012, including for self-consumption, which represents an overall market share of 56.3%. 
  
Natural Gas Distribution 
  
Currently, there are more than 20 natural gas distribution companies with operations in Colombia.  We sell natural gas to distribution companies
through take-or-pay or swing contracts.
Compressed Natural Gas 
  
Demand for natural gas for vehicles increased by 4.8% between 2012 and 2011, from 73 gbtud to 76.4 gbtud. This increase is mainly due to an increase 
in the number of compressed natural gas vehicles in response to incentives offered by companies engaged in marketing and delivery of compressed natural gas. 
According to the latest available report of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, as of December 31, 2012, a total of 402,524 vehicles had been converted to natural 
gas, an increase of 37,342 vehicles over the total of 365,182 that had been converted in 2011, when 40,667 vehicles were added to the 2010 total of 324,515.
During 2012, we amended four of the agreements for the supply of compressed natural gas in the Colombian Atlantic Coast, Bucaramanga, Western
region and Bogota in order to maintain the current incentives program that fosters conversions of motor vehicles in these regions from gasoline to natural gas. In 
addition, we began an early stage of planning and implementation of new incentives programs in the southern part of the country and in the Llanos region.
Natural Gas Sales to the Power and Industrial Sector 
  
We market and sell natural gas to the industrial sector and to gas-fired and combined cycle power plants. We have a number of long-term supply
contracts with power generators under which such companies have entered into take-or-pay contracts and purchase and supply obligations for the supply of 
natural gas. Currently, we have long-term take-or-pay contracts with three of 14 gas-fired and combined cycle power plants. Pursuant to the terms of these 
agreements, if we do not ship the contracted natural gas amounts we must pay a fine to our customers. Long-term supply contracts establish a pricing formula 
that depends on international reference prices.
During 2012, Ecopetrol sold 484.2 gbtud in the local market to clients from different sectors such as distributors, industries and power plants. In 2012, 
as well as in 2011, the lower consumption by power generators allowed the recovery of sales to the industrial sector. This was the opposite of what had occurred 
in 2010, when sales to the industrial sector dropped, due both to the weather phenomenon known as “El Niño” and to the corresponding higher demand by 
power plants.

Natural Gas Exports 
  
In 2007, we and Chevron entered into a long-term natural gas supply contract with PDVSA through the end of 2011. In December 2011, taking into
account that Ecopetrol and Chevron had gas surpluses, we negotiated an extension of exports to PDVSA from January 2012 to June 2014. However, the date of 
the export contract between Ecopetrol, Chevron and PDVSA  could be extended if, by June 2014 Colombia still has a surplus of natural gas to export to 
Venezuela.. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to deliver the following quantities of natural gas to Venezuela, for which Chevron assumed 
43% and Ecopetrol, 57% of the responsibility: 
  
 
 
 
Volume commitments(1)
  
 (1) The quantities for each month are different, because the volume per year is a weighted average.
(2) Total gas delivery commitment to PDVSA.
(3) The quantity for 2014 is a weighted average from January to June 2014.
For the year ended December 31,
In 2012, we and our partner Chevron delivered 186.4 gbtud, exceeding the quantity of natural gas we agreed to supply in our gas export contract with 
PDVSA. In 2011 and 2010, we and Chevron delivered 204.4 gbtud and 154.9 gbtud respectively. Of the total volume of gas delivered in 2012, 70% came from 
us and 30% came from Chevron.
2013(2) 
(gbtud)
In 2007, we signed a gas import contract in which PDVSA would export gas to Colombia from February 2012 (one month after the date on which the 
original contract called for an end of exports from Colombia to Venezuela) until December 2027. Given that the export contract described above was extended, 
the start date of the import contract between Ecopetrol and PDVSA was also changed to September 2014. We have agreed that any change in the date of the end 
of the export contract will also change date on which the import contract begins.

Natural Gas Delivery Commitments 
  
In 2011, we participated along with the Commission for Regulation of Energy and Gas in the definition and implementation of new rules for marketing
gas in the mid-term. In accordance with the new regulatory framework, we updated our committed natural gas volumes for the years 2012 and 2013.

Pursuant to long-term supply contracts and other agreements, we must supply natural gas to these parties, and failure to deliver the agreed amounts
could result in fines under the contracts.
In 2012, we paid Ps$9.2 billion, mainly in compensation for non-delivery of natural gas. The fines resulted from delays in the beginning of new
projects, mainly the Planta de Gas Cupiagua and the expansion project of the Guajira fields. In 2010, we paid Ps$85.2 billion for non-delivery of natural gas as a 
consequence of the weather phenomenon known as “El Niño.”
In order to meet our natural gas delivery commitments, we have three main natural gas production fields, the Guajira fields, the Cusiana and the
Gibraltar fields. Of our total natural gas production at December 31, 2012, 57.1% was supplied by the Guajira production, 22.6% from the Cusiana field and the 
remaining 20.3% from fields located in other regions. Our participation in the Colombian natural gas market in 2012, including export volumes, was 56.3%, a 
decrease compared to 2011 and 2010 when the participations stood at 62.0% and 64.5% respectively.
Since 2011, Decree 2100 of 2011 issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines established that all producers have to make a production statement
including the volumes available for sales. The following table sets forth the total production statement for 2012-2016 published by the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines in the fields in which we hold a stake.

Price Controls on the La Guajira Natural Gas Production 
  
The Ministry of Mines and Energy through the Colombian Commission for the Regulation of Energy and Gas, or CREG, establishes the maximum
price we are allowed to charge customers that consume less than 100 thousand cfpd from La Guajira field under take-or-pay contracts. Maximum prices we can 
charge to these “regulated customers” are determined with reference to the average export price for fuel oil for the previous six months.
Priorities for Delivery of Natural Gas 
  
The Ministry of Mines and Energy established distribution priorities in the event of a shortfall of reserves or production of natural gas. Residential
consumers with existing supply contracts, small businesses and distributors of compressed natural gas have the first priority for delivery. Contracts for export of 
natural gas have the same priority under the firm commitments as other users such as industrial consumers and power generators. The agreements that are not 
firm commitments and contemplate delivery of natural gas “as available” have priority over customers on the spot market. We may enter into natural gas export 
contracts if the ratio of reserves to production exceeds seven years.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy also establishes distribution priorities in the event of a natural gas shortfall derived from supply or infrastructure
issues. This order of priority is based on the type of contract, with firm supply contracts having priority over swing supply contracts.

Regulation
The main authorities that regulate our activities in Colombia are the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the ANH, the CREG, the Ministry of Environment
and Sustainable Development, and the National Authority on Environmental Licensing. 
  
Ministry of Mines and Energy
The Ministry of Mines and Energy is responsible for managing and regulating Colombia’s nonrenewable natural resources assuring their optimal use
by defining and adopting national policies regarding exploration, production, transportation, refining, distribution and export of minerals and hydrocarbons. 
  
National Hydrocarbons Agency – ANH
The ANH was created in 2003 and is responsible for the administration of Colombia’s hydrocarbon reserves.  The ANH’s objective is to manage the
hydrocarbon reserves owned by the Nation through the design, promotion and negotiation of the exploration and production agreements in areas where 
hydrocarbons may be found, and not subject to joint ventures executed before December 31, 2003 and still in force, that are directly operated by Ecopetrol. The 
ANH is also responsible for creating and maintaining attractive conditions for investments in the hydrocarbon sector and for designing bidding rounds for 
exploration blocks. Decree 4137 of 2011 changed ANH’s legal nature and defined new functions for it. 
  
Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission – CREG
Laws 142 and 143 of 1994 created the CREG, a special administrative unit of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, responsible for establishing the
standards for the exploitation and use of energy, regulating the domestic utilities of electricity and fuel gas (liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas). The CREG 
is also responsible for fostering the development of the energy services industry, promoting competition and responding to consumer and industry needs. Decree 
4130 of 2011 assigns CREG new functions previously fulfilled by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. 
  
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development
Formerly the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development was spun off
and reorganized by Law 1444 of 2011. It has among its main functions the issuance of public policies regarding the use and exploitation of natural resources 
and the regulation of national environmental laws.
For the oil industry in particular, the ministry defines the procedures structures that regulate the issuance of environmental licenses and permits
necessary for the development of the following activities: seismic, when the project includes the construction of roads or highways, production, exploration, 
extraction, transportation and refining. 
  
National Authority on Environmental Licensing
Created by Decree 3573 of 2011, the National Authority on Environmental Licensing has among its functions the issuance of licenses and
environmental permits required for projects related to oil activities. Additionally, the National Authority on Environmental Licensing constantly monitors 
license compliance, handles complaints and grievances presented by local communities, and, in general, is in charge of regulating the procedures by which the 
environmental permits needed for Ecopetrol’s operation are issued and enforced. 
  
Control Entities
Superintendency of Public Utilities 
  
Under Colombian regulations, the distribution and marketing of natural gas is considered a public utility. As such, this activity is regulated by Law 142
of 1994 and supervised by the Superintendency of Public Utilities (Superintendencia de Servicios Públicos Domiciliarios).
Superintendency of Corporations 
  
We are subject to the supervision of the Superintendency of Corporations (Superintendencia de Sociedades), the governmental body responsible for
supervising corporations domiciled in Colombia.
63
Superintendency of Finance 
  
The Superintendency of Finance (Superintendencia Financiera) is responsible for monitoring, promoting and regulating the publicly traded securities
market, registered issuers, broker-dealers, mutual funds and any other participants in the public market including the BVC.
We are a registered issuer and our debt and equity securities are publicly traded. The Superintendency of Finance is responsible for the supervision of
any activity we undertake that may affect the market for our securities. We are required to inform the Superintendency of Finance of any material event and 
provide periodic reports of our financial condition.
Superintendency of Ports and Transport 
  
The Superintendency of Ports and Transport (Superintendencia de Puertos y Transporte) has exclusive control and regulates us in matters related to
ports concession contracts, in which we act as contractor.
National Superintendency of Health Care 
  
Because we provide health care benefits to our employees and their families, the National Superintendency of Health Care (Superintendencia Nacional
de Salud) has exclusive control and regulates us in matters related to the inspection, supervision and control of the Social Security Health Care System. 
  
Hydrocarbon Resources Administrator
National Hydrocarbons Agency – ANH 
  
Any oil company selected by the ANH to explore a specific block must execute an exploration and production contract with the ANH. All royalty
payments in connection with the production of hydrocarbons are made to the ANH in-kind unless the ANH grants a specific waiver to make royalty payments in 
cash. Any oil company working in Colombia, must file with the ANH periodical reports on the development of their exploratory and production activities. 
  
Authorities Related to Environmental Matters
Regional Autonomous Corporations 
  
Regulated by Law 99 of 1993, the Regional Autonomous Corporations are responsible for the administration of natural resources located in their
jurisdiction and, although they do not have competency over issues related to the oil industry, they are responsible for granting permission in certain cases to 
issue permits for natural resources usage, such as water, air or soil necessary for the development of our activities.
Ministry of Internal Affairs 
  
The Ministry of Internal Affairs is responsible for certifying the existence of ethnic communities (such as Aboriginal, Afro Colombian and “Raizales,” 
a Colombian legal term that refers to the people born in the San Andrés Island archipelago) in areas in which seismic, exploration, extraction, transportation and 
refining activities are being developed, and issuing general guidelines which should be developed through consultation procedures necessary for the viability of 
any work, project or activity intended to be done in the territories of those communities. 
  
Regulatory Framework
Regulation of Exploration and Production Activities 
  
Pursuant to Colombian law, the Nation is the exclusive owner of all hydrocarbon resources located in Colombia and has full authority to determine the 
rights, royalties or compensation to be paid by investors for the exploration or production of any hydrocarbon reserves. The Ministry of Mines and Energy and 
the ANH, are the authorities responsible for regulating all activities related to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in Colombia.
64
Decree Law 1056 of 1953, or the Petroleum Code (Código de Petróleos), establishes the general procedures and requirements that must be completed
by investors prior to commencing hydrocarbon exploration or production activities. The Petroleum Code sets forth general guidelines, obligations and 
disclosure procedures that need to be followed during the performance of these activities.
Prior to 2003, all activities regarding the exploration and production of hydrocarbons were governed by Decree 2310 of 1974. Consequently, during
such period all of our activities were outlined and regulated by this decree. Decree 2310 of 1974 was replaced by Decree Law 1760 of 2003, but all agreements 
entered into by us prior to 2003 with other oil companies are still regulated by Decree 2310 of 1974.
Decree Law 1760 of 2003 created the ANH to regulate and oversee the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves; according to its exclusive 
legal authority, the ANH developed a new contractual regime for hydrocarbons. Decree Law 1760 of 2003 was complemented by Decree 2288 of 2004, which 
regulates all aspects related to the extension and termination of contracts executed by us before 2004.
Accord 008 of 2004 (applicable to agreements entered into by us prior to May 2012) and Accord 004 of 2012 (applicable to agreements entered into by
on or after May 2012) issued by the Directive Council of the ANH set forth the necessary steps for entering into exploration and production contracts with the 
ANH.
Resolution 18-1495 of 2009 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy establishes a series of regulations regarding hydrocarbon exploration and production. 
  
Pursuant to Colombian law we must pay a percentage of our production to the ANH as royalties. Each production contract has its applicable royalty 
arrangement in accordance with applicable law. In 1999, a modification to the royalty system established a sliding scale for royalty payments, linking them to 
the production level of crude oil and natural gas fields discovered after July 29, 1999 and to the quality of the crude oil produced. Since 2002, the royalties 
system has ranged from 8% for fields producing up to 5 thousand bpd to 25% for fields producing in excess of 600 thousand bpd. Changes in royalty programs 
only apply to new discoveries and do not alter fields already in their production stage. Producing fields pay royalties in accordance with the applicable royalty 
law at the time of the discovery. Our contracts specify that royalties are to be paid in kind (oil and gas) to the ANH.
We currently purchase all physical products delivered by producers of crude oil as royalty payments to the ANH at prices set forth in Law 756 of 2002
and Resolution 18-1709 of 2003 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy.
The purchase price is calculated based on a reference price for crude oil at the wellhead and varies depending on prevailing international prices. We 
have an interagency collaboration agreement, or “Convenio de Colaboración,” with the ANH, whereby we collect all in kind and cash royalties owed to the 
ANH by the oil companies in Colombia. We also have a purchase agreement to buy all the royalty volume. We sell the physical product purchased from the 
ANH as part of our ordinary business.
Decree 2100 of 2011 modified the commercialization scheme of natural gas royalties. Beginning in June 2012, producers must directly commercialize
the royalties of their own production on behalf of the ANH. In return, the ANH pays a commercialization fee to producers.
Regulation of Refining and Petrochemical Activities 
  
Refining and petrochemical activities are considered a public utility activity and are subject to governmental regulation. Article 58 of the Petroleum
Code establishes that oil refining activities can be developed throughout Colombia. Oil refineries must comply with the technical characteristics and 
requirements established by the existing regulations.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy is responsible for regulating, supervising and overseeing all activities related to the refining of crude oil, import of
refined products, storage, transport and distribution.
Decree 2657 of 1964 regulated the oil refining activities and created the Oil Refining Planning Committee, which is responsible for studying industry
problems and implementing short- and long-term refining planning policies. The Committee is also responsible for evaluating and reviewing new refining 
projects or expansion of existing infrastructure. Prior to deciding on a new project, the Committee must take into account the significance of the project and the 
economic impact, the sources of financing, profitability, social contribution, the effects on Colombia’s balance of payments and the price structure of the refined 
products.
65
Pursuant to Resolution 18-0966 of 2006 issued by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and Article 58 of the Petroleum Code, any refining company
operating in Colombia must provide a portion or, if needed, the total of its production to supply local demand prior to exporting any production. If the regulated 
production income, the principal item in the price formula, becomes lower than the export parity price, the price paid for the refined products will be equivalent 
to the price for those products in the U.S. Gulf Coast market. If there is a need of local demand for imported crudes, the refining company may charge additional 
transportation costs in proportion to the crudes delivered to the refinery.
In 2008, Law 1205 was issued with the main purpose of contributing to a healthier environment, and established the minimum quality that fuels must 
have in the country and the time frame for compliances. Since August 2010, Ecopetrol has been selling diesel and gasoline that complies with the requirements 
of the aforementioned law at its refinery in Barrancabermeja.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy establishes the safety standards for LPG, storage equipment, maintenance and distribution. Regulations issued in 
1992 established that every local, commercial and industrial facility with a storage capacity of LPG greater than 420 pounds must receive an authorization for 
operations from the Ministry of Mines and Energy.
As of May 2012, under the powers granted by Decree 4130 of 2011 for currency and tax matters, the ANH determines the crude oil price reference. 
  
Regulation of Transportation Activities 
  
Hydrocarbon transportation activity is considered a public utility activity in Colombia and therefore is under governmental supervision and control.
Transportation and distribution of crude oil, natural gas and refined products must comply with the Petroleum Code, the Commerce Code (Código de Comercio)
and with all governmental decrees and resolutions, including Resolutions 181258 and 124386 of 2010 issued by the Ministry of Mines and Energy on Crude Oil 
Pipeline Transportation, and Resolutions 122 of 2008 and 092 of 2009 issued by the CREG on LPG Pipeline Transportation.
Notwithstanding the general rules for hydrocarbon transportation in Colombia, natural gas transportation has specific regulations, due to the
categorization of natural gas distribution as a public utility activity under Colombian laws. Therefore, natural gas distribution transportation is governed by 
specific regulations, issued by the CREG that primarily seeks to satisfy the needs of the population.
Transport systems, classified as crude oil pipelines and multipurpose pipelines, can be owned by private parties. The construction, operation and
maintenance of pipelines must comply with environmental, social, technical and economic requirements under national and international standards. 
Transportation networks must follow specific conditions regarding design and specifications, while complying with the quality standards demanded by the oil 
and gas industry.
According to Law 681 of 2001, multipurpose pipelines owned by Ecopetrol (currently by Cenit) must be open to third-party use on the basis of equal
access to all.
Hydrocarbon transport activity may be developed by third parties and must meet all requirements established by law. 
  
The Ministry of Mines and Energy is responsible for: 
  
•
  
• mediation of rates between parties or, in case of disagreement, establishing the hydrocarbon transport rates based on information furnished by the
studying and approving the design and blueprints of all pipelines;
service provider;
issuing hydrocarbon transport regulations;
liquidation, distribution and verification of payment of transport-related taxes; and
•
  
•
  
• managing the information system for the oil product distribution chain.
  
The construction of transportation systems requires government licenses and local permits awarded by the Ministry of the Environment as well as other
requirements from regional environmental authorities.
66
Regulation on Selling, Distributing, Transporting and Marketing of Natural Gas 
  
The Colombian natural gas market is divided into two types of markets: (1) the regulated price market and (2) the free price market. Decree 2100 of
2011, issued by the Ministry of Mines and Energy, introduced a new regime for the selling and marketing of natural gas in Colombia, including specific 
procedures that regulate the Colombian market in order to administer the remaining natural gas reserves that the Nation owns, and protect national consumers, 
especially the residential consumers of natural gas.
Decree 2100 of 2011 divided markets in order to regulate marketing procedures as they relate to the production capacity of each production field in
Colombia. The producers that operate fields with production capacity of more than 30 million cfpd (“Large Fields”) of natural gas must follow a specific 
procedure for selling natural gas. The producers that operate fields that produce under 30 million cfpd are free to sell natural gas in terms agreed upon with 
interested buyers in the Colombian market.
Decree 2100 of 2011 distinguished between regulated price fields (Guajira field) and non-regulated price fields with respect to selling procedures for
Large Fields. For the Guajira field, Decree 2100 of 2011 determines a specific order to allocate natural gas, prioritizing buyers that would supply residential 
consumers and small businesses and industry, as well as natural gas transporters. Buyers included in the priority list have the first option to buy natural gas 
under the conditions offered by the producer. If such buyers choose not to use this option, then the next buyer in the priority list will be awarded that first option 
to acquire natural gas, until the gas is entirely allocated.
For non-regulated price fields, Decree 2100 of 2011 and Resolutions 118 of 2011, 140 of 2011 and 167 of 2011, issued by the CREG, provide a
specific procedure to sell natural gas in the Colombian market. The procedure to perform the auction process is completely regulated by the CREG in these 
Resolutions so that the conditions of the auction are clear to the whole market, setting equal rules and opportunities for the buyers. First, the natural gas 
producer must publish the available natural gas volumes available for sale. Then, all potential consumers present a supply agreement request. Afterwards, the 
producer compares the natural gas volume offer with the volumes requested by the potential buyers. If the natural gas demand volumes are higher than the 
natural gas offer published by the producer, then the producer must perform an auction in order to sell the natural gas that is available. If the natural gas demand 
volumes are lower than the natural gas offer published by the producer, then the producer is able to directly negotiate the terms of the agreement with each one 
of the potential buyers that presented the supply agreement request.
CREG’s Resolution 057 of 1996 establishes the rules for the different activities related to the natural gas market. It defines transportation as an 
independent activity. Therefore, transporters of natural gas are not allowed to (1) perform production, commercialization or distribution activities or (2) 
participate in companies for which the main purpose is to perform one of these activities. Transporters also cannot have an economic interest in electricity 
generating companies.  The CREG also regulates certain aspects of the agreements that can be used for the marketing, production, distribution and 
transportation of natural gas. CREG’s Resolutions 118 of 2011, 140 of 2011 and 167 of 2011, as amended, provide four types of contracts that can be used:
Take-or-Pay Agreements. The buyer agrees to purchase a specific amount or percentage of production of natural gas and the producer guarantees 
the availability of 100% of the agreed amount. If the buyer does not consume the agreed natural gas volume, the buyer still must pay the producer 
the agreed price.
• Optional Purchase Agreements. The buyer agrees to pay a premium for its right to take a fixed amount of natural gas if certain previously agreed 
conditions are met, and then the buyer agrees to pay an exercise price for the amount of natural gas effectively delivered. The producer guarantees 
to maintain available 100% of the natural gas agreed volume.
Interruptible Supply Agreements. The parties determine on a daily basis if the quantity of natural gas specified in the agreement is requested and 
will be supplied.
Conditional Firm Supply Agreements. The seller must supply every day the agreed natural gas volumes unless certain previous agreed conditions 
take place. Then, the producer is able to interrupt the natural gas supply. If the producer supplies natural gas, the buyer must pay a fixed price.
The export of natural gas is not considered a public utility activity under Colombian law and therefore is not subject to Law 142 of 1994. Nevertheless,
the internal supply of natural gas is a priority for the Colombian government. This policy is included in Decree 2100 of 2011, providing that in the event the 
supply of natural gas is reduced or halted as a result of a shortage of this hydrocarbon, the Colombian government has the right to suspend the supply of natural 
gas to foreign customers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Decree 2100 of 2011 establishes freedom to export natural gas, under normal conditions for gas 
reserves.

Regulation of Selling, Distributing, Transporting and Marketing of Liquefied Petroleum gas (LPG) 
  
Wholesale marketing, transport, distribution and retail marketing of LPG are mainly regulated by Resolution CREG 74 of 1996, and subsequent
resolutions. LPG in Colombia is primarily obtained from our refineries, field production and our own imports. The LPG must meet minimum quality standards 
to be marketed. Our wholesale marketing and transport activities are regulated by Resolutions 53 of 2011 and 92 of 2009. LPG price is regulated by Resolutions 
CREG 66 of 2007 and CREG 59 of 2008.
Regulation of Sales of Liquid Fuels 
  
According to section 212 of the Petroleum Code and Law 39 of 1987, distribution of liquid fuels and their derivatives is considered a public utility 
activity. Consequently, individuals or entities that engage in these activities are subject to regulations issued by the government in the interest of Colombian 
citizens. The government has the power to determine quality standards, measurement and control of liquid fuels, and establish penalties that may apply to 
dealers who do not observe such rules.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy is the entity that controls and exercises technical supervision over the distribution of liquid fuels derived from 
petroleum, including the refining, importing, storage, transport and distribution in the country. Law 812 of 2003 identified the agents of the supply chain of 
petroleum-derived liquid fuels.
The distribution of liquid fuels, except LPG, is regulated by Decree 4299 of 2005, as modified by Decrees 1333 and 1717 of 2007 and 2008,
respectively, which establish the requirements, obligations and penalties applicable to supply agents in the distribution, refining, import, storage, wholesale, 
transport, retail sale and consumption of liquid fuels.
Decrees 283 of 1990 and 1521 of 1998, and their modifications, establish minimum technical requirements for the construction of storage plants and
service stations. The Decrees also regulate the distribution of liquid fuels, establishing the minimum requirements for distributors and the activities and types of 
agreements permitted for these agents. The Ministry of Mines and Energy also regulates the types of liquid fuels that can be sold and purchased and the 
penalties for noncompliance with governmental regulations.
As of May 2012, the CREG determines the prices for regulated crude oil by-products, except for gasoline, diesel and biofuels (all of which are
determined by the Ministry of Mines and Energy).  The ANH determines the price for crude oil corresponding to royalty payments. Jet fuel prices are 
determined according to Law 1450 of 2011.
The distribution of fuels in areas near Colombian borders is subject to specific regulations that impose stringent control procedures and requirements.
Currently, Ecopetrol is no longer responsible for fuel distribution in these areas. That responsibility was transferred to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, 
pursuant to Law 1430 of 2010.
Regulation of Biofuel and Related Activities 
  
The sale and distribution of biofuels is regulated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Regulations establish the quality and pricing standards for
biofuels and impose minimum requirements for mixing ethanol with gasoline and biodiesel with diesel. 
  
Environmental Matters 
  
Regulation
The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is the highest environmental authority in Colombia and is in charge of issuing nationwide
environmental regulations, policies, and programs. At the regional local level, regional environmental authorities, such as the Regional Autonomous 
Corporations (Corporaciones Autónomas Regionales), are the highest environmental authorities of the region and are in charge of executing and overseeing the 
enforcement of all regulations, policies and programs issued by the Ministry of Environment within their area of jurisdiction, related to the environment and 
renewable natural resources, as well as overseeing any activity from a sustainable development perspective.
68
Law 99 of 1993 and other environmental regulations impose on companies in general, including oil and gas companies, the obligation to obtain an
environmental license prior to undertaking any activity that could negatively impact the environment, or produce serious damage to the environment and natural 
renewable resources. The National Authority on Environmental Licensing, created by Decree 3573 of 2011, is responsible for evaluating license applications 
and overseeing all hydrocarbons projects and monitoring compliance.
If projects or activities may impact indigenous, afro-colombian and “raizal” communities, the Colombian constitution provides that the companies 
developing such projects or activities must consult with those communities before initiating the project or activities or the environmental licensing process. 
Further, along with this process, the communities or the public oversight entities can request that a public hearing take place for this purpose. In addition, the 
Colombian constitution and laws establish that in order to comply with public participation mechanisms, the communities may demand information regarding 
the activities of the project and the impacts it could have.
The environmental licensing process begins when the company filing an environmental plan with the National Authority on Environmental Licensing.
Such licensing includes, but is not limited to, the application for the use of natural renewable resources (water, soil and air), the filing of an environmental 
impact assessment, and a plan to prevent, mitigate, correct and compensate for any activity that may harm the environment. According to recently issued 
regulations, obtaining a license may take between 165 and 265 business days, depending on whether the authority requires the applicant to file additional 
information or if it is necessary to establish a governmental committee to decide on the viability of the project.
The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is also responsible for establishing guidelines regarding climate change policies for the
hydrocarbon sector in Colombia. We are in compliance with those guidelines. At present, the Ministry of Environment has not proposed any specific steps for 
the implementation of the Kyoto Accords as it relates to our operations. We are continuously monitoring climate change requirements that could be applicable 
to us.
A company that does not comply with applicable environmental law and regulations, does not execute the environmental plan approved by the
environmental authority or that ignores the requirements imposed by an environmental license may be subject to an administrative proceeding initiated by the 
National Authority on Environmental Licensing or the regional environmental authorities established by Law 1333 of 2009. The proceeding may result in oral 
or written warnings, monetary penalties fines, license revocation or even temporary or permanent suspension of the activity being undertaken.
As of March 2013, we were party to 147 environmental administrative proceedings, of which 110 were initiated before 2012, 30 during 2012 and seven
during the first three months of 2013. During 2012, ten proceedings were concluded, for which we were subject to monetary fines. The largest fine imposed in 
2011 amounted to Ps$3.427 million (approximately US$1.9 million), after being reduced by the authority after being appealed by the Company. As of 
December 31, 2012, we were subject to four monetary fines that are not yet finally decided, amounting to Ps$616.621 million (approximately US$344,000). It is 
not possible for us to determine the material effect of the pending proceedings. 
  
Environmental Practices
During 2012, we reviewed and adjusted the focus of our environmental management strategy in order to ensure environmental sustainability, taking
into account the challenges we face in complying with environmental regulatory requirements related to larger, international commitments and the expectations 
of our stakeholders. Our environmental strategy has four action fronts: environmental feasibility, operational excellence, environmental water management and 
proactive environmental management. During 2012, we invested Ps$1,161 million in environmental programs to strengthen environmental management and 
increase environmental compliance. These investments include those made through contracts with our business partners in the amount of Ps$113,607 million. 
Such programs include:
•
•
Compliance. The purpose of this program is to guarantee knowledge, assessment, disclosure and compliance with all laws, regulations and 
requirements imposed by the Ministry of Environment and other regulatory bodies. We undertake environmental impact assessments and 
constantly review our environmental plan.
Contingency Planning. This program focuses on implementing preventive actions in our operative and administrative areas in order to diminish the 
impact of oil and hydrocarbon spills, illness, personal and other operational problems and establish the steps that need to be followed in case of an 
emergency.
69
Eco-Efficiency. This program is designed to minimize the environmental impacts resulting from our (1) use of natural resources through activities 
such as water uptake and forest exploitation and (2) waste generation through liquid emissions and the creation of hazardous waste. In 2012, we 
developed two testing projects designed to identify areas that could reduce our use of natural resources and waste generation. Among the 
alternatives identified to enhance operational efficiency, we are reducing fresh water consumption for the production camps of the Castilla and 
Chichimene fields. We have also identified opportunities to reduce consumption and emissions of waste water at transportation facilities and are 
striving to apply a zero liquid discharge plan.
Biodiversity. This program implements initiatives to preserve endangered species and ecosystems in areas where our activities have strong 
influence. In 2012, we invested Ps$4.6 billion to develop the “Environmental Planning for the Biodiversity Conservation in Ecopetrol Areas of 
Influence” project with the National Institute of Biodiversity.
Environmental Culture. This program seeks to promote an environmental culture in our organization, activities, and daily life. We initiated several 
environmental campaigns to educate our workforce in areas such as occupational health and friendly environmental practices.
Climate Change. We have designed a climate change strategy to guide, plan, define and execute our actions towards mitigating the effects of 
climate change and our participation in the elaboration of local and international climate change policies. In this context, we have entered into 
technical cooperation agreements with different parties, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, under the Global Methane 
Initiative, and the Petroleum Technology Alliance of Canada, or PTAC under the energy efficiency program. During 2012, we made progress with 
our climate change mitigation strategy. We implemented 13 projects, which sought a reduction of 280,257 tons of CO2 in one year. Our project 
portfolio comprises emission reduction initiatives and compensation activities for forest conservation and restoration. .
Alternative Energy Sources. This program is designed to develop alternative energy sources, such as biodiesel and ethanol projects. In June 2010, 
the biodiesel production plant (operated by Ecodiesel) began operations with a capacity of producing 2 thousand bpd. Biodiesel is obtained from 
refining crude palm oil. The plant has produced a total of 1,795,915 barrels of biodiesel since it began operations. In 2012, the plant produced 
804,133 barrels, compared to 718,149 barrels in 2011 and 273,625 barrels in 2010. Additionally, we own 91.43% of Bioenergy S.A., a company 
established in Colombia, with a production capacity of 2,640 bpd. In 2011, Bioenergy S.A. began the construction of its plant, while its sugarcane 
plantation has been developed and covers 5,514 hectares of 14,400 hectares projected. The plant is expected to begin operations during the second 
half of 2013.
We have also been undertaking significant efforts to make an efficient and rational use of the energy resources we use in our production processes,
reducing consumption, costs and CO2 emissions. In line with the 2012 update of our Strategic Plan, energy issues have taken special relevance. These include 
energy use, which encompasses the concept of integral energy solutions focused on efficiency, reliability and optimization, and the concept of energy 
diversification. Our 2012 energy efficiency audit was completed for our buildings located in the city of Bogota. The approximate energy savings totaled 497,000 
kwh per year, equivalent to US$65 million and 145 tons of CO2 per year. Additionally, we undertook feasibility studies of potential pipeline energy recovery at 
our pumping stations in Vasconia and La Belleza. We expect the results of these studies by the first quarter of 2013.
In line with our initiatives to diversify the energy resources we use, we began two studies during 2011 on the use of water, solar and eolic resources..
The first one, regarding Small Hydraulic Plants (PCH – Pequeñas Centrales Hidráulicas) attempts to identify water resources with enough generation potential 
to supply the demand of our operations in the South Region. The second aims to measure 13 operation areas, to determine which of them have adequate 
conditions to implement applications of solar and eolic resources that could (i) have a positive impact on emissions reduction, (ii) provide energy solutions to 
reduce consumption and (iii) have economic feasibility.
We launched two new projects:  the Termocoa turbine conversion and the electrification of the San Roque - Tisquirama fields, resulting in an energy-
consumption reduction of 449 boed, equivalent to US$4.7 million per year. In addition, the following developments associated with our projects in potential 
pipeline energy recovery, geothermal energy, solar and wind power and hydroelectric plants took place:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Potential Pipeline Energy Recovery: The project is currently under survey and analysis. It is expected that our analyses of energy-use 
optimization, carbon footprint reduction, and system-reliability improvement analysis in the Vasconia pumping station will conclude by April 
2013.
70
•
•
• Geothermal energy:  Our geothermal energy project is currently undergoing a corporate strategic alignment.  We expect a framework for this
initiative to be available by 2014.
Solar – Wind Energy Potential: We achieved two important goals in 2012. We completed the collection of the relevant information to identify six 
locations potentially well-suited for the development of solar-energy projects. We also have been conducting measurements in the Teca field to 
determine its potential for solar and thermal energy. We expect basic engineering for ten projects to be completed by the end of 2013.
Small Hydroelectric Plant (SHP): We have developed two studies in the southern region of Colombia in order to determine the economic and 
technical feasibility of pursuing hydroelectric projects near identified water resources.
In the case of an oil spill or leak from our operations, we must follow contingency plans in accordance with internal guidelines and procedures
designed in line with our health, safety and environment, or HSE, programs in compliance with best practices to prevent oil spill events from happening and to 
mitigate the environmental impact. In addition, we must comply with Colombian Regulation Decree 321 of 1999 and the National Contingency Plan, which are 
a set of guidelines that must be followed by oil and gas companies in Colombia to prevent, and react in case of, operational events that could impact the 
environment. For offshore joint ventures, the operator partner has the responsibility of designing and implementing remediation plans and procedures to deal 
with operational emergencies in accordance with best practices and local environmental regulations. Despite the fact that in the case of an emergency the 
operator partner is the one responsible for the remediation plan, we will also activate our own contingency plan and act along with the operator. We acted 
according to our contingency plans with respect to the oil spills occurring in the Salgar-Cartago and the Caño Limón-Coveñas pipelines. See “Item 4. 
Information on the Company—Transportation Infrastructure—Incidents at Transportation Facilities.” 
  
Health, Safety and the Environment
We are devoted to improving our HSE, practices. We have several programs in place to increase our industrial and process safety, minimize the
number of accidents of our workforce or our contractors and minimize catastrophic incidents. The frequency of accidents taking place within our premises has 
declined significantly to 0.8 accidents per million of hours worked in 2012 from 5.77 accidents per million of hours worked in 2005. Additionally, since 2009 
we are working on a “Process Safety Management” system aimed at the continuous improvement and minimization of operational incidents, such as fire, 
explosion, loss of primary containment and multiple fatalities. We also employ Technological Risk Analysis and a System of Command Incidents (SCI) and 
continue the process of standardization of HSE protocols and procedures, drafting safety manuals, compliance with existing regulations and the study of HSE 
benchmarks among oil companies. Our HSE programs are comprised of the following six pillars: (1) culture and leadership, (2) HSE competences in our 
employees and contractors, (3) safe design, (4) safe operation, (5) prevention and response to emergencies and (6) performance and audits. We have established 
guidelines to develop these pillars.
In the area of occupational health, our goal is to ensure a healthy workplace for all of our employees. We have defined five main programs in our
organization: epidemiology surveillance, ergonomic risk management, industrial hygiene program, industrial health program and medical emergency response. 
These programs help to control the risks of our daily operations, identified through a health risk assessment. Our goal is to have healthy workers, preventing 
occupational illness, preserving and maintaining individual and collective health of workers in their occupations inside a safe work environment.
In 2012, we recorded 27 environmental incidents, and 41 were recorded in 2011, the same number as in 2010. Oil spills increased from 2,599 barrels in
2011 to 4,050 barrels in 2012. This increase was primarily due to a single incident a fuel spill in the Sebastopol Galán pipeline of 3,323 barrels. 
  
Human Rights Initiatives
We have a strong commitment to the protection of human rights in the areas where we operate and use a set of security and human rights principles, or
Principios Voluntarios en Seguridad y Derechos Humanos, as a basis for the risk analysis of our Company in the communities where we operate. We use this 
set of principles to interact with local communities and strengthen their relationship with local authorities, our third party contractors and us. In particular, under 
the Colombian Constitution and legal framework, we are required to enter into formal consultations with indigenous communities whenever we are making 
plans to commence projects or operations in lands under their control.
71
In addition, as part of our commitment to human rights, in 2009, we approved our Human Rights Policy and joined the United Nations Global
Compact. To manage and ensure compliance with the policy and principles of the United Nations Global Compact, in 2010, we created the following forums 
and tools: 
  
• Human Rights Committee;
  
•
  
•
  
In 2012, to manage and ensure compliance with both our Human Rights Policy/Tactical Plan on Human Rights and the principles of the United Nations
Compliance Indicator for Corporate Human Rights Program.
Tactical Plan on Human Rights; and
Global Compact, we implemented the actions provided within the Tactical Plan on Human Rights. The Tactical Plan on Human Rights revolves around six 
components:
right to equality at work;
right of association and collective bargaining;
human rights complaint, reporting and claims system;

rights of ethnic groups;
children’s rights; and
of our operating lines, with emphasis on projects in the Meta, Casanare and Magdalena Medio departments. This work is planned to continue in 2013 with the 
formulation of a plan for human rights risk management within the broader risk management plan of the Company.
Additionally, in 2012, we designed a process to monitor risks and the human rights impact of our operations and value chain. We identified the various
sources of information that will support the identification of specific cases of alleged human rights violations in the future and trends in the perceptions of our 
stakeholders regarding our performance in the area of human rights. 
  
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)
In 2012, we continued to be listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index - World. This index tracks the financial performance of the leading
sustainability-driven companies worldwide and is a reference used to assess corporate sustainability. 
  
Insurance 
  
We have a clear and defined corporate policy based on risk financing guidelines that summarizes the Company’s risk transference and retention
alternatives and provides support and guidance for all the insurance-related issues of all of our affiliated and subsidiary companies.
There are two corporate insurance programs according to our core business operations, insured values, limits and other aspects. 
  
In the text and tables below, we set forth our insurance programs and the companies covered, along with limits and coverage details. 
  
World-Wide Umbrella Program. This insurance program provides coverage for downstream (assets and operations) of Ecopetrol and all of its affiliates
and subsidiaries in excess of their local insurance programs, and also in excess of the “Global Energy Package” program, when applicable. Coverage includes 
all physical damage, sabotage and terrorism, general liability, directors and officers, crime and marine cargo.

Our third-party liability insurance policies cover Ecopetrol, our subsidiaries and affiliates in excess of local underlying policy limits for claims made
against them by third parties.  Our commercial general liability, umbrella liability, and excess liability coverages will pay on behalf of or indemnify amounts for 
which an insured becomes legally obligated to pay, including damages in respect of bodily injury, property, pollution and product liability.  Coverage of bodily 
injury and property damage is subject to a coverage territory during the policy period.
We do not currently act as an operator in any offshore production operation, although we are involved in certain offshore joint ventures in Colombia,
the U.S. Gulf Coast and Brazil, and have exploration operations offshore of the Colombian Caribbean coast, which are operated by Equion. In Colombia, 
currently offshore production operations are carried out by Chevron. There are two platforms that produce liquefied petroleum gas. The World Wide Umbrella 
and Global Energy Package programs cover all of our interests.
With respect to offshore operations in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Ecopetrol America Inc. is party to Operating Agreements, or OA, that include customary
conditions and which contain similar terms and provisions to those in the Model Form of Offshore Deepwater Operating Agreement of the American 
Association of Professional Landmen (AAPL). In general, pursuant to these OAs, the obligations, duties, and liabilities of the contract parties are several, and 
not joint or collective, for all operations covered by the OAs. Liability for losses, damages, costs, expenses, or claims involving activities or operations under 
the OAs which are not covered by or in excess of the insurance carried for the joint account are borne by each contract party in proportion to its participating 
interest in the activity or operation out of which that liability arises, except when any damages result from a party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, in 
which case, such party is solely liable for such damages. The operators supervise the handling, conduct, and prosecution of all claims involving activities or 
operations under the respective OA or affecting the leases or the contract area covered thereunder. Finally, operators must obtain insurance as required by the 
OA which costs are charged to the joint account and must have HSE practices in place and comply with locally applicable HSE related statutory requirements.
Ecopetrol Oleo e Gas do Brasil Ltd. and Ecopetrol del Perú are parties to Joint Operating Agreements (JOA) based on the Association of International 
Petroleum Negotiators (AIPN), model.  Liability is generally the same as described for the OA above, with the following variations:  if claims arise from third 
parties as part of a claim not involving an operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, and the operator pays such claims, all parties must concur and 
reimburse such claim amounts. In certain contracts, all environmental damages are distributed according the parties’ participation interest, regardless of whether 
the damages were caused by an operator’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. In certain cases, non-operators may intervene and directly verify compliance 
of the operator’s HSE programs. Ecopetrol use the same liability clauses in JOAs for offshore operations in Colombia, when Colombian laws do not govern 
such agreements.
73
As part of the corporate policy based on risk financing guidelines, the assets transferred to Cenit are covered by the corresponding corporate insurance 
programs (World Wide Umbrella Program and Global Energy Package). Pipelines, however, are excluded under the property and terrorism policy coverage as 
part of a corporate risk determination. 
  
Salgar-Cartago and Caño Limon-Coveñas Pipeline Spill Incidents
We have a liability policy covering damages to third parties. We gave timely notice of the events of Dosquebradas (Salgar-Cartago pipeline) and
Cucuta (Caño Limón-Coveñas pipeline) to our insurance company, which appointed the corresponding loss adjusters. The loss adjusters report concluded that 
the cause of the incidents were related to slow and imperceptible movements of land that caused the rupture of the pipelines. Since these events were 
unforeseeable, the report concluded that the incident was caused by a force majeure event, which is expressly excluded from our liability policy. The claim was 
therefore declined by the insurers.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Under Colombian law, the Nation owns all crude oil and natural gas reserves within Colombia and we have certain rights to explore and produce those 
reserves in areas awarded by the ANH after public bidding. Most of our property, consisting of refineries and storage, production and transportation facilities, is 
located in Colombia. Our main assets consist of our wells, refining facilities and our pipelines. See “—Overview by Business Segment—Reserves” for a 
description of our reserves, sources of crude oil and natural gas, main tangible assets and material plans for expansion and improvements in our facilities. See 
“Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Use of Funds—Capital expenditures” and “Item 4. Transportation 
and Logistics.”

ITEM 5.
  
The following discussion presents our financial results and prospects as well as factors that affect our results of operation under Colombian
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
Government Entity GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. 
  
Effects of Acquisitions
Our most significant recent acquisitions are listed below, together with the effective date as of which each has been reflected in our financial
statements. These acquisitions were funded mainly through cash on hand and cash flow from our operations.
• Offshore International Group Inc., or OIG (February 2009) – 50% ownership. OIG is incorporated in the United States and its main asset is Savía
Perú, which carries out offshore exploration and production activities in Peru and has 8.6 million hectares of exploration and production areas. 
Savía Perú contributed with a gross production of approximately 6 thousand boepd in 2012.
• Ocensa (March 2009) – 72.65% ownership. In January 2011, as a result of our acquisition of BP Exploration Company Limited, we indirectly 
acquired 51% of its interest in Ocensa, increasing our share in the company to 72.65%. With this acquisition we increased our participation in a 
key crude oil transport system in Colombia, which transports approximately 57.5% of total crude oil production that reaches the Coveñas export 
facilities. Prior to the acquisition of BP Exploration, in March 2009, we entered into an agreement with Enbridge Inc., a Canadian company, 
pursuant to which we acquired 100% of its stake in Ocensa, thereby increasing our interest in Ocensa from 35.3% to 60%. During 2012, we used, 
on average, approximately 76.3% of the total capacity of this system.
Reficar (May 2009) – 100% ownership. After increasing our participation in Reficar, we continue developing the expansion and modernization of 
the Cartagena refinery. We believe this project will allow us to transform heavy crude oil into more valuable products to improve our profitability.
• Hocol Petroleum Limited (May 2009) – 100% ownership. The principal asset is Hocol, which has exploration and production activities in
Colombia. This operation contributed to increase our hydrocarbon reserves and production in Colombia. In 2012, Hocol contributed a gross 
production of 25.1 thousand boepd. On December 27, 2012, Hocol merged with Hocol Limited and Homcol Cayman Inc.
Equion Energía Limited (January 2011) – 51% ownership. BP Exploration Company Limited sold its interests in Colombia, which were acquired 
by us and Talisman Colombia Holdco Limited. The company was later renamed Equion Energía Limited. During 2012, Equion contributed a 
production of 10.6 thousand barrels per day of crude oil and 42 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.
•

For more information related to our acquisitions, see “Item 4. Information on the Company.”
Factors Affecting our Operating Results
Our operating results are affected mainly by international prices of crude oil, refined products and natural gas, sales volumes and product mix. Higher
crude oil and natural gas prices have a positive impact on our results of operations in our Exploration and Production segment due to the increase in our 
revenues from exported volumes. Results from our refining activities are also affected by conversion ratios, utilization rates, refining capacity and operating 
costs, all of which affect our refining margins. Finally, changes in the value of foreign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar against the Peso, have a significant 
effect on our financial statements. 
  
Sales Volumes and Prices
Our Exploration and Production segment results depend on production levels and average local and international prices for crude oil and natural gas
that we market and sell to our customers locally and abroad. Additionally, sales volumes are affected by the purchase of crude oil and natural gas that we make 
from our business partners and the ANH.
75
We sell crude oil in the international market. In addition, we process crude oil at the Barrancabermeja Refinery and Reficar, and sell refined products in
the local and international markets. Currently, production volumes and sale prices of crude oil and refined products are the main drivers of our financial 
performance, together with marketing, cost reduction and operative performance strategies. 
  
Local Sales and Prices
We have a number of crude oil and natural gas long-term supply contracts with local customers, including Reficar, gas-fired power plants, local natural
gas distribution companies and PDVSA Gas in Venezuela. Local sale prices are determined in accordance with existing regulations, contractual arrangements 
and the spot market linked to international benchmarks. 
  
International Sales and Prices
We export crude oil and refined products at prices which are set by reference to international benchmarks. However, we export any crude oil and
refined products surplus only after we have fulfilled our supply commitments with our refineries and local customers.
Our commercial strategy, which includes market diversification, has led us to countries such as China, India, Singapore and Spain. In addition, we have
started to trade some volume out of the Colombian supply chain by purchasing refined products from an international supplier and selling such products to 
clients in the foreign market. .
During the past three years, we have significantly increased our international sales on a “delivered” basis to the Caribbean, Central America, the United
States and Asian markets, giving us more flexibility both in operational and commercial terms. 
  
Gasoline and Diesel Price Differentials
We charge the domestic prices established by the Government to wholesalers and, at the same time, we accrue the amount of any fuel price differential
due pursuant to Law 1151 of 2007 as revenues and record an account receivable from the Government.
During 2010, refiners were entitled to fuel price differential payments. The payments made by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2010 corresponded
to the first three quarters of the year. The amount due to us by the Ministry, which included the opportunity cost recognized to compensate the delay on the 
payments, as of December 31, 2010, amounting to Ps$163.4 billion, was delayed and paid in the fourth quarter of 2011.
The fuel price differential payment from the Ministry of Mines and Energy corresponding to the first three quarters of 2011 was paid in December
2011. The fuel price differential payment from the Ministry of Mines and Energy corresponding to the fourth quarter of 2011 was Ps$571.8 billion and for the 
year ended of 2012 was Ps$1,381.5 billion. In April 2013, the Ministry of Mines and Energy paid the corresponding amounts due to us for the fourth quarter of 
2011 and first three quarters of 2012, amounting to Ps$1,271.9 billion. The amount due to us, corresponding to the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 
2013 is equivalent to Ps$390.3 billion. 
  
Exploration Costs
We account for exploratory drilling using the successful effort method whereby all costs associated with the exploration and drilling of productive
wells are capitalized, while costs incurred in exploring and drilling of dry wells are expensed in the period and accounted for under operating expenses—studies 
and projects. Consequently, the number of exploratory wells we declared as dry negatively affects our results. As such, the significant expansion of our drilling 
program, which we are currently undertaking, will likely result in higher dry well expenses and may lead to material changes or volatility in our operating 
expenses. 
  
Royalties 
  
We are required by law to pay in kind a percentage of our production (crude oil and natural gas) to the ANH as royalties. Each production contract has
its own royalty arrangement. In 1999, a modification to the royalty system established a sliding scale for royalty payments linked to the production level of 
crude oil and natural gas fields discovered after July 29, 1999 depending on whether the production is crude oil or natural gas, and on the quality of the crude oil 
produced. Since 2002, the royalties system has ranged from 8% for fields producing up to 5,000 bpd to 25% for fields producing in excess of 600 thousand bpd. 
Changes in royalty programs only apply to new discoveries and do not alter fields already in their production stage. Producing fields pay royalties in accordance 
with the applicable royalty program at the time of the discovery.
76
Commercialization of Natural Gas from the ANH
Pursuant to Decree 2100 of 2011, we entered into an agreement with the ANH under which we will no longer purchase the natural gas received in kind
by the ANH as royalties and instead will commercialize the natural gas of those fields in which the producer does not decide to directly commercialize the 
royalties. The agreement establishes that we shall sell to third parties on behalf of the ANH the natural gas that belongs to the government between 2012 and 
2013. This agreement became effective in July 2012 and reduced the natural gas we purchase from the ANH and sale to third parties by approximately 100 
gbtud during 2012.
imported services denominated in U.S. dollars, will by the same token increase.
77
Purchases of Hydrocarbons from the ANH
We continue purchasing all crude oil delivered to the ANH by us and from third parties as well as the natural gas from certain fields not covered by the
above-mentioned agreement and delivered as royalty payments to the ANH. Prices are set forth in a contract between the ANH and us dated December 28, 
2012, and a natural gas offer letter from ANH dated June 17, 2009. For crude oil, the purchase price is calculated according to a formula that includes our 
exports sales prices (crudes and products), a quality adjustment for API gravity and sulfur content, the transportation rates from the wellhead to the Coveñas and 
Tumaco ports, the refining process cost and a marketing fee. We sell the physical product purchased from the ANH as part of our ordinary business. 
  
Import of Products for Transportation and Blending
During 2012, we increased the volume of naphtha imported to 14.5 million barrels from 12.7 million barrels in 2011 for blending with heavy crude oil 
to ease its transportation through pipeline systems. In addition, in order to meet local environmental regulations regarding sulfur content in diesel, we imported 
11.2 million barrels of ultra low sulfur diesel for blending with our local production. Imported diesel volumes were higher than in 2011 due to growth in local 
demand along with less availability of this product related to scheduled maintenance of the hydrotreating plant in Barrancabermeja. Purchase prices were lower 
in 2012 (US$8 per barrel) compared to 2011, in line with international trends. Our variable costs are affected by available volumes of these products and their 
prices, affecting our operating results. 
  
Effect of Taxes and Exchange Rate Variation on our Income 
  
Income Taxes
The Colombian Congress adopted Law 1607 of December 26, 2012, which introduces significant reforms to the Colombian tax system. In particular,
the income tax rate was reduced from 33% to 25% starting in 2013 and the Equality Income Tax (Impuesto de Renta para la Equidad - CREE) was created with 
a rate of 9% from 2013 to 2015 and 8% starting in 2016. There are some differences between the treatment used to determine this tax and the one used to 
determine ordinary income tax. As a result, as of January 2013 we are subject to tax on our income at a rate of 34%. From 2008 until December 2012 the 
standard corporate rate in Colombia was 33%. 
  
Exchange Rate Variation
The appreciation or revaluation of the Peso, particularly against the U.S. dollar, has multiple effects on our financial results. In compliance with
Colombian regulations, our results are reported in Pesos, and we maintain our financial records in Pesos. Almost all of our exports of crude oil, natural gas and 
refined products are sold in U.S. dollars at prices determined by reference to international benchmarks.
During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Peso has appreciated on average 2.7%, 2.6%, and 12.0%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. When the Peso
appreciates against the U.S. dollar, our revenues from exports of crude oil and natural gas are reduced in Pesos. The appreciation of the Peso also results in 
lower cost of products, services supplied and contracted abroad as these are denominated in U.S. dollars.
When the Peso depreciates against the U.S. dollar, our revenues from exports increase when expressed in Pesos. Imported goods, however, including
Similarly, when we incur in U.S. dollar-denominated debt, a depreciation or appreciation of the Peso in relation to the U.S. dollar, may increase or
decrease both our financial expenses and the outstanding value of our indebtedness when expressed in Peso.  During 2010 and 2012, we did not incur any U.S. 
dollar-denominated debt.  During 2011, we raised US$3,500 million and US$80 million through our subsidiaries Reficar and Propilco, respectively.
New Accounting Policies 
  
Colombian Government Entity GAAP
There were no significant new accounting standards effective in the year 2012 impacting the Company pursuant to Colombian Government Entity
GAAP. 
  
U.S. GAAP
In December, 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) - Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. The
amendments in this update require an entity to disclose information about its offsetting of assets and liabilities, as well as related arrangements. An entity is 
required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Our 
preliminary analysis indicates that we do not expect these amendments to have any impact due to the fact that we do not have offsetting assets and liabilities.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The following discussion sets forth our critical accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those policies that require us to exercise judgment 
or involve a higher degree of complexity in the application of the accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations. The 
accounting estimates we make in these contexts require us to calculate variables and make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain. In each case, if 
we had made other estimates, or if changes in the estimates occur from period to period, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially 
affected. This information should be read together with Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the principal accounting policies and 
practices applicable to us. There are many other areas in which we use estimates about uncertain matters, but the reasonably likely effect of changed or different 
estimates is not material to our financial presentation. 
  
Oil and Gas Reserves
When accounting for our reserves we use the internationally recognized “successful efforts” method of accounting for investments in exploration and
production areas. These investments are amortized using the technical units of production method on the basis of proved developed reserves by field. The 
reserves are based on technical studies prepared internally. Internally estimated reserves are then submitted to an external audit process, which is carried out by 
our External Engineers. According to our corporate policy, we report the reserves values obtained from the External Engineers. The reserves process ends when 
the Reserves Directorate consolidates the results and present them to the Reserves Committee, whose members are the Chief Financial Officer, the Exploration 
and Production Executive Vice-President and the Vice-President of Strategy. Results are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and finally 
approved by the Board of Directors.
The estimation of hydrocarbon reserves is subject to several uncertainties inherent to the determination of proved reserves, production recovery rates,
the timelines with which investments are made to develop the reservoirs and the degree of maturity of the fields.
Crude oil prices have traditionally fluctuated as a result of a variety of factors such as changes in international prices of natural gas and refined
products, long-term changes in the demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, regulatory changes, inventory levels, increase in the cost of capital, 
economic conditions, development of new technologies, economic and political events, and local and global demand and supply. Revisions to proved reserves 
estimates of crude oil and gas and the effect of such price variations are presented in Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the crude oil 
price may affect our estimates in the future. A decrease in our estimated proved reserves due to pricing may result in the impairment of oil and gas properties.
78
The calculation of units-of-production depreciation and depletion is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation and depletion of
upstream assets. The units of production are equal to the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves (those proved reserves recoverable 
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods) and applied to our asset cost.
Proved oil and gas properties held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any impairment tests that we perform 
make use of our long-term price assumptions for the crude oil and natural gas markets and petroleum products.
Volumes produced and asset costs are known, while proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability and are based on estimates that are
subject to some variability. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is treated prospectively by depreciating the remaining book value of the assets 
over the future expected production, affecting the following year’s net income.
Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
We capitalizate of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the 
Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these 
criteria are charged as expense. The facts and circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells as of year-end 2012 are disclosed in Note 
35 to the consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In the performance of the impairment testing under U.S. GAAP, our management must make reasonable and supportable assumptions and estimates
with respect to: (1) the market value of reserves, (2) oil fields’ production profiles and future production of refined and chemical products, (3) future 
investments, taxes and costs, (4) future capital expenditures and useful life for properties and (5) future prices, among other factors. As such, any change in the 
variables used to prepare such assumptions and estimates may have a significant effect on the impairment tests. 
  
Financial Derivative Instruments
We may enter into hedging agreements to reduce our exposure to the fluctuations of international crude oil and products prices. Under Colombian 
Government Entity GAAP, amounts paid and income received under hedging operations is recognized as financial income/expense. We are not permitted to 
enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes.
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, our estimates are based on current spot prices subject to market variations according to the regulation
and methodology established by the Superintendency of Finance. 
  
Pension Plans and Other Benefits
By virtue of Legislative Act 01 of 2005, enacted by Congress, the pension regimes excluded from the General Social Security System in Colombia
expired on July 31, 2010. In accordance with provisions therein, it was concluded that those workers who consolidated their right to pension were those workers 
who complied with the age and continuous or discontinuous service time requirements of the law, the Collective Bargaining Agreement in force and/or 
Agreement 01 of 1977, prior to August 1, 2010. Other workers who were not covered by the previously described conditions must mandatorily be affiliated with 
the General Pension System. The agency responsible for paying the respective pension is the pension administrator chosen by the worker (either the 
governmental institution Colpensiones -formerly the Social Security Institute - or a private pension fund).
The determination of the expense, liability and adjustments in memorandum accounts relating to our pension and other retirement benefits requires us 
to use judgment in the determination of actuarial assumptions. These include active employees with indefinite term contracts, retirees and their heirs, pension 
benefits, healthcare and education expenses, the number of temporary employees who will remain with us until retirement, voluntary retirement plans and 
pension bonuses. The calculation of retirement bonds posted by us to meet our pension obligations is regulated by Decrees 1748 of 1995, 1474 of 1997 and 876 
of 1998, as well as Law 100 of 1993 and its regulatory decree. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
79
These actuarial assumptions include estimates of future mortality, withdrawal, changes in compensation and discount rate to reflect the time value of
money as well as the rate of return on pension bonds and other plan assets. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and may differ materially from 
actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, regulatory events, judicial rulings, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life 
spans of participants.
In accordance with Resolution 1555 of 2010 and Decree 4565 of 2010 applicable to Colombian Government Entity GAAP, due to the change in the 
mortality rates in 2010, the Company started to amortize the increase in the pension obligation calculated as of December 31, 2011 using a five-year term. See 
Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
Actuarial gains and losses, a result of differences between estimates and actual calculations and differences between Colombian Government Entity 
GAAP and U.S. GAAP are disclosed in Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in interest rates and amendments to plan conditions have 
affected prior estimates. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our obligations under the plans are reasonable based on our experience and market 
conditions. See Note 35 of our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the sensitivity of the assumed health care cost trend rates as a result of a 1% 
change in interest rates. 
  
Litigation and Tax Assessments
We are subject to claims for substantial amounts, regulatory and arbitration proceedings, tax assessment and other claims arising in the normal course
of business. Management and legal counsel evaluate these situations based on their nature, the likelihood that they materialize, and the amounts involved, to 
decide on any changes to the amounts accrued and/or disclosed. This analysis includes current legal processes against the Company and claims not yet initiated. 
In accordance with management’s evaluation and guidance provided by Colombian Government Entity GAAP, we created provisions to meet these costs when 
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. As of December 31, 2012, we had a provision of 
Ps$792.894 million for litigation contingencies. We also maintain insurance policies to cover specific operational risks and asset protection.
Estimates are based on legal counsel’s evaluation of the cases and management’s judgment. In the past, our estimates have been accurate and have not
varied substantially compared to final judgments. We believe that payments required to settle the amounts related to the claims, in case of loss, will not vary 
significantly from the estimated costs, and thus will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements taken as a whole. Litigation and tax 
assessment differences between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP are disclosed in Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements.
Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences 
attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax base. Deferred taxes 
on assets and liabilities are calculated based on statutory tax rates that we believe will be applied to our taxable income during the years in which temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts are expected to be recovered. 
  
Abandonment of Fields
We are required by law to remove equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites. To estimate this obligation, we
include plugging costs and abandonment of wells, dismantling of facilities and environmental recovery of areas and wells. Changes resulting from new 
estimates of the liability for abandonment can occur as a result of changes in economic conditions. We accrue the estimated discounted costs of dismantling and 
removing these facilities at the time of installation of the assets.
We use economic factors from different sources and develop our own internal estimates of future inflation rates and discount rates. There have not
been significant disparities between estimates and asset retirement costs paid. We believe that the assumptions used in recording our asset retirement costs and 
obligations are reasonable based on our experience and market conditions. The related liability is estimated in local currency and does not require adjustment for 
exchange difference at the end of each year as a greater or lesser value of assets.
Differences between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP are disclosed in Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements.
80
Recognition and Measurement of Assets Recognized and Liabilities Assumed upon Business Combinations
Under U.S. GAAP, we account for businesses acquired using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The application of the purchase method requires certain estimates and assumptions 
especially concerning the determination of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment as well as the liabilities assumed at the 
date of the acquisition. In addition, the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment have to be determined. The judgments made 
in the context of the purchase price allocation can materially impact our future results of operations. Accordingly, for significant acquisitions, we obtain 
assistance from third-party valuation specialists. The valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date and different methodologies are used 
for each intangible identified above. 
  
Goodwill 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a
reporting unit. The first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. However, if certain criteria are 
met, the requirement to test goodwill for impairment annually can be satisfied without a remeasurement of the fair value of a reporting unit. Fair value is 
determined by reference to market value, if available, or by a qualified evaluator or pricing model. Determination of a fair value by a qualified evaluator or 
pricing model requires management to make assumptions and use estimates. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and 
supportable in the existing market environment and commensurate with the risk profile of the assets valued. However, different assumptions and estimates 
could be used which would lead to different results. The valuation models used to determine the fair value of these companies are sensitive to changes in the 
underlying assumptions. For example, the prices and volumes of product sales to be achieved and the prices which will be paid for the purchase of raw materials 
are assumptions which may vary in the future. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions could lead us to record a goodwill impairment charge. See Notes 13 
and 35 to our consolidated financial statements.
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition price and the book value of the acquired
company. This amount is amortized during the period in which the Company expects to receive future benefits. Additionally, under Colombian Government 
Entity GAAP, goodwill is not subject to impairment tests.
OPERATING RESULTS
The following discussion is based on information contained in our audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction 
therewith. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Colombian Government Entity GAAP, which differs in certain 
significant respects from U.S. GAAP. See Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the principal differences.
Certain line items from our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 related to the presentation of the consolidated Balance
Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Financial, Economic, Social and Environmental Activities have been reclassified in order to make the presentation of 
such financial statements comparable to that of the financial statements as of December 31, 2012. The main reclassifications were under cost of sales, marketing 
and projects, accounts payable and related parties, Taxes, contributions and duties payable, Deposits held in trust and Other assets. See Note 34 to our 
consolidated financial statements for a description of the principal differences.

the ANH.
•
We use the following criteria to analyze our financial information by business segment: (1) third party sales are made at market prices by each segment 
according to their ownership of the products or services sold; (2) each segment bears costs and expenses incurred for production and marketing of its products, 
the corresponding administrative expenses and those expenses related to non-operational transactions related to its activity; (3) transactions between segments 
are accounted for as if each segment were a separate entity and prices between segments are determined by reference to those that could be obtained in 
transactions with third parties.
All of our financial information is presented by segment as follows: 
  
•
Exploration and Production – includes our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.  Revenue is derived from inter-company 
and inter-segment sales, exports and third-party sales. Revenues, costs and expenses for this segment include those costs incurred by us from the 
production field to the end customer.  Expenses include all exploration costs that are not capitalized.
Refining and Petrochemicals – includes our refining activities.  Revenue is derived from inter-company and inter-segment sales, exports and third-
party sales and corresponds to products processed in our refineries and our downstream subsidiaries such as motor fuels, fuel oils and 
petrochemicals at market prices. This segment also includes other services sold to third parties.
• Marketing and Supply – includes our revenues, costs and expenses associated with marketing and sale of products purchased from third parties and
Transportation and Logistics – includes our sales and costs associated with our pipelines and other transportation activities.

2011 and 2010.
In 2012, total revenues increased by 4.4% as compared to 2011, mainly due to higher prices of the crude oil basket, supported primarily by the higher 
Brent and Maya benchmarks prices. In addition, revenues increased due to (1) an increase in total volumes sold of crude oil mainly of Vasconia and Magdalena 
blends and (2) higher local sales of gasolines and medium distillates. In 2011, total revenues increased by 56.7% when compared to 2010 mainly due to higher 
average price of crude oil and an increase in total volumes.

Exploration and Production Segment Sales 
  
Crude Oil
Local Sales 
  
Our revenues from local sales of crude oil increased by 83% in 2012 as compared to 2011 mainly due to a 159.1% increase in volumes sold, especially 
from Rubiales blend as a consequence of higher demand of crude oil from shipping companies. In 2011, our revenues from local sales of crude oil increased by 
87.8% in 2011 as compared to 2010, mainly due to an increase in the average price per barrel and a 64.2% increase in the volume sold, primarily due to higher 
demand from shipping companies and local industries for energy generation purposes.
Export Sales 
  
Our revenues from exports of crude oil increased by 8.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011, mainly due to a 4.4% increase in the average export price per 
barrel, explained primarily by the higher Brent and Maya benchmarks prices. Export volumes increased as well by 5.9% primarily due to higher production and 
export of Vasconia and Magdalena blends. Despite the increase in volumes and prices, the segment’s revenues were impacted by a 2.7% appreciation of the 
Peso against the U.S. dollar.
84
In 2011, our revenues from exports of crude oil increased by 77.9% as compared to 2010, mainly due to a 37.3% increase in the average export price
per barrel, and a 38.2% increase in the volume of export sales. Increased export sales resulted from improvements in our transportation capacity and higher 
production of Castilla and Magdalena blends, partially offset by a 2.6% appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar. 
  
Natural Gas
Local Sales 
  
Despite the decrease of 4.9% in volume of local sales of natural gas on a consolidated basis, Exploration and Production segment accounted for a 
higher production of natural gas which led to an increase of 3.2% in local sales in 2012 as compared to 2011. The 4.9% decrease is mainly due to lower gas 
purchases from the ANH, pursuant to Decree 2100 of 2011, through which other companies are also able to purchase gas directly from the ANH.
In 2011, our local sales of natural gas increased by 23.9% as compared to 2010, mainly due to a 32.1% increase in the average local price per mbtu,
despite an 18.8% decrease in volumes sold. The decrease in volumes sold was explained by a higher allocation of natural gas for export sales due to the 
elimination of local regulatory restrictions during 2010 that forced us to guarantee availability of natural gas to supply local gas-fired power plants.
Export Sales 
  
In 2012, export sales of natural gas increased by 45.9% as compared to 2011, principally due to a 33.2% increase in our average export prices, partially
offset by a 12.4% decrease in volumes sold, mainly due to (1) the delay in the start of new projects related to natural gas production and (2) higher domestic 
thermal demand, and a 2.7% appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar
In 2011, export sales of natural gas increased by 275.9% as compared to 2010, principally due to a 179.2% increase in the volume of export sales as a
result of higher volumes of natural gas available for export sales, an increase in the natural gas demand from Venezuela, and a 26.5% increase in our average 
export prices, partially offset by the appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar.
Total Exploration and Production Segment Sales to Third Parties
In 2012 and 2011, our total Exploration and Production segment sales to third parties increased by 10.6% and 81.3%, respectively, in each case as
compared to the prior year principally due to an increase in volumes produced, higher prices for our export crude oil basket and higher selling spreads for our 
crude oil due to the indexation to the Brent and Maya benchmarks prices.  In addition, during 2012, revenues from this segment were positively impacted by our 
commercial strategy which included market diversification of sales to countries such as China, India and Singapore. 
  
Refining and Petrochemicals Segment Sales
Local Sales 
  
In 2012, local sales of refined products and petrochemicals increased by 0.6% as compared to 2011, as a result of a 2.4% increase in average local 
prices and a 2.2% increase in volumes sold due to higher demand for gasoline and middle distillates from automotive, aviation and mining sectors, resulting 
from the country’s economic growth, partially offset by the appreciation in the average exchange rate of the Peso against the U.S. dollar.
Local sales of petrochemicals and refined products increased 33.5% in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of a 32.3% increase in average local prices
and a 4.2% increase in volumes sold due to the same reasons mentioned in the paragraph above related to Colombia’s economic growth.
Export Sales 
  
In 2012, export sales of refined products and petrochemicals decreased by 8.2% as compared to 2011 due to a 4.0% decrease in average export prices
of our products basket in line with the behavior of international prices partially offset by an increase of 2.7% in volumes sold.
85
Export sales of petrochemicals and refined products increased 49.0% in 2011 as compared to 2010 mainly as a result of a 42.4% increase in average
export prices and an 8.0% increase in volumes exported, caused by greater fuel oil production at our Barrancabermeja refinery and an increase in the river 
transportation availability from Barrancabermeja to the Cartagena export terminal.
Total Refining and Petrochemicals Segment Sales to Third Parties 
  
In 2012, total refining and petrochemicals segment sales to third parties decreased by 2.5% as compared to 2011 mainly as a result of the lower export
sales of gasolines, diesel and fuel oil in line with the 4.0% decrease in average export prices of refined products due to the behavior of international prices.
Total refining and petrochemicals segment sales to third parties increased 38.2% in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of an increase in selling prices
and in the volumes sold. 
  
Marketing and Supply Segment Sales 
  
Crude Oil 
  
Local Sales 
  
Since January 2010, we consider crude oil sold to Reficar as an export sale because it corresponds to special free trade zone sales.  We do not have any
other revenues that we record as revenues from crude oil local sales and do not record any local sales of crude oil in our Marketing and Supply segment.
Export Sales 
  
In 2012, export sales of crude oil from our Marketing and Supply segment increased by 2.1% mainly due to a 4.4% increase in the average export price
per barrel, mainly supported by the higher Brent and Maya benchmarks prices, and a 5.9% increase in the volume of export sales. Increased export sales also 
resulted from improvements in our transportation capacity and higher volumes of Vasconia and Magdalena blends commercialized, but were partially offset by 
a 2.7% appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar.
Exports of crude oil allocated to our Marketing and Supply segment went up by 82.4% in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of higher volume
available from purchases from third parties and the ANH as a result of an increase in other producers’ production and higher average export prices, partially 
offset by the appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar. 
  
Natural Gas
Local Sales 
  
In 2012, local sales of natural gas from our Marketing and Supply segment decreased by 39.0% as compared to 2011, mainly as a result of less gas
available for commercialization due to the decrease in gas purchases from the ANH, pursuant to Decree 2100 of 2011, through which other companies are also 
able to purchase gas directly from the ANH.
Revenues from local sales of natural gas from our Marketing and Supply segment decreased by 11.6% in 2011 as compared to 2010, mainly as a result
of lower local demand, partially offset by a 32.1% increase in the average local prices.
Export Sales 
  
In 2012, export sales of natural gas from our Marketing and Supply segment decreased by 71.1%, as compared to 2011, mainly as a result of  less gas
purchased from the ANH, pursuant to Decree 2100 of 2011, as described above.
Revenues from export sales of natural gas from our Marketing and Supply segment increased by 288.2% in 2011 as compared to 2010, mainly as a
result of an increase in volume of export sales and increase in the average export prices.
86
Marketing and Supply Segment Sales to Third Parties 
  
During 2012 and 2011, our Marketing and Supply segment sales to third parties increased by 7.0% and 77.9% respectively, in each case as compared
to the prior year, principally due to an increase in the volume of export sales of crude oil and higher average selling prices. In addition, during 2012, the 
segment’s sales of crude oil were also positively impacted by our commercial strategy which included a market diversification of sales to countries in Asia. 
  
Transportation and Logistics Segment Sales
In 2012, our Transportation and Logistics segment sales increased by 13.0% as compared to 2011 mainly due to the higher transported volume of crude
oil, associated with (1) higher crude oil production in Colombia and (2) higher volume of products, mainly as a result of higher naphtha transported to dilute 
heavy crude oil. The segment sales were impacted as well by the revision of applicable tariffs charged per transported barrel approved by the Ministry of Mines 
and Energy.
Total transportation sales increased by 1.0% in 2011 as compared to 2010, mainly due to higher volumes transported, offset by a one-time transaction
in 2010 and corresponding to a premium received by Ocensa from Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp to increase transportation capacity during that year.
Transportation and Logistics Segment Sales to Third Parties 
  
Our transportation and logistics segment sales to third parties increased by 10.8% in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the higher volume of crude
oil produced by other companies in Colombia which required higher transportation services.
As a result of the above-mentioned increase in the segment volumes transported, after giving effect to eliminations from consolidation, our
transportation and logistics segment sales to third parties decreased by 5.3% in 2011 compared to 2010.

Our cost of sales is affected by a number of factors, including the increase in international prices for crude oil. The most important factors are described
•
•
•
Purchases of hydrocarbons from the ANH in 2012 increased 5% to Ps$8,452,336 million compared to 2011 and 51% in 2011 to Ps$8,048,981 
million compared to 2010. Both increases were mainly the result of higher average prices and an increase in the volumes purchased.
Purchases of imported products in 2012 increased 7% to Ps$9,447,041 million compared to 2011 and 56% in 2011 to Ps$8,840,450 million as 
compared to 2010, as a result of (1) higher volumes of naphtha purchased for blending with increasing heavy crude oil production in order to 
transport it, (2) higher volumes of products (mainly low sulfur diesel) for blending to meet local environmental regulations regarding sulfur 
content and (3) higher average prices.
Purchases of crude oil from our business partners in 2012 increased 8% to Ps$7,207,707 million compared to 2011 and 47% in 2011 compared to 
2010 to Ps$ 6,701,500 million, mainly as a result of higher average prices and an increase in the volumes purchased.
87
•
•
•
Services contracted with associations, which are pro rata expenses for our joint ventures, increased 14% in 2012 to Ps$2,037,205 million compared 
to 2011, mainly as a result of an increase in production activities and water treatment expense due to higher bottom sediment contained in crude. 
Services contracted with associations in 2011 increased 22% to Ps$1,791,681 million compared to 2010 due to an increase in production activities 
and high-price clauses in our joint venture agreements, which assign us additional production when oil prices are higher than a reference price (the 
“High-Price Clauses”).
• Maintenance costs increased 22% to Ps$1,923,736 million compared to 2011, mainly due to the relocation and replacement of our transmission
lines pursuant to our integrity program. See “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—Transportation and Logistics—Integrity Program.”  In 
addition, higher costs related the to repair and coating of pipes of existing wells as a result of the heavy rain season.  Maintenance costs in 2011 
increased 37% to Ps$1,570,912 million compared to 2010, mainly due to an increase in our operating activities and actions taken under our 
maintenance plan.
Labor costs in 2012 increased 9% to Ps$1,095,479 million compared to 2011 as a result of an 11.1% increase in our total number of employees 
due to an increase in our operations and projects. Labor costs increased by 6% to Ps$1,001,102 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of 
an 8% increase in our total number of employees, due to an increase in our operations and projects.
• Depreciation costs increased 4% to Ps$1,886,620 million in 2012 compared to 2011 and 17% to Ps$1,809,546 million in 2011 as compared to
2010, in each year mainly due to new investments and transport systems.
Services contracted with third parties increased 25% to Ps$1,088,597 million compared to 2011 and 2% in 2011 to Ps$872,565 million as 
compared to 2010, in each year as a result of increased supervision and technical management contracts for our business associations, due to 
increased exploration activity.
The principal elements of our cost of sales by business segments are as follows:
Exploration and Production Segment’s Cost of Sales
Cost of sales affecting our Exploration and Production segment are mainly related to the amortization and depletion of our production assets, services 
contracted with outside vendors, maintenance costs, project expenses and labor costs related to this segment. In addition, this segment’s costs were impacted by 
imported naphtha and transportation services.
In 2012, cost of sales for this segment increased by 14.8% compared to 2011, mainly due to a 22.2% increase in cost of imported and locally purchased 
naphtha necessary to dilute and transport heavy crude oil, and a 14% increase of contracted services in the Joint Venture Agreements of the Rubiales and Quifa 
fields corresponding to higher subsoil activities and water treatment.
In 2011, cost of sales for this segment increased by 44.6%, mainly due to a 32.3% increase in our heavy crude oil production, which required increased
purchases of imported naphtha to dilute and transport crude oil, and an increase in costs of services contracted (subject to High-Price Clauses) with certain 
business associations, such as Cravo Norte and La Cira, due to higher production and participation levels. 
  
Refined Products and Petrochemicals Segment’s Cost of Sales
Cost of sales affecting our refined products and petrochemicals segment results primarily from the purchase of crude oil and natural gas to upload and 
feed our refineries, imported products for the refining process, feed stock transportation services, services contracted for refinery maintenance, and amortization 
and depreciation of refining assets.
In 2012, cost of sales for this segment remained practically flat compared to 2011, principally due to a 4.6% decrease in crude oil purchased from our 
Exploration and Production segment to upload our refineries, offset by a 4.0% increase in the cost of imported products and crude oil purchased from the ANH 
and third parties.
In 2011, cost of sales for this segment increased by 35.1% as compared to 2010, principally due to higher prices for the crude oil purchased from our
Exploration and Production segment, third parties and the ANH.
88
Marketing and Supply Segment’s Cost of Sales
volumes from the ANH and our business partners.
Cost of sales affecting our Marketing and Supply segment are mainly related to the costs associated with purchases of crude oil and natural gas
Cost of sales for this segment increased by 4.7% in 2012 and by 80.4% in 2011 due to the increase in volumes and prices of the crude oil purchased
from the ANH and third parties. In 2011, costs were impacted by higher volumes and prices of natural gas purchased. 
  
Transportation and Logistics Segment’s Cost of Sales
Cost of sales affecting our transportation and logistics segment are: (1) project costs, which relate to costs associated with the maintenance of
transportation networks and (2) construction and conversion of existing pipelines for the transportation of heavy crude oil.
Cost of sales for this segment increased by 2.6% in 2012 as compared to 2011 principally due to the higher maintenance and contracted services costs
associated with the development of our integrity program. See “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—Transportation and Logistics—Integrity Program.”
Cost of sales for this segment increased by 31.5% in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to an increase in volumes transported through pipelines and tanker
trucks and an increase in maintenance costs as a result of the heavy rain season that forced us to increase pipeline maintenance activities. 
  
Operating Expenses
In 2012, our operating expenses increased by 21% as compared to 2011, mainly as a result of the following factors: 
  
• An increase in provisions of 604% mainly due to valuation of property, plant and equipment. As per Colombian Government Entity GAAP,
valuation of assets is to be performed every three years being in 2012. This process involves the comparison between the net book value and a 
technical value for a specific asset. The result of such exercise was the taking of a provision for impairment of some assets, mainly for buildings 
and transportation equipment from the Exploration and Production segment and the Transportation segment.
Labor expenses for operating and projects increased by 46% as a result of an increase in the number of employees, which, in turn, increased both 
wages and other benefits.
• An increase in exploration expenses of 48%, primarily as a result of seismic studies and unsuccessful explorations.
  
• An increase in overhead operational expenses of 19% primarily as a consequence of additional agreements signed with national police force as a
strategy to ensure the normal course of operations. This entry was also affected by higher freight and customs charges on foreign sales.
In 2011, our operating expenses increased by 0.2% as compared to 2010, mainly as a result of the following factors: 
  
• Amortizations increased 50% in 2011 as compared to 2010 mainly as a result of goodwill amortizations.
  
• Operating and administrative labor expenses increased 174% and 26%, respectively, as a result of the increased activities and projects.
  
• An increase in taxes in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the tax effect on the consolidation of Equion with Ecopetrol and the recognition of net
worth tax of our subsidiaries Reficar, Ocensa and Oleoducto de Colombia.
•
•
Increases in amortizations, labor expenses and taxes were mainly offset by a decrease of 87% in operational allowances and a 97% decrease in the 
amount of fines paid for the non-fulfilment in gas supply in 2010.
Each segment bears the costs and expenses incurred for product use or marketing and each segment assumes administrative expenses and all non-
operational transactions related to their activity. Operating expenses by business segment are described below.
89
Exploration and Production Segment’s Operating Expenses
Operating expenses affecting our Exploration and Production segment are primarily for studies and projects, which correspond to expensing dry wells,
amortization of the goodwill from our acquisitions and administrative expenses assigned to this segment.
These expenses increased by 28.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011 mainly due to the higher provisions for property, plant and equipment generated by
the update made on the valuation of property, plant and equipment, as described above. In 2011, these expenses decreased by 8.8% as compared to the prior 
year. 
  
Refining and Petrochemicals Segment’s Operating Expenses
Operating expenses affecting our Refining and Petrochemicals segment result primarily due to the amortization of goodwill from acquisitions, projects
and administrative expenses assigned to this segment. In 2012, operating expenses decreased by 3.3% as compared to 2011 mainly due to the lower 
administrative expenses. In 2011, as compared to 2010, operating expenses increased by 10.6% mainly due to non-capitalized projects expenses. 
  
Marketing and Supply Segment’s Operating Expenses
Operating expenses affecting our Marketing and Supply segment result primarily from relatively low administrative expenses related to the
commercialization of crude oil and natural gas assigned to this segment. In 2012, operating expenses decreased by 4.9% mainly due to the lower Selling and 
Projects expenses. 
  
Transportation and Logistics Segment’s Operating Expenses
Operating expenses affecting our Transportation and Logistics segment result primarily from the amortization of the goodwill from acquisitions
assigned to this segment and the development of projects in order to improve our transportation systems. In 2012 and 2011, operating expenses increased by 
30.1% and 81.2%, respectively, mainly due to expenses related to our increased transportation and logistics activity.
The following table sets forth our non-operating income (expenses) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Financial income, net. Financial income, net, mainly includes exchange difference gains or losses and , interest expenses, yields and interest from our 
investments, and results from our hedging operations. During 2012, our results reflected a net financial expense primarily due to the cumulative exchange rate 
loss resulting from the appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar. During 2011, our results reflected a net financial expense due to the results in our 
commodity hedging financial side (put options on WTI Nymex and swaps calculated using the Maya-WTI spread), affected by the spreads between Maya heavy 
crude oil and WTI light crude oil benchmark prices, which resulted in higher prices for heavy crude oil compared to those of the light crude oil.
90
Pension expenses. Pension expenses grew by 34% in 2012 when compared to 2011, principally as a result of (1) an actuarial calculation update for the
health reserve due an increase of approximately 23% in the average health services costs per beneficiary and an increase of approximately 3.5% in the 
population covered (retirees and their beneficiaries) and (2) an increase of approximately 9% in the education reserve. Additionally, the actuarial calculation of 
2012 included an increase of 1.5% on top of inflation taking into account the upward trend in the Company’s growth. In 2011, pension expenses increased by 
87% when compared to 2010, mostly as a result of (1) the actuarial calculation updating the health reserve which increased mainly due to a rise of 
approximately 21% in the average health services costs per beneficiary and an increase of approximately 15% in the population covered (retirees and their 
beneficiaries) and (2) an increase in health care services resulting from an increase of approximately 20% in medicine supplies and services due to the increase 
in the average age of the retirees and their beneficiaries. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
Other income (expenses), net. Other income, net, includes recovery of provisions, other revenues and other recoveries. Other expenses, net, include
legal and other provisions and taxes unrelated to income. Other income (expenses), net, increased by 33% in 2012 compared to 2011, mainly due to a decrease 
of 27% in other income in 2012 as compared to 2011, mainly as a result of (1) a decrease of 14% in allowance recoveries due to a lower recovery in 2012 of 
environmental, legal and healthcare provisions and (2) recovery of expenses in 2011 which had no longer effect in 2012. As of December 31, 2011, there had 
been an increase in recovery of services to partners, which mainly corresponded to (1) recoveries of associated pension services, product of our association with 
Occidental Petroleum Corporation and (2) income from commercially-declared fields held in association with partners. Other income (expenses) decreased 31% 
in 2011 compared to 2010, principally due to a recovery of past provisions for legal proceedings and other recoveries, such as the recovery of our allowance for 
pension liabilities, partially offset by an increase in taxes not related to income and new legal, pension liability and other provisions. 
  
Income Before Income Tax
Income before income tax decreased by 5.5% in 2012 as compared to 2011. This was mainly due to higher unexpected costs of water treatment and 
higher prices of larger volume purchases of hydrocarbons. Income before income tax increased by 105.7% in 2011, compared to 2010, as a result of higher 
revenues from greater average price of crude oil and an increase in the exported volumes of crude oil. 
  
Income Tax
The effective income tax rate for 2012 was 31.9% compared to 33.7% in 2011 and 28.2% in 2010.  The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 
2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the deferred tax credit on the valuation of investments, which caused a reduction of 1.65% in the tax rate. The 
increase in the effective income tax rate in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the elimination, as of January 1, 2011, of the income tax deductions on 
investments in real productive fixed assets. 
  
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing, in 2012 our net income decreased by 4.36% as compared to 2011. In 2011, it increased by 90% as compared to 2010.
Principal Differences Between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP
We prepare our financial statements in accordance with Colombian Government Entity GAAP. The accounting principles and regulations under
Colombian Government Entity GAAP differ in certain significant respects from U.S. GAAP. The following is a description of the most relevant differences 
between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP. Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements presents reconciliations of net income and 
shareholders’ equity determined under Colombian Government Entity GAAP to these same amounts as determined according to U.S. GAAP, as well as a 
complete description of the differences between the two accounting standards. The principal differences between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and 
U.S. GAAP are as follows:
Advances Received from Ecogas for Build, Operate, Maintain and Transfer Contracts 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, payment obligations under the Build, Operate, Maintain and Transfer, or BOMT, contracts were treated 
as equivalent to an operating lease. Under U.S. GAAP, the obligations were treated as capital leases, and an asset and liability were recognized. Payments under 
the BOMT contracts serve to reduce liability and the asset is depreciated. Subsequently, we subleased the same asset to Ecogas, with the corresponding 
treatment of the payments receivable from Ecogas as direct financing leases for U.S. GAAP purposes.
91
Reversal of Concessions 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, we recorded an asset for the contributions of the Nation of crude oil and natural gas reserves derived
from the return of oil field concessions to the Nation, which took place before the effectiveness of Decree 1760 of 2003 came into effect. Reserves were valued 
by means of the technical-economic model where the value per barrel resulted from the relation of the net present value obtained at a discount rate and the total 
proved reserves on the contribution date. For U.S. GAAP purposes, these reversions were considered a transfer of assets between entities under common 
control. Ecopetrol as the entity that received the net assets, should have initially recognized the assets transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the 
transferring entity at the date of transfer, which in this case would be zero as the transferring entity did not recognize a carrying value.
Effects of Inflation on Financial Information 
  
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the accounting records, which are maintained under the historical cost 
convention, modified since 1992 to comply with the legal provisions of the CGN to recognize the effect of inflation on non-monetary balance sheet accounts 
until December 31, 2001, including equity. The CGN eliminated the use of inflation adjustments for accounting purposes for state-owned companies starting on 
January 1, 2002. However, our consolidated financial statements recognize the effect of inflation on non-monetary balance sheet accounts for an extended 
period from January 1, 1992 until December 31, 2006 for Propilco S.A., COMAI – Compounding and Masterbatching Industry Ltda, Hocol, Oleoducto de 
Colombia S.A., and Ocensa because prior to our acquisition of these companies, they were subject to the accounting rules applicable to Colombian privately 
owned entities. Under such rules, the effect of inflation on non-monetary balance sheet accounts was required to be recognized until December 31, 2006. The 
accumulated inflation adjustments were eliminated in the process of reconciling our financial statements to U.S. GAAP.
Valuation Surplus 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, property, plant and equipment are revalued every three years in accordance with market value and the
investments in unconsolidated investees are revalued by using the equity intrinsic value (percentage of ownership of the Company in the equity of the investee). 
The excess of these amounts over the carrying amount is treated as valuation surplus with a corresponding amount in equity (valuation surplus). Revaluation of 
these assets is not done for purposes of U.S. GAAP.
Variable Interest Entity 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, consolidation with significant subsidiaries is required when there is control by having more than 50%
ownership or majority of the voting rights in the subsidiary. Under U.S. GAAP (FIN 46 (R)), if an entity has variable interests whereby one party absorbs losses 
or benefits from net profits in excess of its ownership interest then those variable interests must be evaluated. Ocensa was not consolidated under Colombian 
Government Entity GAAP until March 2009 since Ocensa was a variable interest entity under the rules of ASC 810 and was included in our consolidated results 
pursuant thereto until March 2009. Thereafter, Ocensa was consolidated under both Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP. See Note 35 to our 
consolidated financial statements for a description of our analysis.
Equity Method Accounting 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the equity method is applied for investments where significant influence, but not control, exists.
However, unlike U.S. GAAP, there is no ownership requirement between 20% to 50%.
Employee Benefit Plans 
  
There are significant differences in the measurement of expense and balance sheet amounts for employee benefit plans between Colombian
Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Pension Plans and Other Benefits” and Note 35 to our 
consolidated financial statements.
Investment Securities 
  
There are significant differences in the measurement of expense and balance sheet amounts for investments between Colombian Government Entity
GAAP and U.S. GAAP. See Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements.
92
Provisions — Allowances and Contingences 
  
There are significant differences in the measurement of expense and balance sheet amounts for provisions—allowances and contingences—between
Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP. See Note 35 to our consolidated financial statements.
Cumulative Translation Adjustment 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, foreign currency investments held in a currency other than U.S. dollars must be remeasured to U.S.
dollars prior to translating such financial information to Colombian pesos as the reporting currency. Any impact as a result of the translation process is 
recognized in equity as cumulative translation adjustments.
Under U.S. GAAP, investments in foreign currency must be remeasured to the functional currency with the effects recorded in the income statement
and translate them to the reporting currency with the effects recognized in equity as cumulative translation adjustments.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our principal sources of liquidity in 2012 were cash flows from our operations amounting to Ps$20,531,233 million and cash flows from financing
activities, mainly from the proceeds of our additional indebtedness, which totaled Ps$5,110,249 million. Our principal uses of liquidity in 2012 were (1) 
Ps$15,467,862 million in capital expenditures, which included investments in natural and environmental resources and reserves, and additions to our property, 
plant and equipment, (2) dividend payments for the fiscal year 2012 amounting to Ps$ 8,419,331 million and (3) taxes charged to Ecopetrol amounting to 
Ps$8,320,779. We believe that our financial performance driven by high production and favorable prices along with our access to additional indebtedness have 
resulted in cash sufficient to fund our operational activities and our investment plan.
At December 31, 2012, we had outstanding consolidated indebtedness of Ps$13,705,825 million, which corresponded mainly to: 
  
•
Ps$1,600 billion (approximately US$905 million) outstanding out of a Ps$ 2,220 billion (approximately US$1 billion) under a syndicated loan 
facility entered into by Ecopetrol with a syndicate of 11 local banks in May 2009. This loan facility has a term of seven years with a two-year 
grace period. The interest rate under the facility equals the DTF, plus an additional 4%. We make amortization payments semi-annually under the 
facility. In November 2011, we modified the guarantee we initially granted in this loan by replacing the original pledge over direct stock in Reficar 
(which was 49% of the total shares at the time of the loan), Ocensa and Propilco with a new pledge over our direct stock in Hocol Petroleum 
Limited, Offshore International Group (which corresponds to 50% of the total share) and Propilco. We used the proceeds from this loan to finance 
our Strategic Plan.
• An issuance of US$1,500 million aggregate principal amounts of 7.625% Notes Due 2019 (the “Original Notes”) on July 23, 2009 by Ecopetrol. 
The Original Notes were issued pursuant to Rule 144A/ Regulation S with registration rights with the SEC. The Original Notes were subsequently 
registered with the SEC on September 3, 2009 (the “Registered Notes”). Concurrently with this registration, we commenced an exchange offer to 
exchange up to US$1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of the Registered Notes for an equal principal amount of our outstanding Original Notes 
under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a prospectus dated September 3, 2009. The exchange offer was carried out in compliance 
with the obligations acquired by us under the Registration Rights Agreement referred to in the prospectus. The exchange offer expired on October 
2, 2009. Bond exchange requests were received in an aggregate amount of US$1,492,541,000. On October 7, 2009, we issued an aggregate 
amount of US $1,492,541,000 in Registered Notes and cancelled an aggregate amount of US$1,492,541,000 in Original Notes. The Registered 
Notes were listed on the NYSE.
• A local issuance of Ps$1,000 billion (approximately US$517 million) notes on December 1, 2010 by Ecopetrol. The notes were issued in four
tranches with maturities of five, seven, ten and 30 years and with variable interest rates based on the Consumer Price Index plus spreads of 2.80%, 
3.30%, 3.94% and 4.90%, respectively. The notes have semi-annual payments of interest and bullet amortization for each tranche. We used the 
proceeds from the offering of these notes to finance our capital expenditures in 2010.
93
• US$2.7 billion outstanding out of US$3.5 billion under three facilities held by Reficar with international banks and export credit agencies (United
States Export Credit Agency, Export-Import Bank of the United States (the US Eximbank), the Italian Export Credit Agency (SACE) and 
Exportkreditnämnden (EKN), the official Export Credit Agency in Sweden) to finance the refinery’s expansion. The facilities have a tenor of 16 
years and begin amortization as of June 2014.
• ODL: Ps$720 billion (approximately US$407 million) outstanding out of Ps$800 billion under a loan facility with local banks. This loan facility
was executed in May 2010 and has a term of seven years with a two-year grace period and the principal amount will be amortized in 20 equal 
quarterly payments. This loan has an interest rate of DTF + 4%.
• ODL: Ps$400 billion (approximately US$226 million) series of notes outstanding, having a maturity of seven years, will be amortized in five equal
payments from 2012 to 2016 and have an interest rate based on the consumer price index plus an additional spread of 4.88%.
• Oleoducto Bicentenario de Colombia: Ps$1,295 billion (approximately US$732 million) out of Ps$2.1 trillion under a facility due in 2024 with an
interest rate of DTF + 4.54%. The loan will be amortized in 44 quarterly payments after a one-year grace period.
• Ocensa: Ps$900 billion (approximately US$509 million) outstanding out of Ps$1,200 billion under a term facility due 2017 with an interest rate of
DTF + 4%. We make amortization payments semi-annually under the facility.
On March 22, 2013, we entered into a credit facility guaranteed by the US Eximbank. The four international lender banks are JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ LTD, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. and Citibank N.A.
The facility consists of two parts, whose terms are governed by: (1) a Facility Agreement for US$420,442,800, amortized over 7 years at a rate of
LIBOR + 0.65 and (2) a Credit Agreement for US$426,616,323, amortized over 10 years at a rate of Libor + 0.90. The funds can only be disbursed abroad and 
used exclusively to pay for goods and services purchased from U.S. providers. Therefore, none of the foreign currency disbursed pursuant to these facilities will 
be entering Colombia. Ecopetrol has not yet drawn on either of these facilities.

Our investment plan approved for 2013 amounts to US$9,549 million of which US$6,590 million is expected to be invested directly in Ecopetrol S.A.
and US$2,959 million in our subsidiaries. According to the plan, 93% of investments are expected to be made in Colombia and the remaining 7% for 
exploration and production projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast, Brazil and Peru. As in prior years, the majority of investments (62%) is intended for exploration 
and production. From the investment amount in our subsidiaries in 2013, US$1.336million is expected to be invested by them through their own cash 
generation, commercial financing and third-party or partner contributions, and distributed by segments as follows: 43% in downstream, 19% in midstream and 
38% in upstream branches. We expect our existing and anticipated working capital, capital expenditure requirements and declared dividend payments to be met 
from our cash flows from operations and cash on hand, and to fund part of our capital expenditures through the local and international financial markets. We 
believe that we should be able to access local and international debt markets if the need arises, although we can make no assurances that these external sources 
of financing will be available in terms acceptable to us, if at all. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks related to our business.” Furthermore, we 
may decide to access the equity markets through the issuance of an additional 8.49% of our common stock as authorized by Law 1118 of 2006, or through credit 
facilities with commercial banks, export development credits and sale of shares in non-strategic assets. The schedule for carrying out our investment plan 
depends on our cash generating activities, capital market conditions, execution of the investment budget in the various business areas and possible acquisitions. 
Our investment plan and anticipated capital expenditures in future years may change based on market and other conditions and our results of operations and 
financial resources. 
  
Cash from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 11% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of a 10% increase in cost of sales as a result of 
purchases of crude oil at higher international prices. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 59% in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of an 
increase in the average price of crude oil and natural gas and in volumes produced, which resulted in a 57% increase in our total revenues. 
  
Cash Used in Investing Activities
In 2012, net cash used in investing activities decreased by 7% as compared to 2011 mainly due to the fact that we did not make any acquisition of
companies as was the case in 2011. Additionally, during 2012, the investments for liquidity purposes decreased according to internal policies.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by 35% in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly as a result of an increase in our property, plant and equipment
investments resulting from our increasing activities. These investments were partially funded by cash provided by our portfolio investments, which totaled 
Ps$9,861,330 million. 
  
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities increased 22% in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to an increase in dividend payments, partially offset by cash
inflows derived from indebtedness from our subsidiaries Reficar and Bicentenario. Net cash used in financing activities increased in 2011 compared to 2010 
mainly due to an increase in dividend payments, partially offset by the proceeds from the second round of our shares offering and from our minority interest in 
other companies. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
  
Dividends 
  
In 2012, we paid dividends of Ps$8,419,331 million to our shareholders, including the Nation, to whom we owed Ps$3,915,436 million as of December 
31 2012. That amount was paid as of January 2013. On March 21, 2013, our shareholders at the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting approved dividends for 
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, amounting to Ps$11,964,959 million, or Ps$291 per share, based on the number of outstanding shares at December 31, 
2012. The dividend per share was comprised of an ordinary dividend of Ps$255 per share and an extraordinary dividend of Ps$36 per share. Ordinary dividends 
corresponding to the Nation will be paid in six installments. The first payment was made on April 15, the second will be made on September 16, the third will 
be made in October 16, the fourth will be made on November 14, the fifth will be made on December 6, and the last payment will be made between December 
2013 and January 15, 2014. The extraordinary dividend to be paid to the Nation will be paid between December 16, 2013 and January 31, 2014. The payment of 
the ordinary and extraordinary dividend to the minority shareholders was made in one lump sum on April 15, 2013.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES, ETC.
Our Vice-Presidency of Technology and Innovation was created in 2012 to add value to our business chain through the managing of innovation,
technology, knowledge and development of competitive advantage. The Vice-Presidency of Technology oversees three directorates: The Colombian Petroleum 
Institute (Instituto Colombiano del Petróleo, ICP or the Institute), the Directorate of Information Technology, or DTI, and the new Strategic Directorate of 
Knowledge, Innovation and Technology, or DCT.
95
Our research and development activities are conducted by the Institute, our research, development, transfer and data-protection unit. Its activities are
focused on developing technology solutions for us and the Colombian oil industry. Its scope covers the entire value chain of the company: exploration, 
production, refining, transportation, supply and marketing, as well as environmental issues, integrity and automatization. Each year, we present to the 
Colombian Institute for the Development of Science and Technology (Instituto Colombiano para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y la Tecnología, or 
COLCIENCIAS) our research and development projects in order to get a certification for our investment in science and technology. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, 
COLCIENCIAS recognized investments of US$86.15 million, US$50.83 million, and US$46.5 million, respectively, in science and technology projects. Our 
total investment in science and technology during 2012 was approximately US$97.3 million, of which approximately US$52.26 million corresponded to 12 
high-risk projects in research and development related to air and chemicals injection in oil fields, application of technologies for offshore exploration, petroleum 
systems in convergent margins, non-conventional hydrocarbons, biofuels, petrochemicals new refining processes, scaling deasphalting process and heavy oil 
upgrading, among others. We also invested US$45 million in projects for specialized technical and technological development as well as knowledge for 
strategic business groups. In 2011, we invested approximately US$67.8 million, and in 2010 we invested approximately US$69.1 million.
Our intellectual capital is preserved through a technological value-generation process and an intellectual property protection process, which include the
consolidation of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and publications in specialized journals. In the last seven years, we have filed 126 new patent 
applications including nine in 2012 for issues related to 3D seismic acquisition, surfactants for hydrocarbon transport, detection drilling tools for pipes and 
processes for production of bio-products from vegetable oils.
We currently hold 44 patents in Colombia, the United States, Mexico, Russia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil and Nigeria. In 2012, 21 new patents 
were granted. In addition, a layout-design of integrated circuit was awarded in Colombia. Our efforts in applications have been focused on improving additives 
production and the optimization of refining processes, equipment and tools to prevent fuel theft from pipelines, improvements in the transport of heavy and 
extra heavy crude oils and processes to obtain biofuels from vegetable oils at refineries, among others. In 2011, we filed for 28 new patents in various countries, 
including Colombia, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and Malaysia. One of our most significant patents for which we filed an application in 2009, is 
an anti-theft patent that allowed us to reduce fuel oil and crude oil theft by 50% in 2009 compared to 2008. Most of our patents will expire between 2016 and 
2029.
In 2012, we registered eight copyrights, reaching a total 135. We also registered 33 trademarks, such as our first slogan, “Clean Barrels.” 
  
During 2012 and 2011, two new commercial brands were granted to us. In 2010, we were also granted nine new commercial brands, adding to the 20
brands we had been granted previously (the existing brands have been renewed for an additional ten-year period).
Ecopetrol became the first Colombian company to obtain the American MAKE Prize (Most Admired Knowledge Enterprises), an international award 
that recognizes a company’s ability to transfer knowledge in order to improve performance through its operational, administrative and management areas. We 
were ranked among the ten best in this category of the Americas. Likewise, Ecopetrol has been selected for the third consecutive year as a finalist for the Global 
MAKE award, where it was ranked 28 among 112 nominees worldwide.
In 2010, the ICP’s Technical Information Center became one of the first specialized information units in the oil and gas sector in Latin America to
receive the certification in the System of Information Security Management under the NTC/ISO 27001:2005, standard granted by the Instituto Colombiano de 
Normas Técnicas, or ICONTEC, a Colombian National Standards organization.
In 2012, the scores for repeatability and reproducibility programs conducted by the ICP with about two thousand international laboratories from the 
American Society for Testing and Materials, or ASTM, the United Kingdom Petroleum Institute and Shell, among others, remained above 95%, keeping the 
international quality standards for laboratories.
As of December 31, 2012, we did not have off-balance sheet arrangements of the type that we are required to disclose under Item 5.E of Form 20-F.

SHARE OWNERSHIP
BOARD PRACTICES
Our Board of Directors is composed of nine members and is responsible for, among other things, establishing our general business policies. According 
to Colombian law, the members of the Board of Directors must be elected at the annual shareholders’ meeting in accordance with a proportional representation 
system similar to cumulative voting (through an electoral quota voting system – The number of votes required to fill each position is calculated by dividing the 
number of possible votes by the number of open board positions) and may be reelected indefinitely. The members of the Board of Directors may be elected 
without an electoral quota voting system when there is unanimity. Pursuant to our bylaws, Directors are elected for a one-year term, and the positions are filled 
either by person or by position. Currently, we have three members appointed by their position: the Minister of Mines and Energy, the Minister of Finance and 
Public Credit and the Director of the National Planning Agency. Our current Directors were elected on March 21, 2013. Directors may be removed without 
cause at any moment by a majority of the shareholders present at a general shareholders’ meeting. Our executive officers are appointed by our Board of 
Directors. 
  
The compensation of our Directors is set exclusively by the shareholders at the general shareholders’ meeting. See “—Compensation.”  Colombian law
prohibits Directors from receiving corporate loans.  Directors are compensated for attending board meetings and committee meetings.  A Board meeting 
requires a quorum of at least five members and decisions are approved with a majority of the members present.  None of the contracts of any of our Directors 
contains provisions for benefits upon termination of such director’s services.
Under Colombian law, a director or executive officer must disclose during the general shareholders’ meeting any transaction involving a conflict of
interest.  The general shareholders’ meeting may approve or reject the transaction giving rise to the conflict with the vote of the majority of the shares present at 
the shareholders’ meeting.  If the director or executive officer with a conflict is a shareholder, his or her vote will be excluded.  We disclose conflicts of interest 
of our employees, executive officers and directors in our Corporate Governance and Board of Directors reports.

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2012, we had 9,701 employees.  A collective bargaining agreement between us and our three main labor unions (USO, ADECO 
and SINDISPETROL) governs the labor relations we have with our unionized employees, which amounted to 2,230 employees as of December 31, 2012.  It 
also governs the labor relations with the 1,225 non-unionized employees that agreed to abide by it after asking to be waived of the Agreement 01 of 1977. 
Agreement 01 of 1977 governs the labor relations of our employees devoted to technical and trustworthy activities, which numbered 4,632 employees in 
Ecopetrol S.A. as of December 31, 2012.  The collective bargaining agreement and Agreement 01 of 1977 do not vary significantly in benefits.  Employees are 
subject to Law 100 of 1993 with respect to their retirement scheme.
Most of our employees are located in Colombia. In order to support our corporate growth strategy, we increased the total number of Ecopetrol S.A. 
employees by 10.7% from 7,303 in 2011 to 8,087 in 2012. The table below presents the breakdown of Ecopetrol S.A.’s employees according to the business

Labor Unions
We currently have three industry-wide labor unions and one company labor union: 
  
• Unión Sindical Obrera de la Industria del Petróleo — USO (Industry labor union);
  
• Asociación de Directivos Profesionales, Técnicos y Trabajadores de las Empresas de la Rama de Actividad Económica del Recurso Natural del
Petróleo y sus Derivados de Colombia — ADECO (Industry labor union);
Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de Empresas Operadoras, Contratistas, Subcontratistas de Servicios y Actividades de la Industria del Petróleo 
y Similares — SINDISPETROL (Industry labor union); and
Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de Ecopetrol — SINCOPETROL (Company labor union).
•
  
Currently ECOPETROL does not have any workers in the SINCOPETROL union. This union did not participate in the negotiation exercise. 
  
Our employees and any employee working for any company in the oil and gas industry may join the USO, ADECO or Sindispetrol. Sincopetrol may
only be joined by our employees.
On August 2, 2011 and November 8, 2011, we experienced two work stoppages promoted by the USO in Barrancabermeja to support workers
protesting at an unaffiliated oil and gas exploration and production company, Pacific Rubiales Energy. After our subsidiary Cenit was created on June 15, 2012, 
some workers (members of the USO) protested on June 19 and December 22, 2012. These protests did not affect our operations.
Typically, union protests do not impact our operations because, as soon as they occur, we implement our continuity plan and integrate other trained
workers that can operate in emergency situations.
Ecopetrol’s current transportation contracts were transferred to Cenit, in connection with the previous agreement. See “Item 4. Overview by Business
Segment—Transportation and Logistics—Cenit. There is no change in working conditions contemplated for employees who currently work at the transport 
segment of the Company.
On August 22, 2009, as a result of consensual negotiations, we entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement with USO, ADECO and
Sindispetrol. During the first quarter of 2012, we held meetings with the unions to discuss revisions to the collective bargaining agreement signed in 2009. The 
meetings were carried out under normal conditions and did not affect our operations. During these meetings, we analyzed certain articles of the collective 
bargaining agreement to clarify ambiguities as well as those that became outdated after the Company became public. The aspects that were analyzed during the 
revision process were, among others, union rights, health care benefits and food and transportation allowances.
Benefits and wages will be reviewed once the collective bargaining agreement expires in 2014. The following are the key terms of the agreement
currently in effect since 2009 until June 2014.
Transportation Subsidy.  Monthly transportation subsidy depends on the employee’s location and ranges between Ps$1,292 and Ps$138,557.
Food Subsidy.  Monthly food subsidy ranges between Ps$258,390 and Ps$299,010 depending on the employee’s location.
Lodging Subsidy.  Monthly lodging subsidy to employees is Ps$205,564.
Education Subsidy.  Subsidy that covers 90% of tuition and board expenses and fixed amounts of transportation and textbooks for our employees 
and their children.

programs in prevention of diseases, the supply of medicines and others.
Six months Bonus. Ecopetrol pays 48 days of regular wage to its workers; 24 days in June and 24 in December.
Stability Clause.  Employees who, as of December 1, 2004 had worked over 16 months, cannot be fired without just cause.
Retirement plan for employees.  Employees hired after January 29, 2003 are not covered by our retirement scheme but are covered by the national 
social security system.

to the following scale:

As part of our goal to improve workplace morale, in 2010 we implemented a number of initiatives to maintain good and trustworthy relations with our
employees, guarantee competitive wages, strengthen our corporate principles and culture, provide opportunities for personal development and improve the 
general welfare of our employees.  Our initiatives also sought to strengthen communication processes and to implement performance-based compensation.
To improve the quality of life of our employees, we extend various types of loans to them, including housing loans and general-purpose loans.  In
2012, we extended 1,043 house loans for a total of Ps$106 billion and 1,169 general-purpose loans for a total of Ps$1.1 billion.  We also provided on-site and 
external training and development courses to our employees.  At December 31, 2012, our investments in employees’ development amounted to Ps$31.6 billion 
and we extended a total of Ps$67 billion in subsidies for education. 
  
Labor Regulation
Since November 13, 2007, all of our employees are official employees as a result of our transformation into a mixed economy company.  Therefore,
our employees are governed by the provisions of the Colombian Labor Code since then.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We engage in a variety of transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business. Set forth below is a description of material related party
transactions. For additional information about transactions with related parties, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements. 
  
Ocensa
We have entered into the following agreements with Ocensa: 
  
•
In March 1995, we entered into an agreement for the transportation of crude oil through the Ocensa pipeline. Pursuant to the terms of this 
agreement, we were required to make monthly payments that vary depending on the volumes of crude oil we transported through the pipeline and 
a tariff calculated by Ocensa on the basis of Ocensa’s financial projections and their expected volumes of crude oil. In 2012, payments made by us 
under this agreement amounted to US$290.42 million. On January 17, 2013, this agreement was amended as a result of Ocensa’s new business 
model. Among other changes, this amendment to the transportation agreement establishes the payment of the tariff calculated according to the 
Resolutions issued in 2010 by the Ministry of Mines and Energy.
• On January 17, 2013, the Amended and Restated Oleoducto Central Agreement (AROCA) and other agreements derived from it were terminated 
by mutual consent among the parties. On the same date January 17, 2013, the shareholders and Ocensa entered into a new shareholders agreement 
that establishes the basis for a new business model, pursuant to which Ocensa will be a profit center instead of a cost center.
In December 1995, we leased the Porvenir and Miraflores terminals to Ocensa. Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement we received monthly 
payments during 2012 of approximately US$8,598,266 plus applicable taxes. The duration of this agreement is indefinite.
In November 1996, we leased the Cravo Norte dock to Ocensa. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we received monthly payments during 
2012 of US$23,000, plus applicable taxes. The duration of this agreement is indefinite.
In September 1999, we entered into a joint operation agreement for the TLU-3 Coveñas buoy with Ocensa and ODC. Pursuant to the terms of this 
agreement we are required to make monthly payments of a fixed amount of US$75,000 plus a variable amount depending of the volumes exported 
through the buoy. There have not been variable payments in the last three years. The duration of this agreement is indefinite.

In March 1995, Equion Energia Limited and Santiago Oil Company entered into an agreement for the transportation of crude oil through the 
Oleoducto Central S.A. (Ocensa) pipeline. In November 2012,  Equion Energia Limited and Santiago Oil Company transferred, by means of 
various transactions its shares (24.8%) and transportation rights (19.8%) holdings in the Ocensa pipeline to wholly-owned subsidiaries of 
Ecopetrol S.A. (51%) and Talisman (49%). Equion kept 5% of transportation rights in Ocensa. In 2012, the transportation fees billed by Ocensa 
were: Equion Energia Limited (US$7.5 million), Santiago Oil Company (US$1.3 million) and Hocol and Homcol (US$18.5 million).

Oleoducto de Colombia S.A.
We entered into the following agreements with ODC: 
  
•
In July 1992, we entered into a take-and-pay agreement for the transportation of hydrocarbons. Pursuant to this agreement, we must pay a 
previously agreed tariff over the volume of hydrocarbons transported. The duration of this agreement is indefinite.
In August 1992, we entered into an operation and maintenance agreement for the Vasconia and Coveñas terminals. Pursuant to the terms of this 
agreement, ODC is required to make payments of approximately US$1.5 million per year plus any other expenses incurred by us in the 
performance of the agreement, including a variable surcharge between 5% and 12% on such expenses, plus any applicable taxes. The duration of 
this agreement is indefinite.
In July 2006, we entered into an operation and maintenance agreement for the Caucasia Station and the Vasconia-Coveñas pipeline system. Since

In March 2007, we entered into a service agreement to guarantee the protection and safety of the Cusiana Coveñas and Vasconia Coveñas pipeline 
systems. Under the terms of this agreement, ODC paid us Ps$51 million per year. This agreement expired on December 31, 2011.

Refinería de Cartagena S.A.
In April 2007, we entered into a maintenance and administration agreement with Reficar, our wholly-owned subsidiary as of May 2009. Pursuant 
to the terms of this agreement, we provided Reficar with maintenance and administration services in exchange for a monthly fee. This agreement 
expired in April 2011, but was extended through the term of our negotiations.
• On November 29, 2010, Ecopetrol S.A. entered into a Peso-denominated loan facility with Reficar for an amount in Pesos equivalent to US$1
billion to finance capital expenditures and construction costs in connection with a project to modernize Reficar’s refinery. Ecopetrol S.A. 
disbursed the equivalent of US$591 million in Pesos and amended the agreement to reduce the commitment amount to US$600 million. The 
interest rate for the US$591 million Peso-equivalent loan is the DTF as of December 31 of the year before each annual period. On September 26, 
2011, Reficar and Ecopetrol Capital A.G. executed a new long-term U.S. dollar-denominated subordinated loan agreement for up to US$400 
million also to finance capital expenditures and construction costs in connection with the project to modernize Reficar’s refinery. Ecopetrol Capital 
A.G. disbursed the US$400 million under this new subordinated loan agreement in 2011. The interest rate for this subordinated loan is 6 months 
LIBOR plus 4.775% per annum.

•
•
In December 2011, we executed an agreement that governs the composition of the crude slate that the refinery processes, its purchase of crude and 
other products, and its sale of refining products. Additionally, in January 2012, we executed a new operations and maintenance contract. These 
contracts replaced the old maintenance and administration services contract. The fees billed to Reficar during 2012 under these contracts were 
approximately Ps$73.7 billion.
In December 2011, we entered into a construction support agreement and a debt service guarantee agreement to guarantee certain obligations of 
Reficar under the US$3.5 billion project finance for the expansion and modernization of its facilities. Pursuant to the terms of the construction 
support agreement, Ecopetrol S.A. agreed to support Reficar’s costs and expenses related to overcost and delays in construction. Pursuant to the 
terms of the debt service guarantee agreement, Ecopetrol S.A. provided Reficar with a liquidity mechanism to pay its debt service shortfalls and a 
mechanism to exit the project financing by transferring its debt to us. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and 
Capital Resources.” In June 2011, Ecopetrol Capital A.G. granted a US$240 million treasury loan to Reficar to finance delayed subsidy payments 
from the Nation. The interest rate for this loan is 2.10% per year. In December 2011, the Government paid US$198 million to Reficar for accrued 
subsidies, and Reficar used the entire amount to repay principal and interest on the treasury loan. As of December 31, 2011, the amount 
outstanding under this loan was US$45 million.
• On February 1, 2012, we entered into a crude oil supply contract with Reficar for a period of five years. Pursuant to the terms of this contract,
Reficar has the option to purchase up to 200 thousand bpd of crude oil from our Caño Limón, Vasconia Blend and Castilla blends. This contract 
includes an option for Reficar to receive from Ecopetrol crude oil we have bought from other national producers or imported from foreign 
producers on behalf of Reficar.
Oleoducto de los Llanos Orientales
We have entered into two ship-or-pay agreements with ODL: 
  
•
In March 2009, we entered into a ship-or-pay agreement with ODL that establishes a financing tariff used to pay ODL’s indebtedness to Grupo 
Aval for five years. This agreement was superseded by a new contract executed in May 2010, with a seven-year term, to reflect new conditions 
agreed with Grupo Aval. This financing tariff is collected through a trust fund, which in turn is responsible for making the debt service payments 
to Grupo Aval. Under this agreement, ODL has committed to transport 75 thousand bpd during the two-year grace period of the facility and 90 
thousand bpd during the remaining five years. Ecopetrol is responsible for 65% of this capacity.
In September 2009, we entered into a second ship-or-pay agreement with ODL that establishes a financing tariff collected through a trust fund that 
in turn is responsible for making debt service payments to security holders. Under this agreement, ODL committed to transport 19.5 thousand bpd 
during the first phase of the ODL project (which began in September 2009 and ended in the first quarter of 2010) and 39 thousand bpd upon 
commencement of the second phase of the ODL project which occurred in the first quarter of 2010.
In December 2009, we entered into a service agreement with ODL to transport crude oil. This agreement expires in June 2016 and can be renewed. 
Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, in 2012 we made monthly payments totaling Ps$176 billion for the year.
In March 2010, we entered into a pipeline operating and maintenance agreement with ODL. This agreement has a five-year term and the amount 
payable to us for the entire term of the agreement is Ps$56.4 billion, plus any applicable taxes.
In March 2010, we entered into an undiluted crude oil supply agreement, which was renewed in March, May and November 2012 until December 
2013. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, in 2012 ODL paid us Ps$20.3 billion plus applicable taxes.

Oleoducto Bicentenario de Colombia S.A.S.
In November 2011, we signed a five-year technical assistance services contract for the construction of the Araguaney Covenas pipeline. This 
contract is part of the project construction and the amount payable to us for the entire term of the agreement is approximately Ps$8.8 billion.
In November 2011, we entered into an operation and maintenance agreement for the Banadia unloading facility. Pursuant to the terms of the 
agreement, we receive monthly payments of approximately Ps$128.9 million plus applicable taxes. The duration of this agreement is 15 years.
In June 2012, we entered into ship-or-pay and ship-and-pay crude oil transportation agreements with Oleoducto Bicentenario that establishes a 
price, which requires the payment of Bicentenario’s indebtedness to local banks for twelve years. This tariff is collected through a trust, which in 
turn is responsible for making the debt service payments to the banks. The duration of the ship-or-pay agreement is 12 years or when the credit has 
been entirely paid, and the duration of the ship-and-pay agreement is 20 years after the ship-or-pay terminates. Under these agreements, 
Bicentenario has committed to transport at least 110 thousand bpd, of which the 55% of the agreement volume is provided directly by Ecopetrol 
and 0.97% indirectly by Hocol. In June 2012, we entered into storage-or-pay and storage-and pay agreements with Oleoducto Bicentenario. Under 
these agreements, Bicentenario is committed to receive, store, preserve and deliver our crude oil. The storage-or-pay agreement will terminate 
when Bicentenario’s indebtedness to local banks has been entirely paid, and the duration of the storage-and-pay agreement is 20 years after the 
storage-or-pay agreement terminates.
In August 2012, we entered into an Operation and Maintenance agreement for the Arguaney – Banadia pipeline system. Pursuant to the terms of 
this agreement, we will receive payments of approximately Ps$3.5 billion in the first year and approximately Ps$18.6 billion per year thereafter.

Financial Information
Our annual consolidated financial statements are filed as part of this annual report starting on page F-1.
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  Other than as disclosed in this annual report, we are not currently
involved in any litigation or arbitration proceeding, including any proceeding that is pending or threatened of which we are aware, which we believe will have a 
material adverse effect on our Company.  Other legal proceedings that are pending against or involve us and our subsidiaries are incidental to the conduct of our 
and their business.  We believe that the ultimate disposition of such other proceedings individually or in an aggregate basis will not have a material adverse 
effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
As of December 31, 2012, we were a party to 2,658 legal proceedings relating to civil, administrative, environmental, tax and labor claims filed against
us in the Colombian courts and arbitration tribunals of which 659 had an accrual provision. We allocate sufficient amounts of money and time to defend these 
claims. Historically, we have been successful in defending lawsuits filed against us. Based on the advice of our legal advisors it is reasonable to assume that the 
litigation procedures brought against us will not materially affect our financial position or solvency regardless of the outcome. See Note 31 to our annual 
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a discussion of our legal proceedings.
In December 2010, Llanos Oil Exploration Ltd., or Llanos Oil, filed a lawsuit against us in a district court of the Netherlands before The Court of The 
Hague which, if decided against us, could materially affect our financial condition. The complaint alleges early termination by us of the following exploration 
activity contracts: the 1997 Las Nieves Association Contract and the 2002 Guatapurí Association Contract. These contracts were terminated because of the 
default by Llanos Oil on July 28, 2000, and July 23, 2003, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of the contracts. In the incidental proceedings 
judgment of May 30, 2012, the district court in The Hague ruled that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the case and rejected all the legal grounds of the plea of Llanos 
Oil regarding the jurisdiction of the court. Llanos Oil appealed on August 2012 and the decision on appeal is expected during the second quarter of 2013. We 
have not created a provision for this claim because our legal counsel in The Hague considers the probability of success for Llanos Oil to be remote.
On April 16, 2012, we were served with a class action suit against us seeking monetary damages of approximately Ps$85,936 billion related to the
December 2011 Caño Limon – Coveñas Crude Oil Pipeline Spill. See “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—Transportation and Logistics—Caño Limon – 
Coveñas Crude Oil Pipeline Spill.” The Colombian Attorney General’s Office filed a motion requesting the judge to require the claimant to justify the amount. 
The claimant reduced the claim to Ps$11 billion. However, the court appraised the damages to be at the most Ps$298 million based on the number of people 
involved in the class action. The court set the date of the conciliation hearing for October 23, 2012 but the claimant did not attend and instead requested the 
court to set a new date for the settlement hearing. The court declined the request and decided to continue with the proceeding. As of the date of this annual 
report the evidence phase is pending. Our legal counsel is of the view that this class action suit has only a remote possibility of success. 
  
Foncoeco 
  
An association of former employees known by the acronym Foncoeco brought an action against us in connection with a company profit-sharing plan 
offered in 1962 that expired in 1975.  The plaintiffs claim that our Board of Directors had set aside a specific amount under the profit sharing plan, which was 
not entirely distributed to employees eligible under the plan. The court of first instance ruled on June 25, 2002 in our favor and rejected the plaintiffs’ 
arguments.  The plaintiffs appealed the ruling to the Bogota Higher Tribunal, which ordered us to present a rendición de cuentas (an accounting action) to the 
first instance judge based on the amounts allocated by our Board of Directors.  Based on the judge’s conclusion with respect to our accounting and the expert 
testimony of a witness presented by the plaintiffs, who we maintain included amounts never allocated by our Board of Directors to the profit sharing plan, the 
first instance judge, in 2005, ordered us to pay Ps$541,833 million, or approximately US$260 million.  We appealed the decision by the first instance judge to 
the Bogota Higher Tribunal and on June 22 2011, the court ruled in our favor and reduced the amount we must pay to Ps$6.6 million, or approximately 
US$3,707. On March 14, 2012, the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice permitted an extraordinary appeal filed by the plaintiffs. Ecopetrol filed its reply on 
May 18, 2012 and the appeal is currently in the evidence phase. As of the date of this annual report, the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice has not decided 
the extraordinary appeal. Our legal counsel is of the view that the appeal has a remote possibility of success.
113
We do not have a dividend policy. Pursuant to Colombian law, we may distribute dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors may propose a
dividend, which declaration, amount and payment per share is subject to approval by a simple majority of the shareholders. In 2010, 2011 and 2012 the 
shareholders approved the distribution of 71.8%, 70.3% and 79.9% of 2009, 2010 and 2011 of net income, respectively. On March 21, 2013, our shareholders at 
the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting approved an ordinary dividend of 70.9% plus an extraordinary dividend of 10% of net income for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2012. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Use of Funds—Dividends.”
DIVIDENDS
Except as discussed in “Item 4. Overview by Business Segment—Transportation and Logistics” related to the incorporation of Cenit as our wholly-
owned subsidiary and the transfer of assets to it, there have not been any significant changes since the date of our annual consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended December 31, 2012.

Transfer and Registration of Shares 
  
Transfer of Shares
Under Colombian legislation, if the transfer of shares has a value equivalent or higher than 66,000 Unidades de Valor Real, or UVR, a measurement
unit used in the Colombian market calculated daily, and the shares are registered with the BVC, the transfer has to be done through the BVC. Otherwise, 
shareholders can freely negotiate a transfer of shares.
transfers between shareholders who are considered to be the same beneficial owner;
Nevertheless, the following transfers are not required to be executed through the BVC: 
  
•
  
•
  
•
  
•
transfers of shares owned by financial institutions that are in a liquidation process;
repurchases of shares by the issuer;
transfers of shares made by the Nation or the Financial Institutions Guaranty Fund (Fondo de Garantias de Instituciones Financieras) or 
FOGAFIN;
transfers of shares issued abroad by Colombian companies, provided they take place outside Colombia;
transfers of shares issued by foreign companies, offered through a public offer in Colombia, and that they take place outside Colombia; and
•
  
•
  
•
  
With regard to public tender offers, Colombian law requires that all purchases of 25% or more of the outstanding shares with voting rights (including 
ADSs) of a listed company, or the purchase of 5% or more of the outstanding shares with voting rights (including ADSs) by an existing shareholder or group of 
shareholders beneficially owning 25% or more of the outstanding capital stock of a listed company, must be made pursuant to a public tender offer.
any other transaction specifically authorized by the Superintendency of Finance to take place outside the BVC.
repurchase of shares by the issuer in open market transactions;
transfers made through an auction as a result of privatization procedures;
sales in which 100% of the shareholders authorized the transfer to take place without a tender offer;
Tender offer rules have certain exemptions: 
  
•
  
•
  
•
  
• when the company issues shares with voting rights;
  
• when the company capitalizes its debts; and
  
•
  
In any case, the Superintendency of Finance must be notified of any transfer that is deemed to be an “hecho relevante” or a material event under

Colombian law. 
  
Registration of Shares
considered by law as shareholders.
Under Colombian law, transfers of shares must be registered on the issuer’s stock ledger. Only those holders registered on the stock ledger are
However, shares may be traded either in physical or electronic form. Transfers of shares are subject to a process for registration that differs depending
on whether the shares are evidenced in physical or electronic form.
117
Transfers of shares evidenced in electronic form must first be registered with the Centralized Security Deposit (Depósito Centralizado de Valores) or
DECEVAL, through the relevant stockbroker. Once DECEVAL has made the registration in its systems, it notifies the issuer of the transfer of shares in order to 
make the corresponding registration in the stock ledger.
When the stockholder has physical certificates, he is required, either by endorsing the certificates to the buyer or by giving a written instruction to the
issuer for it to register the transfer on the stock ledger.
Transfers of shares do not require any fees to be paid to the issuer, but they may be subject to certain taxes, stamp duties or other governmental charges
which must be paid by the parties. 
  
ITEM 10. Additional Information
BYLAWS
The following is a summary of the material provisions of our bylaws.  The last amendment of our bylaws was approved on March 21, 2013 by the
shareholders, which allows the Board of Directors to authorize the issuance and placement of non-convertible bonds as well as other debt securities. The 
amendment to the bylaws is in the process of being drafted and affirmed by the Notary.
This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to our bylaws, which are filed as an exhibit to this annual report.  For a
description of the provisions of our bylaws relating to our Board of Directors and its committees, see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees.” 
  
Organization and Register
Ecopetrol was organized on August 25, 1951, existing under the laws of Colombia.  Since November 13, 2007, Ecopetrol has been a mixed economy
company.  We are registered in the Chamber of Commerce of Bogota (Cámara de Comercio de Bogota) under registry number 899.999.068-1. 
  
Corporate Purpose
Pursuant to Article 4 of our bylaws, we may engage in the exploration, production, refining, transportation, storage, distribution and commercialization
of crude oil and its by-products in Colombia and abroad, and to support, promote and manage democratization programs and sales of its equity in accordance 
with applicable rules.  Our bylaws also authorize us to perform activities for the exploration and production of crude oil in areas that prior to January 1, 2004 
were operated by us directly or were subject to agreements subscribed by us; to directly or indirectly explore and produce crude oil in areas assigned to us by the 
ANH; to directly or indirectly explore and produce crude oil in areas assigned to us by a foreign regulatory entity; to buy, sell, import, export, store, blend, or 
distribute hydrocarbons and its by-products in Colombia or abroad; to undertake research for developing and commercializing alternative energy sources; and in 
general, to undertake any other activity instrumental or required to develop our corporate purpose.  Our corporate purpose includes administering and managing 
all properties that were formerly part of the De Mares concession.
Additionally, pursuant to Article 5 of our bylaws, we may enter into all acts, contracts and legal business and activities that may be required for us to
adequately fulfill our corporate purpose. 
  
Preference Rights and Restrictions Attaching to Our Shares
We have only one class of stock without special rights or restrictions. Our shareholders do not have any type of preemptive rights. 
  
Under Colombian law, our shareholders have the following economic privileges and voting rights: 
  
•
  
•
  
•
to receive dividends based on the financial performance of the Company in proportion to their share ownership;
to participate and vote on the decisions of the general shareholders’ meeting;
to transfer and sell shares according to our bylaws and Colombian law;
118
to inspect corporate books and records 15 business days prior to the ordinary shareholders’ meeting where the year-end financial statements are to 
be approved;
upon liquidation, to receive a proportional amount of the corporate assets after the payment of external liabilities; and
to sell the shares, known as derecho de retiro, if a corporate restructuring affects the economic or voting rights of the shareholders in the terms and 
conditions established under Colombian law.
Our bylaws and corporate governance code provide additional rights to our minority shareholders. These rights include: 
  
•
Sale of Assets. For a ten-year period counted from the date of subscription of the declaration of the Nation dated July 26, 2007 or until the Nation 
loses its status as majority shareholder, the Nation guarantees that any sale of 15% or more of our assets requires the approval of the general 
shareholders’ meeting and that the Nation would only be allowed to vote its shares in favor of the proposal if 2% or more of our minority 
shareholders accept the proposal.
Candidate List. Pursuant to our bylaws and Law 1118 of 2006, the Nation will include in its candidate list for election of members of the Board of 
Directors one member selected by the departments that produce hydrocarbons. In addition, pursuant to the declaration of the Nation dated July 26, 
2007, the Nation will include in its candidate list for election of members of the Board of Directors one member selected by the ten largest 
minority shareholders. The minority shareholders’ right to select a candidate loses its effect when minority shareholders, according to their share 
participation, name a member to our Board of Directors.
Extraordinary Meetings. Our bylaws and corporate governance code provide that the entity exercising permanent control over Ecopetrol must 
instruct the Company’s CEO or External Auditor to call an extraordinary meeting of the Company’s shareholders when so requested by a or 
plurality of shareholders holding at least 5% of the total number of outstanding shares. Such requests shall be made in writing and must clearly 
indicate the purpose of the meeting.
• Office for the Attention of Shareholders. Ecopetrol has an office for the attention of shareholders, our specialized unit responsible for receiving
complaints from our shareholders. Pursuant to our bylaws, shareholders holding at least 5% of the total number of shares outstanding may request 
that the office for the attention of shareholders conduct a special audit of the following documents: the income statement; the proposal for the 
distribution of profits; the report of the Board of Directors as to the economic and financial status of our Company; the report from our general 
counsel as to the legal status of our Company; and the report from the independent auditors. Special audits cannot be made of documents that 
contain scientific, technological or statistical information of our Company, or agreement that gives us competitive and economic advantages over 
our competitors, or in respect of any document related to intellectual property. Shareholders also have the right to propose good corporate 
governance recommendations to the office for the protection of investors.
• Others.  Pursuant to our bylaws, shareholders holding at least 5% of the total number of shares outstanding may propose recommendations to our
Board of Directors pertaining to the management of our Company.  Any shareholder may file a written petition to our Board of Directors to 
investigate corporate governance violations that the shareholder believes to have been committed.
The rights and restrictions given to our shareholders may only be modified through an amendment to our bylaws. The general shareholders’ meeting
Amendments to Rights and Restrictions to Shares
has full and exclusive authority to modify or amend our bylaws. 
  
General Shareholders’ Meeting
•
•
  
•
•
•
Shareholders’ meetings may be ordinary or extraordinary.  Ordinary meetings will take place in our legal domicile located in Bogota, Colombia, within 
the first three months following the end of each fiscal year, on the day and at the time set forth in the notice for the general shareholders’ meeting.  The call for 
the general shareholders’ meeting may be made electronically or by written communication sent to each shareholder.  In both cases the call must be published in 
a newspaper of wide circulation 20 business days prior to the date on which the meeting will take place.
119
In the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting, our Board of Directors and the external auditor are appointed and our annual financial statements, profit
distribution, audit and management reports and any other matter provided under applicable law or our corporate bylaws are approved.
Extraordinary meetings of shareholders may be called by our Board of Directors, by our president or chief executive officer, by our external auditor, or
by shareholders holding at least 5% of the shares outstanding.  Calls to extraordinary meetings should be made at least eight days prior to the date of the 
meeting, and may be made electronically or by written communication to each shareholder or be published in a newspaper of wide circulation.  The meeting 
notice must specify the agenda for the meeting.
The required quorum for both ordinary and extraordinary meetings is 50% plus one share entitled to vote and decisions are approved with a majority of 
the members present.  This quorum is exempted in the case of “second-call meetings,” which may take place when a meeting fails to obtain the required quorum 
and is called within a period between 10 business days and 30 business days from the first date, in which case decisions may be adopted by a majority of the 
shares present regardless of the number represented.
Unless Colombian law requires a super majority, decisions made at ordinary and extraordinary shareholders’ meeting must be approved by a majority
of the shares present.  Colombian law requires super majorities in the following cases:
the vote of at least 70% of the shares present and entitled to vote at the ordinary shareholders’ meeting is required to approve the issuance of stock 
not subject to preemptive rights;
the vote of at least 78% of the shares represented entitled to vote is required to approve the distribution of less than 50% of the annual net 
profits.  If the sum of all legal reserves (statutory, legal and optional) exceeds the amount of the outstanding capital, the Company must distribute 
at least 70% of the annual net profits;
the vote of at least 80% of the shares represented is required to approve the payment of dividends in shares; and
the vote of 100% of the outstanding and issued shares is required to replace a vacancy on the Board of Directors without applying the electoral 
quotient system.
Shareholders may be represented by proxies provided that the proxy:  (1) is in writing (faxes and electronic documents are valid), (2) specifies the
name of the representative, (3) specifies the date or time of the meeting for which the proxy is given and (4) includes other information specified by the 
applicable law.  Proxies granted abroad do not require legalization or an apostille.
During our ordinary annual shareholders’ meeting, our employees and Directors are only allowed to represent their own shares, unless they act as legal

representatives. 
  
Limitations to the Rights to Hold Securities
There are no limitations in our bylaws or Colombian law on the rights of Colombian residents or foreign investors to own the shares of our Company,
or on the right to hold or exercise voting rights with respect to those shares, except in cases of legal representation. 
  
Restrictions on Change of Control Mergers, Acquisitions or Corporate Restructuring of the Company
Under Colombian law and our bylaws, the general shareholders’ meeting has full authority to approve any corporate restructuring including, any
mergers, acquisitions or spin-offs.  Corporate restructurings are also subject to the requirement that the Nation must hold a minimum of 80% of our common 
stock at all times.  While Law 1118 of 2006 is in effect, there cannot be any restructuring that results in a change of control of our Company. 
  
Ownership Threshold Requiring Public Disclosure
Our corporate governance code provides that we must disclose periodically on our web page, the names of the shareholders of our Company including,
at least, the 20 shareholders with the greatest number of shares.  We must also disclose this information to the Superintendency of Finance at the end of each 
fiscal year.
120
Colombian securities regulations set forth the obligation to disclose any material event or hecho relevante. Any transfer of shares equal or greater than
5% of our capital stock or any person acquiring a percentage of shares that would make him the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our capital stock, is a 
material event, and therefore, must be disclosed to the Superintendency of Finance. 
  
Changes in the Capital of the Company
There are no conditions in our bylaws governing changes in our capital stock that are more stringent than those required under Colombian law, with the
exception that the Nation must hold a minimum of 80% of our capital stock at all times. Even though the Government noted in previous years its intention to 
make a proposal to the Colombian Congress that would allow the Nation to hold 70% of the capital stock of the Company, Government officials remarked in 
early 2013 that no such proposals were intended in 2013. We do not know whether the Government will make such a proposal or if the Colombian Congress 
will approve any such law. 
  
External Auditor
Pursuant to our bylaws, our external auditor shall not be appointed for more than five consecutive one-year terms by us. However, an external auditor 
may be hired again after two terms have passed since the conclusion of its last term of appointment.  At the ordinary general shareholders’ meeting on March 
21, 2013, the shareholders appointed Pricewaterhouse Coopers Ltd. as external auditor of Ecopetrol.
MATERIAL CONTRACTS
Transportation Agreement between Ecopetrol and Empresa Colombiana de Gas ESP/Transportadora de Gas del Interior S.A. ESP
On October 6, 2006, we entered into a natural gas transportation agreement with Empresa Colombiana de Gas ESP, or Ecogas, for the transportation of 
natural gas from the Ballena terminal located in the La Guajira fields to the Barrancabermeja terminal. On February 27, 2007, Ecogas transferred the rights and 
obligations under this agreement to Transportadora de Gas del Interior S.A. ESP, currently operating as Transportadora de Gas Internacional S.A. ESP, or TGI. 
This agreement expired on November 30, 2012.
On October 1, 2008, Ecopetrol and TGI signed a natural gas transportation agreement for the transportation of 116,500 thousand cfpd from December
1, 2012 to December 31, 2020 of natural gas from the Ballena terminal located in the La Guajira fields to Barrancabermeja. Pursuant to the terms of the 
agreement, we pay to TGI a regulated transportation tariff composed of a fixed fee, variable fee depending on transported volumes and an administration, 
operation and maintenance fee. Payments for transported volume are made in Pesos. During 2012, we paid Ps$49,416 million for the transportation services 
provided to us by TGI. 
  
Transportation Agreement between Ecopetrol and Ocensa
On March 31, 1995, we entered into a crude oil transportation agreement with Ocensa. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party
Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Agreements—Ocensa.” 
  
Reficar
On December 30, 2011, we entered into a construction support agreement pursuant to which we agreed to support Reficar’s costs and expenses related
to overcost and delays in construction. The project financing contract and the related guarantee are described in “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and 
Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
  
Cenit
On April 1, 2013 we entered into two transportation agreements with Cenit, pursuant to which it will provide us with hydrocarbon and refined products 
transportation and logistics services through the transportation assets transferred to it as an in-kind capitalization. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related 
Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Agreements—Cenit.”
121
EXCHANGE CONTROLS
Payments in foreign currency with respect to certain foreign exchange transactions including international investments between Colombian residents 
and non-Colombian residents must by law be conducted through the commercial exchange market. Therefore, any foreign currency income or expenses under 
the ADRs must be channeled through that market. Transactions conducted through the commercial exchange market are made at market rates freely negotiated 
with authorized intermediaries (banks, financial corporations, administrators and others).
Foreign capital investments must be made through authorized foreign exchange investment management companies. Only brokerage firms, trusts and 
investment management companies, subject to the inspection and supervision of the Superintendency of Finance are allowed to make investments in the local 
Colombian market on behalf of foreign investors, and, when referring to portfolio investments, such firms, trusts and investment management companies also 
act as the investors’ local representatives.
Colombian law provides that the Colombian Central Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market at its own discretion at any time. Likewise, 
from time to time, the Colombian government introduces amendments to the International Investment Statute. The Colombian Central Bank may also limit the 
remittance of dividends and/or investments of foreign currency received by Colombian residents whenever international reserves fall below an amount equal to 
three months of imports. We cannot assure you that the Colombian Central Bank will not intervene in the future. However, since the establishment of the 
current foreign exchange regime in 1991, the Colombian Central Bank has never taken such action. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks 
Relating to Colombia’s political and regional environment.” 
  
Registration of Foreign Investment Represented in Underlying Shares
Colombia’s International Investment Statute, which has been amended from time to time through related decrees and regulations, regulates the manner
in which non-Colombian resident entities and individuals can invest in Colombia and participate in the Colombian securities markets. Among other 
requirements, the statute mandates registration of certain foreign exchange transactions with the Colombian Central Bank and specifies procedures to authorize 
and administer certain types of foreign investments. Additionally, pertinent information must be updated yearly.
Under these foreign investment regulations, the failure of a foreign investor to report or register with the Colombian Central Bank foreign exchange 
transactions relating to investments in Colombia on a timely basis may prevent the investor from obtaining remittance rights, constitute an exchange control 
infraction, and result in a fine.
Foreign investors who acquire ADRs are not required to register the investment with Colombian authorities. Holders of ADRs will benefit from the 
registration to be obtained by the custodian for our common shares underlying the ADRs in Colombia, which permits the custodian to convert dividends and 
other distributions with respect to the common shares into foreign currency and remit the proceeds abroad. If investors in ADRs choose to surrender their ADRs 
and withdraw common shares, they must register their investment in the common shares as a portfolio investment through their local representative. The local 
representative is the brokerage firm, trust company or investment management company that acts on behalf of the holders for the common shares in Colombia, 
and the request for registration is made by them through the transmission of consolidated information to the Colombian Central Bank.
In obtaining its own foreign investment registration, an investor who surrenders its ADRs and withdraws common shares may incur expenses and/or 
suffer delays in the application process. Investors would only be allowed to transfer dividends abroad or transfer funds received as distributions relating to our 
common shares after their foreign investment registration procedure with the Colombian Central Bank has been completed. In addition, the depositary’s foreign 
investment registration may also be adversely affected by future legislative changes, but its rights to transfer dividends abroad or profits arising from 
distributions relating to our common shares must be maintained according to Colombian law and foreign investment treaties entered into by Colombia, except 
when Colombia’s international reserves fall below an amount equivalent to three months’ worth of imports.
Colombian Tax Considerations
The following is a general description of the Colombian tax considerations for investments in common shares in Colombia or for the purchase of
ADSs, in a foreign securities market. This description is based on applicable law in effect as of the date of this annual report, which may be subject to change. 
Please note that changes in tax regulations may apply retroactively, which in turn may affect the validity of the information provided herein.
TAXATION
122
Prospective purchasers of common shares or ADSs should consult their own tax advisors for a detailed analysis of the tax consequences resulting from
the acquisition, ownership and disposition of common shares or ADSs. 
  
General Rules
(iii)
Entities and individuals who are residents or are domiciled in Colombia or are considered residents in Colombia for tax purposes, are subject to
Colombian income tax on their worldwide income. Non-resident entities and non-resident individuals are subject to income tax in Colombia solely on their 
Colombian-source income which, as a general rule, originates in the sale of assets located in the country at the time of the sale, in the exploitation of tangible 
and intangible assets in Colombia, and in the rendering of services within the Colombian territory. Double taxation treaties signed by Colombia, if applicable, 
provide for special rules regarding income tax.
For purposes of Colombian taxation, an individual is a resident if he or she meets any of the following criteria: 
  
(i)
  
(ii)
remains in Colombia for more than 183 calendar days within any given 365-consecutive-day term;
is related to the Colombian Government’s foreign service or to individuals who are at the Colombian Government’s foreign service and who, 
by virtue of the Vienna Conventions on diplomatic and consular relations, is exempt from taxes during the time of service; or
is a Colombian national and:
  
- has a spouse or permanent companion, or dependent children, who are Residents, or 
  
- 50% or more of his or her total income is sourced in Colombia, or 
  
- 50% or more of his or her assets are managed in Colombia, or 
  
- 50% or more of his or her assets are deemed to be located in Colombia, or 
  
- has failed to provide proof of residency in another country (different from Colombia) upon previous official request by the Colombian tax 
office, or 
  
- is a resident of a country deemed a tax haven under Colombian law.
For purposes of Colombian taxation, an entity is deemed to be a national, and, therefore, is subject to taxation in Colombia as a resident, if it meets any
of the following criteria:
(i)            it has its place of business or its place of effective management in Colombia during the corresponding year or taxable period; 
  
(ii)           it has its main domicile in the Colombian territory; or 
  
(iii)          it has been incorporated in Colombia, in accordance with Colombian laws. 
  
Pursuant to the Colombian Tax Statute, a foreign company or non-resident individual has a permanent establishment in Colombia when said company
or individual performs activities in Colombia through: (i) a fixed place of business (i.e., branches, factories or offices), or (ii) an individual who is not an 
independent agent empowered to execute agreements on behalf of the foreign company. Permanent establishments are considered Colombian taxpayers in 
connection with the income and taxable gains attributed to said permanent establishment. A foreign company or entity will not be deemed to have a permanent 
establishment by the sole fact that it acts through a broker or any other independent agent.

Tax Treatment of a Non-Resident of Colombia who Purchases an ADS in a Foreign Securities Market 
  
Dividends 
  
As a general rule, dividends paid to foreign companies, foreign entities or non-Colombian residents who are investing in Colombian shares directly or
through a foreign investment capital fund, or FICF, are treated as Colombian-source income, and thus are subject to Colombian income tax.
To avoid double taxation, dividends are not subject to tax at the shareholder level when they are paid out of corporate profits that have been previously
taxed at the corporate level. If the accounting or commercial earnings of a Colombian company exceed the tax profits subject to income tax at the corporate 
level, then the excess distributed as dividends is subject to income tax at the shareholder level. If the shareholder is a non-resident, the applicable tax rate is 
33%. Further regulation and decrees are pending to be enacted by the government, as a consequence of the tax reform (Law 1607 of 2012 which entered into 
force on January 1, 2013).
If the shareholder is a non-resident entity or a non-resident individual investing through an FICF on portfolio investments, the applicable withholding 
tax rate is 25% and it is applied on the basis of the total amounts distributed, assuming that the dividends cannot be attributed to a permanent establishment in 
Colombia belonging to the shareholder. Foreign shareholders subject to such withholding taxes are not required to file an income tax return in Colombia.
Therefore, dividends distributed out of taxed earnings at the corporate level to shareholders who are non-residents will be exempt from income,
withholding and remittance taxes. This exception does not apply in the case of distributions paid out of non-taxed earnings at the corporate level, which would 
be subject to the 33% income tax rate. 
  
Taxation of Capital Gains from the sale of ADSs
Capital gains obtained from the sale of ADSs by non-resident entities, Colombian individuals who are not residents in Colombia or foreign non-
resident individuals, are not subject to income tax in Colombia as such sale does not result in Colombian-source income to the extent that the ADSs are not 
deemed to be owned in Colombia.
If the holder of the ADSs who is a non-resident entity, a Colombian individual who is not a resident in Colombia or a foreign non-resident individual,
decides to surrender the ADSs and withdraw the underlying common shares, it is arguable that such transaction does not constitute a capital gain subject to 
income tax in Colombia. However, different interpretations may be adopted by the Colombian Tax Authorities on this matter. 
  
Tax Treatment in Colombia of Non-Resident who Purchases Ecopetrol´s Shares in Colombia’s Securities Market 
  
Dividends 
  
As a general rule, dividends paid to foreign companies or foreign entities, non-Colombian residents, who are investing in Colombian shares directly or
through a FICF are treated as Colombian-source income; thus, they are subject to Colombian income tax.
To avoid double taxation, dividends are not subject to tax at the shareholder level when they are paid out of corporate profits that have been previously
taxed at the corporate level. If the accounting or commercial earnings of a Colombian company exceed the tax profits subject to income tax at the corporate 
level, then the excess distributed as dividends is subject to income tax at the shareholder level. If the shareholder is a non-Colombian resident, the applicable tax 
rate is 33%. Further regulation and decrees are pending to be enacted by the government, as a consequence of the tax reform (Law 1607 of 2012 which entered 
into force on January 1, 2013).
If the shareholder is a non-resident entity or a non-resident individual investing through a FICF on portfolio investments, the applicable withholding 
tax rate is 25% and it is applied on the basis of the total amounts distributed, assuming that the dividends cannot be attributed to a permanent establishment in 
Colombia belonging to the shareholder. Foreign shareholders subject to said withholding taxes are not required to file an income tax return in Colombia.
124
Therefore, dividends distributed out of taxed earnings at the corporate level to shareholders who are non-residents, will be exempt from income,
withholding and remittance taxes. This exception does not apply in the case of distributions paid out of non-taxed earnings at the corporate level which would 
be subject to the 33% income tax rate. 
  
Taxation of Capital Gains for the Sale of Shares
Capital gains obtained in the sale of shares listed on the BVC and owned by the same beneficial owner, are not subject to income tax in Colombia,
provided that the shares sold during the taxable year do not represent more than 10% of the outstanding shares of the listed company. Pursuant to Article 18 of 
Decree 2634 of 2012, sellers of shares are not required to file an income tax return for the transfer of securities that are listed in the National Registry of 
Securities and Issuers (Registro Nacional de Valores y Emisores or RNVE) as long as the foreign investment is treated as a portfolio investment under article 3 
of Decree 2080 of 2000.
If the abovementioned requirements are not met, the capital gain obtained in the sale of shares is subject to income tax or capital gains tax, under the
following rules:
• The gain or loss arising therefrom will be equivalent to the difference between the sale price and the tax basis of the shares. As a general rule, the
tax basis of shares is equal to the price paid for such shares (i.e., cost of acquisition).
• The applicable tax rate and the withholding tax rate have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
Tax Treatment by Non-Resident Who Purchase Ecopetrol’s Shares in the BVC Market and Exchange them for ADSs 
  
Dividends 
  
Payment of dividends made from Colombia to a non-resident are subject to the tax treatment described above. Therefore, payments to holders of ADSs 
are not subject to income, withholding or remittance taxes. Dividends paid to the Depositary of ADSs arising from Colombian shares are not subject to taxation, 
unless dividends are paid out of earnings that were not taxed at the corporate level, in which case they will be subject to income tax in Colombia at a 33% rate 
via withholding tax. 
  
Taxation on Capital Gains for the Sale of Shares
Assuming that the exchange of securities is treated as a sale of Ecopetrol’s shares, the seller is subject to the tax treatment described above. 
  
Therefore, capital gains obtained in the sale of shares listed on the BVC and owned by the same beneficial owner, are not subject to income tax in 
Colombia, provided that the shares sold during the taxable year do not represent more than 10% of the outstanding shares of the listed company. Pursuant to 
Article 18 of Decree 2634 of 2012, sellers of shares are not required to file an income tax return for the transfer of securities that are listed in the RNVE as long 
as the foreign investment is treated as a portfolio investment under article 3 of Decree 2080 of 2000.
If the abovementioned requirements are not met, the capital gain obtained in the sale of shares is subject to income tax or capital gains tax, under the
following rules:
• The gain or loss arising therefrom will be equivalent to the difference between the sale price and the tax basis of the shares. As a general rule, the
tax basis of shares is equal to the price paid for such shares (i.e., cost of acquisition).
• The applicable tax rate and the withholding tax rate has to be determined in a case-by-case basis.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
This summary describes the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares or ADSs, but it does
not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to a decision to hold or dispose of common shares or 
ADSs. This summary applies only to purchasers of common shares or ADSs who will hold the common shares or ADSs as capital assets and does not apply to 
special classes of holders such as dealers in securities or currencies, holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, holders of ten percent or more of 
our shares (taking into account shares held directly or through depositary arrangements), tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, holders liable for the 
alternative minimum tax, securities traders who elect to account for their investment in common shares or ADSs on a mark-to-market basis, partnerships or 
other pass-through entities, insurance companies, U.S. expatriates, and persons holding common shares or ADSs in a hedging transaction or as part of a 
straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The statements regarding U.S. tax law set forth in this summary are 
based on U.S. law as in force on the date of this annual report, and changes to such law subsequent to the date of this annual report may affect the tax 
consequences described herein (possibly with retroactive effect). This summary is also based in part on the representations of the Depositary and the assumption 
that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
125
Each holder is encouraged to consult such holder’s tax advisor concerning the overall tax consequences to it, including the consequences under laws
other than U.S. federal income tax laws, of an investment in common shares or ADSs.
In this discussion, references to a “U.S. Holder” are to a beneficial holder of a common share or an ADS (1) that is a citizen or resident of the United
States of America, (2) that is a corporation, or any other entity taxable as a corporation, organized under the laws of the United States of America, any state 
thereof or the District of Columbia, or (3) that is otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net basis with respect to the common shares or ADS.
For purposes of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we call the “Code,” holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners
of the common shares represented by such ADSs.
This discussion does not address U.S. federal estate and gift tax or the alternative minimum tax consequences of holding common shares or ADSs. In
addition, this discussion does not address the state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of holding our common shares or ADSs. 
  
Distributions on Common Shares or ADSs
A distribution to U.S. Holders made by us of cash or property with respect to common shares or ADSs generally will be treated as a dividend for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). 
A U.S. Holder of common shares or ADSs generally will be taxed on such dividend as ordinary income. Distributions in excess of our current or accumulated 
earnings and profits will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital reducing such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares or ADSs. Any 
distribution in excess of such adjusted tax basis will be treated as capital gain and will be either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the 
U.S. Holder held the common shares or ADSs for more than one year. Distributions of additional common shares or ADSs to U.S. Holders that are part of a pro 
rata distribution to all of our shareholders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We do not maintain calculations of our earnings and profits 
under U.S. federal income tax principles, and, therefore, U.S. Holders should expect that any distributions generally will be reported as dividends for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. As used below, the term “dividend” means a distribution that constitutes a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The amount of any distribution will include the amount of any Colombian tax withheld on the amount distributed, and the amount of a distribution paid
in Pesos will be measured by reference to the exchange rate for converting Pesos into U.S. dollars in effect on the date the distribution is received by the 
Depositary (or by a U.S. Holder in the case of a holder of common shares). If the Depositary (or U.S. Holder in the case of a holder of common shares) does not 
convert such Pesos into U.S. dollars on the date it receives them, it is possible that the U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency loss or gain, which would be 
ordinary loss or gain, when the Pesos are converted into U.S. dollars. Dividends paid by us will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to 
corporations under the Code.
Subject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the dividends received by an individual with respect to the ADSs will be subject to
taxation at a maximum rate of 20.0% if the dividends are “qualified dividends.” Dividends paid on the ADSs will be treated as qualified dividends if (1) the 
ADSs are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and (2) we were not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was 
paid, and are not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”). The ADSs are listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and will qualify as readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States so long as they are so listed. Based on our audited 
financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect 
to our 2012 taxable year. In addition, based on our audited financial statements and our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the 
sources and nature of our income, and relevant market and shareholder data, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the 2013 taxable year. Based on existing 
guidance, it is not clear whether dividends received with respect to the common shares will be treated as qualified dividends. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has 
announced its intention to promulgate rules pursuant to which holders of ADSs or common shares and intermediaries through whom such securities are held 
will be permitted to rely on certifications from issuers to treat dividends as qualified for tax reporting purposes. Because such procedures have not yet been 
issued, it is not clear whether we will be able to comply with them. Holders of ADSs and common shares should consult their own tax advisers regarding the 
availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in the light of the considerations discussed above and their own particular circumstances.
126
A U.S. Holder will be entitled, subject to a number of complex limitations and conditions, to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit in respect of any
Colombian income taxes withheld on dividends received on common shares or ADSs. U.S. Holders who do not elect to claim a credit for any foreign income 
taxes paid during the taxable year may instead claim a deduction in respect of such Colombian income taxes provided the U.S. Holder elects to deduct (rather 
than credit) all foreign income taxes for that year. Dividends received with respect to the common shares or ADSs will be treated as foreign source income, 
subject to various classifications and other limitations. For the purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit limitations, the dividends paid with respect our common 
shares or ADSs should generally constitute “passive category income.” The rules relating to computing foreign tax credits or deducting foreign income taxes are 
extremely complex, and U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own independent tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits with respect to any 
Colombian income taxes withheld. 
  
Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Dispositions of Common Shares or ADSs
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or ADSs in an 
amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the common shares or ADSs and the U.S. 
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the common shares or ADSs. Any gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares or ADSs have been 
held for more than one year. Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) may be eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in 
respect of long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Code.
If you are a U.S. Holder of common shares or ADSs, the initial tax basis of your common shares or ADSs will be the U.S. dollar value of the Peso-
denominated purchase price determined on the date of purchase. If the common shares or ADSs are treated as traded on an “established securities market,” a 
cash basis U.S. Holder, or, if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder, will determine the dollar value of the cost of such common shares or ADSs by translating 
the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If you convert U.S. dollars to Pesos and immediately use that currency to 
purchase common shares or ADSs, such conversion generally will not result in taxable gain or loss to you.
With respect to the sale or exchange of common shares or ADSs, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the payment received
determined on (1) the date of receipt of payment in the case of a cash basis U.S. Holder and (2) the date of disposition in the case of an accrual basis U.S. 
Holder. If the common shares or ADSs are treated as traded on an “established securities market,” a cash basis taxpayer, or, if it elects, an accrual basis 
taxpayer, will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized by translating the amount received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the 
sale.
If a Colombian income tax is withheld or otherwise imposed on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or ADSs, the amount 
realized by a U.S. Holder will include the gross amount of the proceeds of that sale or other disposition before deduction of the Colombian income tax. Capital 
gain or loss, if any, realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or ADSs generally will be treated as U.S. 
source income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Consequently, in the case of a disposition of a common share or ADS that is subject to Colombian 
income tax imposed on the gain, the U.S. Holder may not be able to benefit from the foreign tax credit for the Colombian income tax (because the income or 
loss on the disposition would be U.S. sourced), unless the U.S. Holder can apply the credit against U.S. federal income tax payable on other income from 
foreign sources. Alternatively, the U.S. Holder may take a deduction for the Colombian income tax if it does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any 
foreign income taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year.
Deposits and withdrawals of common shares in exchange for ADSs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. 
  
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
In general, dividends on common shares or ADSs, and payments of the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of common shares or 
ADSs, paid within the United States, by a U.S. payor through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries to a U.S. Holder are subject to information reporting 
and may be subject to backup withholding at a current rate of 28% unless the holder (1) establishes that it is a corporation or other exempt recipient or (2) with 
respect to backup withholding, provides an accurate taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is a U.S. person and that no loss of exemption from 
backup withholding has occurred.
127
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding tax from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit 
against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally may 
obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed its U.S. federal income tax liability by timely filing a refund claim with 
the IRS. 
  
U.S. Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders
A holder or beneficial owner of common shares or ADSs that is not a U.S. Holder for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “non-U.S. Holder”)
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on dividends received on common shares or ADSs.
A non-U.S. Holder of common shares or ADSs will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on gain realized on the sale of common 
shares or ADSs, unless, in the case of gain realized by an individual non-U.S. Holder, the non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more 
in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions are met.
Although non-U.S. Holders generally are exempt from backup withholding, a non-U.S. Holder may be required to comply with certification and
identification procedures in order to establish its exemption from information reporting and backup withholding.

ITEM 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
  
Risk Management and Financial Instruments
We are exposed to certain risks associated with the nature of our operations and the financial instruments we use. Among those risks affecting our
financial assets, liabilities and expected future cash flows are the changes in commodity prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Commodity price risk is associated with our day-to-day operations as we export and import crude oil, natural gas, and refined products. We control our 
exposure to commodity price volatility using the “cash flow at risk” methodology, which provides an estimation of the impact that price fluctuations have over 
the liquidity of the company. When necessary, we use derivative financial instruments such as options and swaps to hedge our exposure to volatility in 
commodity prices. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or profit-generating purposes.
Currency risk is associated with the fact that approximately 65% of our income is denominated in U.S. dollars and only 35% of our expenses are
denominated in U.S. dollars, whereas our income and expenses denominated in Colombian pesos are 35% and 65%, respectively. We control our currency risk 
using natural hedging when possible, by maintaining funds in U.S. dollars and Pesos to meet our expenses in its respective currency. However, we have to sell 
U.S. dollars regularly in order to cover the currency mismatches that may arise. Derivative financial instruments such as forwards, futures and swaps are usually 
used when weaker or stronger Peso/U.S. dollar-denominated obligations may affect the cash flow of the Company. In addition, the obligations derived from our 
U.S. dollar-denominated debt are naturally hedged by our funds in the same currency. This situation partially mitigates any adverse effect that currency risk may 
have over the financial statements of the Company.
128
Interest rate risk arises from our exposure to changes in interest rates, as we have floating-rate instruments in our investment portfolio and issuances of 
floating rate debt linked to DTF and IPC rates.  Thus, volatility in interest rates may affect the fair value and cash flows related to our investments and floating 
rate debt. In 2011, credit risk events emerged constantly, with financial entities being downgraded or declaring restricted default. As a result, our analysis of the 
situation in the global financial markets resulted in the decision not to hedge the interest rate risk. Nevertheless, our treasury office continuously monitors the 
performance of interest rates and its impact on the financial statements of the Company. On the other hand, the exposure to interest rate risk of our fixed income 
portfolio is controlled through its effective duration. The limits allowed for the effective duration are between +/- 25% of the portfolio’s benchmark duration. 
  
Investment Guidelines
Following Decree 1525 of 2008, our management established guidelines for our investment portfolios. In general terms, our guidelines determine that
we must invest our excess cash in fixed-income securities issued by entities rated A or higher in the long term and A1/P1/F1 or higher in the short term 
(international scale) by a recognized rating agency.  We have no limitation to invest in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or the Colombian 
government. In our Peso-portfolio, we must invest in fixed-income securities of issuers rated AAA in the long term and F1+/BRC1+ in the short term (local 
scale) by a recognized rating agency, except securities issued or guaranteed by the Colombian government.
Our investment portfolio in U.S. dollars is segmented in four tranches, each one matching our liquidity needs.  The working capital tranche is
calculated taking into account our cash flow needs for the next 60 days.  The liquidity tranche is calculated as the contingent cash flow needs over the working 
capital, taking into account the development of capital expenditures related to projects.  The asset liability tranche is built to match our off-balance sheet debt.  
The investment tranche includes the remaining amount of the total portfolio after deducting the amounts pertaining to the above mentioned tranches.
Our investment portfolio in Pesos is segmented in two tranches, each one matching our liquidity needs.  The first tranche is calculated taking into
account our cash flow needs for the next 30 days, and the second tranche is built for investment purposes.

The base scenario on which our sensitivity analysis is made corresponds to the Consolidated Statements of Financial, Economic, Social and 
Environmental Activity or Income Statement, for 2012 as presented elsewhere in this annual report.
The sensitivity of the WTI price index is the increase of one U.S. dollar per barrel of crude oil in the average WTI reference price based on a 365-day 
year for 2012. Prices assumed correspond to real prices for crude oil, natural gas and refined products for 2012, adjusted to account for the differences 
between such real prices and the WTI reference price.
The sensitivity of our results to changes in the exchange rates is the 2.67% average appreciation of the Peso against the U.S. dollar during 2012. Prices 
assumed correspond to real prices of crude oil, natural gas and refined products in 2012, proportionally adjusted to account for differences between 
actual and the monthly average exchange rate.

or issuances pursuant to a merger, exchange of securities or any other transaction or event affecting the ADSs or deposited securities, and each person 
surrendering ADSs for withdrawal of deposited securities in any manner permitted by the deposit agreement or whose ADRs are cancelled or reduced for any 
other reason, US$5.00 for each 100 ADS (or any portion thereof) issued, delivered, reduced, cancelled or surrendered, as the case may be. The Depositary may 
sell (by public or private sale) sufficient securities and property received in respect of a share distribution, rights and/or other distribution prior to such deposit to 
pay such charge.
131
The Depositary collects its fees for issuance and cancellation of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose
of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The Depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the 
amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The Depositary may collect its annual fee for Depositary services by 
deduction from cash distributions, or by directly billing investors, or by charging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The Depositary 
may generally refuse to provide services to any holder until the fees and expenses owing by such holder for those services or otherwise are paid.
The following additional charges may be incurred by ADS holders, by any party depositing or withdrawing shares or by any party surrendering ADSs 
or to whom ADSs are issued (including, without limitation, issuance pursuant to a stock dividend or stock split declared by us or an exchange of stock regarding 
the ADRs or the deposited securities or a distribution of ADSs), whichever is applicable:
a fee of US$1.50 per ADR or ADRs for transfers of certificated or direct registration ADRs;
a fee of up to US$0.02 per ADS for any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement;
a fee of US$0.05 per ADS per calendar year (or portion thereof) for services performed by the Depositary in administering our ADR program 
(which fee may be charged on a periodic basis during each calendar year and shall be assessed against holders of ADRs as of the record date or 
record dates set by the Depositary during each calendar year and shall be payable in the manner described in the next succeeding provision);
any other charge payable by any of the Depositary, any of the Depositary’s agents, including, without limitation, the custodian, or the agents of the 
Depositary’s agents in connection with the servicing of our shares or other deposited securities (which charge shall be assessed against registered 
holders of our ADRs as of the record date or dates set by the Depositary and shall be payable at the sole discretion of the Depositary by billing 
such registered holders or by deducting such charge from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions);
a fee for the distribution of securities (or the sale of securities in connection with a distribution), such fee being in an amount equal to the fee for 
the execution and delivery of ADSs which would have been charged as a result of the deposit of such securities (treating all such securities as if 
they were shares) but which securities or the net cash proceeds from the sale thereof are instead distributed by the Depositary to those holders 
entitled thereto;
stock transfer or other taxes and other governmental charges;
cable, telex and facsimile transmission and delivery charges incurred at the ADS holder’s request;
transfer or registration fees for the registration of transfer of deposited securities on any applicable register in connection with the deposit or 
withdrawal of deposited securities;
expenses of the Depositary in connection with the conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars; and

connection with the Depositary’s or its custodian’s compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
We will pay all other charges and expenses of the Depositary and any agent of the Depositary (except the custodian) pursuant to agreements from time
to time between us and the Depositary. The fees described above may be amended from time to time. 
  
Fees and Other Direct and Indirect Payments Made by the Depositary to Us
Our Depositary has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses we incur that are related to establishment and maintenance of the ADR program,
including investor relations expenses and exchange application and listing fees.  In 2012, the Depositary made direct payments and reimbursements to us in the 
amount of approximately US$446,149.84 for expenses related to investor relations expenses.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
•
  
•
•
As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of December 31, 2012, we evaluated the design and 
effectiveness of our financial disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and participation of our management, including our Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the 
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even if effective, disclosure controls and procedures 
can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.
Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this annual 
report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we 
file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, summarized and reported as and when required and is accumulated and communicated to 
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely 
decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15
(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief 
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and affected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance 
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and it includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of our assets;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and 
directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have 
a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, effective control over 
financial reporting cannot, and does not, provide absolute assurance of achieving our control objectives. Also, projection of any evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As of the year ended December 31, 2012, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the criteria established in the publication “Internal Control – Integrated Framework”, issued by the Treadway Commission’s Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations (COSO), as well as the rules prescribed by the SEC in its Final Rule “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports.”
Based on the assessment performed, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG Ltda., an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their audit report accompanying our consolidated financial statements.
133
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected or
are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. 
  
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
KPMG Ltda.’s attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting is included in their audit report accompanying our consolidated
financial statements. See our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 16D. Exemptions from the Listing Standards for Audit Committees
At the general ordinary shareholders meeting held on March 21, 2013, the Company´s shareholders approved the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda. as recommended by the Company’s Audit Committee, as the new independent registered public accounting firm to replace 
KPMG Ltda., which was appointed as described above.
During the Company’s two fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and subsequent interim periods through the date of its report, there were no
disagreements with KPMG Ltda. on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which 
disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG Ltda. would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the consolidated financial 
statements for such periods.
During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the subsequent periods through the date of its report, there
have been no reportable events (as defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v)) of Form 20-F).
We have not previously consulted with PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda. regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific
completed or contemplated transaction; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements; or (iii) a reportable event (as provided 
in 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F) during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, or any later interim period, including the interim period up to and including 
the date of its report.
We have provided KPMG Ltda. with a copy of the foregoing disclosure, and have requested that KPMG Ltda. furnish us with a letter addressed to the 
SEC stating whether or not KPMG Ltda. agrees with such disclosure, which we attach to this report as Exhibit 16.1 as required by Item 16F(a)(3) of Form 20-F.
At the general ordinary shareholders meeting held on March 24, 2011, the Company´s shareholders approved the appointment of KPMG Ltda., as 
recommended by the Company’s Audit Committee, as the new independent registered public accounting firm to replace PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda., as 
previously reported in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 as amended.
During the Company’s two fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and subsequent interim periods through July 15, 2011, there were no 
disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda. on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure , or auditing scope or 
procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda., would have caused them to make reference to such 
disagreement in their reports on the consolidated financial statements for such periods.
During the Company’s two fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the subsequent periods through July 15, 2011, there have been no
reportable events (as defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(v)) of Form 20-F).
135
We did not previously consult with KPMG Ltda. regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated
transaction; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements; or (iii) a reportable event (as provided in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 
20-F) during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, or any later interim period, including the interim period up to and including the date the relationship 
with Pricewaterhouse Coopers Ltda.. KPMG Ltda. reviewed the foregoing disclosure required by Item 16F of Form 20-F before it was filed with the SEC and 
was provided an opportunity to furnish the SEC with a letter addressed to the SEC containing any new information, clarification of the expression of our views, 
or the respects in which it does not agree with the statements made by us in response to Item 16F of Form 20-F. 
  
ITEM 16G. Corporate Governance
Pursuant to the requirements of Section 303A.11 of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual, the following is a summary of the significant differences
between our corporate governance practices and those required for U.S. companies under the NYSE listing standards.
The following discloses the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards.
NYSE Standards
Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Practices
Law No. 964/2005 establishes that (1) the board of directors of listed
companies must be comprised of a minimum of five directors and a maximum 
of ten directors and (2) at least 25% of board members must be 
independent.  Under our corporate governance guidelines, our board of 
directors must be comprised of nine directors, of which at least three must be 
independent.  As of the date of this annual report, we have six (6) independent 
directors.
Executive Sessions
A comparable rule does not exist under Colombian law.  Except for our Audit
Committee, our Board of Directors does not meet without management.
Nominating/Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee
The majority of the board of directors must be independent.  §303A.01. 
 “Controlled companies,” which would include Ecopetrol if we were a U.S. 
issuer, are exempt from this requirement.  A controlled company is one in 
which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or 
another company, rather than the public.  §303A.00.
The non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly 
scheduled executive sessions without management.  §303A.03.
A nominating/corporate governance and sustainability committee composed 
entirely of independent directors is required.  The committee must have a 
charter specifying the purpose, duties and evaluation procedures of the 
committee.  §303A.04.  “Controlled companies” are exempt from these 
requirements.  §303A.00.
Compensation Committee
A compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors is 
required, which must evaluate and approve executive officer compensation. 
 The committee must have a charter specifying the purpose, duties and 
evaluation procedures of the committee.  §303A.05.  “Controlled companies” 
are exempt from this requirement.  §303A.00.
An audit committee with a minimum of three independent directors satisfying 
the independence and other requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange 
Act and the more stringent requirements under the NYSE standards is 
required.  §303A.06, §303A.07.
Audit Committee
Colombian law does not require the establishment of a nominating and
corporate governance and sustainability committee composed entirely of 
independent directors.  Pursuant to our bylaws, both our corporate governance 
and sustainability committee, and our nomination and compensation 
committee shall be composed of at least one independent director which acts 
pursuant to a written charter.
Colombian law does not require the establishment of a compensation
committee composed entirely of independent directors.  Pursuant to our 
bylaws, our nomination and compensation committee shall be composed of at 
least one independent director which acts pursuant to a written charter.
According to Law No. 964/2005, Colombian companies that are authorized to
issue securities by the Superintendency of Finance must have an audit 
committee that satisfies the requirements of Law No. 964/2005, including its 
minimum number of members, independence criteria and audit related 
duties.  Our audit committee is composed of Joaquín Moreno Uribe, Amilcar 
Acosta Medina, Roberto Steiner Sampedro, Luis Carlos Villegas Echeverri 
and Jorge Pinzón Sánchez, all of whom are independent directors, and the 
committee meets the requirements of Law No. 964/2005 and Rule 10A 3 
under the Exchange Act.
136
Equity compensation plans and all material revisions thereto require 
shareholder approval, subject to limited exemptions.  §§303A.08 and 312.03.
Equity Compensation Plans
Under Colombian law, no similar right to vote on equity compensation plans
and material revisions thereto is given to shareholders.  We do not give our 
shareholders the right to vote on equity compensation plans and material 
revisions thereto.
Listed companies must adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. 
 §303A.09.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
Corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics is 
required, with disclosure of any waiver for directors or executive officers.  The 
code must contain compliance standards and procedures that will facilitate the 
effective operation of the code.  §303A.10.
Code of Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees
The Superintendency of Finance does recommend the adoption of corporate 
governance guidelines.  However, according to Superintendency of Finance 
Circular No. 007/2011, the adoption of corporate governance guidelines is 
voluntary.  Listed companies must annually publish a corporate governance 
survey comparing their corporate governance standards with those 
recommended by the Superintendency of Finance.  Our corporate 
governance guidelines (Code of Good Corporate Governance) are listed on 
our website at http://www.ecopetrol.com.co.
We have adopted a code of ethics which complies with applicable U.S. and
Colombian law.  Our code of ethics applies to our chief executive officer, 
chief financial officer, principal accounting officer, persons performing 
similar functions and generally to all the employees, members of the board 
of directors, suppliers, and contractors of Ecopetrol S.A. and its corporate 
group.  Our code of ethics is available on our website at 
http://www.ecopetrol.com.co.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
Ecopetrol S.A.: 
  
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ecopetrol S.A. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the 
related consolidated statements of Financial, Economic, Social and Environmental Activities, Changes in Stockholders’ Equity, and Cash Flows for the years 
then ended. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal 
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is 
responsible  for  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  and  for  its  assessment  of  the 
effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  ITEM  15  of  the  FORM  20-F  for  the  fiscal  year  ended  December  31,  2012.  Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
based on our audits. 
  
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we 
plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement  and  whether  effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement  presentation.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  Our  audits  also  included  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the 
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
  
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over 
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of 
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
  
In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred  to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position  of  the  Company  as  of 
December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted  in  Colombia,  promulgated  by  the  National  Accounting  Office  (Contaduría  General  de  la  Nación  or  CGN).  Also  in  our  opinion,  the  Company 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in COSO. 
  
Accounting principles generally accepted for Colombian Government Entities vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted 
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Information  relating  to  the  nature  and  effects  of  such  differences  is  presented  in  Note  35  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
In  our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of  financial,  economic,  social  and  environmental  activities,  of  changes  in  shareholders’
equity and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010 present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Ecopetrol S.A. 
and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles for Colombian Government Entities 
issued  by  the  Contaduría  General  de  la  Nación .  These  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is  to 
express  an  opinion  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing  standards  in 
Colombia and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates 
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
   
Accounting principles generally accepted for Colombian Government Entities vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted 
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Information  relating  to  the  nature  and  effects  of  such  differences  is  presented  in  Note  35  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements.

Ecopetrol S.A. and Subsidiaries
For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010
(1)
Economic entity and principal accounting policies and practices
  
Reporting entity 
  
ECOPETROL S.A. (hereinafter Ecopetrol or the Company) was constituted by Law 165 of 1948 and transformed through Extraordinary Decree 1760 of 
2003  (as  well  as  Decree  409  of  2006)  and  Law  1118  of  2006  into  a  state-owned  stock  company  and  then  into  a  mixed  economy  Company  of  a
commercial  nature,  at  the  national  level,  linked  to  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Energy,  for  an  indefinite  period.  Ecopetrol’s  corporate  purpose  is  the 
development, in Colombia or abroad, of commercial or industrial activities arising from or related to the exploration, production, refining, transportation, 
storage,  distribution,  and  selling  of  hydrocarbons,  their  by-products  and  associated  products,  as  well  as  subsidiary  operations,  connected  or
complementary to these activities, in accordance with applicable regulations. Ecopetrol’s principal domicile is Bogota and it may establish subsidiaries, 
branches and agencies in Colombia or abroad. 
  
Pursuant to Transformation Decree 1760 of 2003, all administration of the Colombian nation’s hydrocarbon reserves, as well as the administration of 
non-strategic assets represented by stocks and shares in companies, were split from Ecopetrol. Furthermore, Ecopetrol’s basic structure was changed and 
two entities were created: a) the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (ANH) was created to issue and develop Colombian oil policy from that point
forward (formerly the responsibility of Ecopetrol), and b) Sociedad Promotora de Energía de Colombia S.A., which received the non-strategic assets 
owned by Ecopetrol. 
  
Law 1118 of December 27, 2006 changed the legal nature of Ecopetrol and authorized the Company to issue shares to be placed on the market and 
acquired by Colombian individuals or legal entities. Once the shares corresponding to 10.1% of the authorized capital were issued and placed, at the end 
of 2007, the Company became a public-private entity of a commercial nature, at the national level, linked to the Ministry of Mines and Energy. 
  
Ecopetrol entered into a deposit agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, for the issuance of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each of the 
ADSs represents 20 of Ecopetrol’s common shares or the right to receive 20 common shares of Ecopetrol. 
  
On September 12, 2008, Ecopetrol submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register and list the Company’s 
ADSs evidenced by ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Company’s ADSs began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “EC” on 
September 18, 2008. 
  
On December 3, 2009, the Comisión Nacional Supervisora de Empresas y Valores del Perú (CONASEV) (Peruvian National Commission of Companies 
and Securities) approved the listing of Ecopetrol’s ADRs on the Lima Stock Exchange and the registration of such securities with the Public Registry of
the Securities Market. The ADRs began trading on the Lima Stock Exchange on December 4, 2009 in the Peruvian market under the symbol “EC”. 
  
On August 13, 2010, Ecopetrol began trading its ADRs on the Toronto Stock Exchange – Canada, one of the biggest in the world in the energy sector. 
Thus, Ecopetrol became the first Colombian company to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
  
Between July 27 and August 17, 2011, Ecopetrol carried out the second placement of its public share offering, authorized by Law 1118 of 2006. As a 
result of this process, 644,185,868 shares were placed at a nominal price of $3,700 per share, for a total amount of $2,383,488. The common shares were 
registered  with  the  National  Registry  of  Securities  and  Issuers  in  accordance  with  Decree  2555  of  2010.  After  this,  the  Colombian  National 
Government’s equity participation in Ecopetrol was 88.49%. 
  
On February 13, 2008, Ecopetrol S.A. announced that it had become the parent company in the Group (the « Group »), with the following subsidiaries: 
Black Gold Re Limited, Ecopetrol Oleo é Gas do Brasil Ltda., Ecopetrol del Perú S.A., and Ecopetrol America Inc. Subsequently, Andean Chemicals
Ltd., parent company of Bioenergy and an investor in Propilco S.A., which in turn is the parent company of Compounding and Masterbatching Industry 
Ltd. (Comai Ltd.), joined the Group. 
  
Similarly, in 2009, the Group was joined by: ODL Finance, which is in turn the parent company of Oleoducto de los Llanos; Hocol Petroleum Limited, 
parent company of Homcol Cayman Inc and Hocol Limited, the Colombian branch of which is Hocol S.A.; Ecopetrol Transportation Company, the 
parent company of Ecopetrol Pipelines International Ltd., Oleoducto Central S.A., Oleoducto de Colombia S.A., and finally, Ecopetrol Global Energy 
and Refinería de Cartagena S.A. 
  
On September 20, 2010, Ecopetrol S.A. announced the setting up of a Group with Oleoducto Bicentenario de Colombia S.A.S. as a subsidiary. 
  
On January 17, 2011, Ecopetrol S.A. set up a Group with Ecopetrol Capital S.L.U., Ecopetrol Capital AG and Ecopetrol Transportation Investments Ltd., 
domiciled outside of Colombia.
F-9
On February 23, 2011, Ecopetrol S.A. set up control over the following subsidiaries: Colombia Pipelines Limited, Equión Energía Limited, Santiago Oil 
Co, Santiago Oil Company and Santiago Pipelines Co. 
  
In December 2011, the Board of Directors of Andean Chemicals Ltd, approved the capitalization of a liability (capital plus interest) with Ecopetrol S.A. 
Andean  placed  615,677,799  ordinary  shares  at  a  nominal  value  of  US$1  per  share  for  this  process.  The  liability  was  originated  by  a  loan  contract 
between Andean and Ecopetrol in May 2009, to acquire the Refinería de Cartagena through Andean Ltd as an investment vehicle. 
  
At its meeting on August 13, 2012, the Board of Directors of Cenit Transporte y Logística de Hidrocarburos S.A.S. drafted and approved the Issuance 
and Placement of Shares Regulation, through which it offered to Ecopetrol S.A. the subscription of 45,582,982 common shares in the Company’s capital, 
for a total value of $2,279,149, of which $455,830 corresponds to nominal value, and a total of $1,823,319 corresponds to paid-in capital. The above 
share subscription offer was accepted by Ecopetrol S.A. on August 22, 2012.

The Contaduría General de la Nación (CGN – National Accounts Office) adopted the Public Accounting Regime (RCP) in September 2007, defining its
configuration, scope and application. Pursuant to CGN Communication No. 20079-101345 of September 28, 2007, the Colombian Government Entity
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) went into effect for Ecopetrol on January 1, 2008.
Consolidation process
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Articles 23 and 122 of Decree 2649 of 1993. The latter article stipulates 
that an economic entity that owns more than 50% of the other economic entities must present, along with its basic financial statements, the consolidated 
financial statements with their respective notes. The consolidation method used is the full consolidation method set out in External Circular Letter No. 
005 of April 6, 2000, issued by the Superintendence of Corporations, which stipulates that consolidated financial statements must be aggregated based on 
the  individual  financial  statements  of  the  parent  company  and  of  each  of  its  subsidiaries,  identifying  the  effect  of  all  of  the  operations  among  the
companies in the group on assets, liabilities, equity and results.
F-11
The group consolidation was carried out using the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, at the same cut-off point of December 
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, after they were standardized according to the Public Accounting Regime issued by the Contaduria General de la Nación
(CGN) (National Accounting Office). 
  
(a) Basis of presentation 
  
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with Colombian Government Entity GAAP standards and principles issued by the 
CGN, and other legal provisions. These principles may differ in certain respects from those established by other standards and other control authorities 
and CGN opinions on specific matters prevail over other regulations. 
  
The accrual method was applied for the accounting recognition of the consolidated statement of financial, economic, social and environmental activity. 
  
A structure was established in accordance with the rules for the inspection, supervision, and/or control of Ecopetrol and the companies that apply the 
Regime of Public Accounting (RCP) to record operations at the level of source documents, or for standardization purposes, to define the accounting 
treatment  of  operations  not  covered  by  the  CGN.  The  structure  involves:  i)  principal  and  permanent  inspection,  supervision,  and  control: 
Superintendence of Domiciliary Public Services; ii) residual control: Superintendence of Corporations; and iii) concurrent control: Superintendence of 
Finance, of the activities of the Company in its capacity as issuer in the stock market. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are applied 
when accounting guidance under Colombian Government Entity GAAP does not address specific accounting issues applicable to the Company, while 
accounting standards under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) are applied for accounting issues related to crude 
oil and natural gas activities. 
  
The basic consolidated financial statements defined by the CGN are: the Balance Sheet, the Financial, Economic, Social and Environmental Activities 
Statement, the Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows. The notes to the basic consolidated financial statements
are an integral part of them. 
  
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the businesses in which the Company holds a direct or indirect share of over 50% of 
capital, or over which it has significant influence without being a majority shareholder. All inter-company transactions among consolidated companies 
have been eliminated. The attached consolidated financial statements consolidate the assets, liabilities, equity and results of the subsidiaries. 
  
(b) Materiality criterion
  
An economic fact is material when, due to its nature, amount and surrounding circumstances, knowledge or ignorance of it can significantly alter the 
economic decisions of users of financial information. 
  
As set forth by the RCP, the information disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and financial accounting reports must cover the main aspects
of the public accounting entity in a way that must be significantly close to the truth, so that it is relevant and reliable for decision-making purposes or the 
evaluations required to meet accounting information objectives. Materiality depends on the nature of the facts or the magnitude of the amounts revealed 
or not revealed. 
  
The consolidated financial statements include specific headings in accordance with legal requirements or for elements representing 5% or more of total 
assets, current assets, total liabilities, current liabilities, working capital, equity and income, as appropriate. In addition, lower amounts are shown when 
they are deemed to contribute to a better interpretation of financial information. 
  
(c) Use of estimates
  
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that the management of the companies in the Group make estimates and assumptions that 
could affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, results of activities and the attached notes. These estimates are carried out based on technical 
criteria, judgment and tenets pursuant to the regulations and legal provisions in effect. Actual results may differ from such estimates. 
  
(d) Foreign currency transactions
  
Foreign currency transactions are recognized in accordance with applicable regulations and recorded at the appropriate exchange rates on the transaction 
date. Balances denominated in foreign currency are reflected in Colombian pesos at the official exchange rates at the end of each year. 
  
The exchange difference resulting from asset adjustment is recorded in results, and the difference resulting from liabilities is recorded against the related 
asset until it is ready for use or sale, at which time the adjustment is recorded in the results.
F-12
In accordance with Decree 4318 of December 26, 2007 issued by the Ministerio de Comercio, Industria y Turismo (Ministry of Trade, Industry and 
Tourism), the exchange difference generated by equity investments in foreign subsidiaries is recorded as an increase or decrease in equity value, and 
when the investment is actually made this value affects the results for the year. 
  
While performing their oil industry activities, the Company and its subsidiaries can freely deal in foreign currencies, provided that they comply with the 
provisions of Colombia’s exchange rate regime. 
  
The conversion of financial statements of subsidiaries that use currencies other than the Colombian peso involved changing the currency first to U.S. 
dollars and then to Colombian pesos. The official exchange rate (ER) for the end of the period was used to convert asset and liability balances, monthly 
average ERs were used to convert result figures, and historical rates were used to convert capital figures. 
  
(e) Joint venture contracts 
  
Joint venture contracts are entered into between Ecopetrol or the companies in the Group and third parties in order to share the risk, secure capital, 
maximize operating efficiency and optimize the recovery of reserves. In these joint ventures, one party is designated as the operator and each party takes 
its share of the hydrocarbons (crude oil or gas) produced according to its agreed participation. When Ecopetrol or one of the companies in the Group 
participates as a non-operator partner, it records the assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses based on information reported by the operators. When 
Ecopetrol or one of the companies in the Group is the direct operator of the joint venture contract, it records 100% of the assets, liabilities, revenues, 
costs  and  expenses,  recognizing,  on  a  monthly  basis,  the  distribution  according  to  the  participation  interests  of  each  partner  in  the  line  items 
corresponding to: assets, liabilities, expenses, costs and revenues for the associate. 
  
(f) Cash equivalents
  
Cash equivalents are represented by negotiable investments with maturity dates that fall within ninety (90) days of their acquisition, and are recorded as 
cash management investments. 
  
Cash from joint operations in which the Company is the operating partner corresponds to advances from partners (including the companies in the Group) 
according to their contractually agreed participation percentages, and funds are managed in a joint operation exclusive-use bank account. 
  
(g) Derivative financial instruments
  
The  Company  enters  into  hedging  agreements  to  hedge  against  fluctuations  in  crude-oil  prices,  product  prices  and  exchange  rates.  The  difference 
between traded value and market value, generated by hedging operations, is recognized as financial income or expense in the statement of financial, 
economic, social and environmental activities. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
  
(h) Investments
  
The investments are classified as: i) liquidity management investments; ii) investments for policy purposes; and iii) equity investments.
Liquidity management investments correspond to resources invested in debt and participative securities with the objective of obtaining profits
through  short-term  price  fluctuations.  Their  initial  recording  corresponds  to  their  historical  cost  and  they  are  updated  based  on  valuation
methods issued by the Superintendence of Finance of Colombia.
  
Investments for policy purposes are made up of national or foreign debt securities acquired in compliance with the macroeconomic or internal
policies of the Group, which include investments held through their maturity date and those available for sale, which are kept for at least one
(1) year, as of the first day on which they were classified for the first time, or when they were reclassified.
  
Investments  held  to  maturity  are  updated  based  on  the  internal  rate  of  return  (IRR)  as  set  out  in  the  methodology  adopted  by  the
Superintendence of Finance; the investments for the purpose of macroeconomic policy and those available for sale must be updated based on
the methodology adopted by the Superintendence of Finance for tradable investments. 
  
Equity investments are classified as being in controlled and uncontrolled entities. Equity investments in controlled entities are recognized at
their acquisition cost whenever it is lower than the intrinsic value; otherwise, they are recognized at the intrinsic value, and the difference
between the purchase price and the intrinsic value corresponds to goodwill. Their values are updated using the equity method, as established in
CGN Resolution 145 of 2008.
Investments in associates in which the Company exerts significant influence are recorded using the equity method. 
  
Significant influence is defined as the power the entity has, whether or not the percentage of ownership is 50% or lower, to participate in setting and 
directing the financial and operational policies of another entity for the purpose of obtaining profits from that entity.

Significant influence may be present in one or more of the following ways:
Representation on the Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the associate;
  
Participation in policy-making;
Significant transactions between the investor and the associate;
Secondment of officers; or
Supplying essential technical information.

For subsidiaries abroad, the equity method must apply in Colombian legal currency after the conversion of financial statements in foreign currency. 
  
Equity investments in uncontrolled entities include shares with a low or minimum market, or shares not listed on an exchange. They do not enable any 
type of control or significant influence and are recognized at historical cost. Their change in value arises from periodically comparing the cost of the 
investment to its intrinsic value or its value on the stock market. 
  
Investments made in foreign currency are recognized by applying the ER on the date of the transaction. The value must be re-expressed periodically 
based on the ER, whenever the adjustment method does not take it into account. 
  
(i) Accounts and notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts
  
Accounts and notes receivable are stated at their original amount or at the value accepted by the debtor, subject to periodic updating according to legal
provisions in effect, or according to agreed upon contract terms. 
  
The allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  is reviewed  and updated  periodically  based on  the  age  of  the  balances  and  the  recovery analysis of  individual 
accounts. The Group carries out the necessary administrative and legal steps to recover overdue accounts receivable and to collect interest from clients 
who do not comply with payment policies. 
  
Accounts and notes receivable are only written off against the allowances when there is reasonable legal or material certainty of the total or partial loss of 
the incorporated or represented right. 
  
(j)
  
The inventories include assets extracted, in production process, transformed and acquired for any reason, to be sold, intended for transformation and 
consumed in the production process, or as part of services delivered. The perpetual inventory system is used. 
  
Inventories are stated at historical cost or at purchase cost, including direct and indirect charges incurred to prepare the inventory for sale or production. 
  
The value of inventories is measured using the weighted average method, taking into account the following parameters:
Inventories
Inventories of crude oil and own production, taking into account production cost;
Crude oil purchases, at acquisition costs, including transportation and delivery costs incurred;
Inventory of finished products, at total production costs;
Work in progress inventory, at production costs; and
Raw materials inventory, at weighted average cost.
Raw materials and supplies in joint ventures are controlled by the operator and reported in a joint account at the acquisition cost (recorded in the original 
currency at average costs). Inventory consumption is charged to the joint venture as a cost, expense or investment, as appropriate. 
  
Furthermore, inventories are valued at market cost or average cost, whichever is lower, and in-transit inventories are valued at actual cost incurred. At 
the end of the fiscal year allowances are calculated to take into account impairment, obsolescence, excess, slow movement or loss of market value.

(k) Property, plant and equipment depreciation
  
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost adjusted for inflation up to 2001. This cost includes financial expenses and the exchange 
differences for acquisition in foreign currency up until commissioning of the asset, as well as financial revenues from the unused portion of financial 
obligations acquired to finance investment projects. When an asset is sold or retired, the adjusted cost and accumulated depreciation are written off and 
any gain or loss is recorded in the year’s results. 
  
Depreciation is calculated on the total acquisition cost using the straight-line method, based on the assets’ useful life, which are reviewed periodically.
Annual depreciation rates are:
Disbursements for maintenance and repairs are recorded as expenses. Significant disbursements that improve efficiency of an asset or extend its useful 
life are capitalized as an increase in the value of that asset. 
  
The  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is  subject  to  periodic  revaluation  by  comparing  the  net  book  value  with  the  value  determined  through 
technical appraisals. When the value of an asset’s technical appraisal is greater than its net book cost, the difference is recorded as an asset valuation and
credited to the surplus account for equity valuation; otherwise, it is recorded as an allowance for devaluations and charged to results. 
  
Upon termination of an association contract, the Group receives, at no cost, the property, plant and equipment, materials and amortizable oil investments 
belonging to the associate. This transaction does not affect the Group’s results. 
  
(l) Natural and environmental resources
  
The Group follows the successful-efforts method of accounting for investments in exploration and production or development. Expenses for geological
and geophysical studies are recorded as they are incurred. Acquisition and exploration costs are capitalized until it is determined whether the exploration 
drilling was successful or not. If it is not successful, all of the costs incurred are charged to expenses. When a project is approved for development, the 
accumulated value of the acquisition and exploration costs are classified in the oil investment account. Costs capitalized also include asset retirement 
costs. Asset and liability balances related to asset retirement costs are updated every six months. Production and support equipment is accounted under 
the historical cost and is included in property, plant and equipment subject to depreciation. 
  
Natural  and  environmental  resources  investments  are  amortized  by  applying  the  amortization  factor  to  technical  units  of  production  and  proven 
developed  reserves  per  field,  royalty-free,  estimated  as  of  December 31  of  the  immediately  preceding  year.  The  amortization  charged  to  results  is 
adjusted at the end of December, recalculating the DD&A (Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization) as of January 1 of the current year, based on the 
reserve study updated at the end of the current year. 
  
In the same way that it receives property, plant and equipment upon termination of an association contract, Ecopetrol receives, at no cost, the associate’s 
amortizable oil investments. 
  
Ecopetrol has established a corporate process for reserves led by the Reserves Directorate, which reports directly to the Vice President of Corporate 
Finance.  The  reserves  are  audited  by  internationally  recognized  external  consultants  and  approved  by  the  Company’s  Reserves  Committee.  Proven 
reserves consist of the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas demonstrated with reasonable certainty by geological and engineering data to be 
recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions, that is, at the prices and costs that apply at the date of 
the estimate. 
  
Since Ecopetrol became an issuer on the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC – Colombia Stock Exchange) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
the Group has applied the methodology approved by the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) for estimating reserves. Under this methodology, the 
reference price is the arithmetic average of the BRENT price for crude over the previous twelve (12) months. 
  
Estimating hydrocarbon reserves is fraught with the various uncertainties inherent to determining proven reserves, recovery and production rates, the 
timeliness of investments to develop deposits and the maturity of fields. 
  
We capitalize of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the 
Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting 
these criteria are charged as expense. 
  
(m) Deferred charges
  
Deferred  charges  include:  i)  deferred  income  tax  resulting  from  the  temporary  differences  between  the  basis  for  determining  commercial  gains  and 
taxable net income at the end of each period; ii) the net equity tax, which is amortized up to 2014; and iii) investments made to develop cooperation 
contracts that are amortized based on technical units of production.
F-15
(n) Other assets
  
Other  assets  include  goodwill,  which  corresponds  to  the  difference  between  the  purchase  value  of  equity  investments  in  controlled  or  joint-control 
entities, and their intrinsic value, which reflects the economic benefits expected to be achieved from the investment, created by good name, specialized 
personnel, preferential credit reputation, prestige due to sale of better products and services, favourable location and the expectations of new businesses, 
among other things. 
  
Goodwill is amortized using methods of recognized technical value over the term for expected recovery of the investment, which is 10 to 18 years. At the 
close of each accounting period, the Group must evaluate goodwill to determine whether the conditions for the generation of future economic benefits 
still exist; otherwise, the asset must be retired. If the book value of the equity investment plus the book value of goodwill, which includes its historical 
cost added to all price adjustments and amortizations, is greater than the market value, the asset shall, as a result of such difference, be retired in the 
related year, with charge to results, and the reasons for said decision shall be disclosed. 
  
Intangible assets like software, licenses and patents are recognized at acquisition, development or production cost. Intangible assets are amortized using 
the straight-line method over the periods during which the benefits arising from the incurred costs and expenses are expected to occur, or during the term
of the legal or contractual coverage of the granted rights. 
  
(o) Valuations
Investments
a.
b.
Valuations correspond to the differences between the net book value of the investments and their intrinsic value or quoted price on the stock exchange.
Property, plant and equipment
Valuations and the valuation surplus of property, plant and equipment correspond to the difference between the net book cost and the market value for 
real estate or the current use value (CUV) for plant and equipment, determined by specialists registered with the Colombian Real Estate Association or 
by suitable technical personnel, as appropriate. 
  
The methodology used for plant and equipment appraisal is the current use value (CUV) for running businesses, for the economic valuation of assets, 
taking into account facilities’ current conditions and their useful life in terms of production capability and ability to generate income. It is not mandatory
to adjust the value of moveable property when its historical value, taken individually, is lower than 35 current monthly legal minimum wages, or of 
property, plant and equipment located in high risk zones. 
  
(p) Financial obligations
  
Public credit operations pertain to any  actions  undertaken or  contracts entered into, in compliance with legal regulations governing public credit,  to 
supply the Company with resources, goods and services under specific payment terms such as loans, issue and placement of bonds and public credit 
securities, and suppliers’ credit. 
  
With respect to loans, public credit operations must be recorded for the actual disbursed amount, while bonds and securities placed are recorded at their 
nominal value. Placement costs are carried directly to expenses. 
  
(q) Income tax
  
Current tax expenses are calculated based on taxable income. 
  
The effect of temporary differences leading to the payment of a lower or higher income tax in the current year is recorded as a deferred tax asset or 
liability, as appropriate, provided that there is a reasonable expectation that such differences will be reversed. 
  
(r) Labor and pension obligations
  
The main plan covers salary and benefits for Ecopetrol S.A. staff, and is governed by the Collective Labor Agreement 01 of 1977, and by the Substantive 
Labor Code. In addition to legally mandated benefits, employees are entitled to agreed upon additional benefits linked to place of work, type of work, 
length of service, and basic salary. Annual interest of 12% is recognized on accumulated severance amounts for each employee, and the payment of 
indemnities  is  provided  for  when  special  circumstances  arise  that  result  in  the  non-voluntary  termination  of  the  contract,  without  just  cause,  and  in 
periods other than the probationary period. 
   
The  actuarial  calculation  includes  active  employees,  employees  with  indefinite  term  contracts,  pensioners  and  heirs,  for  pension,  health  care  and 
education plans; it also includes pension bonds for temporary employees, active employees and voluntary retirements. Health and education obligations 
are not part of pension liabilities, they are part of benefit obligations.
F-16
All social benefits of employees who joined the Company before 1990 are the responsibility of Ecopetrol, without the involvement of any social security 
entity  or  institution.  The  cost  of  health  services  for  the  employee  and  his/her  relatives  registered  with  the  Company  is  determined  by  means  of  the 
morbidity table, based on facts occurring during 2011. 
  
Similarly,  Ecopetrol  calculates  educational  allowances  according  to  experience,  based  on  the  annual  average  cost  of  each  business,  subdivided  in 
accordance with the type of studies: pre-school, elementary, high school and university. 
  
For employees who joined the Company subsequent to the entry into effect of Law 50 of 1990, the Company makes periodic contributions for severance, 
pensions  and  occupational  injuries  to  the  funds  created  for  these  respective  obligations.  Similarly,  Law  797  of  January 29,  2003  determined  that 
Ecopetrol employees who joined the Company as of that date would be subject to the provisions of the General Pension Regime. 
  
Pursuant to Legislative Act 01 of 2005, enacted by the Colombian Congress, the pension plans excluded from the General Social Security System in 
Colombia expired on July 31, 2010. In accordance with the provisions therein, the Ministry of Social Protection’s judicial pronouncement on the matter
and the analysis conducted by Ecopetrol’s labor advisers, it was concluded that those workers who had met the age and continuous or discontinuous
service  time  requirements  of  the  law,  the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  in  effect  and/or  Agreement  01  of  1977,  prior  to  August  1,  2010,  had 
consolidated their right to their pension. It was, however, mandatory for other workers, who were not covered, to join the General Pension System. The 
pension  administrator  chosen  by  the  worker  (Colpensiones,  Private  Pension  Fund,  or  whichever  applies)  would  be  responsible  for  recognizing  and 
paying the respective pension. 
  
As set out in Decree 941 of 2002, upon approval of the actuarial calculation by the Ministry of Finance in October 2008, and upon approval of the 
mechanism by the Ministry of Social Protection through the Administration Act of December 29, 2008, the Company partially switched over the value 
corresponding to monthly pension payments from its pension liabilities, transferring said liabilities and their underlying amounts to stand-alone pension 
equities (PAP). The funds transferred and returns on those funds cannot be redirected nor be returned to the Company until all of the pension obligations 
have been fulfilled. 
  
The transferred liability corresponds only to pension allowances and pension bonds. The portion relating to health care and education services remains 
within Ecopetrol’s labor liabilities. 
  
At the end of each period, Ecopetrol must check the reported value of trust funds against the updated pension liability value as determined by the latest 
actuarial calculation. In the event that equity is insufficient to cover 100% of the liability, the Company must create an allowance for the difference, 
which must be funded should the contingency materialize. Ecopetrol remains materially responsible for the payment of pension liabilities. 
  
Through  Resolution  1555  of  July  30,  2010,  the  Superintendence  of  Finance  replaced  the  mortality  tables  used  to  prepare  actuarial  calculations  and 
stipulated  that  the  effects  of  the  change  could  be  recognized  gradually.  Subsequently,  Decree  4565  of  December  7,  2010  modified  the  accounting 
standards for amortization of the actuarial calculation in effect up to that date. Pursuant to the new decree, the companies that had amortized 100% of 
their  actuarial  calculation at December  31,  2009  could gradually  amortize  the  increase in  the actuarial calculation  for 2010  using the  new mortality 
tables, up to 2029. 
  
Given the above, in 2010 Ecopetrol modified its accounting policy for amortization of the actuarial calculation of monthly pension payments, pension 
quotas and bonds (transferred liabilities) and health bonds, and adopted a five-year term starting in 2010 to amortize the increase in the 2010 actuarial
calculation. Up until 2009, the yearly increase in the actuarial calculation was recorded as expenses for the period, as the actuarial calculation was 100% 
amortized. 
  
Resolution  717  of  December  2012  amended  the  Manual  de  Procedimiento  del  Régimen  de  Contabilidad  Pública  (Regime  of  Public  Accounting 
Procedure Manual) with regard to the Accounting Procedure for recognizing and disclosing pension liability, the underlying financial reserve, and related 
expenses, at items 5 and 44. With regard to item 5, the indications in the previous paragraph lead to the conclusion that this item has no impact on the 
Company’s activities within its amortization plan. 
  
With  regard  to  item  44,  its  only  impact  is  to  disclose  the  fact  that  the  Reserve  Funds  are  common  funds  that  are  also  under  the  administration  of 
Colpensiones. There are no further implications for Ecopetrol. 
  
(s) Advances received from Ecogas to cover BOMT (Build, Operate, Maintain and Transfer) obligations 
  
Pursuant to the sale of Ecogas by the Colombian Nation, and following specific instructions from CGN, the net present value of the future payment 
scheme in connection with Ecopetrol’s debt toward BOMT contractors was recognized as deferred income. These liabilities are due in 2017, the year
when the contract obligations will be fulfilled. 
  
(t) Hydrocarbon purchases
  
Ecopetrol purchases hydrocarbons that the ANH receives from all production in Colombia, at prices established according to section four of Law 756 of 
2002 and Resolution 18-1709 of 2003 of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, taking into account international reference prices.
F-17
Hydrocarbons are also purchased from partners and other producers in Colombia and abroad to meet the Group’s needs and operating plans. 
  
(u) Revenue recognition
  
Revenue from crude oil and natural gas sales is recognized at the time of transfer of title to the buyer, including risks and benefits. In the case of refined 
and petrochemical products, revenue is recognized when products are shipped by the refinery and subsequently adjusted in accordance with the volumes 
actually delivered. 
  
Revenue from transportation services is recognized when products are transported and delivered to the buyer in accordance with sale terms. In other 
cases, revenue is recognized at the time it is earned and a true, probable and quantifiable right to demand its payment arises. 
  
Under current regulations, Ecopetrol S.A. and Sociedad Refinería de Cartagena S.A. (Reficar) sell regular gasoline and diesel at a regulated price, and
the National Government recognizes for these businesses the amount of the subsidy on regular gasoline and diesel granted to local consumers, which is 
generated by adding the difference, for every day of the month, between the producer’s regulated revenues and the daily price equivalent to the U.S. Gulf 
Coast reference price, calculated according to origin and multiplied by the volumes sold daily. 
  
Resolution 182439 and Decree 4839 of December 2008 establish the procedure for recognizing subsidies in the event they are negative (negative value 
between parity and regulated prices). 
  
In March 2010, the Ministry of Mines and Energy issued Resolution No. 180522, which revoked provisions that were contrary to Resolutions 181496 of 
September 2008, 182439 of December 30, 2008, and 180219 of February 13, 2009 and modified the formula for calculating the international reference 
prices for gasoline and diesel. 
  
In 2012, Resolution 91658 was issued, amending Resolution 180522 with regard to the subsidy procedure for refiners and importers of regular gasoline 
and diesel. 
  
(v) Cost of sales and expenses
  
Costs are recognized at their historic value both for goods purchased for sale and for the accumulated production costs of goods produced and services 
rendered. Costs are disclosed according to the operation generating them. 
  
Expenses correspond to the amounts required for the development of ordinary activities and include those related with activities caused by extraordinary 
events. Expenses are disclosed in accordance with their nature and the occurrence of extraordinary events. 
  
Costs and expenses are recognized upon receipt of goods or services or when there is certainty that the economic event will occur. Fuel shortages and 
losses due to theft and explosions are recorded as non-operating expenses. 
  
(w) Abandonment of fields
  
The Group recognizes estimated liability for future environmental obligations, and its corresponding entry is a higher value for natural resource and 
environmental assets. The estimate includes the cost of plugging and abandoning wells, dismantling facilities and the environmental recovery of areas 
and wells. Amortization is recorded as production costs, using the technical-units-of-production method, based on remaining proved developed reserves. 
Changes resulting from new estimates of liability for abandonment and environmental restoration are accounted for under the corresponding asset. 
  
Depending  on  the  scope  of  certain  association  contracts,  field  abandonment  costs  are  taken  on  by  partners  according  to  the  same  participation 
percentages set out in each contract. Ecopetrol has not allocated funds to cover these obligations, with the exception of the Casanare, Orocue, Garcero, 
Estero, Corocora, Monas, Guajira, Tisquirama, Cravo Norte association contracts and the Caño Limón Coveñas pipeline. However, as activities linked to
field abandonment take place, they will be covered by the Group. 
  
(x) Accounting for contingencies
  
On the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, conditions might exist that could result in losses for the Company that will only be 
known if specific future circumstances arise. The nature, probability of such situations, as well as the amounts involved are evaluated by Management, 
the Vice President of Legal Affairs, and legal consultants, so that decisions can be made regarding changes to amounts provisioned and/or disclosed. 
This analysis includes current legal suits against the Companies of the Group. 
  
The methodology used to assess legal proceedings and any contingent obligations is based on the Nation’s credit system used by the Ministry of the 
Interior and Justice.
F-18
A provision is recorded for legal proceedings when there is a conviction at trial court or when the risk assessment outcome is “likely to lose.” 
  
(y) Memorandum accounts
  
Creditor and debtor memorandum accounts represent the estimated value of facts or circumstances that could affect the Group’s financial, economic, 
social and environmental situation. They also disclose the value of the goods, rights and obligations that require control, and also include differences 
between accounting information and the information used for tax purposes. 
  
(z) Net earnings per share
  
Net earnings per share are calculated based on net earnings for the year, divided by the weighted average of subscribed shares in circulation. 
  
The Company does not have share-based employee incentive plans. 
  
(aa) Transition from Colombian Government Entity GAAP (RCP) to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
  
In accordance with Law 1314 of 2009 and Regulatory Decrees 1706 and 2784 of 2012, the Group must begin the transition toward convergence of the 
accounting and financial information standards applied in Colombia with IFRS. For this purpose, the Consejo Técnico de la Contaduría Pública (Public 
Accounting Technical Council) has placed companies in groups; the Company belongs to Group 1, with a transition period beginning in January 1, 2014, 
and with the first consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards to be issued in 2015. 
  
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency
  
Transactions and balances in foreign currency are converted at the representative market exchange rate certified by the Superintendence of Finance of 
Colombia. 
  
As  at  December  31,  2012  and  2011,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Ecopetrol  included  the  following  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in 
foreign currency (converted to Colombian pesos at the closing exchange rates of $1,768.23 and $1,942.70 per US$1, respectively).

Restrictions on long-term investments – variable income:  
  
The following developments can be reported for the Invercolsa S.A. trial as at January 10, 2013: The Supreme Court of Justice is deciding over the 
cassation appeals put forth by AFIB S.A. and Fernando Londoño Hoyos against the sentence issued by the 28th Civil Circuit Court on February 8, 2007,
(sentence that was confirmed by the Superior Court of the Judicial District of Bogota – Civil Chamber, on January 11, 2011). On October 22, 2012, the 
notification for the appellant AFIB S.A. to support the corresponding recourse came due, and was submitted in a timely manner, and the notification 
period began so that appellant Fernando Londoño Hoyos could support his recourse, which was also done within the prescribed period. Therefore, on
December 5, 2012, the Court Registrar indicated that, upon notification to the appellants, the corresponding claims were made on time and are part of the 
record, the report of which was dispatched on the same day. 
  
It should be noted that the appeal sentence of January 11, 2011 ordered: i) that the purchase of 145 million shares of Invercolsa by Fernando Londoño 
Hoyos be cancelled; ii) that the cancellation of said transaction be recorded in the shareholders’ book, including the pledge in favor of the Pacífico 
Colombia  y  Panamá  banks,  as  well  as  the  payment  in  kind  of  the  Arrendadora  Financiera  Internacional  Bolivariana  S.A.  shares;  iii)  that  Fernando
Londoño  Hoyos  and  AFIB  return  the  Invercolsa  dividends  to  Ecopetrol,  along  with  the  new  shares  received  as  profit  and/or  revaluations;  iv)  that
Fernando Londoño Hoyos did not acquire or possess in good faith the 145 million Invercolsa shares; and v) that Invercolsa adjust its operation and the
Assembly to the declarations made in the sentence. If ruled in favor of Ecopetrol, the Company would be the owner of the aforementioned number of 
shares of Invercolsa and the normal rights that come with it: voice, vote and dividends. 
  
The economic activity for the entities in which the Group has investments are as follows:

The deferred tax asset is calculated based on the value of accounting provisions only deductible for tax purposes, at the time of their utilization, and the 
value of asset inflation adjustments originated between 2004 and 2006. The deferred tax credit is the result of: a) the value of the differences in the policy 
for amortizing oil investments, which are amortized for accounting purposes using the technical units of production, but amortized for tax purposes using 
the straight-line method; b) the difference in the valuation of fixed yield investments, which are valuated using the market value method for accounting
purposes but valuated using the straight-line method for tax purposes; and c) the difference in the amortized value of goodwill which amortization is
accelerated for tax purposes.
Income tax returns can be reviewed by the tax authorities for up to two years following filing. To date, for Ecopetrol S.A. the tax return for 2010 is open 
for review. 
  
Currently there are differences with the National Customs and Tax Directorate – DIAN with regard to the calculation and payment of the first income tax
installment for 2004. It is the DIAN’s view that the value of the surtax for said year should have been included in the basis for the calculation. Having 
that the total amount of the income tax was paid. In practice, the amount in question relates to the impact on interests from the time the first installment 
and the total amount was paid. The result of this process will not affect the Company’s cash flow because in a related matter the DIAN compensated for 
the amounts in question directly from balances paid in excess by the Company originated in withholding taxes.

Transfer prices 
  
As of 2004, income tax payers who had engaged in transactions with economic associates or related parties abroad, and/or with residents of countries 
considered to be tax havens, are under the obligation of determining, for income and additional tax purposes, their regular and extraordinary income, 
costs and deductions, and assets and liabilities, taking into account the denominated market prices and profit margins for these operations. Based on the 
opinion  of  the  Company’s  external  consultants,  no  significant  changes  are  expected  for  the  2012  tax  year  related  to  fulfilling  the  principle  of  full
jurisdiction set out in section 260-1 of the Taxation Act, and there are no foreseen adjustments to the determination of income tax expenses for said year. 
  
Equity tax 
  
Pursuant to Law 1370 of 2009, the value of equity tax payable was to be registered just once, on January 1, 2011, to be paid in eight equal installments 
during 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, by deadlines established by the National Government. 
  
Based on the above and in accordance with accounting management decrees, Ecopetrol recognized the value of equity tax payable and the corresponding 
charge  to  results  for  the  proportional  value  corresponding  to  2011  and  2012.  The  outstanding  balance  payable  was  registered  as  a  deferred  charge 
amortizable in subsequent years. 
  
Tax reform 
  
The Congress of the Republic adopted Law 1607 of December 26, 2012, which introduces significant reforms to the Colombian tax system, in particular:
The income tax rate was reduced from 33% to 25% starting in 2013, and the Equality Income Tax (impuesto de renta para la equidad -
CREE), was created with a rate of 9% from 2013 to 2015 and 8% starting in 2016; there are some differences between the treatment used to
determine this tax and the one used to determine ordinary income tax.
•
Those who pay the Equality Income Tax do not have to pay the SENA and ICBF contributions for employees who earn less than 10 minimum
monthly wages; this exemption will have an extensive effect on contributions to the health plan starting in January 1, 2014.
The concept of permanent establishment was defined, and is understood as fixed premises through which a foreign Company does business in
Colombia.
There  is  a  change  in  the  way  that  taxable  and  non-taxable  profits  are  calculated  for  companies  that  distribute  profits  to  partners  or 
shareholders.
•
•
•
New rules on the transfer price regime have been introduced. Among other things, these rules extend the regime’s scope of application to transactions with 
economic associates located in duty-free zones, and to some taxpayer transactions with foreign entities linked to a permanent establishment in Colombia and 
abroad.

The actuarial calculations for health and education for Ecopetrol S.A. were prepared by applying the mortality tables updated in 2010 and
using a technical interest rate of 4.8%. The value of future health and education payments was estimated by applying an increase of 4.755%,
which  corresponds  to  the  average  inflation  rate  registered  by  the  DANE  during  the  last  three  years,  to  the  year  of  calculation,  plus  an
additional 1.5%, taking into account the Company’s real growth. As a result of the 2010 change in the accounting principle for amortization,
as at December 31, 2012, the portion to be amortized is 11%, which is equivalent to $454,973.

Reserves evaluated as at December 31, 2012 based on the volumes in the audited reserves study and applying the average price set by SEC-
approved regulations.
On  March  7,  2007,  Decree  727,  which  replaced  Decree  2625  of  2000,  was  issued  featuring  the  regulations  for  valuating  reserves  and
accounting for the Nation’s hydrocarbon reserves in the Company’s financial statements. The decree also establishes that the value of the
hydrocarbon exploration or production rights it owns must be recorded. Said value is recorded under memorandum accounts, in accordance
with  the  opinion  provided  by  the  National  Accounts  Office  (CGN);  however,  the  memorandum  accounts  are  not  part  of  the  Company’s 
balance sheet.
The balance corresponds mainly to: (i) the balance of tax memorandum accounts in the amount of $22,590,844, which reflect the differences
between  the  values  of  both  equity  and  result  accounts,  taken  from  the  2011  tax  return,  and  the  accounting  balances.  The  differences  are
derived from concepts such as valuations, allowances that are not accepted for tax purposes, the difference in the amortization method for oil
investments, which is done using the units of production method for accounting purposes, and using the straight-line method for tax purposes, 
and the effect of the adjustment for inflation, (ii) securities in custody in the amount of $2,253,560, and (iii) other contingent rights, mainly for
recognition of the right linked to high prices for the Quifa contract in the amount of $262,166.
Reflects the contingent right (debtor account) on resources put in the autonomous pension trust, to pay transferred pension liabilities, in order
to control the existence of liquid resources in the stand-alone equity fund. The value transferred on December 31, 2012, which is $11,866,064 
($10,092,528 on the date of transfer, December 31, 2008), corresponds to pension liability for monthly pension payments, shares and pension
bonds; the amounts tied to health and education are within Ecopetrol’s pension liability. The transferred resources, and their yield, cannot
change destination or be returned to the Company until all pension obligations have been fulfilled.

Ship or pay contracts 
  
Ecopetrol S.A. and ODL Finance S.A. have signed the following ship or pay contracts: (i) the first supports the five-year debt (Financial Tariff) with 
Grupo Aval, which is collected in trust, from which the debt amortization payments are made. This contract was replaced by a new one, concluded in 
May 2010, for a seven-year term, to reflect the new terms agreed to with Grupo Aval, and (ii) the second contract backs securitization (autonomous trust 
securities) for a seven-year term. The securities are administrated from their date of issuance by an autonomous trust structured for that purpose, to which
have been ceded the rights for invoicing, collecting and paying the securities holders. 
  
Under the first ship or pay contract, ODL Finance S.A. committed to transporting 75,000 barrels of crude a day during the two-year grace period for the 
facility, and 90,000 barrels of crude a day during the subsequent five years. Under the second contract, ODL Finance S.A. committed to transporting 
19,500 barrels of crude during the first phase of the construction period (which began operations in September 2009) and 39,000 barrels of crude a day 
from the beginning of the second phase, which took place in the first quarter of 2010. 
  
Bicentenario ship or pay contract for crude oil transportation  
  
In  order  to  finance  the  construction  of  Stages  0  and  1  of  the  Bicentenario  oil  pipeline,  crude  oil  transportation  contacts  were  signed  that  create  the 
obligation on the part of the respective shareholder or affiliate to ship crude oil under its ownership: (i) from the Araguaney station to Coveñas, (ii) under 
the ‘ship or pay’ modality, and (iii) up to the capacity of the shareholder, determined by his share in Bicentenario, which will depend on the contracted
capacity of all Bicentenario’s shareholders and/or affiliates, and which shall not be less than 110,000 BPCD. 
  
In exchange for the shipping service, the shareholder or his affiliate must pay a fixed monthly fee, even if no barrels at all are shipped, from one of the 
following dates, whichever comes first: (i) The date at which the oil pipeline begins operation or (ii) 12 months from the date of the first disbursement of 
the syndicated loan, namely July 5, 2013. The right to receive the fee under the ship or pay modality was ceded to an autonomous trust created for the 
purpose of administrating and making payments. 
  
The contracts will initially be in effect from the date of the first payment of the fee, or the date of the beginning of service, whichever takes place first, 
and will end either (a) 12 years after the beginning of the period, or (b) the day on which all of the obligations under the contract have been discharged, 
whichever comes last. Once the above period has been completed, the contract will be in effect for an additional period of 20 years.

c. Impairment
The  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP  (RCP). These  principles  and 
regulations differ in certain significant aspects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and therefore this 
note  presents  reconciliations  of  net  income  and  shareholders’  equity  determined  under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP  to  those  same  amounts  as 
determined  according  to  U.S.  GAAP. Also  presented  in  this  note  are  those  disclosures  required  under  U.S.  GAAP  but  not  required  under  Colombian 
Government Entity GAAP. 
  
A)       Reconciliation of net income attributable to Ecopetrol.: 
  
The following table presents the reconciliation of consolidated net income under Colombian Government Entity GAAP to consolidated net income under U.S.

D) Summary of significant differences between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP and required U.S. GAAP disclosures
INVESTMENT SECURITIES
i.
  
The Company’s investments include both marketable and non-marketable securities. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP , the Company classifies 
investment securities based on the form of their investment return, either as fixed-yield investment or as variable-yield investments. Fixed-yield investments 
generally represent debt securities and are initially recorded at cost with subsequent adjustments to fair value recorded in the income statement. Variable-yield 
investments generally represent equity securities or interests in other entities and are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are made 
with increases in fair value resulting in an increase to equity, while decreases in fair value are charged to the income statement. Fair values are determined using 
quoted market prices, if and when available. In the absence of quoted market prices, these investments are recorded at Management’s estimate of fair value 
using discounted cash flow techniques. 
  
Under  U.S.  GAAP, the Company has classified its investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale, as defined in ASC Sub-topic  320-10-25, 
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Debt security investments for which the Company has demonstrated its ability and intent to 
hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Such investments are reported at amortized cost. Investments classified as available-for-sale are reported at 
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of taxes, as a component of other comprehensive income. 
  
In the event that any other than temporary impairment of the investments value occurs, the impairment loss is recorded in income. 
  
The Company’s short-term and long-term investments at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 consist of the following:

Impairment  of  investment  securities  are  reported  differently  under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP  and  U.S.  GAAP.  Under  Colombian  Government 
Entity GAAP, impairment is charged to income in the current period, but recoveries in value can be recorded up to the amount that was originally impaired. 
Under U.S. GAAP, other-than-temporary impairment should be charged to income in the current period and a new cost basis for the security is established. 
Subsequent increases in the cost basis of an impaired investment as a result of a recovery in fair value are included in other comprehensive income. 
  
The Company has a policy under which they conduct periodic reviews of marketable securities to assess whether other-than-temporary impairment exists. A 
number of factors are considered in performing an impairment analysis of securities. Those factors include: 
  
a)
  
b)
The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which influence the operations of the issuer (such as changes in 
technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment, or the discontinuance of a segment of a business that may affect the future earnings 
potential); and
The length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been less than cost;
F-64
c) Carry out the analysis as instructed in ASC paragraph 320-10-65-1 which includes the comparison of the fair value and the amortized cost, evaluates the 
intention to sell the security and if it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery, including the existence 
of a credit loss.
The  Company  also  takes  into  account  changes  in  global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and  changes  related  to  specific  issuers  or  industries  that  could 
adversely affect these values.  
  
Ecopetrol’s marketable security portfolio consists only of debt securities, such as treasury investments,  bonds, and commercial papers. For this reason, the 
Company has an internal policy to limit the ratings of their investments and issuers to the following ratings:

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company recognized impairment on its investment securities amounting to $50,126, $116 and $44,851 in 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively. 
  
ii.
  
a. Equity Method and Valuation Surplus 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP , equity securities for which prices are unquoted, or for which trading volume is minimal, and the Company does 
not control the investee, are accounted for under the cost method and subsequently are valued by the shareholders' equity comparison method. Under the equity 
comparison method, the Company accounts for the difference between its proportionate share of shareholders' equity of the investee and its acquisition cost, 
adjusted for inflation through 2001, in a separate valuation account in the assets and equity (valuation surplus), if the proportionate share of shareholders’ equity 
of the investee is higher than its cost or as an allowance for losses, affecting net income, if the cost is higher than the proportionate share of shareholders’ equity 
of the investee. The proportionate share of shareholder’s equity is considered as the market value for this purpose and is known as book value. Under this 
method, the Company only records dividends as income when received. From 2008 the Colombian Government Entity GAAP incorporated the concept of 
significant influence for the recognition of investments in associated entities and established the equity method to update these investments.
Under U.S. GAAP, an investment in a non-marketable equity security is recorded using the equity method when the investor can exercise significant influence 
over the investee, or the cost method when significant influence cannot be exercised. Under the equity method of accounting for U.S. GAAP the carrying value 
of such an investment is adjusted to reflect (1) the Company’s proportionate share of earnings or losses from the investee and (2) additional investments and 
distributions of dividends. The Company’s proportionate share of income or loss is reported in earnings but any dividends or additional investments are reported 
only as an adjustment of the carrying amount of the investment.
The differences between the application of the cost and the equity method under U.S. GAAP were: 
  
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reversal of valuations and allowances for losses recorded under Colombian Government Entity GAAP
Reversal of inflation adjustments recorded under Colombian Government Entity GAAP
Reversal of Goodwill amortization and impairment
Inclusion of share of earnings or losses under U.S. GAAP, net of inter-company eliminations.
Inclusion of share in Other Comprehensive Income under U.S. GAAP.
Recognition of impairment under U.S. GAAP

Impairment
The number of shares which the Company owns with respect to its investment in Invercolsa S.A. has been subject to a legal dispute with another Invercolsa 
shareholder. Lower court decisions had ruled in favor of both the Company and the other shareholder and a final court decision in January 2011 determined that 
324  million  shares,  equivalent  to  11.58%  of  the  capital  stock  of  Invercolsa  should  be  returned  to  Ecopetrol.  As  a  result  Ecopetrol  controls  43.35%.  The 
dividends  paid  in  respect  of  the  shares  returned  to  Ecopetrol  are  still  in  dispute,  as  well  as  the  ownership  of  shares  constituting  8.53%  of  Invercolsa.  The 
resolution of these matters is still pending. 
  
b.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP it is not mandatory to perform impairment tests of the Equity Method Investments unless positive evidence is 
identified. For the years 2011, the investment in Offshore International Group was evaluated for impairment resulting in a loss of $13,136. 
  
The impairment under U.S. GAAP ASC paragraph 325-20-35 1A and 2, assets held at cost, including non-marketable equity investments, should be evaluated 
for impairment if the Company is aware of any events or changes in circumstances that may have significant adverse effects on the fair value of the investment. 
If  the  Company  believes  such  circumstances  exist,  the  Company  would  estimate  the  asset’s  fair  value  and  compare  that  to  the  cost  to  determine  if  any 
impairment is necessary. During 2012 and 2011 the Company eventhough it was not aware of any event that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair 
value of the investment, calculate the fair value of these investments and concluded that there were not impaired 
  
c.
  
Under U.S. GAAP, ASC paragraph 810-10-15-13 requires that consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling 
financial interest, i.e., a majority voting interest. However, application of the majority voting interest requirement to certain types of entities may not identify the 
party with a controlling financial interest because that interest may be achieved through other arrangements. Thus, the U.S. GAAP rules also require a Company 
to consolidate a variable interest entity if that Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, with that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that 
most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance and will absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s expected 
residual returns, or both. In determining whether it is a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, a Company shall treat variable interests in that same 
entity held by the Company’s related parties as its own interest. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, consolidated financial statements only include 
subsidiaries in which the Company has the majority voting interest.
Variable Interest Entity (VIE)
F-66
In October 2009, the subsidiary Oleoducto de los Llanos Orientales (hereinafter “ODL”) assigned its rights under a "Ship or Pay” contract for the completion of 
a securitization for the purpose of obtaining the funds required to finish the second phase of the project, the refund of capital to the associates, and maintain the 
capital structure initially agreed. The structure of this issuance was made through assets in a trust fund (hereinafter “Fideicomiso P.A. ODL - ECOPETROL”) 
administered by Corficolombiana S.A., who has to pay the security holder on the due dates. Additionally, each month, the trust Company must report to ODL 
income and expenses that are generated in this process and that are paid, if applicable, to ODL as advances. 
  
Based on the ASC 810, ODL determined that it must consolidate Fideicomiso P.A. ODL - ECOPETROL, since it is a VIE and ODL is the primary beneficiary 
and therefore, consolidated its financial statements for U.S. GAAP purposes. 
The adjustments of Fideicomiso P. A. ODL – ECOPETROL, according to financial information under U.S. GAAP as of and for the years ended December 31, 
2012 and 2011, are as follows:

Ecopetrol is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate risk of its financial obligations and to commodity price risk, 
resulting from the fluctuations of international crude oil prices which affect its earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Ecopetrol manages its exposure to 
these market risks through its regular operating and financial activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Ecopetrol has 
established  a  control  to  assess,  approve  and  monitor  derivative  financial  instrument  activities.  Ecopetrol  does  not  buy,  hold  or  sell  derivative  financial 
instruments for trading purposes. Ecopetrol's primary foreign currency exposures relate to the U.S. dollar; however, Ecopetrol manages its foreign currency risk 
position internally, using non-deliverable forwards, according to the size of the mismatches between its asset-liability position in U.S. dollars and its asset-
liability  position  in  Colombian  pesos.  If  no mismatches occur  Ecopetrol  has  a  perfect  natural hedge.  Ecopetrol  also  utilizes  other  derivative  agreements to 
mitigate changes in the fair value of commodities. None of the derivatives were designated or documented for hedge accounting. 
  
The Company periodically enters into call and put option contracts to cover the price risk associated with fluctuations in market prices of asphalt. The option 
contracts limit the unfavorable effect that the price increase will have on asphalt. The maximum term over which the Company is managing its exposure to the 
variability for commodity price risk is 12 months. 
  
As of December 31, 2012, only the subsidiary Hocol S.A. is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. Such exposures arise primarily from expenditures that are 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The Company constantly monitors its exposure to foreign currency risks. To reduce its foreign 
currency exposure associated with operating expenses incurred in Colombian pesos, the Company may enter into foreign currency derivatives to manage such 
risks. These derivatives are recognized at their fair value as either a financial asset or obligation with the corresponding income or expense recognized.

EXCHANGE OF NON-MONETARY ASSETS
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, each derivative has its own accounting treatment depending on the type of derivative. Option premiums paid are 
recorded as deferred charges and amortized to the income statement as financial expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, the option contract 
is recognized in memo accounts unless it is likely to be exercised, and the gain is recognized as an investment. Swap and forward contract net results are 
recorded  as  an  investment.  In  all  cases,  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  in  earnings  as  financial  income  or  expense.  Amounts  receivable  or  payable  upon 
maturity resulting from net payments are recorded using current rates for the period. 
  
U.S. GAAP requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each 
period in current earnings. The fair value of derivatives instruments is recorded as other assets and other liabilities. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, embedded derivative instruments shall be separated from the host contract, and accounted for using different measurement attributes, if 
certain conditions are met. In the case of the Company, some contracts to which the Company is counterparty include embedded foreign exchange derivatives. 
According to ASC paragraph 815-15-15-10 through 13 these contracts do not require separate accounting for the embedded derivative and the host contract 
because contract payments are made in the functional currency of a party to the contract or contract payments are made in a currency in which the price of the 
good  or  service  delivered  is  routinely  denominated  in  international  commerce.  In  other  cases,  contracts  indexed  to  inflation  considered  clearly  and  closely 
related. 
  
Gas imbalance agreements were evaluated to identify if they were derivatives. Management concluded that these agreements are not derivatives since they do 
not contain fixed notional amounts. 
  
iv.
  
During 2007, the Company exchanged a refinery business with a book value of $234,371 for a 49% interest in Refinería de Cartagena S.A. The Company 
estimated the fair value of the 49% investment as $1,369,546. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, this difference between the cost of the assets given 
and the fair value of the assets received was recorded as an increase to asset revaluation and equity. However, under ASC Subtopic 845-10-30, 51% of the 
difference between the book value of the Refinery and the fair value of the assets received, which the Company determined to be a more reliable indicator of the 
value of the exchange since the fair value of the investment was greater, was recorded in the results of operations as a gain in the amount of $578,939. The 
remaining 49% of unrealized gain was recorded as a deferred gain with a corresponding increase to the investment, equivalent to a deferred gain of $556,236, to 
be  amortized  over  the  expected  useful  life  of  the  equipment. In  2011,  the  Company  determined  that  in  2009,  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  51%  of  the 
remaining  participation  in  Reficar  S.A.,  the  unamortized  unrealized  gain  should  have  been  recorded  at  fair  value  since  the  Company  obtained  control  of 
Refinería de Cartagena S.A. in 2009 in line with the acquired entity’s fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as of May 27, 2009. However, according to 
ASC 250 and SAB 108, we do not consider such amount significant and decided to fully amortize the remaining balance as of 2011. As a result, the net income 
reconciliation includes amortized income of $425,521 in 2011 and $23,640 in 2010, corresponding to the amortization of the deferred gain. 
  
v.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the Equity Tax is recognized as a deferred charge for the total amount due payable during the years 2011 through 
2014. The deferred charge is amortized as an expense of the year based on the payments made. The local regulatory entities also allowed companies that applied 
inflation adjustments and still have outstanding balances in the Equity Revaluation account to reduce such balance instead of recognizing a deferred charge. 
Other  deferred  assets  recognized  under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP  are  related  to  certain  pre-operating  expenses  and  other  charges  that  include 
normal recurring maintenance and fees. 
  
For U.S. GAAP purposes, the amount of the adjustment in the Company’s net income related to deferred charges amounting to $493,159 in 2012, $1,710,944 in 
2011 and $7,167 in 2010. 
  
vi.
  
Under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP,  the  Company  estimates  the  net  present  value  of  its  actuarial  liability  for  all  pension  plans  and  other  post-
retirement  obligations.  Annually,  the  Company  estimates  the  net  present  value  of  the  actuarial  liability  and  adjusts  the  recorded  liability  accordingly.  The 
amount of the adjustment is reflected in the Company’s net income. 
  
For other post-retirement benefits, the payments are made according to seniority and the salary at the time of retirement, as stipulated in the Collective Labor 
Agreement and Agreement No. 01. 
  
Under  the  post-retirement  benefits  plan  for  Ecopetrol  personnel,  the  Company  covers  90%  of  educational  expenses  for  children  of  employees,  including 
enrollment fees, tuition and other associated costs. A fixed annual sum, depending on grade level, is also provided for the acquisition of textbooks. Educational 
coverage  includes  kindergarten,  elementary  school,  high  school  and  college.  Ecopetrol´s  financial  statements  must  also  show  the  cost  of  post-retirement 
educational benefits for children of retired employees, since benefits continue irrespective of retirement or death.
DEFERRED CHARGES
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
F-68
According to the Collective Labor Agreement and Agreement No. 01, the Company will pay for health services for employees and enrolled family members. 
Health services include: office visits and required laboratory services, drugs, diagnostic examinations, ambulatory treatment, hospitalization due to illness or 
accident, surgery due to illness or accident, maternity and rehabilitation treatments and orthopedic parts. Therefore, such post-retirement health benefit costs are 
recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Colombian Government Entity GAAP, since retired workers and 
enrolled family members continue to receive full medical coverage. The same is true for deceased non-retired employees. 
  
U.S. GAAP requires the recognition of pension, health care and education plans costs based on actuarial computations under a prescribed methodology which 
differs from that used under RCP. For purposes of the U.S. GAAP reconciliation, the transition obligation is calculated at the date the Company adopted the 
ASC  Topic  420,  715,  805,  and  835  Employers’  Accounting  for  Pensions  and  is  being  amortized  as  of  January  1,  1989.  The  transition  obligation  for  the 
education and medical plan is being amortized from January 1, 1995 
  
Under Colombian law, employees are entitled to one month salary for each year of service. This benefit is known as the “severance obligation” or “cesantias”. 
This benefit accumulates during the time of employment and is paid to employees upon their termination or retirement from Ecopetrol. However, employees 
may request advanced benefit payments at any time. In 1990, the Colombian government revised its labor regulations to permit companies, subject to employee 
approval, to pay the severance obligation to their employees on a current basis. Law 50 of 1990 also enabled each employee to freely choose yearly which trust 
fund would manage the amount accrued during each year in which they are eligible for severance payments. This amount must be transferred by the Company 
to the trust fund no later than the next subsequent year. 
  
In addition, the Company under Colombian law must pay pension bonds for certain employees when they leave Ecopetrol. Those bonds payable accrue interest 
at the DTF rate, according to the class of bonds, as follows:
1) For pension bonds type B, CPI + 4%;
2) For pension bonds type A, with date of transfer before December 31, 1998, CPI + 4%;
3) For the remaining pension bonds type A, CPI + 3%.
The economic assumptions used in the determination of pension obligations under U.S. GAAP differ from those used under RCP since the latter are established 
annually by the Colombian regulations. 
  
Ecopetrol has not made any change to its methodology or accounting policy for the determination of disclosure information. However, since 2011 they are 
based on the calculations of a new actuary and therefore have a new valuation system. 
  
The  combined  costs  for  the  above  mentioned  benefit  plans,  determined  using  U.S.  GAAP,  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2012,  2011  and  2010  are

Under  U.S.  GAAP,  the  method  of  allocating  the  comingled  asset  fund  as  of  the  valuation  date  between  the  pension  and  the  pension bond plan  have  been 
changed from allocating the asset fund in proportion to the amounts of the respective liabilities. 
  
While under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, to allocating the total return for the year between the two plans by calculating a return for each plan, equal 
to the fund´s total return, given the beginning balances and actual payments for the year. The allocated return added to the beginning balance plus contributions 
and less the actual payments results in the year-end balance. 
  
Net liability of employee benefit plans, net of other employee benefits, is classified as follows:

* Colombian Mortality Table ISS, male and female, 2005-2008. 
  
The Superintendence of Finance concluded a mortality study based on the experience of the affiliated workers to the pension funds and to the Social Security 
Institute ISS, during the years 2005-2008. The resulting mortality table from such study reflects the current mortality of the Colombian workers. As it was 
expected, the new table shows a lower mortality rate compared with those of the actual mortality table, ISS, experience 1981-1989. For such reason, the new 
table was applied for purposes of executing the different actuarial calculations included in this valuation in 2009. 
  
The rate of return of the plan assets during 2012 was 11.02%. We have considered the expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% and an expected inflation 
rate equal to 3.00% at December 31, 2012, with a discount rate of 6.25%. 
  
In 2011, the health plan had an increase in the obligation since the amount reflects the current medical cost trend during the last 3 years in increases in health 
costs in Colombia. In 2010, the Company did not consider generating an increase in health care obligation due to projections by the health department in 2009 
and 2010. However, in 2011 and 2012, the most recent analyses by the health department shows a tendency to the decrease and control of the high costs. 
  
The actuarial assumptions of health plan have changed since the last actuarial valuation as of December 31, 2011: 
  
The 2011 valuation used a trend rate that starts at 18.4% and grades down to general inflation +1% over 10 years. In 2012 we used a trend rate starting at 
11.20% and grading down to general inflation +1% over 10 years. 
  
The  2010 valuation considered  the  current  family  group  for  active  participants.  For  2011  and  2012  the  valuation  was  valued  as an  assumed  family group, 
projected to retirement eligibility based on the demographics of the currently inactive population near first retirement eligibility. 
  
The 2010 valuation does not consider spouses of active or inactive female participants. For 2011 and 2012 the valuation was valued for all eligible spouses of 
female inactive participants and projected spouses for active female participants. 
  
The 2010 valuation uses a retirement age that depends on the employee completing the service requirement for retirement with Social Security using only with 
Ecopetrol. For 2011 and 2012 valuation, we have assumed an employee´s labor history and Social Security participation starting at age 25. 
  
As mentioned above, as of December 31, 2012, the actuarial assumptions of Pension have changed since the last actuarial valuation as of December 31, 2011, 
with main updates as follows: 
  
The 2010 liability was calculated as if a participant´s first employer was Ecopetrol. Since employment with other employers before and after employment with 
the Company is unknown, for the 2011 and 2012 valuations assumptions have been established to estimate the employee labor history. 
  
The 2010 liability was calculated as if all participants have a Bond type B. For 2011 and 2012 the valuation was established assumptions that depend on the hire 
date and the Social Security system in which participants are enrolled. 
  
The 2010 liability was calculated as if all participants would retire immediately. For 2011 and 2012 the valuation establishes retirement dates depending on 
whether the participants are eligible for the Company pension plan or the general Social Security retirement benefit. 
  
The 2011 pension bond liability was calculated assuming that if a retired participant had not claimed his bond there was a likelihood that he would never claim 
it,  equivalent  to:  a) 100  %  after  15 years  b)  50% among 10  and  15  years, c)  25%  among  5  and  10  years;  and  d)  0%  for  less than 5  years.  For 2012  this 
assumption was revised assuming there was a 100% likelihood after 3 years and 0% for less than 3 years.

All of the benefits estimated in the table above are to be paid from plan assets. The Company does not have any insurance policies that are intended to cover 
benefits that plan participants are to receive in the future. 
  
Furthermore, to the Company currently does not intend to contribute to the fund in the upcoming fiscal year. Management believes that the plan assets will 
provide for a sufficient return to cover any payments that are necessary to be made in the upcoming year. 
  
Assumed health care cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care 
cost trend rates would have the following effects:

PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENCIES
For  U.S.  GAAP,  Accounting  for  Contingencies  (ASC  450),  provides  the  guidance  for  recording  contingencies.  Under  ASC  450,  there  are  three  levels  of 
assessment of contingent events – probable, reasonably possible and remote. The term probable in ASC 450 is defined as “the future event or events that are 
likely to occur”. The term reasonably possible is defined as “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely”. While 
the term remote is defined as “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight”.
Under ASC 450, an estimated loss related to a contingent event shall be accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met:
Information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been 
incurred at the date of the financial statements
The amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
The amount recorded is an estimate of the amount of loss at the date of the financial statements. If the contingent event is evaluated to be reasonably possible, 
no provision for the contingent event may be made, but disclosure of the event is required with amount of loss that is reasonably possible.
As a result of the difference in the definition of “probable” between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP, and the general interpretation of the 
definition in practice in Colombia, there is a difference in the amount of the provision for legal proceedings.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES
The effects of this adjustment in the reconciliation of income were $(36,841); $335,983 and $67,629 in December 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
  
The effects of this adjustment in the reconciliation of consolidated shareholders´ equity were 313,637 and 350,535in December 2012 and 2011 respectively. 
  
viii. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRESENT VALUE
  
Under  Colombian  government  Entity  GAAP,  accounts  receivable  and  payable  are  recognized  at  amortized  cost,  represented  by  any  uncollected  or  unpaid 
balances, regardless if such balances are due within the year or not. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company measures the long-term balances at present value by 
discounting future cash flows at the appropriate discount rate. Such balance is amortized using the effective interest method. 
  
The estimated discount rate for long-term liability was calculated by our Treasury department and is based on the Colombian Government Treasury bonds as it 
was considered that the Company has a similar credit risk. 
  
As a result of the measurement of the Equity Tax liability recognized by Ecopetrol and its subsidiaries in the year 2012 and 2011, an adjustment for $92,512 and 
$126,861 was recorded respectively. 
  
ix.
  
Under U.S. GAAP a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, deferred income taxes are calculated using the current statutory tax rate. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred income 
taxes are calculated based on rates and tax laws enacted at the reporting date considering the future tax rate that will apply when the deferred income tax 
difference will be realized. 
  
Under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP,  since  2009,  goodwill  is  deductible  and  does  not  generate  differences  between  tax  laws  and  the  Colombian 
Government Entity GAAP, except by the difference in the time of amortization. Under U.S. GAAP, the goodwill is not amortizable and generates a temporary 
difference, as a result it is necessary to compute and recognize deferred income taxes for differences originated by deductions since the acquisition date. 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the fair value of the assets is not recorded; the difference between this value (zero) and the value recorded under 
U.S. GAAP generates deferred tax calculated under ASC 740. 
  
All of the income tax effects in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation are the tax effect of pretax adjustments, and none relate to differences between the accounting for 
income tax standards. 
  
The Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns since tax regulations do not allow consolidated income tax returns. There are no requirements 
to file tax returns by segments. Tax returns are required for each legal entity. Tax rate of Refineria de Cartagena S,A, Bioenergy and Comai is 15% because it 
has tax benefit until 2023, 2025 and 2021 respectively. The tax savings for the last three years has not been significant. 
  
Taxable loss carry forwards are deductible in future years depending of countries tax regulations. As of December 31, 2012, Ecopetrol S.A and its subsidiaries 
had accumulated tax loss carry-forwards and excesses of presumptive income generated in previous years, as follows:
Expiration date
With no Maximum expiry date $
Loss carry-  
forwards
1,927,525 $
Excess of
presumed income
Tax reform 
  
The Congress of the Republic adopted Law 1607 of December 26, 2012, which introduces significant reforms to the Colombian tax system, in particular, the 
income tax rate was reduced from 33% to 25% starting in 2013, and the Equality Income Tax (Impuesto de Renta para la Equidad - CREE), was created with a 
rate  of  9%  from  2013  to  2015  and  8%  starting  in  2016;  there  are  some  differences  between  the  treatment  used  to  determine  this  tax  and  the  one  used  to 
determine ordinary income tax.

Carry forwards losses are generated by subsidiaries and according to local tax laws, these losses do not expire.
The excess in presumptive income tax are generated by subsidiaries and will expire in 5 years.
The changes in the valuation allowance is mainly due to 2012 tax losses originated by Ecopetrol do Brazil, Ecopetrol America Inc. and Refineria de 
Cartagena amounted $620,915 approximately offsetted by utilizations in Ecopetrol del Peru and ODC, amounting $16,521 approximately, as detailed

a.1
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the Company recognizes receivables from or payables to partners and to pipeline companies based on the cost of 
the inventory. 
  
The  Company’s  crude  oil  over  balance  position  at  December  31,  2012  was  $221,350  and  at  December  31,  2011  was  $659,535  equivalent  to  968,656  and 
4,184,690 barrels, respectively.

For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company utilizes the entitlement method of accounting for over and under positions by which the amount of crude oil sold is 
based on its shared interest in the properties, and revenue is recognized based on market prices. The pipeline imbalances determined through volume allocation 
are recorded as either receivables or payables as per EITF 90-22. valued at selling prices. 
  
During 2012, the Company identified some transactions that Ecopetrol was considering as Over and Under lifting but corresponded mainly to transportation 
imbalances and therefore not to entitlement accounting. This, given that the distribution of the production is done at the wellhead and in that sense none of the 
association  contracts  establishes  the  possibility  to  sell  oil  on  behalf  of  the  other  party.  Accordingly,  the  values  that  would  affected  Ecopetrol´s  income  in 
previous years as a revenue recognition issue should be recognized as imbalances with the transporter. Given the financial and operational mechanics of these 
inventories, the record should affect the cost of sales because these imbalances will be delivered by or return to Ecopetrol in kind and not adjusting income and 
being presented in the reconciliation netting the adjustment of cost of sales, as previously done. The valuation would remain at selling prices in accordance with 
the requirements of the EITF90-22. However, according to ASC 250 and SAB 108, we do not consider such amount significant and decided to adjust revenues 
and cost of sale as of 2012. The said adjustment as of December 31, 2011 represents lower net assets and higher net income amounting $286,203 (higher net 
assets and lower net income amounting $21,975 in 2010). 
  
a.2
  
Under U.S. GAAP, the related cost of sale in the reconciliation of net income for over and under deliveries transactions described at a.1 above amounted to 
$208,644, $(449,225) and $158,609 during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in comparison with the amount recognized under Colombian Government Entity 
GAAP. 
  
a.3
Cost of Sales
Net vs. Gross sales
INVENTORIES
INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS
The Company has sales transactions were it transports crude oil, from the supplier to the customer, using its pipelines. For U.S. GAAP purposes, when price is 
fixed, there are no changes made to the product and the Company has no physical inventory loss risk, among other criteria, the Company records such sales on a 
net basis. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, such crude oil sales are recognized gross. 
  
xi.
  
The  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP  consolidated  financial  statements  were  adjusted  for  inflation  based  on  the  variation  in  the  IPC  (Colombia’s 
equivalent to the consumer price index in the United States) for middle income-earners from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2001 for Ecopetrol S.A. and from 
January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2006 for Oleoducto de Colombia S.A. (ODC), Hocol S.A., Oleoducto Central S.A. (Ocensa), Equion, and Reficar S.A. The 
adjustment was applied monthly to non-monetary assets, equity (except for the valuation surplus) and memorandum accounts. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, the aforementioned adjustments under Colombian Government Entity GAAP are not applicable and have been reversed. 
  
xii.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or sale price. Under U.S. GAAP, inventories are valued at the 
lower of average cost or market value, the determination of which can be made using several different methods acceptable under U.S. GAAP. An adjustment 
has been recorded to reflect the difference in the method used to determine the valuation of inventories that arises from using sale price instead of market value, 
as defined by U.S. GAAP. Inventories are also affected by the effect of adjustments to cost of sales included in this reconciliation. These adjustments are related 
to depreciation, expenses capitalized in property, plant and equipment, asset retirement cost and impairment of long-lived assets. 
  
The  effects  of  this  adjustment  (loss)  gain  in  the  reconciliation  of  income  were  $(16,699),  $76,126,  and  $(87,797)  in  December  2012,  2011  and  2010, 
respectively. 
  
The effects of these adjustments in the reconciliation of equity and the corresponding effect in inventory were $(55,078) and $(38,473) at December 31, 2012 
and 2011, respectively. 
  
xiii.
  
Under both Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP, lease accounting for capital leases and operating leases is similar. However, the tests used to 
determine if a lease is a capital or an operating lease differs between Colombian Government Entity GAAP and U.S. GAAP. In applying the tests in accordance 
with Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the Company has determined that all leases are operating leases. Under U.S. GAAP some of these leases should be 
accounted  for  as  capital  leases  in  accordance  with  ASC  840-10. As  a  result,  adjustments  were  recorded  to  reflect  the  related  assets  and  liabilities,  and  to 
recognize interest expense and de-recognize operating expenses associated with the lease payments. 
  
Embedded Leasing 
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, there is no requirement to identify whether the arrangements or contracts contain leases.
LEASE ACCOUNTING
F-78
Under U.S. GAAP, an arrangement contains a lease if both of the following two criteria are met: 
  
1. The arrangement depends on a specific fixed asset, either identified contractually or implicitly identified as no alternative item could feasibly be used.
  
2. The purchaser has the right to control the use of the underlying fixed asset, such control demonstrated by the existence of any of the following qualitative
conditions:
a) The purchaser can operate the asset or direct others to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than a minor amount of the asset’s output;
b) The purchaser can control physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling more than a minor amount of the asset’s output; or
c) Probability is remote that another party will get more than minor amount of the asset’s output and the price is not fixed per unit.
Under U.S. GAAP, if the arrangement contains a lease, ASC 840 is applied by both purchaser and supplier for recognition, measurement, classification and 
disclosure purposes.

(1) Three original leases that were accounted for as capital leases under U.S. GAAP are BOMT contracts, the use of which are specifically required under
Colombian law for projects that involve the building, operating, maintaining and transferring of natural gas pipelines for the transportation of natural
gas. These contracts had original terms of 20 years, no renewal provisions, and a purchase option. The rights to the leased assets were subsequently
transferred to a related Company (ECOGAS) that was sold, but Ecopetrol was not relieved of the primary obligation under the original lease. This
transfer was considered a sublease accounted for as a direct finance lease. In 2007, Ecopetrol received a prepayment of all amounts to be received
during the term of the sublease contract.
  
In 2010, we entered in a new BOMT, corresponding to the gas treatment plant located in the Dina-Tello field with an estimated value of construction 
US$28 million. This BOMT is accounted as capital lease in accordance with ASC 840 such as the contracts described previously, this contract had
original term of 8 years, ending in 2017.
(3) Ecopetrol  subscribed  a  contract  with  Unión  Temporal  Gas  Gibraltar  firm  to  advanced  the  design,  build,  operation  and  maintenance  of  a  plant  of 
treatment  with  30  capacity  of  mpcd.  Likewise,  for  the marketing  of  this  product  a  contract  with  Natural  Gas  E.S.P  was  signed.,  Company  that  it
contracted  with  the  Company  TransOriente  E.S.P  the  construction  of  the  pipeline  that  will  transport  the  treated  gas  from  the  Gibraltar  field  to
Bucaramanga, where it will be connected with the national system of gas transport. The plant of gas processing of Gibraltar is located between the
populations of Toledo (Norte de Santander) and Cubará (Boyacá). This BOMT is accounted as capital lease in accordance with ASC 840 such as the 
contracts described previously, this contract had original term of 15 years, ending in 2026.
(4) ODL signed three agreements for the acquisition of assets necessary for energy conversion. The purpose of these assets is to ensure availability of
capacity to meet the needs of power consumption in ODL booster station 1 (ER1). Booster station (ER2) and Rubiales Field.
The assets will be owned by ODL beyond the duration of the agreement and settle purchase option, or ends early to settle the purchase option at any 
time by the contract elapsed time. ODL has no obligation to perform the purchase option, if not the assets will be removed by the contractor.
ODL considering the guidelines of the regulations established under U.S. GAAP ASC 840. According to this rule, these contracts were treated as a 
finance lease therefore recorded an asset and a liability for the present value of their initial measurement and subsequent measurement at amortized 
cost.
F-79
In 2011 the BOMT´s contracts were recognized in the adjustment No. 14, with an annual interest rate of 9.13% equivalent ODL Average debt. 
  
During 2012 is included under the guidelines of RCP with an annual interest rate of 3% equivalent to the CPI projection target of the Bank of the 
Republic of Colombia in the long term, taken from Ecopetrol instructive: "Bases of subordinated financial planning and budget 2013-2015 ". For U.S. 
GAAP 2012 report, was eliminated this recognition made in 2011 and made a reclassification of accounts coming from RCP to use the same accounts 
under U.S. GAAP. 
  
The accounting recognition of contracts BOMT's under RCP follows the same guidelines of normativity U.S. GAAP (ASC - 840), and using a 
discount rate of 3%
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
xiv.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are adjusted for inflation until 2001. The cost includes 
administrative expenses until 2004, financial expenses and exchange differences from foreign currency financing until the asset is placed in service. Normal 
disbursements for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense and those significant costs that improve efficiency or extend the useful life are capitalized. 
Under U.S. GAAP, cost includes expenditures until the asset is placed in service such as installation cost, freight, interest, retirement cost; construction cost and 
other direct expenses are capitalized, with exception of adjustment for inflation and foreign currency loss. For U.S. GAAP purposes, administrative expenses 
capitalized were eliminated from property, plant and equipment. In addition, a deferred income tax asset resulted from the application of the provisions of ASC 
740-10, Accounting for Acquired Temporary Differences in Certain Purchase Transactions that are not Accounted for as Business Combinations, since the 
investment in real productive assets creates an additional tax deduction of 30% in 2010. Starting in January 2011, investment tax credit were no longer be 
available. 
  
The  following  table  reflects  the  net  changes  in  capitalized  exploratory  wells  during  2012  and  2011  it  does  not  include  amounts  that  were  capitalized  and 
recorded as expenses during the same period under the successful efforts method.

Under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP,  all  interest  paid  net  of  interest  income  is  subject  to  capitalization  regardless  of  the  utilization  of  the  funds. 
Exchange rate differential is also capitalized as part of the asset.The Company´s assessment of the methodology followed to determine the capitalization amount 
under U.S. GAAP considered more detailed information available to estimate the interest to be capitalized. Previous to 2010, the calculations were made based 
on the average monthly disbursements, as an improvement, the Company obtained a detail of the assets associated to the debt and was able to apply the analysis 
and calculations based on each project, providing further detail of interest capitalized. The impact was recognized during 2010 as it was considered a change in 
an accounting estimate per ASC 250-10-45-17 and 18, Change in Accounting Estimates. 
  
The total interest capitalized during 2012 under Colombian Government Entity GAAP was $761,199 and the total interest capitalized under U.S. GAAP was 
$153,999. The effect of this adjustment in the reconciliation of income was $607,200 The total interest capitalized during 2011 under Colombian Government 
Entity GAAP was $207,514 and the total interest capitalized under U.S. GAAP was $85,337. The effect of this adjustment in the reconciliation of income was 
$122,177. The total interest capitalized during 2010 under RCP was $319,326 and the total interest capitalized under U.S. GAAP was $150,800. The effect of 
this adjustment in the reconciliation of income was $$168,527.  
  
b.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment and public accounting effect
Impairment
Valuation surplus of property, plant and equipment and public accounting effect correspond to the difference between net book value and the market value for 
real estate or the current value in use for property, plant and equipment, determined by specialists. These accounts are reflected as valuations and as valuation 
surplus from reappraisals of assets and the public accounting effect (components of equity) in the Company’s consolidated balances sheets. The last valuation 
was in December 2012. Technical appraisals are valid for three years. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, the valuation surplus of assets and the public accounting effect are not permitted. The effect of this adjustment in the reconciliation of 
Equity as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $19,503,673, $12,396,858, respectively. 
  
c.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP , technical appraisals for property, plant and equipment are performed at least every three years. If the technical 
study is lower than the carrying value, the difference is recorded in equity as a reduction of the property, plant and equipment carrying value even if it reduces 
the valuation surplus below zero. Under U.S. GAAP, in accordance with ASC 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived 
Assets  (ASC 360-10),  property,  plant,  and  equipment  are reviewed  for impairment whenever  events  or changes  in  circumstances indicate that  the carrying 
amount  of  an  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.  If  circumstances  require  a  long-lived  asset  to  be  tested  for  possible  impairment,  the  Company  first  compares 
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable 
on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through 
various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. For 
U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company reviewed property, plant and equipment for impairment as of December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010, and recorded impairment 
losses when required. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the Company recorded in 2012, 2011 and 2010, $276,145, $136,357, and $135,469, respectively, as additional 
impairment charges to reduce the net book value of certain field assets and pipelines to their estimated recoverable values.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION
xv.
  
Under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP,  all  tangible  equipment,  including  those  used  in  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  exploration  and  development,  are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the related estimated useful lives. Intangible crude oil and natural gas assets reflected on the Company’s consolidated 
balance sheets as natural and environmental resources are depleted on a units-of-production basis. 
  
In the case of HOCOL, all tangible and intangible assets used in the production of crude and natural gas production are depreciated or depleted using the units 
of production method, using developed proved reserves, except for the pipeline asset which is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the related estimated 
useful life (20 years). For REFICAR, in the case of the unit “Viscorreductora”, this is depreciated based on a 4 year life on a straight line basis, ending in 
December 2012. For BIOENERGY, in relation to agricultural sugarcane crops, the Company develops the plantations that it will use as base for the production 
of Bioethanol. The cost of the agricultural plantations will be amortized during productive cycle time frame, in agreement with recognized technical value 
methods. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, all assets, including tangible equipment, used in crude oil and natural gas producing activities are required to be depreciated or depleted 
using a units-of-production method, using proved reserves calculated in accordance with SEC requirements. Therefore, an adjustment to net income per U.S. 
GAAP has been recorded to account for the difference in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense based on the above-described differences in the 
methods used. In addition, the financial statements reflect the amortization of those assets affected by the application of ASC 740-10, Accounting for Acquired 
Temporary Differences in Certain Purchase Transactions That Are Not Accounted for as Business Combinations. Therefore, an adjustment to net income per 
U.S. GAAP has been recorded to account for the difference in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense.  
  
xvi. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP , the Company updates annually the analysis of the estimated liability for future asset retirement obligations as of 
each balance sheet date. The liability is adjusted to the current value and an offsetting amount is recorded as an adjustment to the asset cost. Until 2009 the 
elements of the liability originated in U.S. dollars, changes in the foreign currency rates are included in the adjustment to the liability and the related asset, the 
component of the asset cost resulting from this liability is included in the depreciable base of the related asset.
For purposes of U.S. GAAP reporting, the Company follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 410-20 Asset Retirement Obligations.  
ASC 410-20 requires the Company to recognize a liability for the present value of all legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible, long-lived 
assets as of the date the related asset was placed into service, and capitalize an equal amount as an asset retirement cost (asset).  Each period the liability is 
accreted using the effective interest rate method. The accretion is included as an operating expense. The cost associated with the abandonment obligation, is 
included in the computation of depreciation, depletion and amortization.
An adjustment has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements to reflect accretion expense, and the related obligation and assets in accordance with 
ASC 410-20. 
  
For Pipeline systems there is insufficient information to reasonably determine the timing and/or method of settlement for estimating the fair value of the asset 
retirement obligation. In these cases, the asset retirement obligation cost is considered indeterminate because there is no data or information that can be derived 
from past practice, industry practice, our intentions or the estimated economic life of the asset. Useful lives of most pipeline systems are primarily derived from 
available supply resources and ultimate consumption of those resources by end users. Variables can affect the remaining lives of the assets which preclude us 
from making a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation. Indeterminate asset retirement obligation costs will be recognized in the period in which 
sufficient information exists to allow us to reasonably estimate potential settlement dates and methods. 
  
In addition to the aforementioned situation, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for asset retirement obligation 
related to refineries since the Company undergoes major renovations. In addition, The Company believes there is not sufficient information available to estimate 
the fair value of the asset retirement obligation because the settlement date or the range of potential settlement dates have not been specified by others and 
information is not available to apply an expected present value technique.

EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS
Incorporated Institutional Equity
xvii.
  
a.
  
At the end of association contracts that were signed prior to January 1, 2004, private companies are required to transfer, without cost, to Ecopetrol, all producing 
wells, facilities and other real estate and assets acquired in executing the contracts. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the Company accounts for the 
receipt, using the relinquishing Company’s reported historical cost, by recording an increase to assets and equity. The assets are then depreciated in accordance 
with the Company’s previously disclosed accounting policies. For U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, these balances and their related impacts on accumulated 
depreciation, depletion and amortization, and cost of production have been removed from the financial statements, based on the fact that the cost of these assets 
is zero. 
  
The adjustment to conform to U.S. GAAP in 2012 was a reduction in equity of $37,088 (original value of $149,695 net of $112,607 in accumulated depreciation 
or the assets received), holds materials of $1,105. 
  
The adjustment to conform to U.S. GAAP in 2011 was a reduction in equity of $50,479 (original value of $148,999 net of $98,520 in accumulated depreciation 
or the assets received), holds materials of $1,214. 
  
The adjustment to conform to U.S. GAAP in 2010 was a reduction in equity of $62,592 (original value of $137,010 net of $74,418 in accumulated depreciation 
of the assets received) holds materials of $1,819. 
  
b.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the Company recorded as reservoirs the contributions of the  Nation represented by crude oil and natural gas 
reserves deriving from the reversion of concessions of oilfield areas in favor of the Nation, given before the effectiveness of Decree 1760 of 2003. Reserves 
were valued by means of the technical-economic model where the value per barrel resulted from the relation of the net present value obtained at a discount rate 
and the total proved reserves on the contribution date. 
  
For U.S. GAAP purposes, these reversions were considered a transfer of assets between entities under common control. Ecopetrol, the entity that received the 
net assets, recognized the assets transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer which was zero value. The 
unamortized  amount  reverted  at  December  31,  2012  and  2011  was  $17,013  and  $19,737  respectively.  Since  2003  (creation  of  the  Agencia  Nacional  de 
Hidrocarburos - ANH) there have not been reversals of concessions.
Reversal of Concession Rights Contributed as Capital
INDEBTEDNESS COST
xviii.
  
Under  Colombian  Government  Entity  GAAP,  the  borrowing  costs  correspond  to  interest  paid,  lender  commissions  and  other  costs  related  to  the  debt 
transactions, the exchange difference for the interest rate to be paid, the amortization of premiums and discounts in the placement of bonds and securities, and 
any income results earned on the temporary investment of such loans. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, the borrowing costs correspond to interest paid, lender commissions and other costs related to the debt transactions, the amortization of 
premiums  and  discounts  in  the  placement  of  bonds  and  securities,  should  not  offset  interest  expense  with  interest  income,  unless  the  financing  transaction 
involves restricted, tax-exempt borrowings. Unlike Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the cost of borrowing does not include the exchange difference for 
the interest rate to be paid, unless such difference forms part of the negotiation of the interest rate for the transaction. 
  
The total indebtedness cost incurred during 2012 under Colombian Government Entity GAAP was $820,821 and the total indebtedness cost incurred under U.S. 
GAAP  was  $820,856.  The  effects  of  this  adjustment  in  the  reconciliation  of  income  were  $36.  The  total  indebtedness  cost  incurred  during  2011  under 
Colombian Government Entity GAAP was $608,261 and the total indebtedness cost incurred under U.S. GAAP was $608,912. The effects of this adjustment in 
the reconciliation of income were $652. The total indebtedness cost incurred during 2010 under Colombian Government Entity GAAP was $ 519,697 and the 
total indebtedness cost incurred under U.S. GAAP was $521,367.The effects of this adjustment in the reconciliation of income were $1,670.

Goodwill
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
xix.
  
a.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition price and the book value of the acquired Company 
recognized as an intangible asset. Separate intangibles are not identified under Colombian Government Entity GAAP nor are assets stepped up to fair values as a 
result of acquisitions; if the book value is higher than the acquisition price, the resulting difference is recorded as a gain. The amount recognized as goodwill is 
amortized during the period in which the Company expects to receive future benefits; in addition, it is subject to an annual impairment test 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to an annual impairment test with the option of an initial qualitative test. In addition, the tax effect 
on temporary difference between tax basis and fair values is allocated to goodwill. 
  
The following table shows, by Company, the goodwill balance as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 net of the amount of deferred income tax on goodwill

Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP in 2012 and 2011, $282,463 and $262,984 were amortized in regard to goodwill acquired from OIG, Ecopetrol 
Transportation Company, Hocol, Andean Chemicals, IPL Enterprises, Propilco and Equion. The amortization in the table above represents the accumulated 
amortization of the companies that could be deductible for income tax purposes. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill acquired from OIG, which is recognized by the 
equity method, is included as part of the investment. 
  
Under U.S. GAAP, Ecopetrol tests goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a 
reporting  unit. The  first  step  is  a  screen  for  potential  impairment  and  the  second  step  measures  the  amount  of  impairment.  Ecopetrol  did  not  perform  a 
qualitative analysis although allowed. 
  
Fair value is determined by reference to market value, if available, or by a qualified evaluator or pricing model. Determination of a fair value by a qualified 
evaluator or pricing model requires management to make assumptions and use estimates. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are 
reasonable and supportable in the existing market environment and commensurate with the risk profile of the assets valued. However, different assumptions and 
estimates could be used which would lead to different results. The valuation models used to determine the fair value of these companies are sensitive to changes 
in the underlying assumptions. For example, the prices and volumes of product sales to be achieved and the prices which will be paid for the purchase of raw 
materials are assumptions which may vary in the future. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions could lead the Company to record a goodwill impairment 
charge.

Business Combination
During 2011, Ecopetrol performed an impairment test of goodwill which showed that goodwill had been impaired in Propilco by $46,691, due to the increase in 
book value during current year as a result of a change in functional currency from Colombian pesos to US dollars. In addition during 2011 Propilco change their 
raw material suppliers due to Ecopetrol stopped providing it. New suppliers are more expensive than Ecopetrol so in the foreseeable a cost increase on Ecopetrol 
investment in Propilco is expected. 
  
 b.
  
During 2012, Ecopetrol was not incurred involved in any business combination. 
  
In August 2010, Ecopetrol entered in into a memorandum of understanding with Talisman Colombia Holdco Limited, or Talisman, a Canadian oil and gas 
Company, to acquire BP Exploration Company (Colombia) Limited, a British Petroleum subsidiary operating in Colombia; the acquired Company was renamed 
as Equion Energia Limited. After obtaining required authorizations, we completed the acquisition, in January 24, 2011, which includes assets in oil and gas 
exploration and production as well as oil transportation and gas marketing. As a result of this acquisition, we increased our participation in the ownership of the 
Ocensa pipeline from 60.00% to 72.65%, in ODC from 66% to 73% and in Oleoducto del Alto Magdalena, or OAM assets, from 83.00% to 85.12%. We also 
acquired a 10.20% interest in Transgas de Occidente. 
  
The total acquisition price, paid in cash, was US$1,596,157 thousands, Ecopetrol totals 51% ownership, the remaining 49% represents Talisman Energy Inc. 
share. The following table details the purchase price calculation (USD in thousands) as well as the Colombian peso equivalent (in millions) of the transaction 
using the effective exchange rate on the dates of the payments.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination (ASC 805) which, among other things, requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be 
measured at their acquisition date fair values. Fair value measurements and Purchase Price Allocation process was finalized in fourth quarter 2011. 
  
Pro-forma financial information is not presented as it would not be materially different from the information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
  
The following table summarizes the measurement at fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
Property, plant and equipment and reserves were measured primarily using an income approach. The fair values of the acquired oil and gas properties were 
based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements. Significant inputs included estimated resource volumes, 
assumed future production profiles, and assumptions on the timing and amount of future operating and development costs.

The net assets acquired for US$1,459,728, represent $2,682,999 pesos and goodwill of $226,592 pesos. The goodwill represents the amount of the consideration 
transferred in excess of the values assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising 
from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The fair value of the 49% share of Talisman Energy Inc. is 
US$782,117. 
  
In Colombia, the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes, thus, a deferred tax asset of $315,979 was recognized for the difference between the tax goodwill and 
the goodwill, resulting in a bargain purchase gain of $89,387 recorded in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
  
In addition, Ecopetrol increased its ownership interest in Ocensa and ODC while retaining control, as a result, the difference between the fair value and the 
carrying amount of the non-controlling interest was recognized in a decrease in additional paid-in-capital for the amount of $792,440.

Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, the companies domiciled outside of the country, regardless of its functional currency, must report in USD and 
then translated to Colombian pesos with the impact recorded as cumulative translation adjustment. 
  
For U.S. GAAP, the Company must remeasure all subsidiary financial information to its functional currency and then translate it to the reporting currency. This 
difference in methodology results in a difference in the translated amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. 
  
As such an adjustment is made to appropriately reflect amounts under translated U.S. GAAP.

In August 2011, the Company issued shares in a second public offering in Colombia. Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, all related costs of this 
issuance were expensed as well as a discount granted to shares fully paid in cash. For U.S. GAAP purposes, direct costs incurred in public offerings and cash 
discounts are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received and, consequently, a reduction in equity. An adjustment in the amount of $103,949 was recorded 
to recognize the effect of these amounts. There were not any public offering shares during 2012.

CONCENTRATIONS
EARNINGS PER SHARE
xxiii.
  
Under Colombian Government Entity GAAP, earnings per share ("EPS") are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average of both common and 
preferred shares outstanding for each period presented. However, although the Company has presented EPS under Colombian Government Entity GAAP for 
informational purposes, the presentation of EPS is not required for financial statements issued under Colombian Government Entity GAAP. The Company does 
not have any issued or outstanding preferred shares. 
  
U.S.  GAAP  requires  dual  presentation  of  basic  and  diluted  EPS  for  entities  with  complex  capital  structures,  as  well  as  a  reconciliation  of  the  basic  EPS 
calculation with the diluted EPS calculation. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average of 
common shares outstanding for the corresponding period. 
  
Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. For the years ended 
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a simple capital structure. There are no any other compensation plan involving shares. Therefore, the 
Company is not required to present diluted EPS for these years. 
  
xxiv.
  
In 2012, there were no customers in excess of 10% of total sales. In 2011, there were no customers in excess of 10% of total sales. In 2010 one customer of the 
refining segment accounted for 11.4% of total sales. One customer of the production segment and market and supply segment accounted for 10.5% from total 
sales. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of total sales in 2010. There was no exposure that affects the financial position of Ecopetrol if the 
company lost the client. 
  
The majority of  the Company’s assets and activities are located in Colombia. The financial position and  results of  operations  of those  subsidiaries located 
outside of Colombia are not material to the Company.

In  May  2011,  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2011-04  Fair  Value  Measurement  (Topic  820)  -  Amendments  to  Achieve  Common  Fair  Value  Measurement  and 
Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS, the amendments in this Update are the result of the work by the FASB and the IASB to develop common 
requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). This amendment is effective prospectively, for public entities, the amendments are 
effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Ecopetrol adopted this update in fiscal year 2012 and determined that there will 
not be any significant effect on fair value measurements or disclosures of the Company. 
  
In June 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income, the amendments require that all 
non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive 
statements in order to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other 
comprehensive income. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years 
beginning after December 15, 2011. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Deferral of the Effective Date 
for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In Accounting Standards Update No. 
2011-05. Ecopetrol adopted these updates in fiscal year 2012 and determined that no significant effect will arise in our financial statements. 
  
In October 2012, FASB issued ASU No. 2012-03 Technical Corrections and Amendments to SEC sections pursuant to SAB 114 and SEC Release 33-9250, and 
2012-04 Technical Corrections and Improvements. These ASU introduce changes related to cross references among SEC and FASB and include minor changes 
in Codification that have no impact in our accounting policies.
RECENTLY ADOPTED U.S. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Recently issued accounting standards and U.S. GAAP pronouncements
In December 2011, FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic 210) - Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, the amendments in this 
Update require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of 
those arrangements on its financial position. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, 
and interim periods within those annual periods. On January 31, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, which clarifies the scope of the offsetting disclosure 
requirements in ASU 2011-11. Under ASU 2013-01, the disclosure requirements would apply to derivative instruments accounted for in accordance with ASC 
815, including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending 
arrangements that are either offset on the balance sheet or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. However, as a result our 
analysis we don’t expect any impact at all due to we don’t have these compensation agreements. 
  
The FASB issued ASU 2013-02 in February 2013. This standard became effective for the company on January 1, 2013. ASU 2013-02 changes the presentation 
requirements of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety and their corresponding effect on net income. For 
other  significant  amounts  that  are  not  required  to  be  reclassified  in  their  entirety,  the  standard  requires  the  company  to  cross-reference  to  related  footnote 
disclosures. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the company's financial statement presentation.
F-88
SEGMENT INFORMATION
On February 28, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, which is based on a consensus reached by the EITF. The ASU requires entities to “measure obligations 
resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting 
date, as the sum of the following: a) The amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors b) Any additional 
amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.” Required disclosures include a description of the joint-and-several arrangement and the 
total outstanding amount of the obligation for all joint parties. The ASU permits entities to aggregate disclosures (as opposed to providing separate disclosures 
for each joint-and-several obligation). These disclosure requirements are incremental to the existing related-party disclosure requirements in ASC 850. The ASU 
is effective for all prior periods in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2013. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on 
the company's financial statement presentation. 
  
On March 4, 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which indicates that the entire amount of a cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) related to an entity's 
investment in a foreign entity should be released when there has been a) Sale of a subsidiary or group of net assets within a foreign entity and the sale represents 
the substantially complete liquidation of the investment in the foreign entity. b) Loss of a controlling financial interest in an investment in a foreign entity (i.e., 
the foreign entity is deconsolidated). c) Step acquisition for a foreign entity (i.e., when an entity has changed from applying the equity method for an investment 
in a foreign entity to consolidating the foreign entity). The ASU does not change the requirement to release a pro rata portion of the CTA of the foreign entity 
into earnings for a partial sale of an equity method investment in a foreign entity. the ASU is effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal 
years) beginning on or after December 15, 2013. Adoption of the standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the company's financial statement 
presentation.

The following segment information has been prepared according to ASC 280, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Financial 
information by business segment is reported in accordance with the internal reporting system under Colombian Government Entity GAAP and shows internal 
segment information that is used by the chief operating decision maker to manage and measure the performance of Ecopetrol. 
  
The financial information among segments is reported considering each business as a separate entity. Prices between segments are established by referencing 
those that would apply in an arm’s length transaction. Each segment should bear the costs and expenses required to put the product in terms of use or marketing. 
Each segment assumes its administrative expenses and all non-operational transactions related to their activity. 
  
The Company operates under the following segments, which are described as follows: 
  
Exploration and Production — this segment includes the Company’s oil & gas exploration and production activities. Revenue is derived from the sale of 
crude oil and natural gas to intercompany segments, at market prices, and to third parties. Revenue is derived from local sales of crude oil, regulated fuels, non-
regulated  fuels  and  natural  gas.  Sales  are  made  to  local  and  foreign  distributors.  Costs  include  those  costs  incurred  in  production.  Expenses  include  all 
exploration costs that are not capitalized. 
  
Refining  and  Petrochemicals  –  this  segment  includes  the  Company’s  refining  activities.  Goods  sold,  both  internally  and  to  third  parties,  include  refined 
products such as motor fuels, fuel oils and petrochemicals at market prices. This segment also includes sales of industrial services to third parties. 
  
Transportation – this segment includes the Company’s sales and costs associated with the Company’s pipelines and other transportation activities 
  
Market and Supply – this segment includes the Company’s revenues, costs and expenses associated with distribution, including distribution of purchases from 
third parties and the ANH (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos). 
  
These functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Company since these are the segments (a) that engage in business activities from which 
revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker to allocate 
resources to the segments and assess their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. Internal transfers represent sales to inter-
company segments and are recorded and presented at market prices.

NOTE: Certain amounts of the consolidated financial statements of December 2011 and December 2010 were reclassified for presentation purposes consistent 
with those of December 31, 2012. 
  
xxvii. RELATED PARTIES
  
The Company is majority owned by Colombian Government, so other state-owned companies and governmental entities are considered to be related parties. In 
addition to those transactions disclosed in Note 16 of statutory financial statements and those included in Item 7, numerous transactions with these entities exist. 
The most significant of them are disclosed below. 
  
Fuel subsidy: Selling prices of regular motor gasoline and diesel are regulated by government. However a subsidy is granted to producers to compensate the 
difference between selling price and U.S. Gulf reference market price. The amount received by the Company in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $809,773, $2,251,322 
and $740,682, respectively. In addition, in 2010, the Company recognized interests amounting to $929 regarding subsidies recorded. 
  
Purchases of hydrocarbons from ANH: The Company purchases the physical product that the ANH receives from all producers in Colombia at prices set forth 
by Law 756 of 2002 and Resolution 18-1709 of 2003, which references international prices. For more information on this transaction, please see Notes 1(s), 16 
and 25. 
  
The Company also paid in kind royalties over certain fields as set forth in Law 141 of 1994, the Administrative Agreement of Collaborative Collection of 
Liquid Hydrocarbon Royalties signed on September 16, 2010, with the ANH, and Decree 4923 of 2011. The quantities of oil and gas paid as in-kind royalties to 
the ANH for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010 were 54,095,846 boe, 59,059,539 boe and 52,518,111 boe, respectively.

xxviii. FAIR VALUE
  
Accounting  standards  for  fair  value  measurement  (ASC  820)  establish  a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  stipulate  disclosures  about  fair  value 
measurements.  The  standards  apply  to  recurring  and  nonrecurring  financial  and  nonfinancial  assets  and  liabilities  that  require  or  permit  fair-value 
measurements. Among the required disclosures is the fair-value hierarchy of inputs the Company uses to value an asset or a liability. The three levels of the fair-
value hierarchy are described as follows: 
  
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the Company, Level 1 inputs include marketable securities that are 
actively traded. 
  
Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that is observable, either directly or indirectly. For the Company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets, 
prices obtained through third-party broker quotes, and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a 
contract. 
  
Level 3: Unobservable inputs - The Company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair-value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for 
the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company uses Level 3 inputs to 
determine the fair value of certain nonrecurring nonfinancial assets. 
  
The fair value hierarchy for recurring assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2011, is as follows:

Marketable Securities: The Company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. The fair 
values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2012. 
  
Derivatives: The Company records its derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. For derivatives with identical or similar provisions as contracts that are publicly traded on a regular basis, the Company uses the market 
values of the publicly traded instruments as an input for fair-value calculations.

The Company’s derivative instruments principally include foreign exchange and refined-product (asphalt) swaps, options and forward contracts, principally 
with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values for which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and 
exchanges. 
  
The Company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market 
data, it has historically been very consistent. The Company does not materially adjust this information.

Total Fixed Assets
Total Non-Recurring Assets
  
* Transportation fixed assets were written down to their fair value of $0 in 2011 and 2012, resulting in an impairment charge of ($41,043), under U.S. GAAP, in 
2011 and ($195,903) in 2012. 
  
Impairment of “Goodwill”- During 2011 in accordance with the accounting standard for Intangibles – Goodwill Impairment Test (ASC 350 - 20), the Goodwill 
in Propilco with a carrying amount of $694,388 was written down to a fair value of $647,697, resulting in a before-tax loss of $46,691. The fair value was 
determined from internal cash-flow models, using discount rates consistent with those used by the Company to evaluate cash flows of other assets of a similar 
nature. In 2012 there is no impairment according to our analysis. 
  
Impairment of “Properties, plant and equipment” and “Natural and environmental Resources” - During 2012 and in accordance with the accounting standard 
for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (ASC 360), long-lived assets “held and used” with a carrying amount of $34,777,002 were written down to a 
fair value of $34,500,857, resulting in a before-tax loss of $276,145. The fair values were determined from internal cash-flow models, using discount rates 
consistent  with  those  used  by  the  Company  to  evaluate  cash  flows  of  other  assets  of  a  similar  nature.  The  respective  long-lived  assets  were  reviewed  for 
impairment on a field-by-field basis.

Assets and liabilities not required to be measured at fair value
The Company holds cash and cash equivalents. The instruments held are primarily time deposits and money market funds. The fair values reflect the cash that 
would  have  been  received  or  paid  if  the  instruments  were  settled  at  year-end.  Cash  equivalents  had  carrying/fair  values  of  $7,972,335  and  $7,073,550  at 
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Fair values of other financial instruments at the end of 2012 and 2011 were not material. 
  
The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivables. The carrying value of 
cash and accounts receivable reflects management’s assessment of credit risk. As of December 31, 2011 and 2012, cash and cash equivalents includes balances 
in savings and checking accounts, as well as term deposits and certificates of deposit, placed primarily with governments and financial institutions with strong 
investment grade ratings. 
  
Fair  value  of  financial  instruments:  The  estimated  fair  value  amounts  presented  below  have  been  determined  by  the  Company  using  available  market 
information  or  other  appropriate  valuation  methodologies  that  require  considerable  judgment  in  developing  and  interpreting  the  estimates  of  fair 
value. Accordingly,  the  estimates  presented  herein  are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  the  amounts  that  the  Company  could  realize  in  a  current  market 
exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  
The carrying amounts of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and current notes payable approximate fair value because they have relatively 
short-term maturities and bear interest at rates tied to market indicators, as appropriate. The Company’s long-term debt consists of debt instruments that bear 
interest at fixed or variable rates tied to market indicators.

xxix.
  
In accordance with the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Accounting Standards Codification 932 and the ASU-
2010-03  “Oil  and  Gas  reserve  Estimation  and  Disclosures”  Rule,  this  section  provides  supplemental  information  on  oil  and  gas exploration and  producing 
activities of the Company. The information included in items (i) through (iii) provides historical cost information pertaining to costs incurred in exploration, 
property  acquisitions  and  development,  capitalized  costs  and  results  of  operations.  The  information  included  in  items  (iv)  and  (v)  presents  information  on 
Ecopetrol’s estimated net proved reserve quantities, standardized measure of estimated discounted future net cash flows related to proved reserves, and changes 
in estimated discounted future net cash flows. 
  
The following information corresponds to Ecopetrol’s oil and gas producing activities at December 31 2012, 2011 and 2010 in direct and joint operations. 
  
Under  the  SEC  final  rule,  optional  disclosure  of  possible  and  probable  reserves  is  allowed.  But,  the  Company  opted  not  to  do  so.  Ecopetrol  estimated  its 
reserves without considering non-traditional resources.

Results of operations for producing activities
  
Note: Effects of naphtha addition are included into results of operations in the table above. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 the additional total barrels (million boe) 
were 19.4, 15.4 and 12.2.
(1) Production costs are lifting costs incurred to operate and maintain productive wells and related equipment and facilities, including costs such as operating 
labor, materials, supplies, and fuel consumed in operations and the costs of operating natural gas liquids plants. In addition includes accretion expense 
related to the asset retirement obligations that were recognized during 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounting approximately $150,754, $ 133,796 and $ 151,516 
respectively. The Company’s results of operations from oil and gas producing activities for the years ending December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are shown 
above.
In accordance with ASC 410-20, the expense related to asset retirement obligations that were recognized during 2012, 2011 and 2010 in depreciation, 
depletion and amortization amounted approximately to $131,342, $28,676 and $180,484 respectively.

(3) Corresponds to transportation costs and naphtha that are not part of the Company´s lifting cost.
(4) Exploration expenses include the costs of geological and geophysical activities as well as the non-productive exploratory wells.
(5) Corresponds to administration and marketing expenses.
  
During 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, the Company transferred approximately 31%, 34% and 37% of its crude oil and gas production; (percentages based 
on  the  value  sales  in  Colombian  pesos)  to  intercompany  business  units.  Base  on  volume,  those  transfers  were  39%,  42%  and  47%  respectively  (including 
Reficar). The intercompany transfers were recorded at values equal to the Company’s market prices. 
  
Table iv – Reserve information 
  
The reserve information presented in this section is based on the definitions and rules used for U.S. GAAP purposes. The estimates for proved oil and gas 
reserves used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements were prepared by Ecopetrol’s engineers, audited in a 99% by the “external engineers”. 
  
Reserves are first estimated internally. This process is supervised and coordinated by the corporate manager of reservoirs, a geologist who holds a master’s 
degree in geology and has more than 20 years of experience in projects associated with reservoir characterization and development, estimation, and reporting of 
reserves. The employees involved in the reserves process meet the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or SPE, qualifications for reserves estimators. Internally 
estimated reserves are submitted to an external audit process, which was conducted by the External Engineers (Ryder Scott, DeGolyer and MacNaughton and 
Gaffney, Cline & Associates). These firms have audited 99% of our total net proved reserves for 2012, 2011, and 2010. According to our corporate policy, we 
report the reserves values obtained from the External Engineers. 
  
The reserves process ends when the Reserves Directorate consolidates the results and present them to the Reserves Committee, whose members are the Chief 
Financial  Officer,  the  Exploration  and  Production  Executive  Vice-President  and  the  Vice-President  of  Strategy.  Finally,  results  are  presented  to  the  Audit 
Committee of the Board of Directors and approved by the Board of Directors. 
  
Information concerning the technical definitions used for the estimated proved reserves is included in this annual report. The information provided in this annual 
report  about  our  2012  net  proved  reserves  is  based  on  the  2012  audited  reserve  reports  for  99%  of  our  total  reserves  prepared  by  experts  under  the  SEC 
definitions  and  rules.  The  remaining  1%  corresponds  to  calculations  made  by  us  internally  using  SEC  definitions  and  rules  set  forth  in  Rule  4-10(a)  of 
Regulation  S-X  and  the  disclosure  guidelines  contained  in  the  SEC’s  “Modernization  of  Oil  and  Gas  Reporting”  final  rule  dated  December  31,  2008  and 
effective as of January 1, 2010.
F-98
Our 2012 crude oil and natural gas net proved reserves include reserves from production assets located in the United States, Perú and Colombia regarding the 
Hocol and Equion’s assets. 
  
The Company’s proved reserves as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 are based on the SEC average price methodology for U.S. GAAP purposes, which 
mirrors the average price methodology used by the Company in Colombia during this period. 
  
Future development, abandonment and production costs were computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing, producing, and abandoning 
proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs. Future income taxes were computed by applying statutory tax rates to the estimated 
net pre-tax cash flows after consideration of tax basis and tax credits and carry forwards. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10% mid period 
discount factors. This discounting requires a year-by-year estimate of when the future expenditures will be incurred and when the reserves will be produced. 
  
The arbitrary valuation methodology prescribed under ASU 2010-03 and ASU-2010-14 requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development 
and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and should not be relied upon as an indication of the Company’s future cash flows 
or the value of its oil and gas reserves. 
  
Ecopetrol used deterministic methods that are commonly used internationally to estimate reserves. These methods have some uncertainty in degradation, and 
thus, the estimates should not be interpreted as being exact amounts. However, the technology used to estimate reserves is considered reliable. 
  
Estimates of reserves were prepared by geological and engineering methods commonly used in the oil industry. The method or combination of methods used in 
the analysis of each reserve was adopted from experience with similar reserves, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data and production 
history. 
  
The majority of the producing proved reserves were estimated by applying appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In analyzing decline 
curves, reserves were estimated by calculating economic limits that are based on current economic conditions. In certain cases, where the methods previously 
employed could not be used, reserves were estimated by analogy with similar reserves where more complete data was available. 
  
Most of the Company’s activities and reserves are located in Colombia. The Colombian Nation is the owner of all mineral interests located in Colombia. The 
Company and, by extension of joint association contracts, its partners, are given the right to explore, develop, produce and sell those reserves, but do not own 
them.  The  reserve  quantities  and  their  standardized  measure,  presented  in  the  following  tables,  represent  those  reserves  and  their  estimated  value  that  the 
Company has the right to extract and sell. 
  
The information provided does not represent management’s estimate of the Company’s expected future cash flows or value of proved oil and gas reserves. 
Estimates of proved reserve quantities involve uncertainty and change over time as new information becomes available. 
  
The table below sets forth the Company’s total proved oil and gas reserves together with their changes therein as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 
2011 and 2010. The estimates (oil in million barrels, gas in billion cf, gas converted to million barrels at 5.7 billion cf per million barrels) using the SEC rules in 
effect for each respective year.

The Company’s revisions, on a consolidated basis, during 2012 amounted to 44.2 million boe, corresponding primarily to the following: 
  
•
Pauto Field: Sales natural gas liquids , or NGL volumes associated with our gas processing plant , better production performance, and new development 
projects focused in gas conversion activities and drilling, representing a 19.4 million boe increase.
Caño Limon Field: Better production performance representing a 13.9 million boe increase
•
  
The revisions described above represented 75% of the additions to reserves revisions in 2012, while the revisions with respect to the remaining 10.9 million boe 
resulted from varying increases and decreases from a variety of fields like Apiay, Quifa and others. 
  
The Company’s improved recovery during 2012 amounted to 65.3 million boe, which corresponded mainly to new proved areas under waterflooding in the La 
Cira-Infantas, Casabe and Tibu fields. 
  
The Company’s extensions and discoveries during 2012 amounted to 142.8 million boe, which corresponded to 16.2 million boe of newly discovered fields and 
126.6  million  boe  of  extensions  of  proved  acreage.  The  newly  discovered  fields  corresponded  mainly  to  Ecopetrol  S.A.’s  Cajua,  Chipiron  fields  Hocol’s 
Mamey-Bonga fields and Ecopetrol America’s Dalmatian field. 
  
In terms of extensions of proved acreage (126.6 million boe), 70% was associated with activities in the followings fields: 
  
25.5 million boe related to the Castilla Field where the company´s plan is to perform additional drilling activities in order to cover new proved areas, 47.8 
million boe was associated with new sales agreements enabling increases the future gas sales in the Cupiagua field and 15.4 million boe related to new proved 
areas in the Quifa and Chichimene fields. The remaining 30% is distributed in smaller changes in several Company fields.

Tariff per Barrel, by 365 days; and
(ii)      It  has  liquid  net  assets  1.5  times  greater  than  the  annual  transportation  commitment  assumed  by  the  assignee,  calculated  by

from the Contract for all purposes of Article 893 of the Commercial Code.

authorization of the assignment is requested.

“ANNEX B – CONTRACTED CAPACITY”
ANNEX B
DETERMINATION AND ALLOCATION OF CONTRACTED CAPACITY
1.       Calculation of Contracted Capacity 
  
(i)     Before  the Completion of  the  Delta 35  Project,  for purposes  of  determining  the number of  barrels  forming  part of  the  Original Shipper’s Contracted 
Capacity, the following Effective Capacity per segment was used as a basis: Segment 0 – 198,000 Barrels average per day on a monthly basis; Segment 1: 
575,000 Barrels average per day on a monthly basis; Segment 2: 575,000 Barrels average per day on a monthly basis; Segment 3: 375,000 Barrels average per 
day on a monthly basis; and for the Coveñas Terminal, the receipt of 375,000 Barrels average per day on a monthly basis coming from Segment 3, provided the 
Withdrawal Conditions to which the Coveñas Terminal Regulations for Technical Operating Conditions and Annex C refer are met. 
  
(ii)    If the Delta 35 Project is executed, once Completion of the Delta 35 Project occurs, the Carrier shall notify the Original Shipper in writing of: (a) its New 
Contracted Capacity expressed in thousands of Barrels average per day on a monthly basis in the next Effective Capacity per Segment average per day on a 
monthly basis, from which the 20% for the Preferential Right in favor of National Oil has already been deducted: Segment 0, 198,000 Barrels per day; Segment 
1: 603,000 Barrels per day; Segment 2: 603,000 Barrels per day; Segment 3: 407,000 Barrels per day; and for the Coveñas Terminal, the receipt of 407,000 
Barrels average per day on a monthly basis coming from Segment 3, provided the Withdrawal Conditions to which the Coveñas Terminal Regulations for 
Technical Operating Conditions \and Annex C refer are met; (b) the date as of which the additional capacity provided by the Delta 35 project will be available. 
If the Crude Oil nominations in exercise of the Preferential Right in favor of National Oil are less than 20% of the Delta 35 Project’s Effective Capacity, such 
capacity shall be part of the Available Capacity. 
  
(iii)   The Parties understand that if, either temporarily or permanently, the Effective Capacity before or after the Completion of the Delta 35 Project is greater 
than the capacity per Segment established in this annex for any reason, this situation shall not increase or reduce the Original Shipper’s Contracted Capacity. 
The difference between the Effective Capacity and the sum of the Original Shippers’ Contracted Capacities per Segment shall be part of the Available Capacity.
  
(iv)   The Effective Capacity per Segment and therefore the Contracted Capacity of each Original Shipper was chiefly determined assuming: (i) the Design 
Capacity (ii) the use of Drag Reduction Agents (DRA), and (iii) that the Crude Oil transported by the Oil Pipeline is no more than 80% heavy Crude Oil, 
according to the specifications established in Table No.1 of this Annex and no less than 20% light or intermediate Crude Oils according to the Specifications 
established in Table No. 2 of this Annex.
23
(v)  If the volume of heavy Crude Oil delivered or to be delivered exceeds the percentage limits determined above, the Effective Capacity of the Oil Pipeline 
may decrease, proportionally reducing the Original Shipper’s Contracted Capacity. In the event that an increase in the quantity of heavy Crude Oil delivered or 
to be delivered reduces the Oil Pipeline’s Effective Capacity in a given Operating Month, affecting the Contracted Capacity of the Original Shippers, the Carrier 
shall have the right, as long as the reduction in Effective Capacity for this reason lasts, to reduce the Contracted Capacity of the Original Shipper that delivers or 
plans to deliver more than 80% heavy Crude Oil, or if there are two or more Original Shippers who deliver or plan to deliver heavy Crude Oil, prorated among 
them, in a proportion equal to that needed to ensure that the Contracted Capacity of all other Original Shippers is not affected. 
  
(vi)   Save agreement between the Parties, the Original Shipper undertakes to withdraw the number of Barrels exceeding its Contracted Capacity in Segment 3 
with respect to Segment 2 at the Vasconia Station. Breach of this obligation shall lead to the consequences established in this Contract and entitle the Carrier to 
receive from the Original Shipper, in Segment 2, a quantity of Crude Oil equal to that not withdrawn at the Vasconia Station, save if there is Available Capacity 
in Segment 3 that can be allocated to it in accordance with the Nomination Process. 
  
(vii)  The Effective Capacity of Segment 0 mentioned in (i) above prior to the signature date of the Supplementary Agreement is limited to 68,000 Barrels a day 
because Crude Oil with high water content is being transported, which will be suspended insofar as the Original Shipper or any Third Party needs to transport 
high volumes of Crude Oil by Segment 0. 
  
(viii)  The Original Shipper recognizes that the Effective Capacity by Segment mentioned in (i) and (ii) may be temporarily affected during the implementation 
of the Delta 35 Project and all other projects initiated by the Carrier in connection with the need to increase the Effective Capacity of the Oil Pipeline, since such 
projects will require scheduled shutdowns of the Oil Pipeline that will affect the Service Factor based on which the Effective Capacity mentioned in (i) and (ii) 
above was calculated. Without prejudice to the above, the Carrier shall make all reasonable efforts to see that the Service Factor is affected as little as possible 
in connection with the new projects it initiates. 
  
(ix)  The Parties understand that in order to comply with the Scheduled Capacity, the Original Shipper will have to adjust the Deliveries to the minimum and 
maximum daily limits indicated to it by the Carrier, after having previously coordinated with the Original Shipper insofar as possible. 
  
2.           Preferential Right 
For purposes of allocating the Preferential Right, the Carrier shall observe the following rules:
24
(i)   For all Crude Oil nominations made in exercise of the Preferential Right. For Effective Capacity equal to or less than the Effective Capacity mentioned in 
subparagraph  1  (i)  of  this  Annex,  the  Crude  Oil  nominated  in  exercise  of  the  Preferential  Right  shall  be  transported  through  the  Contracted  Capacity  of 
Ecopetrol S.A. as Original Shipper or of the heirs or assignees of said Contracted Capacity. 
  
(ii)   The  Crude  Oil  nominated  in  exercise  of  the  Preferential  right  with  respect  to  an  Effective  Capacity  greater  than  the  Effective  Capacity  mentioned  in 
subparagraph 1  (i) of  this Annex  shall  first affect the Effective  Capacity exceeding the  Effective Capacity mentioned  in 1 (i),  up  to  twenty  percent  (20%) 
thereof, and subsequently the Contracted Capacity of Ecopetrol S.A. as Original Shipper or the heirs and assignees of said Contracted Capacity pursuant to the 
above paragraph. 
  
3.    Allocation of Contracted Capacity 
  
The Carrier shall make its Contracted Capacity for each Segment available to the Original Shipper observing the following rules for allocating the capacity: 
  
(i)    Nominations for transporting Cusiana Crude Oil made by the Original Shipper until reaching the Contracted Capacity; 
  
(ii)   Other Nominations made by the Original Shipper until reaching its Contracted Capacity. 
  
4. Unused Contracted Capacity 
  
The Contracted Capacity that has not been nominated by the Original Shipper for a given Operating Month shall be part of the Oil Pipeline’s Available Capacity 
in the respective Operating Month. 
  
5.   Quality specifications for determining Effective Capacity

Clause Four: Annex C shall read as follows:
“ANNEX C”
PROCEDURE FOR USE OF THE COVEÑAS TERMINAL
1.            For purposes of the use of the Coveñas Terminal, the rules and procedures established in this annex, as well as in the document entitled “OCENSA 
COVEÑAS TERMINAL OFF-TAKE PROCEDURES” shall be taken into account. 
  
2.            With respect to the Over/Under Procedure, which shall only apply to the inventories in the Coveñas Terminal, the Carrier shall not assign a Lay Day 
under this procedure when the time period required by the Original Shipper to return the Crude Oil that has was loaned to it for loading purposes by another 
Original Shipper is more than 120 days. To calculate the above time period, the Carrier shall take into account the transportation plan for the next 5 months 
prepared by the respective Original Shipper, as well as the term of the Contract. 
  
3.            If 180 days have elapsed since the date on which the Crude Oil was loaned and the Original Shipper has not returned it, the Original Shipper shall 
proceed  to  pay  for  the  Crude  Oil  not  returned,  as  well  as  the  costs  and  expenses  that  must  be  defrayed  for  taxes,  to  the  parties  indicated  by  the  Carrier. 
Therefore,  the  Original  Shipper  henceforth  accepts  that  the  number  of  Barrels  that  have  been  loaned  to  it  shall  be  those  established  by  the  Carrier  in  the 
communication informing it of the payment obligation for which it is responsible. The price to be paid by the Original Shipper per Barrel not returned shall be 
the Declared Value or the price of the Crude Oil on the payment day calculated in the terms established for setting the Declared Value, whichever is greater. In 
the event of late payment, the Original Shipper shall recognize and pay delinquent interest at an annual rate of Libor +4. 
  
Once  the  payment  is  made,  the  Original  Shipper  shall  inform  the Carrier  with  respect  thereto  so  that  said  situation  is  reflected  in  the  Coveñas  Terminal’s 
inventories. 
  
The Original Shipper recognizes that the Carrier shall not be liable for the return of or payment for the Crude Oil, as applicable. 
  
4.       Taking into account that the Coveñas Terminal is a public port, the rules established in this annex, as well as in the Off Take Procedures, shall only be in 
force until the Coveñas Terminal Regulations for Technical Operating Conditions are approved by the National Infrastructure Agency (hereinafter, ANI) and/or 
the Carrier sets new rules in this respect. Therefore, the Original Shipper understands and accepts that the Carrier is autonomous in determining the rules that 
will govern the use of the Coveñas Terminal.
27
That being the case, this Annex shall be replaced insofar as the Carrier updates or issues the applicable regulations for use of the Coveñas Terminal, including 
but not limited to the Coveñas Terminal Regulations for Technical Operating Conditions. For each update of this annex, the Carrier shall send the Original 
Shipper a notification as soon as possible, in which it shall include: (i) the date as of which the modification will apply, (ii) the modifications made and, if 
applicable (iii) a copy of the resolution in which the ANI authorized the modification of the Coveñas Terminal Regulations for Technical Operating Conditions. 
  
Clause Five: Nothing indicated in this Supplementary Agreement shall be understood as a modification of the document entitled “Agreement for Capacity 
Release” signed on October 13, 2009 between the Ocensa Shareholders, the Original Shippers and Ocensa, as it was modified on December 11, 2009. 
  
Clause  Six: The Parties understand  and  accept  that this  Supplementary  Agreement  does  not  imply a  novation  of the Contract  or  a  break  in the continuity 
thereof. 
  
Clause Seven: For purposes of implementing the Supplementary Agreement, the Original Shipper and the Carrier shall take into account that:
1.     First Nomination under this Supplementary Agreement.
The first Nomination made after the signing date of this Supplementary Agreement (hereinafter, the “First Nomination”) shall be made on next 
suitable date in the nomination process, as established in the Carrier’s Manual, at which time the Contracted Capacity to which this Supplementary Agreement 
refers shall enter into effect.
In accordance with the above, the first Operating Month in which Oil nominated based on the Contracted Capacity will be transported shall be the
second calendar month following the signing date of this Supplementary Agreement.
2.      Tariff
a) From January 18 to January 31, 2013
For  this  period,  the  Tariff  Regulations  shall  apply,  included  as  Annex  C  of  the  Contract  before  the  modification  introduced  by  this
Supplementary Agreement, only with regard to the tariff and the recognition and payment of debts.
b) As of February 1, 2013
The Tariff to which this Supplementary Agreement refers shall apply to the volumes scheduled to be transported as of February first (1), 2013.
28
3.           Pending financial issues
and 2012 (hereinafter the “Outstanding Invoices”), such sums of money may be paid up to January 31, 2014.
a)             In relation to the balances pending payment by the Original Shipper on December 31, 2012 in connection with the invoices for 2011
With respect to the balances, compensatory interest shall be generated and paid based on the current bank interest rate certified by the 
Financial Superintendence if payment is made in Colombian pesos, or the annual Libor rate +2 if payment is made in Dollars. In no case shall it exceed the 
lending interest rate established by Colombian law, or be less than the Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. Interest shall accrue as of January 
1, 2013 and the value thereof shall be invoiced monthly by the Carrier and paid by the Original Shipper in the terms established in section 4.2 of the Contract.
In any case, should a situation arise involving the Carrier’s cash requirements, the Carrier shall have the right to request payment of 
all or part of the Outstanding Invoices before the expiration of the term granted for that purpose. For such cases, it shall give notice of said situation to the

Gases de Barrancabermeja (UPBM-10). 
  
For Exit Point 2, the meters installed in Centragas for the high pressure line (FQI-3-01 and FQI-3-04), Meriléctrica meter (UPBM-12) and gas meter to the 
Central-Eastern gas pipeline (UPBM-02). 
  
In addition, if the SHIPPER needs to increase its consumption capacity (both pressure and volume increase), it shall assume all the costs required to carry out 
the Exit Point and Connection. 
  
PARAGRAPH 1: The Parties agree that the schedules and the Nomination process may be modified in the future, based on the provisions established by the 
CREG on the matter. 
  
5.        CALCULATION FOR VARIATIONS  
  
During the first twenty (20) calendar days of each month following the Deliveries Month, the TRANSPORTER shall calculate the SHIPPER’S Output Variation 
for each Gas Day of the Deliveries Month. 
  
6.        COMPENSATION FOR VARIATIONS 
  
When the cases referred to in this paragraph arise, the TRANSPORTER may notify and coordinate with the SHIPPER the operating corrections necessary in 
order to rectify the Shipper’s Output Variation. Compliance with the agreement will exonerate the SHIPPER from compensations. 
  
In the event that the SHIPPER fails to apply the operating corrections to the satisfaction of the TRANSPORTER, it shall apply the compensation set forth 
below: 
  
For each hour of the Deliveries Month Gas Day, when the SHIPPER’S Output Variation exceeds 4% of the Confirmed Amount of Energy, the SHIPPER shall 
pay a charge equivalent to five (5) times the Reference Capacity Daily Charge multiplied by the volume equivalent to the excess in the Output Variation in 
excess of 4%. 
  
These payments shall not grant the SHIPPER the right to incur Output Variations. 
  
When the CREG approves the tables of Compensation for Output Variations caused by the SHIPPER, they shall begin to be applied and shall replace those 
initially stated. Said compensation shall be calculated daily and shall be invoiced monthly, as set forth in paragraph 3 of Chapter IV.

7.          BALANCE ACCOUNT 
  
7.1         During the first twenty (20) calendar days of each month following the Deliveries Month, the TRANSPORTER shall calculate the Power Imbalances 
for the Deliveries Month. The Energy Balance Account shall be updated daily in accordance with the measurements made by the TRANSPORTER. 
  
7.2         The SHIPPER undertakes to supply to the TRANSPORTER the information requested from it by the latter when it considers necessary and which the 
SHIPPER is able to supply, for the purpose of calculating the Imbalances. At the discretion of the TRANSPORTER, this information shall be provided in 
electronic format. 
  
7.3         The TRANSPORTER shall maintain the SHIPPER’S Balance Account duly updated. 
  
8.          COMPENSATION FOR IMBALANCES 
  
In the event that the Power Imbalance exceeds 0.5% in the Deliveries Month, the TRANSPORTER may first seek to reach an agreement with the SHIPPER 
with respect to the accounting procedures to be followed, in order to handle, reconcile and eliminate the Power Imbalances. In the event that said situation is not 
rectified to the satisfaction of the TRANSPORTER, the TRANSPORTER may require the SHIPPER to pay, by way of indemnity, a sum equal to the excess 
multiplied by the Reference Capacity Daily Charge. 
  
Such payment shall not grant the SHIPPER the right to incur Power Imbalances. 
  
PARAGRAPH I. The amounts paid for each Deliveries Month by virtue of Indemnities owed by the SHIPPER shall be invoiced monthly together with the 
amount of the Service, as set forth in paragraph 3 of Chapter IV. 
  
9.          PRESSURE AT THE ENTRY AND EXIT POINTS 
  
9.1         The TRANSPORTER shall make available to the SHIPPER the Gas at the Exit Point at the minimum defined pressure of 350 Psig. 
  
9.2         From the Exit  Point onward, the SHIPPER shall take  the  measures necessary  to guarantee  its capacity  to  take from  the system  the  volume of  the 
transportation capacity contracted. 
  
9.3         The SHIPPER, through its producer, shall make the necessary arrangements for the Gas to enter the system at the Entry Point without exceeding the 
maximum operating pressure defined as 1200 psig. The TRANSPORTER may decline to receive Gas which is not in compliance with this pressure requirement.
  
10.        NON-COMPLIANCE DUE TO LOW PRESSURE OR POOR GAS QUALITY AT THE EXIT POINT 
  
In the event that the pressure at the Exit Point is lower than the minimum pressure defined in paragraph 9 of this Chapter, and for this reason the SHIPPER is 
unable to receive the amount of Power confirmed, or in the event that the SHIPPER elects to exercise the right not to receive the Gas in accordance with 
paragraph 1.3 of Chapter III, the procedure below shall be followed: 
  
10.1       The TRANSPORTER  shall not make any charge whatsoever  for the  difference  between the Authorized Volume and the Volume Received by  the 
SHIPPER.

rate  to the SHIPPER  as of  the  date  on which  it  starts  to apply said  rate  to third parties, notwithstanding  that the parties  may  execute agreements between 
themselves or with third parties to promote market growth, in which event said conditions shall not affect the rates of this contract. 
  
2.6           In  the  event  that  the  TRANSPORTER’S  Policy  for  the  interruptible  transportation  establishes  interruptible  transportation  rates  lower  than  those 
agreed to in this contract, the TRANSPORTER shall adjust the charges to the SHIPPER, deducting from the fixed charges to be paid by the SHIPPER the 
amount  of  the  income  obtained  by  the  TRANSPORTER  under  the  interruptible  transportation  modality  and  for  a  capacity  equivalent  to  the  lesser  amount 
between the capacity not sold by the SHIPPER and the capacity sold as interruptible by the TRANSPORTER. In order to comply with the provisions set forth in 
this paragraph, the SHIPPER undertakes to publish daily in the TRANSPORTER’S Electronic Operations Bulletin (BEO) its surpluses of capacity for resale.

3.2         The invoice shall be based on the sum total of the Daily Amounts Requested and Accepted by the SHIPPER at the Entry Point. 
  
3.3         The  invoice  must  contain  the  minimum  requirements  set  forth  in  the  Single  Code  on  Natural  Gas  Transportation  (RUT)  and,  once  issued  by  the 
TRANSPORTER, shall be enforceable per se. 
  
3.4         For the purposes of invoicing the solidarity contribution factor to the SHIPPER, the TRANSPORTER shall use the information for the month 
immediately prior to the Delivery Month, and shall make the respective adjustments to the billing the following month. 
  
3.5         For all the purposes of this Contract, the invoice shall be considered delivered by the TRANSPORTER to the SHIPPER on the date on which it is 
forwarded electronically or by fax to the fax number recorded for that purpose in Section I – ESTF. The TRANSPORTER shall simultaneously submit the 
original invoices with their respective supporting documentation by registered mail, not later than the calendar day following the fax transmission. Failure to 
send the original invoice within the established timeframe shall result in an extension of the payment term for a period equal to that of the delay. 
  
4.          PAYMENTS 
  
The SHIPPER shall pay the invoice in the place and manner that the TRANSPORTER designates for that purpose, in Colombian pesos, no more than fifteen 
(15) calendar days after the invoice is delivered. 
  
If the SHIPPER disputes an invoice or part of it or one of its line items before the payment due date, the SHIPPER may abstain from paying the disputed sum, 
stating the grounds for the rejection. If the Parties reach an agreement regarding the disputed amount within the next eight (8) business days, and if the dispute is 
resolved in  favor of the TRANSPORTER, the SHIPPER shall pay the amount owed not later than the ninth (9th) business day following resolution of the 
dispute, with the corresponding penalty interest, if appropriate.

5.          DEFAULT 
  
If the Party obligated to do so does not pay on the dates fixed for that purpose any sum owed to the other Party pursuant to the provisions of this Contract, it 
shall pay Default Interest. Default Interest shall be applied to the balance of the sum owed in pesos and in proportion to the time transpired from the date on 
which the payment should have been made, according to the stipulations herein, until the date on which the payment is made. 
  
When the SHIPPER defaults, the TRANSPORTER shall have the right to suspend the Service as of the eleventh (11th) calendar day of the default. If the default 
continues for fifty (50) more calendar days, the TRANSPORTER may terminate the Contract and enforce the guarantees, should this Contract be assigned by 
the SHIPPER. 
  
PARAGRAPH: The debtor shall be considered in default without the need for any formal notice. 
  
6.          ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE CONTRACT 
  
It is considered equal to the Contracted Firm Capacity multiplied by the Fixed Charges that compensate the investment plus the Contracted Firm Capacity 
multiplied by the variable charges for three hundred sixty-five (365) days and the Contracted Firm Capacity for the AO&M expenses, expressed in U.S. dollars 
and in Colombian pesos ($). 
  
7.          DISCOUNTS ON THE FIXED CHARGE 
  
7.1         If during the Performance Period of the Contract the Excusable Events, Force Majeure, or Acts of God set forth in Chapter II, number 21, occur, or the 
TRANSPORTER fails to deliver to the SHIPPER the Authorized Volume in an amount equal to the Contracted Firm Capacity, the TRANSPORTER shall give 
the SHIPPER a discount, in dollars and pesos, for each Gas Day the events or failures are in effect, according to the following formula: 
  
Discount in dollars = [Contracted Firm Capacity (kcf/d) – Volume Received by the SHIPPER (kcf/d)] x (Fixed Charge (USD/kcf/d-year) / 365 days) 
  
Discount in pesos = [Contracted Firm Capacity (kcf/d) – Volume Received by the SHIPPER (kcf/d)] x (Charge for AO&M (Pesos ($)/kcf/d-year) / 365 days). 
  
7.2         If the TRANSPORTER refuses to accept delivery of the SHIPPER’s Gas or restricts the SHIPPER’s deliveries based on the right of refusal in Chapter 
III, paragraph 1, regarding Gas Quality, the TRANSPORTER shall not be obligated to provide any Fixed Charge discount. 
  
7.3         Likewise, in the event the Contract obligations are suspended under the terms of Chapter III, paragraph 11, by either of the Parties, this shall give rise 
to a discount on the fixed charges corresponding to both pesos and dollars, with regard to the capacity that the TRANSPORTER did not have available, applied 
as follows: 
  
Discount in dollars = [Contracted Firm Capacity (kcf/d) – Available Firm Volume that the TRANSPORTER reported during the maintenance (kcf/d)] x (Fixed 
Charge (USD/kcf/d-year) / 365 days) 
  
Discount in pesos = [Contracted Firm Capacity (kcf/d) – Available Firm Volume that the TRANSPORTER reported during the maintenance (kcf/d)] x (Charge 
for AO&M (Pesos ($)/kcf/d-year) / 365 days).

The master instruments used in the verification activities must have a margin of error at least two (2) times smaller than that of the instruments to be evaluated. 
In  addition,  they  must  be  included  in  a  measurement  assurance  plan  to  guarantee  their  reliability,  bearing  in  mind  the  masters  are  used  to  determine  the 
maximum calibration interval. 
  
2. Energy Measurement 
  
2.1 Entry Points 
All the Entry Points must have an on-line gas chromatograph, as set forth in paragraph 5.2.1 of the RUT. 
  
The  chromatograph  and  the  sampler  must  be  selected,  installed,  and  operated  in  a  manner  that  guarantees  the  capture  of  representative  samples  and  the 
performance of analysis with a low margin of error for measurements, pursuant to the applicable technical references in effect. 
  
The on-line chromatograph must be integrated with the flow computer for the purposes of precise volume and energy measurement. 
  
The chromatograph calibration gas must be a Certified Reference Material, and its analytical characteristics shall be better than the chromatograph’s technical 
specifications in order to allow its use as a master standard. 
  
2.2 Exit Points 
  
A monthly adjustment of the composition shall be performed at the exit points that operate with fixed chromatography. The composition shall be obtained from 
chromatographic sampling and analysis or via the monthly average taken from a nearby chromatograph that measures the same current with a negligible time 
difference regarding the period between adjustments. 
  
The installation of on-line chromatographs at the exit points, where required, by mutual agreement of the parties, shall be the responsibility of the shipper and 
shall be subject to the criteria indicated above for the Entry Points. 
  
3. Volumetric Measurement 
  
For  the  measurement  of  gas  volume,  only  those  meters  that  are  recognized  for  use  in  custody  transfer  operations  and  are  supported  by  a  standard  and/or 
recognized technical recommendation shall be used. 
  
The instruments for measurement of magnitudes other than volume (for example: pressure, temperature, density) but that influence the measurement result must 
be integrated with the flow computer. 
  
Orifice  plate  measurement  systems  must  comply  with  the  most  recent  version  of  AGA  Report  No.  3  and  have  a  plate-holder  element  that  allows  the 
performance of inspections and/or replacements without interruption of the flow. All plate measurement systems must have an inspection certificate issued by a 
recognized body that guarantees system compliance with the tolerances expressed in the standard. 
  
Ultrasonic meters must have multiple trajectories and be calibrated in a recognized laboratory, under conditions similar to operating conditions. Sufficient space 
shall be provided for their installation, operation, and maintenance, and the tools necessary for on-the-spot removal of the transducers shall also be provided, in 
order to internally inspect, clean, and/or replace them in case of defect. Likewise, they must comply with the most recent version of AGA Report No. 9.

Turbine-type meters must be calibrated in a recognized laboratory, under conditions similar to operating conditions. The meter must have an oil injector or 
pump that guarantees periodic lubrication of the bearings. Likewise, they must comply with the most recent version of AGA Report No. 7. 
  
Mass meters must be calibrated in a recognized laboratory. When technically justifying the appropriateness of their use, it must be shown that the effect of the 
density  variations  on  the  volume  calculation  from  the  mass  does  not  affect  the  measurement  more  than  the  ±1%  margin  of  error  indicated  in  the  RUT. 
Otherwise, installation of equipment for ongoing determination of the specific gravity of the gas shall be required, integrated with the flow computer. Likewise, 
they must comply with the most recent version of AGA Report No. 11. 
  
Rotameters may be calibrated to atmospheric pressure. A pressure gauge shall be installed on the rotameters for measurement of differential pressure, between 
the meter inlet and outlet. Likewise, they must comply with the most recent version of ANSI standard B109.3. 
  
Diaphragm meters shall not be used as it is not possible to diagnose their performance throughout their useful life. The use of rotameters is recommended in 
their stead. 
  
All of the measurement systems must have full bore and by-pass valves that facilitate operation and the execution of calibration, maintenance, and inspection 
activities. Likewise, the space and conditions around the system must be safe and of an appropriate size for access to the system and for the execution of future 
inspections and maintenance. 
  
Measurement systems that may fail due to excessive acceleration in their components (for example: turbine, rotameter, diaphragm, mass, etc.) must have a 
restriction element for protection in case of over-revolution. 
  
The method to guarantee transparency in measurements that have a by-pass without an alternate meter shall be decided by mutual agreement. The installation of 
seals, blind plates, or electronic locks integrated with the SCADA is recommended. 
  
After a repair, the parties shall assess whether it is necessary for the meter to be recalibrated in a recognized laboratory. Should this be necessary, the system 
owner shall be responsible for the associated costs. 
  
Should operating conditions change from the time when the measurement system was originally designed, causing its performance to not comply satisfactorily 
with the required measurement capacity and/or margin of error, the system shall be redesigned or replaced by one that satisfies the new operating condition. The 
system owner shall be responsible for the associated costs. 
  
The  flow  computer  must  be  approved  pursuant  to  its  compliance  with  the  most  recent  edition  of  API  MPMS  standard  21.1  and  be  compatible  with  the 
Transporter’s  SCADA  System  communication  protocol.  Therefore,  the  parties  shall  evaluate  the  communication  protocol  with  the  most  appropriate  flow 
computer, among which shall be considered Bristol Babcock’s BSAP. 
  
4. Measurement of Other Variables 
  
4.1 Temperature 
  
Flow  temperature  must  be  determined  according  to  the  applicable  technical  references.  The  determination  of  error  and  the  measurement  margin  of  error 
associated with the flow temperature include the unit made up of the sensor and the transmitter or analog-digital converter, forming a single loop.

4.2 Pressure 
  
Static pressure must be determined according to the applicable technical references. Should absolute pressure transmitters not be used, it shall be determined 
from the average atmospheric pressure of the site where the measurement system will be installed, using the best and most up-to-date resources for its precise 
characterization (for example: in-situ monitoring, correlation by altitude, GPS, etc.). 
  
4.3 Compressibility Factor 
  
The gas compressibility factor shall be determined using the methods described in the most recent edition of AGA Report No. 8. 
  
4.4 Speed of Sound in Natural Gas 
  
For the purpose of ultrasonic meter diagnosis, the speed of sound in the natural gas shall be calculated using the methods described in the most recent edition of 
AGA Report No. 10. 
  
4.5 Heating Value and Composition 
At the points where there is on-line chromatography, the heating value shall be taken from the chromatograph and included in the flow computer calculations. 
The heating value shall be evaluated according to the most recent edition of ASTM standard D3588. 
  
At those points with fixed chromatography, the parameters associated with gas composition and required for the calculation of its properties shall be adjusted 
monthly. These shall be obtained by chromatographic sampling and analysis or using the monthly average taken from a nearby chromatograph that measures the 
same current with a negligible time difference regarding the period between adjustments. 
  
5. Margin of Error in Measurements 
The measurement systems must operate within a combined margin of error of ±1%. To that end, the expanded margin of error, associated with the volume and 
energy measurements, and stated for a confidence level of 95% must be less than 1%. 
  
The  Guía  para  la  expresión  de  la  Incertidumbre  en  las  Mediciones (GUM)  Guide  for  the  Statement  of  Margin  of  Error  in  Measurements,  published  by 
ICONTEC in the most recent edition of the Colombian Technical Guide GTC-51, shall be used to evaluate the interval that characterizes the dispersion of 
values that may reasonably be attributed to the measurement system as results. 
  
6. Calibration of Measurement Equipment 
  
6.1 First Calibration 
The first calibration of the meter and of the instruments and equipment associated with the measurement system shall be performed in a recognized laboratory 
before their installation. 
  
6.2 Verifications 
Verification of metrological performance, accuracy, and the internal condition of the measurement systems shall be performed periodically, starting with the 
following intervals:

 Meters (primary element): annual inspection
 Other instruments and flow computer: monthly verification
Page 31 of 35
After the first year, the initially-established verification periods may be extended up to a maximum of three (3) years for the meters and three (3) months for the 
other instruments and flow computer, provided the results of the inspection and historical data fully support the action. 
  
Likewise, once extended, the periods may be shortened if for any reason the performance of the elements degrades in such a way that the extended interval 
would not allow appropriate metrological monitoring of the system. 
  
Should there be instruments, equipment, and/or components that do not maintain their stability between successive one (1)-month periods, the owner shall 
proceed to repair or replace the element with one of better quality and stability. 
  
7. Conservation of Readings 
  
The TRANSPORTER and the SHIPPER shall keep original documents or supporting documentation regarding all testing or graphic data, or any other similar 
type of record, on optical and/or magnetic media for a period of four (4) years or the shortest period permitted by the applicable rules of the Energy and Gas 
Regulatory Committee (CREG), counted from the date on which the evaluation is performed.

(e) With  regard  to  ECOPETROL’s  Temporary  Capacity  Releases  which  CENIT  successfully  markets,  ECOPETROL  shall  remit  to  CENIT  a 
Marketing Rate to be agreed by the Parties and shall not be required to pay any additional Rate. In any event, the amount of the Marketing Rate 
agreed by the Parties shall not be greater than:
1. For  released  and  marketed  capacities  of  up  to  twenty  thousand  (20,000  BPCD)  Barrels  per  Calendar  Day,  the  Marketing  Rate  shall  not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the Service Rate corresponding to the Asset(s) subject to temporary release by ECOPETROL.
2.
For released and marketed capacities in excess of twenty thousand (20,000 BPCD), the Marketing Rate shall not exceed seven percent (7%) 
of the Service Rate corresponding to the Asset(s) subject to temporary release by ECOPETROL.
(f) CENIT shall not be required to accept nominations from ECOPETROL with respect to the Temporary Capacity Release, except in the event that it
has not successfully marketed such Temporary Capacity Release.
(g)
In those cases where various users release capacity for the respective Asset and CENIT markets a portion of such Temporary Capacity Release, 
for purposes of applying the rules set forth in letters (c) and (e) above, CENIT shall distribute such marketed capacity among the users that have 
released capacity, based on the proportion of contracted firm capacity held by each one of the users that have released capacity.
(h) The release of capacity does not involve contractual modification of the Firm Capacity under ECOPETROL’s “Ship or Pay” modality.
(ii)
Permanent Firm Capacity Release under the “Ship or Pay” modality:
(a) Within the first ten (10) Calendar Years of the Completion Period of the Master Service Contract, ECOPETROL may permanently make available
to CENIT all or part of the contracted Firm Capacity.
(b) For purposes of the Permanent Capacity Release, ECOPETROL may at any time notify CENIT, and by any written means, of the volumes it is 
releasing of the respective Firm Capacity and the Asset to which such Permanent Capacity Release applies. The Permanent Capacity Release shall 
be effective as of the first (1st) Day of the third (3rd) month following the date of notification of such permanent release.
7
(iii)
(c) Following  the  first  ten  (10)  Calendar  Years  of  the  Completion  Period  of  the  Master  Service  Contract,  ECOPETROL  may  permanently  make 
available to CENIT, at any time, all or part of the Firm Capacity. In this case of capacity release, the Firm Capacity shall only be modified when 
expressly accepted by CENIT.
(d) ECOPETROL shall not be required to pay any Rate with regard to Permanent Capacity Release.
  
(e) The permanent capacity release leads to a contractual modification of ECOPETROL’s Firm Capacity. In order to determine the modified amount 
of Firm Capacity for each modality, the percentages set forth in Section 3.04 (ii) (c) (2) of the General Conditions shall be applied to the total
amount of capacity that ECOPETROL has advised it will permanently release.
(f) When  ECOPETROL  permanently  releases  capacity  as  a  result  of  the  termination  or  modification  of  the  contract  in  force  with  the  National
Hydrocarbons Agency for the purchase of royalty Crude Oil, the Permanent Capacity Release shall modify the Firm Capacity:
1. When the release occurs during the first ten (10) Calendar Years of the Master Service Agreement, the percentages set forth in Section 3.04
(ii) (c) (2) the General Conditions shall be applied to the total amount of capacity that ECOPETROL has advised it will permanently release.
2. Following the tenth Calendar Year the Master Service Contract has been in force, ECOPETROL may only unilaterally release capacity for 
volumes corresponding to royalty hydrocarbons that, pursuant to an order from the National Hydrocarbons Agency (or the entity acting in its 
stead) or from ECOPETROL in its capacity as purchaser, shall no longer form part of the contract(s) for royalty purchases that ECOPETROL 
has in effect at any given time. 
  
In this case, it shall be understood that Permanent Capacity Release corresponds solely to the Firm Capacity subject to the “Ship or Pay”
modality. Consequently, the percentages set forth in Section 3.04 (ii) (c) (2) of the General Conditions shall be adjusted based on the total 
amount of the capacity that ECOPETROL has indicated it will permanently release.
Assignment of rights to Firm Capacity:
(a) ECOPETROL may temporarily or permanently assign all or a portion of its contractual rights to the Firm Capacity agreed in this Master Service

(D)
  
The  assignment  of  rights  carried  out  by  ECOPETROL  and  to  which  CENIT  does  not  object,  shall  be  fully  binding  and  obligatory  for 
CENIT.

and CENIT.
ECOPETROL shall not be jointly liable with the assignee regarding the obligations under its responsibility that are derived as a result of the 
assignment of Firm Capacity.
6. As a result of the Firm Capacity transfers, ECOPETROL shall not be required to pay any Rate for such assigned capacity.
Section 3.06    Additional Capacity. 
  
(i)

Any change to the Firm Capacity pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.08 shall require a previous written agreement by the Parties. 
  
Section 3.09    The Parties understand ECOPETROL’s position vis-á-vis other Shippers or users of the Assets is diminished if: (i) it constitutes or grants new 
easements for the Assets to third parties; (ii) extends the term of existing easements with regard to the Assets and thereby affects the rights of ECOPETROL as 
derived  from  this  Master  Service  Agreement;  (iii)  grants,  allows  or  acknowledges  for  any  user  or  Shipper  privileges  or  priority  regarding  access  to  the 
infrastructure that diminish the status of Shipper held by ECOPETROL by virtue of this Master Service Contract, with the exception of the Preferential Right 
for royalty Crude Oil.

At the request of ECOPETROL, Ryder Scott Company (Ryder Scott) has prepared an audit of the proved reserves attributable to certain properties of
ECOPETROL, as of December 31, 2012. The subject properties are located in the country of Colombia and the United States of America.
For the purpose of the audit, Ryder Scott estimated the reserves based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 
2009 in the Federal Register (SEC Regulations). Our third party study, completed on January 4, 2012 and presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure 
by ECOPETROL in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations.
The  properties  evaluated  by  Ryder  Scott  account  for  a  portion  of  ECOPETROL’s  total  net  proved  reserves  as  of  December  31,  2012.  Based  on 
information  provided  by  ECOPETROL,  the  third  party  estimate  conducted  by  Ryder  Scott  addresses  46  percent  of  the  total  proved  developed  net  liquid 
hydrocarbon reserves and 21 percent of the total proved undeveloped net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, of ECOPETROL. Ryder Scott review also addresses 71 
percent of the total net proved developed gas reserves and 42 percent of the total proved undeveloped net gas reserves, of ECOPETROL.
The estimated reserve amounts presented in this report, as of December 31, 2012, are related to hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the 
preparation of this report are based on the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as 
the  unweighted  arithmetic  averages  of  the  prices  in  effect  on  the  first-day-of-the-month  for  each  month  within  such  period,  unless  prices  were  defined  by 
contractual  arrangements,  as  required  by  the  SEC  regulations.  Actual  future  prices  may  vary  significantly  from  the  prices  required  by  SEC  regulations; 
therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report. The results of Ryder Scott’s 
estimates are summarized below.

Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in thousand standard 42 gallon barrels. All gas volumes are reported on an “as sold” basis expressed in millions of 
cubic  feet  (MMCF)  at  the  official  temperature  and  pressure  bases  of  the  areas  in  which  the  gas  reserves  are  located.  These  proved  reserves  volumes  are 
exclusive of royalties. Further, they include ECOPETROL’s participation interest in properties operated by Equion Energía Ltd. and Hocol Petroleum Ltd. 
  
Reserves Included in This Report
The proved reserves included herein conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). 
An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a) entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” is included as an attachment to this report. The 
various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” in this report.
No  attempt  was  made  to  quantify  or  otherwise  account  for  any  accumulated  gas  production  imbalances  that  may  exist.  The  proved  gas  volumes 
included herein do not attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves. Non-hydrocarbon or inert gas volumes have been excluded from the reserves reported 
herein.
Reserves are those estimated remaining quantities of petroleum that are anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, from known 
accumulations  under  defined  conditions.  All  reserve  estimates  involve  an  assessment  of  the  uncertainty  relating  the  likelihood  that  the  actual  remaining 
quantities recovered will be greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the 
amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may 
be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than 
proved reserves, and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At 
ECOPETROL’s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein.
Proved oil and gas reserves are “those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable 
certainty  to  be  economically  producible  from  a  given  date  forward.”  The  proved  reserves  included  herein  were  estimated  using  deterministic  methods.  If 
deterministic  methods  are  used,  the  SEC  has  defined  reasonable  certainty  for  proved  reserves  as  a  “high  degree  of  confidence  that  the  quantities  will  be 
recovered.”
Proved reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
For proved reserves, the SEC states that “as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and 
economic data are made to the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to 
decrease.” Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical 
or  economic  risks.  Therefore,  the  proved  reserves  included  in  this  report  are  estimates  only  and  should  not  be  construed  as  being  exact  quantities,  and  if 
recovered, the revenues therefrom, and the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.

The proved reserves reported herein are limited to the period prior to expiration of current contracts providing the legal rights to produce, or a revenue 
interest  in  such  production,  unless  evidence  indicates  that  contract  renewal  is  reasonably  certain.  Furthermore,  properties  in  the  different  countries  may  be 
subjected to significantly varying contractual fiscal terms that affect the net revenue to ECOPETROL for the production of these volumes. The prices and 
economic return received for these net volumes can vary significantly based on the terms of these contracts. Therefore, when applicable, Ryder Scott reviewed 
the fiscal terms of such contracts and discussed with ECOPETROL the net economic benefit attributed to such operations for the determination of the net 
hydrocarbon volumes and income thereof. Ryder Scott has not conducted an exhaustive audit or verification of such contractual information. Neither our review 
of such contractual information nor our acceptance of ECOPETROL’s representations regarding such contractual information should be construed as a legal 
opinion on this matter.
Ryder  Scott  did  not  evaluate  the  country  and  geopolitical  risks  in  the  countries  where  ECOPETROL  operates  or  has  interests.  ECOPETROL’s 
operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and regulations may include, but may not be limited to, 
matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to produce hydrocarbons including the granting, extension or termination of production sharing 
contracts, the fiscal terms of various production sharing contracts, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies, 
royalties,  various  taxes  and  levies  including  income  tax,  and  foreign  trade  and  investment  and  are  subject  to  change  from  time  to  time.  Such  changes  in 
governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of proved income actually received to differ 
significantly from the estimated quantities.
The  estimates  of  proved  reserves  presented  herein  were  based  upon  a  detailed  study  of  the  properties  in  which  ECOPETROL  owns  an  interest; 
however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may 
exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices. 
  
Estimates of Reserves
The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and 
gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set 
forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves 
relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-
based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods; and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process 
of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their professional judgment is most 
appropriate  given  the  nature  and  amount  of  reliable  geoscience  and  engineering  data  available  at  the  time  of  the  estimate,  the  established  or  anticipated 
performance characteristics of the reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.

In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this data may indicate a range of 
possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator. When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must 
determine the uncertainty associated with the incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental 
approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is 
the categorization of reserve  quantities as  proved, probable and/or possible that addresses  the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported.  For 
proved  reserves, uncertainty  is  defined  by  the  SEC  as reasonable certainty  wherein  the  “quantities actually  recovered  are much more likely than not  to  be 
achieved.” The SEC states that “probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together 
with  proved  reserves,  are  as  likely  as  not  to  be  recovered.”  The  SEC  states  that  “possible  reserves  are  those  additional  reserves  that  are  less  certain  to  be 
recovered than probable reserves and the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus 
possible reserves.” All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted above.
Estimates  of  reserves  quantities  and  their  associated  reserve  categories  may  be  revised  in  the  future  as  additional  geoscience  or  engineering  data 
become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes 
in economic conditions, results of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical economic risks as previously noted herein.
The  proved  reserves  for  the  properties  included  herein  were  estimated  by  performance  methods,  the  volumetric  method,  or  a  combination  of
performance and volumetric methods. The following table summarizes the approximate percent of reserves estimated by each of these methods.

These  performance  methods  include,  but  may  not  be  limited  to,  decline  curve  analysis  and  analogy  which  utilized  extrapolations  of  historical 
production  and  pressure  data  available  through  November  2012  in  those  cases  where  such  data  were  considered  to  be  definitive.  The  data  utilized  in  this 
analysis were supplied to Ryder Scott by ECOPETROL and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. The volumetric method was used where there 
were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates 
was  considered  to  be  inappropriate.  The  volumetric  analysis  utilized  pertinent  well  and  seismic  data  supplied  to  Ryder  Scott  by  ECOPETROL  that  were 
available through November, 2012. The data utilized from the well and seismic data incorporated into our volumetric analysis were considered sufficient for the 
purpose thereof.
To  estimate  economically  recoverable  proved  oil  and  gas  reserves  and  related  future  net  cash  flows,  we  consider  many  factors  and  assumptions 
including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  use  of  reservoir  parameters  derived  from  geological,  geophysical  and  engineering  data  that  cannot  be  measured  directly, 
economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) 
and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the 
prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for 
the  sale  of  production  and  the  operating  costs  and  other  costs  relating  to  such  production  may  increase  or  decrease  from  those  under  existing  economic 
conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.

ECOPETROL has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other 
data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by ECOPETROL with 
respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as 
transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices 
based on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure 
measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished 
by ECOPETROL. We consider the factual data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves herein.
In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for the purpose hereof, and we have 
used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included 
herein were determined in conformance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final 
Rule,  including  all  references  to  Regulation  S-X  and  Regulation  S-K,  referred to  herein collectively  as  the  “SEC Regulations.”  In  our  opinion,  the  proved 
reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure requirements as required by the SEC regulations. 
  
Future Production Rates
For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If no production decline trend has 
been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was 
anticipated. An estimated rate of decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as the basis for 
estimating future production rates.
Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or locations that are not currently 
producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an anticipated date furnished by ECOPETROL. Wells or locations that are 
not currently producing may start producing earlier or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate 
production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling, completing and/or recompleting wells and/or 
constraints set by regulatory bodies.
The  future  production  rates  from  wells  currently  on  production  or  wells  or  locations  that  are  not  currently  producing  may  be  more  or  less  than 
estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial 
lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions, producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.

Hydrocarbon Prices
The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of 
the period covered in this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within 
such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and 
determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 
12-month unweighted arithmetic average as previously described.
ECOPETROL furnished us with the above mentioned average prices in effect on December 31, 2012. These initial SEC hydrocarbon prices were 
determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These 
benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the “benchmark prices” and “price reference”
used  for  the  geographic  area  included  in  the  report.  In  certain  geographic  areas,  the  price  reference  and  benchmark  prices  may  be  defined  by  contractual 
arrangements. In cases where there are numerous contracts or price references within the same geographic area, the benchmark price is represented by the 
unweighted arithmetic average of the initial 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices used.
The product prices that were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments to the benchmark prices for 
gravity, quality, local conditions and/or distance from market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used in the preparation of this report were 
furnished to us by ECOPETROL. The differentials furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have 
not conducted an independent verification of the data used by ECOPETROL to determine these differentials.
In addition, the following table summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and referred to herein as the “average 
realized prices.” The average realized prices shown in the table below were determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total 
net reserves for the geographic area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas included in the report.

Costs
Operating costs used in our evaluation were based on the operating expense reports of ECOPETROL and include only those costs directly applicable to 
the evaluated assets. The operating costs include a portion of general and administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. The operating costs 
furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the 
operating cost data used by ECOPETROL. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or exploration and development prepayments that 
were not charged directly to the assets.
Development costs were furnished to us by ECOPETROL and are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed work or actual costs for 
similar  projects.  The  development  costs  furnished  to  us  were  accepted  as  factual  data  and  reviewed  by  us  for  their  reasonableness;  however,  we  have  not 
conducted an independent verification of these costs. The estimated net cost of abandonment after salvage was included for properties where abandonment costs 
net of salvage were significant. The estimates of the net abandonment costs furnished by ECOPETROL were accepted without independent verification.
The proved developed and undeveloped reserves in this report have been incorporated herein in accordance with ECOPETROL’s plans to develop 
these reserves as of December 31, 2012. The implementation of ECOPETROL’s development plans as presented to us and incorporated herein is subject to the 
approval process adopted by ECOPETROL’s management. As the result of our inquires during the course of preparing this report, ECOPETROL has informed 
us that the development activities included herein have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required by ECOPETROL’s management at the 
appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific 
partner  AFE  processes,  Joint  Operating  Agreement  (JOA)  requirements  or  other  administrative  approvals  external  to  ECOPETROL.  Additionally, 
ECOPETROL has informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly alter their plans.
Current costs used by ECOPETROL were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

PREAMBLE
PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
As Adapted From:
On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final 
Rule” in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” includes 
revisions and additions to the definition section in Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation 
S-K, and amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule”, including all references to 
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “SEC Regulations”. The SEC Regulations take effect for all filings made with 
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 
17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions, as the following definitions, descriptions and explanations 
rely wholly or in part on excerpts from the original document (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
Reserves are those estimated remaining quantities of petroleum which are anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, from known 
accumulations under defined conditions. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable 
geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by 
placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and 
may  be  further  sub-classified  as  probable  and  possible  reserves  to  denote  progressively  increasing  uncertainty  in  their  recoverability.  Under  the  SEC 
Regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas 
reserves in documents publicly filed with the Commission. The SEC Regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than 
reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the Commission unless such information is required to be disclosed in 
the document by foreign or state law as noted in §229.1202 Instruction to Item 1202.
Reserves estimates will generally be revised as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. 
  
Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all methods for supplementing 
natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, 
waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be 
developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
Reserves  may  be  attributed  to  either  conventional  or  unconventional  petroleum  accumulations.  Petroleum  accumulations  are  considered  as  either 
conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples 
of unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen 
and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.

RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES 
Page 2
RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory. 
  
Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from different reserves categories.
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by 
application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the 
legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and 
financing required to implement the project. 
  
Note  to  paragraph  (a)(26):  Reserves  should  not  be  assigned  to  adjacent  reservoirs  isolated  by  major,  potentially  sealing,  faults  until  those  reservoirs  are 
penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a 
non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e;, 
potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be 
estimated  with  reasonable  certainty  to  be  economically  producible⎯from  a  given  date  forward,  from  known  reservoirs,  and  under  existing  economic 
conditions,  operating  methods,  and  government  regulations⎯prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts  providing  the  right  to  operate  expire,  unless  evidence 
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the 
hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i)
The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A)        The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and 
  
(B)        Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain
economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED
(ii)        In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well
penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
  
(iii)        Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated
gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data
and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
  
(iv)        Reserves  which  can  be  produced  economically  through  application  of  improved  recovery  techniques  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  fluid
injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A)        Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole,
the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the
reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and 
  
(B)        The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.
(v)        Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be
the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average  of  the  first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period,  unless  prices  are  defined  by  contractual  arrangements,  excluding 
escalations based upon further conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be made to Title 17, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original 
documents (direct passages excerpted from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows: 
  
Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i)
(ii)
Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively 
minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
  
Through  installed extracting equipment  and infrastructure operational  at  the time of the  reserves estimate if the extraction is by 
means not involving a well.
Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions)
While  not  a  requirement  for  disclosure  under  the  SEC  regulations,  developed  oil  and  gas  reserves  may  be  further  sub-classified  according  to  the
guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
Developed Producing Reserves  
Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate. 
  
Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.

Developed Non-Producing 
Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves. 
  
Shut-In 
Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from:
UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(1)        completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing; 
(2)        wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or 
(3)        wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
Behind-Pipe 
Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells which will require additional completion work or future re-completion 
prior to start of production. 
  
In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as follows: 
  
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing 
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of 
production  when  drilled,  unless  evidence  using  reliable  technology  exists  that  establishes  reasonable  certainty  of  economic 
producibility at greater distances.
  
Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that 
they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.
Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid 
injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects 
in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by other evidence using reliable 
technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Dear Mrs. Echeverri:
This Proved reserves statement has been prepared by Gaffney, Cline & Associates (GCA) and issued on March 08, 2013 at the request of Ecopetrol, 
S.A. (Ecopetrol), a participant operator and investor in sixty eight fields in the Lower, Middle and Upper Magdalena Valley, Catatumbo, Putumayo, Llanos 
Orientales and Nororiente Basins, Colombia. This report is based on prior audits conducted by GCA and is intended for use in conjunction with Ecopetrol’s 
December 31, 2012 20-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
GCA has conducted an independent audit examination as of December 31, 2012, of the Proved hydrocarbon liquids and natural gas reserves of the 
above mentioned fields. On the basis of technical and other information made available to us concerning these property units, we hereby provide the reserve 
statement given in the table below.

RESERVE AUDIT
FOR SIXTY EIGHT FIELDS IN COLOMBIA
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013
ASF/gjh/AH-12-2038.00/gcah.100.13 
Ecopetrol, S. A.
Hydrocarbon liquid volumes represent crude oil and condensate, natural gasoline and LPG estimated to be recovered during field separation and plant 
processing, and are reported in millions of barrels (MMBbl). Natural gas volumes represent expected gas sales, and are reported in billions (109) of cubic feet 
(Bscf) at standard conditions of 14.7 psia and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. These volumes have been reduced for fuel usage in the field. Royalties payable to the State 
have been deducted from reported net volumes.
Proved gas volumes are based on firm and existing gas contracts and on the reasonable expectation that such gas sales contracts will be renewed on
Ecopetrol has advised GCA that these audited hydrocarbon volumes represent the following proportionate shares of Ecopetrol’s total reserves on a net
similar terms in the future.

Proved Developed Liquids – 38% 
  
Proved Developed Gas – 28% 
  
Proved Undeveloped Liquids – 52% 
  
Proved Undeveloped Gas – 54% 
  
Total Proved Oil Equivalent - 39.0% 
  
GCA is not in a position to verify these values as it was not requested to review Ecopetrol’s other oil and gas assets. 
  
This audit examination was based on reserve estimates and other information provided by Ecopetrol to GCA through December 2012, and included 
such tests, procedures and adjustments as were considered necessary. Field data and information provided by Ecopetrol varies from field to field. Ecopetrol 
provided production data sets, depending on the field, up to September or August 2012. All questions that arose during the course of the audit process were 
resolved to our satisfaction.
Technical information and comments related to the methodology followed to audit the reserves volumes for each one of the fields is presented in
separate individual reports. As these reports are quite extensive and detailed, the significant points of the work performed are summarized below.
Recoverable volume estimates as derived from profiles of expected future performance were checked for consistency with the development plans
provided  by  Ecopetrol.  These  were  further  verified  on  the  basis  of  individual  well  decline  analysis,  typical  well  performance  models,  material  balance 
calculations, reservoir simulation results, analogies, etc. as appropriate to the available information and category of the reserves. Gross reserves and those net to 
Ecopetrol’s interests were verified on the basis of the fiscal and contractual terms applicable for each field.
In order to confirm estimates of petroleum initially in place, the structural and stratigraphic descriptions of the accumulations, various reservoir limits,
rock petrophysical parameters and reservoir fluid properties were reviewed, checked for reasonableness and/or modified as appropriate based on information 
and  data  supplied  by  Ecopetrol.  Reservoir  and  individual  well  performance  was  analyzed  in  order  to  assess  the  predominant  reservoir  drive  mechanisms 
currently active in the fields and those expected to affect the future production performance.
ASF/gjh/AH-12-2038.00/gcah.100.13

The economic tests for the December 31, 2012 reserve volumes were based on a prior twelve-month first-day-of-the-month average reference price for 
Brent crude of US$111.13/Bbl, corrected for location and quality to average wellhead prices in the range of US$74.72/Bbl – 112.53/Bbl, depending on the 
specific field. Sales gas and plant product prices were advised by Ecopetrol according to existing contracts and/or regulations. No price escalation has been 
included, other than as provided for in existing contracts. The following tables include additional details of these prices:

Future capital costs for the fields were derived from development program forecasts prepared by field operators. Recent historical operating expense 
data were utilized as the basis for operating cost projections. GCA has found that sufficient capital investments and operating expenses have been projected by 
the operators to produce the projected volumes.
It  is  GCA’s  opinion  that  the  estimates  of  total  remaining  recoverable  hydrocarbon  liquid  and  gas  volumes  as  of  December  31,  2012  are,  in  the 
aggregate, reasonable and the reserves categorization is appropriate and consistent with the definitions for reserves set out in 17 CFR Part 210 Rule 4-10(a) of 
Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. GCA concludes that the methodologies employed by Ecopetrol in the derivation of 
the  reserves  estimates  are  appropriate  and  that  the  quality  of  the  data  relied  upon  and  the  depth  and  thoroughness  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  are 
adequate. 
  
GCA is not aware of any potential changes in regulations applicable to these fields that could affect the ability of Ecopetrol to produce the estimated
reserves. 
  
This assessment has been conducted within the context of GCA’s understanding of Ecopetrol’s petroleum property rights as represented by Ecopetrol’s 
management. GCA is not in a position to attest to property title, financial interest relationships or encumbrances thereon for any part of the appraised properties 
or interests.
There  are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating  reserves  and  resources,  and  in  projecting  future  production,  development  expenditures, 
operating  expenses  and  cash  flows.  Oil  and  gas  reserve  engineering  and  resource  assessment  must  be  recognized  as  a  subjective  process  of  estimating 
subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. Estimates of oil and gas reserves or resources prepared by other parties may 
differ, perhaps materially, from those contained within this report. The accuracy of any Reserve or Resource estimate is a function of the quality of the available 
data  and  of engineering  and geological  interpretation. Results  of drilling, testing  and  production that post-date  the preparation  of the  estimates may  justify 
revisions, some or all of which may be material. Accordingly, Reserve and Resource estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are 
ultimately recovered, and the timing and cost of those volumes that are recovered may vary from that assumed.

Exhibit 99.3
Pursuant to your request, we have audited the net proved hydrocarbon reserves, as of December 31, 2012, of certain selected properties in Colombia 
and Peru owned by Ecopetrol S.A., its wholly owned subsidiary Hocol Petroleum Limited, and through its ownership interest in Savia Peru S.A. (collectively, 
“ECOPETROL”). This evaluation was completed on February 26, 2013. ECOPETROL has represented that these properties account for 14 percent on a net 
equivalent barrel basis of ECOPETROL’s net proved reserves as of December 31, 2012. ECOPETROL has also represented that these properties account for 14 
percent of ECOPETROL’s total proved developed net liquid hydrocarbon (oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids (NGL)) reserves, 1 percent of its total proved 
developed net gas reserves, 27 percent of its total proved undeveloped net liquid hydrocarbon reserves, and 4 percent of its total proved undeveloped net gas 
reserves. The net proved reserves estimates have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4–10(a) (1)–(32) of Regulation S–X of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202 (a)(8) of 
Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain SEC filings by ECOPETROL.
Reserves  included  herein  are  expressed  as  net  reserves.  Gross  reserves  are  defined  as  the  total  estimated  petroleum  to  be  produced  from  these 
properties after December 31, 2012. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the interests owned by ECOPETROL after 
deducting all interests owned by others, including royalties paid in kind.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas reserves should be regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and 
additional information become available. Not only are such reserves estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also 
subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
Data  used  in  this  audit  were  obtained  from  reviews  with  ECOPETROL  personnel,  ECOPETROL  files,  from  records  on  file  with  the  appropriate 
regulatory agencies, and from public sources. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without independent verification, upon such information furnished 
by ECOPETROL with respect to property interests, production from such properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, 
agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field 
examination of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. We believe the data used in this audit are appropriate for the purposes 
of this report.

Methodology and Procedures
Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques that are in 
accordance  with  practices  generally  recognized  by  the  petroleum  industry  as  presented  in  the  publication  of  the  Society  of  Petroleum  Engineers  entitled 
“Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007).” The method or combination of 
methods used in the analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic 
data, and production history.
When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP) and the original gas in place (OGIP). Structure and 
isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were used to prepare 
these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water saturation. When adequate data were available and when circumstances justified, 
material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP or OGIP. These recovery factors were based on consideration of 
the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, 
material  balance  and  other  engineering  methods  were  used  to  estimate  recovery  factors.  An  analysis  of  reservoir  performance,  including  production  rate, 
reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of reserves.
For  depletion-type  reservoirs  or  those  whose  performance  disclosed  a  reliable  decline  in  producing-rate  trends  or  other  diagnostic  characteristics, 
reserves  were  estimated  by  the  application  of  appropriate  decline  curves  or  other  performance  relationships.  In  the  analyses  of  production-decline  curves, 
reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production or to the limit of the production licenses as appropriate.
The  proved  reserves  for  the  properties  included  herein  were  estimated  by  the  performance  method,  the  volumetric  method,  or  a  combination  of
performance and volumetric methods. The following table summarizes the approximate percentage of net reserves estimated by each of these methods.

Definition of Reserves
Petroleum reserves estimated by us included in this report are classified as proved. Only proved reserves 
have been evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4–10(a) (1)–(32) of 
Regulation S–X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating 
conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-
decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and 
costs consistent with the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements but not 
including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
DeGolyer and MacNaughton

Proved oil and gas reserves – Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, 
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under existing 
economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless 
evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The 
project  to  extract  the  hydrocarbons  must  have  commenced  or  the  operator  must  be  reasonably  certain  that  it  will  commence  the  project  within  a 
reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: 
(A)  The  area  identified  by  drilling  and  limited  by  fluid  contacts,  if  any,  and  (B)  Adjacent  undrilled  portions  of  the  reservoir  that  can,  with 
reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and 
engineering data. 
  
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well 
penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 
  
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated 
gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance 
data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 
  
(iv)  Reserves  which  can  be  produced  economically  through  application  of  improved  recovery  techniques  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  fluid 
injection) are included in the proved classification when: 
  
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation 
of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty 
of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary 
parties and entities, including governmental entities.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be 
the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic 
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding 
escalations based upon future conditions.
Developed oil and gas reserves – Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i)  Through  existing  wells  with  existing  equipment  and  operating  methods  or  in  which  the  cost  of  the  required  equipment  is  relatively  minor 
compared to the cost of a new well; and 
  
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not 
involving a well.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves – Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on 
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production 
when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are 
scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time.

DeGolyer and MacNaughton
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or 
other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or 
an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4–10 (a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable 
certainty.

Primary Economic Assumptions
The following economic assumptions were used for estimating existing and future prices and costs: 
  
Oil, Condensate, and NGL Prices
ECOPETROL has represented that the oil, condensate, and NGL prices were based on a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted 
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are 
defined  by  contractual  agreements.  ECOPETROL  has  represented  that  the  12-month  average  adjusted  product  prices  for  the  properties  in 
Colombia evaluated herein were U.S.$94.61 per barrel for crude oil and condensate and U.S.$41.49 per barrel for NGL, based on a 12-month 
average Brent reference price of U.S.$111.13 per barrel. ECOPETROL supplied differentials by field to the Brent reference price, and the prices 
were held constant thereafter. ECOPETROL has also represented that the 12-month average adjusted product prices for the properties in Peru 
evaluated herein were U.S.$113.51 per barrel for crude oil and condensate and U.S.$66.49 per barrel for NGL based on the 12-month average 
Ardjuna and Minas crude reference prices, and the prices were held constant thereafter.
DeGolyer and MacNaughton
Natural Gas Prices
ECOPETROL has represented that the natural gas prices were based on a 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted average of the 
first-day-of-the-month  price  for each  month  within  the  12-month  period  prior  to  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  unless  prices are  defined  by 
contractual agreements. ECOPETROL has represented that the natural gas prices for the properties in Colombia evaluated herein are defined by 
contractual agreements based on specific market conditions, and the average adjusted product price was U.S.$4.02 per thousand cubic feet, and the 
prices were held constant thereafter. ECOPETROL has also represented that the natural gas prices for the properties in Peru evaluated herein are 
defined by contractual agreements based on specific market conditions, and the average adjusted product price was U.S.$3.06 per thousand cubic 
feet, and the prices were held constant thereafter.
Operating Expenses and Capital Costs
Operating expenses and capital costs, based on information provided by ECOPETROL, were used in estimating future costs required to operate the 
properties. In certain cases, future costs, either higher or lower than existing costs, may have been used because of anticipated changes in operating 
conditions. These costs were not escalated for inflation.
While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry participant’s ability to recover its oil 
and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict the recovery of the December 31, 2012, estimated proved oil and gas 
reserves. The reserves estimated in this report can be produced under current regulatory guidelines.
Our estimates of ECOPETROL’s net proved reserves attributable to the reviewed properties are based on the definitions of proved reserves of the SEC
and are as follows, expressed in millions of barrels (MMbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and millions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe):

In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained in this report has been 
prepared  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  932-235-50-4,  932-235-50-6,  932-235-50-7,  and  932-235-50-9  of  the  Accounting  Standards  Update  932-235-50, 
Extractive Industries – Oil and Gas (Topic 932): Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures (January 2010) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
and Rules 4–10(a) (1)–(32) of Regulation S–X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S–K of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission; provided, however, that estimates of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the year.
To the extent the above-enumerated rules, regulations, and statements require determinations of an accounting or legal nature, we, as engineers, are
necessarily unable to express an opinion as to whether the above-described information is in accordance therewith or sufficient therefor.
