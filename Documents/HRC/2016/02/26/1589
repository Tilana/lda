<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Panel on the right to privacy in the digital age 
</b></p>
<p> At its &#8230; meeting, on &#8230; March 2014, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt 
the text below:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, relevant international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and other relevant international human rights 
instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
<i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 68/167 of 18 December 2013 on the right to 
</p>
<p>privacy in the digital age, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>all relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Human Rights Council, in particular Council resolution 20/8 of 5 July 2012 on the 
promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, 
and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, as set out in article 12 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, special procedures, treaty bodies and other relevant 
mechanisms in promoting and protecting the right to privacy in the digital age, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected 
online, including the right to privacy, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization 
of the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and is one 
of the foundations of a democratic society, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of 
communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of 
communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out 
on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-seventh session, a panel discussion on the 
promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age in the context of domestic 
and extraterritorial surveillance and/or the interception of digital communications and the 
collection of personal data, including on a mass scale, also with a view to identifying 
challenges and best practices, taking into account the report of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 
68/167; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner to organize the panel discussion, in 
consultation with States, relevant United Nations bodies, funds and programmes, treaty 
bodies, special procedures and regional human rights mechanisms, as well as with civil 
society, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and national human rights 
institutions, with a view to ensuring multi-stakeholder participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the 
panel discussion for submission to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session.&#8221;
