<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Intergovernmental Working Group on the 
Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 11/12 and decision 3/103. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Intergovernmental Working Group held its tenth session from 8 to 19 October 
2012 (see annex I). Participants reviewed progress on implementation of recommendations 
adopted by the Working Group at its ninth session and shared experiences, including best 
practices, in implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. Participants also reviewed the 
activities of the &#8220;Respect diversity &#8211; football unites&#8221; campaign of the Union of European 
Football Associations (UEFA) for the European Football Championship of 2012. 
Furthermore, thematic discussions on the role of politicians and political parties in 
combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and on the 
enhancement of international and regional cooperation with regard to the implementation of 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, were held. The presentations by the 
experts were followed by interactive discussions. The Working Group adopted conclusions 
and recommendations on the above-mentioned themes.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. The session was attended by representatives of States Members of the United 
Nations, and observers from non-Member States and intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations (see annex II). 
</p>
<p>4. Under item 4 of the programme of work (see annex III), a review of the activities 
conducted for the UEFA EURO 2012 &#8220;Respect diversity &#8211; football unites&#8221; campaign was 
presented by the Executive Director of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE), Piara 
Powar, and the Director of Football and Social Responsibility Unit at UEFA, Patrick 
Gasser. 
</p>
<p>5. During the session, presentations on the role of politicians and political parties in 
combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance were made by 
Nazila Ghanea, lecturer in international human rights law at the University of Oxford; 
Alvaro Bello Maldonado, researcher at the Department of Anthropology at the Catholic

</p>
<p>6.  Presentations were also made on the enhancement of international and regional

joint presentation was also made under the topic by the African Union and European Union 
on the joint workshop organized in Geneva on 5 June 2012 within the framework of the 
Africa-European Union strategic partnership on human rights and democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 8 October 2012, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
opened the session.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Permanent Representative of Djibouti to the United Nations in Geneva, 
Mohamed Siad Douale, was re-elected Chairperson-Rapporteur by acclamation.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Statements 
</b></p>
<p>9. The European Union congratulated Mr. Douale on his re-election as Chairperson- 
Rapporteur and expressed its determination to make a genuine and positive difference to 
those suffering from all forms of discrimination on the ground. The African Union 
expressed its support for the re-election of the Chairperson, and congratulated the High 
Commissioner and the secretariat for their work, expressing the hope that the two new 
topics could lead to significant progress in the effective implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegate of Pakistan, speaking on behalf of OIC, expressed the Organization&#8217;s 
commitment to cooperate and participate in order to make useful and productive 
discussions.  
</p>
<p>11. The representative of Egypt congratulated the Chairperson on his re-election, and 
highlighted the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference. He expressed grave concern about 
contemporary forms of racism and discrimination in various parts of the world, including 
discrimination based on religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>12. The representative of South Africa expressed appreciation for the work of the 
Chairperson and the High Commissioner, and voiced his country&#8217;s hope for the 
</p>
<p>forthcoming proclamation of the International Decade for People of African Descent by the 
General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>13. The representative of Algeria expressed support for the re-election of the 
Chairperson, and remarked that, 10 years after the adoption of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, its implementation was still slow.  
</p>
<p>14. The representative of Italy highlighted the importance of the word &#8220;consensual&#8221;, and 
underlined the increasing importance of the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group, 
especially at a time of economic recession, massive movement of migrants and refugees, </p>


<p>and deprivation, which increase the temptation of groups and individuals to behave in a 
discriminatory and intolerant manner.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda and programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>15. After the election of its Chairperson, the Working Group adopted the agenda for its 
tenth session and its programme of work. The Working Group held its final meeting on the 
afternoon of 8 February 2013. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Implementation of previous decisions of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. </b>Review of the activities of the Euro 2012 &#8220;Respect diversity &#8211;<b> football 
</b>unites&#8221; campaign<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Director of the Football and Social Responsibility Unit at UEFA, Mr. Gasser, 
made a presentation on the anti-racism and anti-discrimination activities conducted in the 
framework of the 2012 UEFA European Football Championships.  
</p>
<p>17. The Executive Director of FARE, Mr. Powar, made a presentation about FARE 
activities during the 2012 Championships and the campaign entitled &#8220;Football unites.&#8221; The 
</p>
<p>actions undertaken included a three-year education programme to focus on educational 
measures to raise the awareness of civil society in Poland and Ukraine on the problems 
associated with racism and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>18. Following the presentations, a discussion was held on the importance of having 
exchanges with representatives of sporting organizations as well as on how mass sporting 
events reach millions of people around the world. As such, football represents an 
opportunity for the understanding and promotion of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>19. Delegates enquired about the type of punishable measures taken to try to limit the 
rise of racist and discriminatory incidents. They asked whether there was a blueprint that 
could be reproduced for other events, and enquired about the most successful components 
of the campaigns conducted by both UEFA and FARE. They also requested information 
about initiatives taken by UEFA in prevention, such as disciplinary sanctions and criminal 
procedures.  
</p>
<p>20. On the issue of sanctions, Mr. Powar emphasized the fact that, from the perspective 
of a non-governmental organization, imposing a sanction on a player, a club or a national 
association because of the acts of the fans inside or around stadium was critical in setting an 
example, but was not enough. Complementary educational measures were needed. FARE 
played its role by providing detailed information so that the relevant authorities could take 
adequate action. Pointed out that criminal justice systems, the police and the relevant 
authorities at the national level had a key role to play in this issue. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the existence of a blueprint that could be reproduced, Mr. Powar 
affirmed that there was indeed a template on the type of educational and preventive 
activities that could be operationalized, and the same could be said for UEFA and FIFA.  
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Gasser stated that it was not football that was racist by definition, but that there 
were elements in society that were racist, and football became the vector of such abuse by 
certain groups.  </p>


<p>23. The representative of Senegal asked how the bodies that the speakers represented 
proceeded in the event of racist incidents, and enquired how they brought in sponsors in the 
fight against racism, taking into account the fact that football is a market place.  
</p>
<p>24. The representative of the European Union reported on a law passed by an European 
directive of 2 February 2012 on the European dimension in sports, which encouraged 
Member States to permanently include sport in programmes and services for the genuine 
integration of all groups at risk of discrimination, and called on sport organizations to adopt 
appropriate training programmes to prevent and fight racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Gasser explained the different stages that UEFA followed in its efforts to 
combat racism and discrimination, starting at the campaign level, followed by an education 
level, and lastly a sanctions level. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to sponsors, Mr. Gasser stated that, although sponsors were invited to 
participate in and support anti-racism projects, unfortunately they did not provide the 
support that might be hoped for.  
</p>
<p>27. Mr. Powar explained the efforts made to tailor proposals and programmes to 
commercial market places, but stated that it was difficult, as commercial entities had their 
own programmes within the sphere of social responsibility.  
</p>
<p><b> B.  Review of progress in the implementation of recommendations adopted 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Working Group at its ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>28. The representative of South Africa opened the debate by sharing examples of 
governmental programmes in place intended to address the legacy of legal injustices, 
poverty, marginalization, racial, social and gender inequalities and economic disparities. 
The most successful programmes had included the universalization of free education and 
the ongoing development of an integrated educational system and integrated human 
settlements.  
</p>
<p>29. The representative of the European Union shared examples of actions taken by the 
European Union to combat all forms of discrimination, such as mainstreaming of non-
discrimination in European Union policies and activities, awareness-raising, the integration 
of Roma people, and diversity management. She highlighted the upcoming 2012 Equality 
Summit dedicated to that sharing of knowledge and experiences, which would be held on 
22 and 23 2012 November in Nicosia. She added that the focus in 2012 of the European 
Union information campaign &#8220;For diversity. Against discrimination&#8221; was on discrimination 
</p>
<p>at the workplace. 
</p>
<p>30. The representative of Italy provided examples of measures adopted by the 
Government of Italy to enhance the implementation of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other international instruments, such 
as the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. He noted, inter alia, the establishment 
of new institutions and the expansion of existing ones, the adoption of a code of conduct for 
the press and the establishment of a media monitoring centre, as well as training courses for 
police and civil servants. 
</p>
<p>31. The representative of Brazil informed participants that 50 per cent of all places in 
institutions of higher education related to the Ministry of Education would be subject to 
quotas based on social and racial criteria. Furthermore, the General Law of the World Cup 
contained four provisions aiming at combating racism and promoting equality in all jobs 
created for the Confederations Cup in 2013 and the World Cup in 2014. The theme of the 
awareness-raising campaign of the two events was &#8220;A world free of weapons, drugs, 
violence and racism&#8221;. </p>


<p>32. The representative of Japan listed several concrete measures that his Government 
had taken to ensure the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action, emphasizing that human rights issues relating to foreigners remained a priority. 
He also gave an update on the implementation of the State&#8217;s obligation under the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>33. The representative of Norway enumerated a number of measures taken by his 
Government to build a more inclusive society, emphasizing that legal protection, measures 
in plans of action and awareness-raising and educational campaigns were major tools in the 
prevention of racism and the protection of vulnerable groups from various types of 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p>34. The representative of Senegal emphasized the importance of preventive measures. 
</p>
<p>35. The representative of Austria informed participants on the recent review of his 
country by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the relevant 
measures taken. He emphasized the importance of intercultural and interfaith dialogue and 
the creation of a task force on dialogue between cultures. He also elaborated on the national 
plan of action on integration that included, for example, a focus on the media, human rights 
education and the training of law enforcement officials.  
</p>
<p>36. The Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section of the Office of the High 
Commissioner (OHCHR) provided an overview of the activities conducted by OHCHR 
since the ninth session. He reported on the Section&#8217;s collaboration with the National Human 
Rights Commission of Nigeria aimed at elaborating a national plan of action against 
discrimination, to be integrated into the existing plan of action for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. He highlighted the establishment of the United Nations network 
on racial discrimination and protection of minorities, endorsed by the Policy Committee of 
the Secretary-General in March 2012.  
</p>
<p>37. The Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section also referred to the second Fellowship 
Programme for People of African Descent, organized by the Section in 2012, and the 
progress achieved in the creation of the OHCHR database on practical means to combat 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to the joint activities of OHCHR and the Department of Public 
Information , the Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section referred to a range of activities 
to promote the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the 
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the International Day of 
Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade. He noted the 
finalization of the new publication compiling the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference and the political 
declaration of the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.  
</p>
<p>39. The representative of the European Union stressed its determination to ensure 
conformity of national laws of Member States with European Union law prohibiting racist 
and xenophobic hate speech and crimes, and referred to the efforts of the European 
Commission in this regard. She reported on the financial support for civil society actions 
and national policies to combat discrimination, promote equality and redress with regard to 
racist speech and crimes through the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship programme.  
</p>
<p>40. The representative of Austria referred to the OHCHR database to be launched in 
2013, stating that it would be a useful tool for the collection of relevant documents, national 
legislation, good practices and laws.  </p>


<p><b> IV. The role of politicians and political parties in combating 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance  
</b></p>
<p>41. Nazila Ghanea, , a lecturer in international human rights law at the University of 
Oxford, explained how the human rights obligations to respect, to protect and to fulfil 
applied to the role of politicians and political parties in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and highlighted the activities that are 
incompatible with these obligations. She reviewed the relevant provisions of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, then concluded with recommendations for 
Governments that perpetuate discriminatory, xenophobic or racist practices. 
</p>
<p>42. Alvaro Bello Maldonado, a researcher at the Department of Anthropology at the 
Catholic University of Temuco (Chile), emphasized in his presentation the importance of 
cooperation among politicians, political parties and civil society, including victims&#8217; 
associations, in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. He explained the central role that politicians and political parties had in the 
transformation of legal and normative structures of a discriminatory character, and 
highlighted the need to ensure that political parties reflected the diverse and plural social 
reality of contemporary societies. He touched upon issues of quotas, affirmative action and 
the promotion of the principles of equality and non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>43. Referring to Ms. Ghanea&#8217;s presentation, the representative of Egypt emphasized that 
politicians and political parties had an influence outside of government; focusing on 
Governments in power was therefore not sufficient. 
</p>
<p>44. The representative of the European Union emphasized that democratic 
accountability, with its checks and balances, prevented the institutionalization of 
expressions of intolerance, and drew attention to Framework decision of 28 November 
2008, by which the European Union requires Member States to penalize any public 
incitement to hatred. 
</p>
<p>45. The representative of the Czech Republic asked the panellists to expand on the 
importance of independent and functioning judiciary as the ultimate check for politicians 
and political parties. 
</p>
<p>46. The representative of Senegal emphasized the importance of political parties 
representing diversity within society as an important means in preventing xenophobic 
discourse, together with constitutional provisions and political and legal sanctions.  
</p>
<p>47. The representative of Austria highlighted the importance of civil society, judiciary 
and civil courts, as well as of international cooperation, in combating racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>48. The representative of OIC emphasized the regional dimension of the problem and 
the need for regional organizations to play a key role in addressing it, as well as the need to 
continue to address these issues.  
</p>
<p>49. The representative of the African Union warned that political statements and 
discourse inciting hatred were on the rise, especially during times of elections. 
Governments should systematically and publically call for an end to such incitement. 
</p>
<p>50. Ms. Ghanea emphasized that Governments had the duty to educate and enlighten the 
public so that respect for diversity became a commonly embraced value.  </p>


<p>51. Mr. Bello Maldonado reiterated the fact that the role of civil society and its 
interaction with political parties was essential in combating racism, and emphasized the 
need to create accountability mechanisms for politicians and political parties.  
</p>
<p>52.  The representative of Tunisia suggested that punishment of hate speech was 
necessary and could perhaps be strengthened through automatic prosecution. He also 
stressed that hate speech by a politician it should be seen as an aggravating circumstance.  
</p>
<p>53. Dr. Lucrezia Meier-Schatz, on behalf of the IPU, highlighted the role of parliaments 
in proposing a model of society based on respect, tolerance, acceptance of others and of 
human rights. She referred to the commitments assumed by IPU in 2001 to develop 
appropriate mechanisms to combat discrimination, promote human rights and consolidate 
democracy.  
</p>
<p>54. Dr. Meier-Schatz highlighted four areas of participation, including the establishment 
of a fair play environment in parliaments to fight racism and racial discrimination. She 
stated that diversity had to be reflected in parliaments, and favoured the setting up in 
parliaments of a network to monitor issues of racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>55. According to Professor Chigara, Professor of Law at Brunel University (United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), the battle for control of public authority 
was probably the oldest contest in any nation State. It attracted attention and the support of 
others who, while not seeking public authority themselves, sought to influence its uses 
towards particular outcomes. This introduced the threat of corruption to the function of 
politicians and political parties regardless of the political system in operation. As an 
outcome, the threat of discrimination of individuals was maximized wherever corruption of 
policy makers existed. 
</p>
<p>56. Professor Chigara also pointed out that, whenever traditional political parties felt 
challenged by emergent pro-ethno-nationalist parties, they tended to adopt radical extremist 
rhetoric that exacerbated intolerance in nation States. 
</p>
<p>57. Lastly, Professor Chigara expressed the view that legislating over the years against 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance had not solved the problem. New forms 
of coded language, symbols and arguments had emerged to replace prohibited ones as mere 
symptoms of the problem. He recommended that States should focus on the root causes of 
this behaviour and apply a combination of measures towards its eventual elimination, 
including a meticulously planned and efficiently executed 10-year universal educational 
campaign.  
</p>
<p>58. In the ensuing discussion, the representative of Senegal inquired whether IPU made 
recommendations to Member States and, if so, what the legal weight of such 
recommendations was and the follow-up by IPU on them.  
</p>
<p>59. Several delegates requested Mr. Chigara to elaborate on the link between 
discrimination, political power, business and corruption.  
</p>
<p>60. The representative of the European Union enquired about existing cooperation with 
parliamentarian assemblies. She asked both speakers to provide additional information on 
parliamentarian measures that focused on awareness-raising, and to elaborate on current 
initiatives in the area of education to combat racism and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>61. The representative of the United Kingdom stressed its commitments in the field of 
business and human rights. 
</p>
<p>62. The representative of Austria referred to the Commission for Equality of Austria, 
and requested information on the cooperation of IPU with other international bodies. He 
also referred to the International Anti-Corruption Academy, an international organization 
based in Laxenburg (Austria). </p>


<p>63. Mr. Chigara pointed out that corruption undermined or removed the possibility of 
equal treatment.  
</p>
<p>64. According to Professor Jamin of the University of Li&#232;ge (Belgium), political parties 
and politicians in Belgium had taken numerous decisions to combat racism, xenophobia, 
anti-Semitism and revisionism, and more generally against all discrimination and 
intolerance. Decisions were political and philosophical when designed to promote a certain 
idea of democracy and to put the &#8220;enemies&#8221; of democracy out of power, but also legal when 
it came to repressing actions of groups promoting discriminatory ideas through legislative 
measures. There were many legal means against racism, and included tools developed by 
political parties to prevent certain individuals or groups from undermining the fundamental 
principles of democracy. The legal means developed by political parties and elected 
officials to respond to these threats could be found in international treaties and conventions 
to which Belgium was a party, under its Constitution, in laws passed by Parliament and the 
regions, and more generally in Belgium criminal law. 
</p>
<p>65. Professor Jamin described the measures taken by political parties at the national 
level to combat racism, xenophobia, intolerance, anti-Semitism and revisionism, and gave 
an analysis of the work of the national Parliament to suppress racism, xenophobia and anti-
Semitism, and its relative effectiveness. He also focused on racially biased reporting in the 
media and the relevant difficulties encountered by parliaments in enacting laws in this 
regard without prejudice to the principle of freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>66. In conclusion, Professor Jamin observed how legislature had devised and sought to 
implement procedures aimed at banning political parties advocating racism and 
discrimination, and noted that the actions of political parties against racism, xenophobia, 
anti-Semitism and revisionism were undertaken in a context of permanent tension with 
regard to the issue of freedom that should be accorded to the enemies of freedom in a 
democratic regime. 
</p>
<p><b> V. The enhancement of international and regional cooperation 
with regard to the implementation of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>67. In her presentation, the Head of the Tolerance and Non-Discrimination Department 
at the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Floriane Hohenberg, 
noted that States members of OSCE had acknowledged that hate crimes, racism and 
xenophobia, as well as anti-Semitism and intolerance against Muslims, Christians and 
members of other religions or beliefs, constituted a threat to stability and security 
throughout the OSCE region. They had adopted a comprehensive range of commitments to 
prevent and respond to hate-motivated violence and to promote mutual respect and 
understanding. In addition, participating States had adopted a broad range of obligations 
relating to combating intolerance and discrimination against Roma and Sinti. She also 
referred to the resolution adopted in 2011 by the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly entitled on 
strengthening efforts to combat racism and xenophobia and foster inclusion, aimed at 
combating racism and xenophobia against people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>68. With regard to its mandate, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights 
provided Governments and civil society with assistance to combat hate crimes effectively 
and to promote mutual respect and understanding, including the development of a broad 
range of programmes to build the capacities of law enforcement and government officials, 
and civil society, to combat hate crimes and to raise awareness through education 
programmes.  </p>


<p>69. Lastly, Ms. Hohenberg highlighted some examples where cooperation had been 
particularly fruitful, in particular with regard to awareness-raising and the exchange of good 
practices, collecting and disseminating information about hate crimes, capacity-building for 
law enforcement agencies, and responding to anti-Semitism and to intolerance against 
Muslims. 
</p>
<p>70. The appointee of the Special Rapporteurship on People of African Descent and 
against Racial Discrimination of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Hilaire 
Sobers, highlighted in his presentation how, in the Americas, both regional and 
international cooperation had made a contribution to the advancement of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular through the establishment of the 
rapporteurship, and the ongoing process of drafting regional instruments on racism, racial 
discrimination and other forms of discrimination and intolerance. 
</p>
<p>71. The rapporteurship had been established through the joint efforts of community of 
non-governmental organizations and the State of Brazil, which had funded the 
rapporteurship for the first year. Since 2005, other States members of the Organization of 
American States (OAS) hade contributed to the funding of the rapporteurship, as had some 
of observer States to OAS. Another example of this cooperation was the thematic report 
issued by the rapporteurship in December 2011, during the International Year of Persons of 
African Descent, which was funded largely by donations from the European Union.    
</p>
<p>72. Mr. Sobers stated that, over the past seven years, the rapporteurship had supported 
and advanced the Durban Agenda in a number of ways, including the above-mentioned 
thematic report on the situation of people of African descent in the Americas; country visits 
and the relevant thematic reports thereon; the technical assistance provided to the Working 
Group of the Permanent Council on the draft convention; and the organization of a major 
conference to mark the International Year for People of African Descent. 
</p>
<p>73. With regard to the challenges faced within the inter-American system in 
implementing and advancing the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, Mr. Sobers 
stated that OAS could improve its capacity to advance the relevant agenda by taking a more 
proactive, programmatic approach when forging and sustaining institutional bonds of 
cooperation with the United Nations, civil society and other relevant actors. 
</p>
<p>74. Lastly, Mr. Sobers updated the Working Group on the process of drafting an inter-
American convention against racism and all forms of discrimination and intolerance, which 
had started in 2005. He noted that, initially, the project was meant to be a compendious 
instrument that covered multiple categories of discrimination. By 2010, however, Member 
States had come to an impasse in negotiations, primarily because they could not agree on 
the scope of the convention and, more specifically, the categories of discrimination.    
</p>
<p>75. In response to the impasse, a proposal was made that the draft convention be split 
into two instruments: one on racism/racial discrimination, and the other on all other types of 
discrimination. This proposal had since been accepted by the Working Group and, 
ultimately, by the General Assembly in 2012.    
</p>
<p>76. The Executive Director of the secretariat of the OIC Independent Permanent Human 
Rights Commission, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh, delivered a presentation on the history of OIC 
engagement with the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, especially with regard 
to one of the key areas of concern for OIC: religious intolerance and the associated 
&#8220;Istanbul process&#8221;. He emphasized the value of OIC as a cross-regional mechanism that 
cooperated and coordinated with other regional organisations at three levels: Member 
States, the secretariat, and the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission. He 
argued for increased attention to Islamophobia as a contemporary form of racism and 
proposed that the focus of the Working Group on international and regional cooperation </p>


<p>and coordination could result in the sharing of experiences in areas such as legislation, 
transposition into national laws, juridical practices and public policies.  
</p>
<p>77. The Director of the European Network against Racism, Catherine Lynch, presented 
the work of the network, which had been created in 2000 as a result of the European Year 
against Racism. She warned that racism within the European Union was on the rise, and 
emphasized the importance of developing a positive narrative on anti-racism and migration. 
She highlighted the need for adequate financial support for non-governmental organizations 
if they were to produce credible data for Governments. 
</p>
<p>78. During the ensuing discussion, the representative of Senegal enquired about the 
reasons for racism in places where there was adequate legislation and political will. He 
asked whether this was due to a lack of understanding of the laws or a lack of capacity. He 
also requested information on the network&#8217;s capacity-building activities.  
</p>
<p>79. The representative of the European Union informed participants on the work of the 
Fundamental Rights Agency, which collected information and data, gave advice to Member 
States and organized expert consultations with other international organizations. She 
enquired about concrete human rights projects on the ground that OIC was undertaking or 
funding in its region.  
</p>
<p>80. The representative of South Africa enquired about the progress that the network has 
made in elaborating a positive narrative on anti-racism and migration, and whether such a 
narrative would be a viable means to counter racism. She asked whether the Independent 
Permanent Human Rights Commission had, or could have in the future, recourse to special 
procedure mechanisms to address human rights violations related to racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>81. The representative of the Czech Republic questioned Mr. Sheikh&#8217;s opinion on the 
need to arrive at an integrated framework for combatting religious intolerance, arguing that 
such a framework already existed in Human Rights Council resolution 16/18, which had 
been adopted by consensus. She also asked how the Independent Permanent Human Rights 
Commission tackled challenges relating to migration within the OIC constituency, and 
about any other challenges in the OIC constituency. 
</p>
<p>82. The representative of Egypt explained that OIC focused on non-discrimination based 
on religion and belief, and did not support the rise of religion above human rights. The 
debate on combating religious intolerance was particularly relevant to the current 
discussion. He asked whether Council resolution 16/18 was sufficient to deal with the rise 
of contemporary forms of racial discrimination, such as Arabophobia and Islamophopbia, 
and whether another resolution was needed to address these issues. He also asked whether 
the rise of racism in Europe could be attributed mainly to the economic crises, and 
suggested that impunity for racist and discriminatory acts might instead be the main reason. 
In his opinion, freedom of opinion seemed to be more safeguarded than the right to be 
protected against hate speech. 
</p>
<p>83. The representative of Morocco highlighted the fact that there was a need to reflect 
more in depth on the reasons for the sudden rise of xenophobia and the issue of impunity, 
and on whether the current legal frameworks relating to discrimination were sufficient. He 
suggested that the relationship between freedom of religion, freedom of expression and 
impunity should be discussed at &#8211; the national, regional and international levels. 
</p>
<p>84. The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expressed appreciation 
for the presentation on the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission, which had 
clarified that OIC made great efforts in the area of cooperation in combating racism. 
Referring to the contemporary unprecedented levels of racism, he noted that discriminatory 
practices could be found in the European Union as anywhere else. He asked Ms. Lynch </p>


<p>about the obstacles that the European Network against Racism had encountered in 
combating racism in general, and with regard to migration in particular. 
</p>
<p>85. In responding to the questions, Mr. Sheikh explained that OIC was now in the 
institution-building phase with regard to human rights. He drew attention to some good 
practices, such as the creation of an OIC observatory on Islamophobia, which produced 
daily, monthly and annual reports. Such a practice should be emulated by other regional 
organizations, as well as by the United Nations itself. He explained that the possibility of 
using special procedures and of dealing with complaints was part of a large toolbox 
available to the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission; the statute of the 
Commission did not prohibit it. Other tools already in use included fact-finding missions, 
with one to Myanmar being currently considered. The Cairo Declaration was the beginning 
of OIC engagement with human rights. The Commission might suggest reconsidering that 
document if they deemed it necessary.  
</p>
<p>86. Mr. Sheikh also elaborated on the complexity of what others called Pakistani 
blasphemy laws. In relation to the adequacy of Council resolution 16/18, Mr. Sheik stated 
that the Istanbul process had built on that resolution in order to address the issues dividing 
the international community. In his opinion, there was a need to explore whether there were 
any gaps in relation to combating racism in legislation, implementation or elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>87. Ms. Lynch, in responding to questions, elaborated on capacity-building activities by 
the European Network against Racism of its members. She reiterated that an increase in the 
severity of racist crimes had been observed, as well as a greater tolerance of racism, which 
could not be attributed to the recession only. While building a positive narrative on anti-
racism and migration on its own would not be sufficient, it was a necessary piece of the 
anti-racism puzzle. She explained that, while non-discrimination legislation was the 
cornerstone of the fight against it, there were other challenges, such as motivating people to 
report racist acts. In her opinion, victims must not only be provided with access to justice, 
but also be reassured that they can trust the justice system and that they can see results.  
</p>
<p>88. Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Professor at the University of Geneva and 
Member of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, presented the Committee&#8217;s 
study on the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights,1 
covering the relevant legal framework, the various modalities of international cooperation 
and the challenges and prospects in this regard. 
</p>
<p>89. During the ensuing discussion, examples of the cooperation of OSCE with various 
agencies in the area of tolerance and non-discrimination were highlighted. In her 
concluding remarks, Ms. Boisson de Chazournes expressed the hope that the work of the 
Advisory Committee would become better known and utilized.  
</p>
<p>90. The Programme Officer from the Social and Human Sciences Sector of the 
UNESCO Office at Windhoek, Obert Lubasi Mutumba, presented the initiative of the 
International Coalition of Cities against Racism and Discrimination, explaining the 
rationale for and history behind its creation and its operational context, providing a 
summary of results achieved to date, some insights into good practices, and considerations 
on lessons learned and the way forward. 
</p>
<p>91. During the ensuing discussion, Mr. Sobers enquired about the inclusion of 
Caribbean cities in the Coalition of Cities against Racism, especially those with significant 
Afro-descendant populations. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/19/74. </p>


<p>92. The representative of the European Union pointed out that the work of the Coalition 
was an interesting example of dealing with discrimination in an urban environment and of 
cooperation at the sub-State level. Asserting that migration towards urban centres was a 
global phenomenon, she enquired whether the Coalition cooperated more closely with other 
regional and United Nations mechanisms with regard to, for example, housing and social 
security.  
</p>
<p>93. The representative of Mexico asked whether the Coalition cooperated with theinter-
American system, about the methodology for designating good practices, and the 
challenges that the Coalition faced in interaction with States.  
</p>
<p>94. The representative of Senegal noted that the Coalition was an interesting example of 
sub-State and decentralized cooperation, given that debates about cooperation were often 
restricted to international and regional dimensions. He asked for more information on 
accession criteria, whether the cities provided legal assistance and information for victims 
of discriminatory acts, and about the means used by municipalities to combat racism. 
</p>
<p>95. The representative of South Africa asked about cooperation with such organization 
as the Southern African Development Community, and invited the presenter to share 
successful trends in addressing the lack of political will.  
</p>
<p>96. The representative of the Association of World Citizens enquired about cooperation 
with the University of Fribourg and the use of the Association&#8217;s study on health 
determinants and of specialized educators, and emphasized the role of youth, local radio 
stations and integration programmes for foreign students after they have finished their 
studies as a means to combat racism. 
</p>
<p>97. The representative of the non-governmental organization Nord-Sud XXI asked 
whether the Coalition disseminated the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and 
expressed his wish to see the organization cooperate with the Coalition. 
</p>
<p>98. In response, Mr. Mutumba explained that the Coalition could hold member cities 
accountable, but this worked only if a real buy-in was ensured. The Coalition advocated for 
its enlargement, but cities themselves had to see the importance of joining; they could not 
be forced to do so. The Coalition provided technical support but did not have a national 
mandate as such. The admissions process consisted of a declaration of intent by the city. 
Member cities had their own advocacy and outreach strategies, which included community 
media (especially in remote areas) and translation into local and indigenous languages. He 
confirmed that Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was the Coalition&#8217;s 
operational basis, and informed participants about the studies that the Coalition had 
conducted in South Africa. With regard to political will, Mr. Mutumba noted that all the 
Coalition could do was to advocate. He ensured the representatives of non-governmental 
organizations the Coalition was highly collaborative, including with academic institutions.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Presentation and adoption of the report on the tenth session 
</b></p>
<p>99. On 8 February 2013, the draft report was adopted ad referendum, and the Working 
Group decided to entrust the Chairperson-Rapporteur with its finalization. </p>

<p>106.<b> The Working Group commends its Chairperson for his efforts in implementing 
recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of the work of IGWG as 
</b></p>
<p><b>contained in the report of its 7th session (paragraphs 101-107) and encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Chairperson to continue in that pursuit. </b></p>


<p>107.<b> The Working Group notes with appreciation the convening of regional and 
national workshops on development and implementation of national action plans

<p>108.<b> The Working Group also reiterates its call on States to draft, revise as 
necessary and fully and effectively implement national action plans against racism,

<p><b>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular as a follow-up 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome of the Durban

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Role of politicians and political parties in combating racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The Working Group reaffirms the critical role, as recognized in the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action and the Outcome Document of the Durban 
</b></p>
<p><b>Review Conference, of political parties and political leaders in combating racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and recalls all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraphs of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p><b>document of the Durban Review Conference;  
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The Working Group urges States to reinforce their commitment to promote 
tolerance and human rights and to fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> The Working Group underlines the key role that all political leaders and 
political parties at every level, can and ought to play in combating racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, thereby contributing to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening democracy. It encourages political parties to take concrete steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote solidarity, tolerance and respect for diversity and human rights. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group stresses the necessity for political leaders and political parties to 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to implement measures in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>121.<b> The Working Group notes that several historical injustices were based on and 
legitimized by messages of racial, religious, national or ethnic hatred disseminated by 
</b></p>
<p><b>political parties and political leaders. 
</b></p>
<p>122.<b> The Working Group considers in this regard unacceptable, when political 
leaders at every level deliver racist speeches and incite hatred and xenophobia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>urges political leaders and political parties, to explicitly and strongly condemn the use 
</b></p>
<p><b>of political platforms to disseminate all political messages and ideas based on racism, 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial superiority or hatred and that incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance as well as combating manifestations of generalized rejection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants.  </b></p>


<p>123.<b> The Working Group underlines the necessity for political leaders and political 
parties at every level to take a strong public stance, concrete measures, actions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies against discourses that propagate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance including when such messages come from their own ranks.  
</b></p>
<p>124.<b> The Working Group encourages all political parties and politicians, at every 
level, to consider undertaking the following measures:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopting action plans against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Encouraging diversity among candidates presented for election and 
</b></p>
<p><b>within their own structures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promoting the development of diversity within political leadership as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>fundamental value of the political systems; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establishing strong, positive and sustained cooperation with the media to 
</b></p>
<p><b>build a platform against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Seeking to promote and achieve the respect for diversity through 
</b></p>
<p><b>political action and legislative measures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Committing to take decisive action against racist discourse; condemn 
</b></p>
<p><b>openly all political messages or discourses that disseminate ideas based on racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>superiority or hatred and that incite racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>125.<b> The Working Group urges all political parties and political leaders at every 
level, to engage with civil society in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b> The Working Group further encourages political parties to develop codes of 
conduct in accordance with international human rights law that include internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>disciplinary measures for violations thereof, so their members refrain from public 
</b></p>
<p><b>statements and actions that encourage or incite racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p>127.<b> The Working Group notes the necessity of implementing existing legislations in 
the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</b></p>
<p><b>These legislations should be comprehensively well drafted to encompass all forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including all its 
</b></p>
<p><b>contemporary forms and manifestations. Related to the foregoing, the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group recognizes that legislation alone, while fundamental, is not sufficient by itself to 
</b></p>
<p><b>respond fully to the challenges of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</b></p>
<p><b>related intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>128.<b> The Working Group further notes that States should focus systematically and 
methodically on the root causes of the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>xenophobia and related intolerance as identified in the Durban Declaration and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Programme of Action and apply a combination of measures towards its elimination. 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>racial and negative stereotypes.

<p>129.<b> The Working Group believes that human rights education and awareness-
raising, including amongst political parties and political leaders, is critical in 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group recommends States to adopt educational campaigns with the aim of </b></p>


<p><b>preventing and combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance. The Working Group emphasizes the importance of the Durban 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration and Programme of Action as an instrumental source for education, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular in the elaboration of educational programmes and plans aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing negative stereotypes that appear to be the enduring legacy of historical 
</b></p>
<p><b>injustices, and in countering all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance, including contemporary ones.  
</b></p>
<p>130.<b> The Working Group recognizes the positive contribution that the exercise of 
the right to freedom of expression particularly by the media and new technologies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the Internet, and full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart 
</b></p>
<p><b>information can make to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance; the Working Group reiterates the need to respect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>editorial independence and autonomy of the media in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>131.<b> The Working Group notes with regret that certain media, by promoting false 
images and negative stereotypes of vulnerable individuals or groups of individuals, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly of migrants and refugees, have contributed to the spread of xenophobic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and racist sentiments among the public and in some cases have encouraged violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>by racist individuals and groups. 
</b></p>
<p>132.<b> The Working Group condemns political platforms and organizations based on 
racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as legislation and practices based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p><b>and related intolerance, as incompatible with democracy and transparent and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable governance. The Working Group reaffirms that racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance condoned by governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies violate human rights and may endanger friendly relations among peoples, 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation among nations and international peace and security.  
</b></p>
<p>133.<b> The Working Group reiterates that the preservation and promotion of 
tolerance, pluralism and respect for diversity is important in producing more 
</b></p>
<p><b>inclusive societies. Furthermore, the Working Group strongly encourages political 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties and political leaders to take actions in their work to combat the continuing 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents of racial or religious intolerance and violence manifested in particular by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>derogatory stereotyping and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or 
</b></p>
<p><b>belief. The Working Group also strongly encourages all political parties and 
</b></p>
<p><b>politicians to take an active and firm stance in combating hate speech, incitement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including vis-&#224;-vis 
</b></p>
<p><b>their own membership and candidates.  
</b></p>
<p>134.<b> The Working Groups invites OHCHR to continue cooperating with the Inter-
Parliamentary Union with a view to mobilizing parliaments and parliamentarians in

<p><b>intolerance.

</b></p>
<p><b>in the full and effective implementation of Durban Declaration and Programme of

<p>136.<b> The Working Group recognizes the importance of cooperation among States, 
relevant international and regional organizations, the international financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions, non-governmental organizations and individuals in the worldwide fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that 
</b></p>
<p><b>success in this fight requires specifically taking into consideration the grievances, 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinions and demands of the victims of such discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>137.<b> The Working Group further recognizes the important role that relevant 
regional bodies, including regional associations of national human rights institutions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>can play in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance, and the key role they can play in monitoring and raising awareness about

</b></p>
<p>138.<b> The Working Group believes that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, including their contemporary forms and manifestations, may 
</b></p>
<p><b>endanger international peace and security and encourages in this respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>international, regional, subregional and non-governmental organizations to take 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventive measures such as awareness-raising campaigns and training activities.   
</b></p>
<p>139.<b> The Working Group thanks participants of regional organizations who 
attended the session and takes note of their presentations, as those presentations 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute to the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme
