<p><b>  Mission to Argentina</b>** *** 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> From 6 to 11 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur on human trafficking, 
especially women and children conducted an official country visit to Argentina at the 
invitation of the Government. The purpose of her mission was to learn about the 
Argentinean legislative and institutional framework and policies in the fight against human 
trafficking, as well as the remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur highlights the positive progress made 
by the Government, such as the adoption of the Law on the Prevention and Punishment of 
Trafficking in Persons and the creation of dedicated offices within the Executive to provide 
victims of trafficking with assistance and to investigate this crime. The Special Rapporteur 
nevertheless observed a number of challenges that the Government must address in order to 
effectively combat trafficking in persons and to protect the human rights of trafficked 
victims. Such challenges include, but are not limited to, the lack of comprehensive data on 
the trend of trafficking in persons; the weak coordination of anti-trafficking activities; the 
lack of identification and referral mechanisms for trafficked persons; and the insufficient 
availability of facilities and services specifically designed to provide trafficked persons 
with direct assistance. On the basis of the above observations, the Special Rapporteur 
addresses a number of recommendations to the Government for further consideration.

<p><b> I. Introduction and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 6 to 11 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur on human trafficking, 
especially women and children undertook an official visit to Argentina at the invitation of 
the Government. She conducted meetings and consultations with relevant stakeholders in 
Buenos Aires and in Posadas, in the province of Misiones. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its hospitality and 
collaboration in facilitating meetings with officials from its various branches as well as for 
its cooperation prior to, during and following the visit.  
</p>
<p>3. In Buenos Aires, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Justice, Security 
and Human Rights and Government officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
Labour, the Interior and Social Development. The Rapporteur also met with the office of 
the Public Prosecutor, representatives of police forces, parliamentarians, a minister of the 
Supreme Court of Justice and other members of the judiciary. Furthermore, she met with 
regional and local authorities in Posadas, and representatives of civil society, including 
non-governmental organizations, academics and lawyers in both Posadas and Buenos Aires. 
</p>
<p>4. The purpose of her mission was to learn about the legislative and institutional 
framework and policies in Argentina in the fight against human trafficking and their 
compliance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator and the staff from the United Nations country team for their strong support 
during the visit. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to receive valuable 
information from representatives of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes in the 
country, as well as from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). She also 
warmly thanks all activists and members of civil society organizations who met with her 
during the mission and provided her with relevant information.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Main findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Forms and manifestations of trafficking in persons  
</b></p>
<p>6. The Argentine Republic, a federation comprised of 23 provinces and the 
autonomous city of Buenos Aires, is a country of origin, transit and destination for victims 
of trafficking in persons. Men, women and children are trafficked to, from and through 
Argentina for the purposes of both sexual and labour exploitation. Given the porosity of the 
borders with Paraguay and Brazil (zone also known as the tri-border area), this is a 
common transit region used by traffickers.  
</p>
<p>7. As a country of destination, women and children are trafficked to Argentina for 
sexual exploitation mainly from Brazil, the Dominican Republic Paraguay and Peru, while 
victims of labour exploitation usually come from Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Paraguay and Peru.1  
</p>
<p>8. With regard to internal trafficking, victims usually move from rural areas and poor 
Northern provinces to wealthier cities and provinces such as Buenos Aires, C&#243;rdoba, Entre

</p>
<p>R&#237;os, La Pampa, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. Northern provinces such as 
Misiones (in the tri-border area), Corrientes, Chaco, Formosa, Santiago del Estero and 
Tucuman are typical recruitment areas for women victims of internal trafficking for sexual 
exploitation.2  
</p>
<p>9. Argentina is also a country of origin and of transit for women and girls destined for 
sexual exploitation in other Latin American countries and in Europe, mainly Italy and 
Spain.  
</p>
<p>10. In December 2001, Argentina experienced a grave political, social and economic 
crisis that produced high levels of unemployment and poverty. Although the country has 
been gradually recovering, a large segment of the country&#8217;s population continues to suffer 
from social exclusion and an inability to fully enjoy their economic, social and cultural 
rights.3 This has profound effects on the vulnerability of potential victims, who are subject 
to falling prey of traffickers when searching for livelihood opportunities beyond their 
places of origin. At the same time, given the economic growth and recovery the country has 
experienced in recent years, and the overall situation of underdevelopment in the region, 
Argentina attracts economic migrants from neighbouring countries who might also become 
victims of trafficking, since they rarely enter the country via regular means.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Trafficking for sexual exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>11. Trafficking networks in Argentina range from complex organizations operating at 
every stage of the trafficking process (recruitment/abduction, transportation and 
exploitation of the victims) to brothel owners who recruit or abduct victims directly to 
exploit them in their own establishments or to sell them to others. As these operators are 
well connected, the same victim exploited in a province can then be easily transported to a 
brothel in Buenos Aires, or abroad. The participation of corrupt public officials and police 
officers facilitates the running of these networks.4  
</p>
<p>12. When victims are not forcefully abducted, they are usually recruited by means of 
false offers for work as waitresses, secretaries, cleaning ladies or nannies. The offers are 
advertised in flyers or classified advertisements in newspapers. Sometimes, girls are invited 
to &#8220;castings&#8221; for modelling or hostessing jobs and promised high earnings and access to a 
luxurious lifestyle.5 It is important to make clear that even in cases in which victims are 
recruited to offer sexual services, they are deceived regarding their eventual working 
conditions. In other cases, it is the victims themselves who are coerced by pimps and 
brothel owners to recruit more women under threat of violence against them or their 
families or as the only means to improve their working conditions. It is also common for 
pimps and traffickers to &#8220;charm&#8221; their victims, becoming their boyfriends and even having 
children with them, later used as a means of coercion and threat to force them to provide 
sexual services.  
</p>
<p>13. Most trafficking victims in Argentina, including those from Paraguay and Brazil, 
come from settings of economic insecurity where their basics needs and those of their 
families are not satisfied and with no real means of social improvement owing to their low 
educational levels.6

<p><b> 2. Trafficking for labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur received information regarding the existence of small textile 
sweatshops run in private family houses throughout the province and the city of Buenos 
Aires where migrant workers are reportedly exploited. The workshops offer their services 
to larger commercial brands, both national and international. Workers are required to work 
and live on the premises, where their documents are withheld and their freedom of 
movement is totally controlled.  
</p>
<p>15. One non-governmental organization has identified approximately 600 clandestine 
workshops in the country working for more than 103 businesses. The organization has 
submitted judicial complaints with the support of the office of the ombudsperson in the city 
of Buenos Aires. It claims, however, that despite submitting proof of bonded labour and 
servitude in both workshops and farms, the responses from the justice system have not been 
appropriate. It has therefore resorted to raising awareness of the problem through 
campaigns and the media, and this has helped in the identification of more sweatshops all 
over the country, as well as the existence of a network linked to important clothing brands. 
</p>
<p>16. The cases reviewed by anti-trafficking non-governmental organizations in Argentina 
reveal that many victims are lured from abroad, mainly from Bolivia (Plurinational State 
of), by fake job advertisements that are sometimes posted in the native language of those 
recruited. Traffickers allegedly operate with the help of transport companies, which 
sometimes make deals with border guards to allow migrants to enter the country without 
the appropriate documents. Villaz&#243;n, Yacuiba and the tri-border area have been identified 
as common entry points for irregular migrants, who are then exploited not only in textile 
workshops but also in agriculture and construction. 
</p>
<p>17. Once the workers arrive, their documents are withheld, they become indebted, are 
subjected to harsh working conditions and enclosed in the workshops, constantly breathing 
fabric dust, which makes them more vulnerable to diseases such as tuberculosis and other 
pulmonary ailments. There are reportedly large numbers of Bolivian migrant workers 
among tuberculosis patients in Buenos Aires public hospitals. 
</p>
<p>18. According to non-governmental organizations working with victims of labour 
exploitation, one of the main shortcomings in the Ministry of Labour is the lack of an 
effective inspections policy. Inspections aimed at investigating the existence of forced 
labour are rarely carried out and, reportedly, fines can easily be converted into bribes.7  
</p>
<p>19. A famous case from 2006 illustrates how judicial proceedings have failed to 
investigate the existence of trafficking networks. On 30 March 2006, in the neighbourhood 
of Caballito in Buenos Aires, a clandestine workshop caught fire and six people (four 
children and two adults) who were locked inside lost their lives. Apparently more than 60 
people were working in the overcrowded and slave-like conditions in the workshop. Many 
of them had been brought from Bolivia (Plurinational State of) under false pretences and 
without regular documents. Although this information pointed clearly towards a situation of 
trafficking in persons, the judge following the case focused only on the causes of the fire 
and only tried those managing the workshop, not the owners, who were not even 
summoned to testify. According to reports by non-governmental organizations, the two 
managers were finally acquitted and the workers were later transferred to other workshops, 
where they continued to face the same exploitative conditions. 
</p>
<p>20. The poultry industry also reportedly resorts to the use of irregular migrant workers, 
sometimes in conditions of forced labour. Investigations carried out by non-governmental 
organizations prove the existence of child labour and slavery in 30 farms owned by one 
</p>
<p>  
 7 The Special Rapporteur received post-mission information from the Government in which it stated 
</p>
<p>that, in raids carried out between December 2010 and March 2011, 567 victims of labour exploitation 
had been rescued from agricultural farms throughout the country. </p>

</p>
<p>company, which commercializes with large grocery stores in Argentina and also exports to 
the European Union. The company is said to operate with impunity, as its owner is related 
to local authorities.  
</p>
<p>21. With regard to agricultural work, sometimes entire families are recruited; although 
just the head of family receives payment, the whole family is encouraged to work in order 
to increase productivity. Reportedly, children are also used in the harvest of onion, garlic 
and carrots. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur heard the heartbreaking story of Oscar, a Bolivian survivor 
of labour exploitation who was forced to work from 16 to 17 hours a day in a poultry farm 
located in the province of Buenos Aires. Oscar and his family worked every day of the 
week and they were not allowed to leave the farm, which was surrounded by an electric 
fence. Not even when his children were sick or injured was Oscar allowed to seek medical 
assistance outside the farm. Oscar explained how the owner of the farm would force his 
wife and young children to help him collect eggs while he had to clean away poultry 
excrement. The work at the farm also involved the handling of pesticides and other toxic 
chemicals without appropriate training or instruments. Reportedly, even young children 
were involved in these tasks. Owing to contact with chemicals and the terrible working 
conditions, Oscar&#8217;s wife suffered a miscarriage and another woman experienced a stillbirth.  
</p>
<p>23. Whenever the workers attempted to complain or threatened to go to the authorities, 
the farm owner would taunt them that their claims would not be taken seriously because 
they were just undocumented immigrants and he was well connected with the authorities. 
Finally, when Oscar had the courage to complain about his situation, he was fired from the 
farm, without receiving pending payments or compensation. 
</p>
<p>24. Oscar explained that, when recruited, Bolivian farm workers were offered good 
working conditions, free housing and salaries ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 pesos. However, 
once in Argentina, they were paid approximately 800 pesos and forced to work in slave-like 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>25. Argentina is party to most major international human rights instruments, including 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the two Optional Protocols 
thereto, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the two Optional Protocols 
thereto, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
and its Optional Protocol, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>26. Argentina has also signed and ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Conventions No.182 concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst forms of Child Labour (1999), No.29 concerning Forced or 
Compulsory Labour (1930) and No. 105 concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour (1957).  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to regional human rights instruments, Argentina is party to the 
American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the American Convention on 
Human Rights, the Inter-American Convention on International Traffic in Minors and the 
Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>28. Article 15 of the Constitution prohibits slavery and penalizes the selling and buying 
of persons. Furthermore, following the constitutional reform of August 1994, under article 
75 (22) of the Constitution, most human rights instruments ratified by Argentina have 
constitutional status and are interpreted as complementary to the rights and guarantees 
recognized in the Constitution.8 These international human rights instruments have the 
same status as all other constitutional provisions and prevail over national and provincial 
law.9 
</p>
<p>29. The Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons (No. 26.364), 
enacted on 29 April 2008, defines the crime of trafficking in persons in accordance with the 
definition set out by the Palermo Protocol and establishes provisions to prevent this crime 
and to provide assistance to victims. The Law amended the Criminal Code (arts. 145 bis 
and ter) prohibiting and punishing all forms of trafficking in persons, of both adults and 
children. It also amended the Code of Criminal Procedures (art. 33) establishing trafficking 
as a crime of federal competency, subject to examination by the federal courts. The Law 
responds to the fact that the crime of trafficking involves movement of victims and 
perpetrators through the country&#8217;s different jurisdictions, especially in the case of internal 
trafficking, and aims to help reduce the possibility of collusion between perpetrators and 
local judicial authorities when crimes are being investigated. 
</p>
<p>30. Briefly before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to Argentina, a new draft of the law 
had been drawn up by the Commission on Women, Family, Childhood and Adolescence 
and the Commission on Penal Legislation of the Chamber of Deputies, with the support of 
several women&#8217;s and human rights organizations. The draft proposal (a) eliminates the 
issue of consent for adult victims; (b) increases minimum penalties;10 (c) establishes new 
penalties for withdrawing, retaining or destroying identification documents;11 (d) 
introduces aggravating circumstances, such as the victim pregnancy or disability; (e) 
creates a national programme to fight against trafficking and assist its victims, which would 
be inter-institutional and monitored by both chambers of Congress; (f) creates a federal 
council headed by the Ministry of Justice, with participation of other ministries, legislators, 
counsellors and the Office of the National Prosecutor; and (g) creates an advisory body 
comprising provincial representatives and members of civil society. The draft is yet to be 
approved by the plenary of the Chamber. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to other laws relevant to the fight against trafficking in Argentina, the 
Special Rapporteur noted the Comprehensive Law on the Prevention, Punishment and 
Elimination of Violence against Women in their Interpersonal Relations (Law No. 26.485). 
The law, together with its byelaw, negotiated in Congress with broad participation of 
women&#8217;s organizations, it includes prevention, assistance and access to justice and security 
</p>
<p>  
 8 The full list includes the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the First the Optional Protocol thereto, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
of the Crime of Genocide, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child. See A/HRC/WG.6/1/ARG/1, para. 6.  
</p>
<p> 9 After being approved by Congress, other treaties and conventions on human rights require the vote of 
two thirds of the members of each Chamber in order to acquire constitutional status. 
</p>
<p> 10 The maximum prison sentence is raised from six to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment. In cases in which the 
victim is under 18 years old, the minimum penalty is raised from four to five years&#8217; imprisonment and 
the maximum penalty from 10 to 15 years. In cases of children under 13 years, penalties are between 
10 and 15 years&#8217; imprisonment.

Criminal Code.  </p>

</p>
<p>provision for victims of gender violence. It also creates a national observatory of violence 
against women to monitor and evaluate the situation of violence against women and the 
programs and policies to address this issue.  
</p>
<p>32. The domestic legal framework dealing with refugees is set out in Refugee Law No. 
26.165 (2006) that establishes a national refugee commission in charge of evaluating 
asylum claims and finding durable solutions for refugees. The law enshrines important 
provisions, ranging from those relating to the refugee status determination procedure to 
those referring to local integration and the search for durable solutions for refugees (such as 
resettlement). The refugee regulation is further complemented by an important number of 
decrees and administrative regulations dealing with specific issues, such as residence 
permits, documentation and extradition, in line with international protection standards.  
</p>
<p>33. Other relevant laws include the Law for the Integral Protection of the Rights of 
Girls, Boys and Adolescents (No. 26.061), which protects in article 9 the child&#8217;s rights not 
to be subjected to any kind of exploitation;12 and Law No. 25.764 on the National 
Programme for the Protection of Witnesses, which is quoted in article 6 (E) of the Law 
against Trafficking.13 
</p>
<p>34. Besides article 145 bis and ter, which specifically criminalize trafficking in persons, 
the Criminal Code establishes other penalties for related crimes, some of which were used 
by judges and prosecutors prior to the enactment of the anti trafficking law in 2008: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Articles 119 and 120: Crimes against sexual integrity (Law No. 25.087) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 125 and 125 bis: promotion and facilitation of child prostitution and 
promotion and facilitation of corruption of minors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 126: promotion and facilitation of prostitution of others 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 127: exploitation of prostitution of others 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 128: child pornography (Law No. 26.388) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 140: reduction to servitude  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 142 bis: illegitimate deprivation of liberty  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>35. A number of institutions are involved in the fight against trafficking in Argentina. 
</p>
<p>36. The Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking was established 
in August 2008 in the Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights by resolution 2149 
and mandated to investigate and prevent the crime of trafficking, as well as to provide 
assistance to trafficking victims up until the moment they testify in a judicial procedure. 
Through Ministry of Justice resolution No. 1679/2008, specialized units were established 
within the Gendarmerie, the Federal Police, the Naval Prefecture and Airport Police to help 
prevent and investigate trafficking in persons. These four security forces depend on the 
Ministry of Justice14 and are part of the Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of 
Trafficking, which runs a shelter to assist victims of trafficking. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
 12 The article also highlights the State&#8217;s ultimate responsibility in protecting the rights of the child by 
</p>
<p>means of a protection system composed of administrative and judicial organisms and protection 
policies. 
</p>
<p> 13 The law provides for the protection of trafficking victims from all kinds of reprisal against them or 
their families, with the possibility of being incorporated to the national programme for the protection 
of witnesses. 
</p>
<p> 14 Following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, she was informed that the Ministry of National Security had 
been created in December 2010 and that the four security forces had been incorporated into it.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>was informed that the Office provides training for security offices and for the judiciary 
throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>37. The Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Extortive Kidnapping works under the Public 
Prosecutor and helps in the investigation of trafficking crimes referred to in articles 145 bis 
and ter of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>38. The National Secretariat of Childhood, Adolescence and Family provides assistance 
to trafficking victims once they have testified in a judicial proceeding. It also provides 
training and capacity-building activities on trafficking and child exploitation to public 
officials throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>39. The Office for the Integral Assistance to Victims of Crime works under the Public 
Prosecutor and is mandated to, inter alia, provide legal advice to victims of crime, 
particularly victims with low incomes, and to direct them to the relevant assistant 
mechanisms, whether State-run or non-governmental. 
</p>
<p>40. The &#8220;victims against violence&#8221; programme, which also operates inside the Ministry 
of Justice, was created to help victims to escape from situations of sexual abuse, domestic 
violence and child exploitation and prostitution. It runs several &#8220;brigades&#8221; that carry out 
street patrolling in Buenos Aires and that receive emergency calls from victims. 
</p>
<p>41. The National Refugee Commission, an inter-ministerial organ working within the 
Ministry of the Interior, is in charge of evaluating asylum claims and finding durable 
solutions for refugees and victims of trafficking with international protection needs.  
</p>
<p>42. The National Programme for the Prevention of Kidnapping and Trafficking of 
Children and the Crimes against their Identity comprises a national information registry of 
lost minors (Law No. 25.746), which aims to centralize and facilitate the sharing of 
information on missing and located children throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>43. The National Commission to Eradicate Child Labour, which was created within the 
Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security in 2000, has led the development of a 
national plan to prevent and eradicate child labour. Since it creation, similar commissions 
have been set up at the provincial level.  
</p>
<p>44. The National Committee of the Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from 
Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism was created within the Ministry of Tourism in 
2007 to promote the adoption of the Code of Conduct by relevant businesses in Argentina. 
The Code is an international initiative launched by ECPAT15 with the support of the World 
Tourism Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF).  
</p>
<p>45. The number of governmental actors involved in the issue of trafficking and the 
consequent challenges in coordination, coupled with existing gaps in terms of the delivery 
of assistance, jeopardize these national anti-trafficking efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>46. Through the establishment of specialized investigative units within four security 
forces &#8211; the Gendarmerie, the Federal Police, the Naval Prefecture and the Airport Police &#8211; 
and with the participation of the Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of 
Trafficking, the authorities have carried out raids to identify victims of trafficking for 
sexual exploitation. Places of exploitation are usually brothels, which offer their services 
through newspapers, presentation cards, flyers and the Internet, and commonly have a front 
as a legitimate business venture, such as a bar or a nightclub.  
</p>
<p>  
 15 ECPAT is a global network of organizations and individuals working to eliminate child prostitution, 
</p>
<p>child pornography and the trafficking of child for sexual purposes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Between the enactment of Law No. 26.362 in April 2008 and August 2010, 613 
raids were carried out by security forces and 605 people were arrested.16 The Special 
Rapporteur did not receive any information on police raids of workshops, farms or other 
businesses where victims of labour trafficking might be exploited.  
</p>
<p>48. Given that the above-mentioned special forces do not have the resources to cover the 
entire country, they often rely on provincial police forces, which sometimes, however, 
collude with brothels owners; when raids are carried out, victims have often already been 
removed from the establishment. Although significant efforts are made to provide local 
forces with adequate training and awareness on trafficking, they still lack the capacity to 
adequately investigate and provide assistance to victims. They are unaware of the specific 
methods required to investigate these cases, which are different to the methods usually 
adopted for other crimes.  
</p>
<p>49. The Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking is mandated to 
participate in interventions and to interview possible victims in order to establish if they 
willingly work in the establishment. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the Office 
has an internal protocol of action for the correct identification of victims of trafficking, 
which establishes the parameters that should be taken into consideration when conducting 
initial interviews; no copy of this protocol, however, was shared with the Special 
Rapporteur. According to an investigation on trafficking cases carried out by a specialized 
research centre in Buenos Aires, the Office was not always summoned to participate in 
police raids. In cases in which it had intervened, it was not clear what criteria had been used 
to identify victims, as it had not been consistent in all the cases analysed. Some non-
governmental organizations have even accused the Office of discouraging potential victims 
to identify themselves as such; according to Government officials, however, only one 
judicial complaint has been made in this regard, and was subsequently dismissed by a 
criminal court in December 2010.17 
</p>
<p>50. Apart from the raids carried out by the police, it is extremely difficult for victims to 
approach the authorities given their lack of trust in the police and their well-founded fear of 
not being adequately assisted and then of being subjected to retaliation by traffickers. The 
Government runs the &#8220;Victims against violence&#8221; programme, which was set up within the 
Ministry of Justice by resolution 314/2006 with the aim of providing assistance to victims 
of violence, whatever its nature, helping them to escape violent situations in safety and to 
guarantee them their rights. The programme targets in particular victims of domestic abuse, 
sexual exploitation and child prostitution and trafficking. It comprises a number of <i>brigadas</i> 
with emergency numbers that operate around the clock:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Brigada ni&#241;@s</b> (0800 number) is a specialized team on sexual commercial 
exploitation of children and adolescents and human trafficking. The team is made up 
of psychologists, social workers and personnel from the Federal Police. It patrols the 
streets of Buenos Aires. Its main objectives are to prevent child sexual and 
commercial exploitation, help victims, raise social awareness of this crime and target 
clients. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Sexual Abuse and Family Violence</b> has an emergency number (137 toll-free) for 
situations of violence. When a call is placed, a car manned by two Federal Police 
officers is sent to the crime scene, accompanied by a psychologist and a social 
worker. They detain the aggressor, offer the victim legal, social and psychological 
aid and/or take her (or him) to a hospital if necessary. A competent judge is 
immediately informed of the situation and a team accompanies the victim for the 
next 72 hours, providing assistance, shelter and legal aid as required.  
</p>
<p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Sexual Violence</b>. A mobile brigade intervenes when a victim of rape or sexual 
violence files a complaint with a police commissary. The mobile brigade comprises 
a psychologist and a social worker, who accompany the victim while filing the 
complaint, giving testimony, receiving medical attention and identifying the 
aggressor. The team also accompanies the victim&#8217;s family, if necessary. The brigade 
operates from a centre where psychologists, social workers, lawyers, a sociologist 
and a gynaecologist offer support. The centre helps anyone who enters directly or is 
referred by a judge.  
</p>
<p>51. The above programme is said to be innovative in that it allows psychologists and 
socials workers to coordinate with police officers when addressing each case, fostering also 
greater awareness and sensitivity among security forces with regard to gender violence. At 
the present time, the programme only operates in the city of Buenos Aires and, although it 
may tend to victims of trafficking, it does not have a specific brigade for cases of human 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>52. One important limitation encountered by the Special Rapporteur was the lack of 
reliable data on victims identified and assisted by the different Government programmes. 
For example, the statistics provided by the Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims 
of Trafficking concern all persons found by the police in raids of establishments and do not 
specify how many of these are eventually identified as trafficking victims and assisted as 
such.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Protection of trafficked persons  
</b></p>
<p>53. The Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking (see paragraph 
37 above) is composed of an interdisciplinary team that includes anti-trafficking divisions 
within the four security corporations in Argentina, in addition to psychologists, doctors, 
social workers and lawyers. The team is mandated to intervene along with the security 
forces from the moment a first contact is established with the victims, whether they have 
been rescued or have escaped from their captors. Anti-trafficking law No. 26.364 
establishes that victims should provide their testimony in special conditions of protection 
and care, and that the interventions of the Office are aimed at guaranteeing that such 
conditions are met.  
</p>
<p>54. Public Prosecutor resolution No. 94/09 features a protocol of action to assist victims 
of trafficking. This was elaborated by the Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Extortive Kidnapping 
(see paragraph 38 above) and the Office for the Integral Assistance to Victims of Crime 
(see paragraph 40 above) in the office of the Attorney General. The resolution provides 
general intervention guidelines to assist victims of trafficking in person in criminal 
processes that lead to their rescue, the adoption of certain legal precautions when taking 
their initial statement to ensure its validity in further stages of the proceedings, and an 
operative guide, to be consulted by prosecutors during the victim&#8217;s testimony which 
systematizes the basic questions required to help clarify the case.  
</p>
<p>55. During this process, the Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of 
Trafficking offers victims psychological, medical and legal assistance and determines if 
they are ready to testify, and under what conditions. A psychologist assists the victims 
throughout the entire judicial proceeding and helps to determine whether the victim is ready 
to testify. If the victim is under 16 years of age, he or she will testify only in the presence of 
a psychologist and not before a judge. Once the victim has testified, the Office ceases to 
provide them assistance and it is the Ministry of Social Development that initiates an 
assistance programme. 
</p>
<p>56. The Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking runs a shelter in 
the city of Buenos Aires, where victims are logged in for the duration of the judicial 
proceedings before they testify. Since opening in February 2010, the shelter has logged in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>60 victims, mostly from Paraguay and Bolivia (Plurinational State of). From the enactment 
of Law 26.364 to December 2009, the Office participated in 384 raids, in which 406 alleged 
perpetrators were detained and 578 victims rescued.  
</p>
<p>57. In the Ministry of Social Development, the National Secretariat of Childhood, 
Adolescence and Family (see paragraph 39 above) currently runs two shelters; at the time 
of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the body was about to open a third. The location of the 
shelters is confidential and is not disclosed to the judicial authorities in order to ensure the 
safety of victims. The body provides victims with medical and psychological assistance, 
recreational activities and educational assistance, among other services. Victims are then 
repatriated after a risk assessment is carried out to ensure they will not be re-victimized. 
IOM is usually summoned to assist with repatriations.  
</p>
<p>58. In 2009, the National Secretariat of Childhood, Adolescence and Family provided 
direct assistance to 146 people, and 48 more were assisted through partner agencies in the 
provinces. Of the total, 52 per cent were victims of trafficking for labour exploitation, 36 
per cent of trafficking for sexual exploitation and 12 per cent were children found in the 
place of exploitation of their families. With regard to nationality, 53 per cent of victims 
were from Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 14 per cent from Paraguay, 14 per cent from 
Argentina, 11 per cent from the Dominican Republic, 5 per cent from Peru and 3 per cent 
from Colombia.18 
</p>
<p>59. A large minority of the victims (43 per cent) were exploited in the province of 
Buenos Aires, but only 38 per cent directly in the city of Buenos Aires. The other victims 
(19 per cent) suffered from exploitation in other provinces, such as Santa Fe, C&#243;rdoba, R&#237;o 
Negro, Santa Cruz, La Pampa, Tierra de Fuego and Chubut. Of the victims assisted in 2009, 
97 per cent of them decided to return to their town or country of origin.  
</p>
<p>60. The National Secretariat of Childhood, Adolescence and Family also provides 
training and capacity-building activities on trafficking and child exploitation throughout the 
country. It carries out awareness-raising campaigns, particularly in areas of recruitment 
such as the tri-border area, working closely with other provinces but also in collaboration 
with other countries, such as Uruguay and Paraguay. It has provided technical assistance to 
relevant authorities in the provinces and, through this work, become aware of the need to 
establish an assistance protocol for victims of trafficking, which was adopted by the Federal 
Council of Childhood, Adolescence and Family in November 2008. 
</p>
<p>61. Most of the work done by the Secretariat is focused on prevention, working with 
low-income families to prevent children from dropping out of school and engaging in child 
labour and/or prostitution. It also aims to change cultural perceptions of sexual exploitation, 
working closely with schools, trade unions, health centres and the media to raise awareness 
at the local level.  
</p>
<p>62. One of the main limitations of the above assistance initiatives is the lack of adequate 
and sufficient shelters. Until recently, only two shelters run by non-governmental 
organizations provided services: one in Tucuman, run by Organizaci&#243;n Mar&#237;a de los 
&#193;ngeles, and the other in Cordoba, run by Hermanas Adoratrices<i>. </i>The Office for the 
Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking opened one shelter in February 2010, and 
the city of Buenos Aires opened another in August 2010 (although the latter is only for 
women and child victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation). The shelters run by the 
Ministry of Social Development do not have the necessary characteristics to cope with 
victims of trafficking; indeed, they are actually shelters for children that allocate a small 
area to trafficking victims. Sometimes the victims are hastily repatriated and not allowed to 
go through an adequate reflection period, affecting thus any judicial procedure. Once 
</p>
<p>  
 18 Statistics provided by the Ministry of Social Development.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>foreign victims are repatriated, IOM may carry out some follow-up on their situation, but 
the same does not apply to victims of internal trafficking.  
</p>
<p>63. The Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Victims of Trafficking mainly operates 
in the province and city of Buenos Aires, and does not have enough resources to 
permanently assist and offer shelter services in other provinces of the country. Furthermore, 
since it only provides assistance to victims until they make a statement in a judicial 
proceeding, there is little follow-up on victims beyond that point. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur visited a privately run shelter that receives some funding 
from the city of Buenos Aires. The funding is actually a small stipend that only applies to 
victims referred to the shelter through the local authorities; victims referred from different 
provinces or arriving on their own are therefore not entitled to such support and the shelter 
needs to cover their expenses independently. In many cases, the type of specialized 
psychological and psychiatric support that these victims need is not available or is 
inadequate in public hospitals, so the shelter needs to resort to private service providers, 
absorbing very high costs.  
</p>
<p>65. At the shelter, the Special Rapporteur heard the story of A, a young victim of 
trafficking for sexual exploitation who arrived at the age of 12 years. A and other young 
girls were sexually abused and exploited by a man who ran a small shop in their 
neighbourhood. From the time an official complaint was filed with the police against A&#8217;s 
trafficker in 2006 until his arrest in 2010, the man remained in contact with his victim, 
constantly harassing her, pressuring her to drop the charges and not to testify against him. 
During that time, he also continued to run a network of sexual exploitation of girls in his 
neighbourhood.  
</p>
<p>66. A&#8217;s reluctance to testify against her exploiter was seen as an obstacle by prosecutors 
handling the case, and the testimonies of non-governmental organizations and other service 
providers assisting her and other of the victims were not taken seriously by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>67. The above case is a clear example of the long delays encountered in investigations 
and of the failure of authorities to address the special needs of trafficking victims during 
judicial procedures. As is common in cases of child sexual abuse, A saw her exploiter as a 
father figure and was initially reluctant to act against him. It took years of therapy and 
support from for A to realize that she had been subjected to exploitation; it was not until she 
decided to denounce his continued harassment that she finally received protective custody 
against her abuser, who was eventually arrested. The support, counselling and protection 
that A received over the years and that eventually led to her recovery were provided and 
funded by the private shelter. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Prosecution of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>68. After the enactment of anti-trafficking law No. 26.364, the crime of trafficking in 
persons was incorporated into the area of competence of the Fiscal Unit of Assistance in 
Extortive Kidnapping (see paragraph 38 above). Through its resolution No. 160/8, the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office approved a plan of action on trafficking in persons, which was 
elaborated by the Unit and aims to provide all federal prosecutors with adequate tools to 
identify, investigate and persecute these crimes and also provide, through the competent 
bodies, adequate assistance to its victims. The plan establishes the provision of: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In situ assistance by Unit officers to help with trafficking investigations carried out 
in each federal prosecutor&#8217;s office  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Useful online information on persons, addresses, document, telephones, and other 
data available through the Unit&#8217;s own records and records to which it has access </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Direct collaboration in investigations when required by the main prosecutor 
investigating the case  
</p>
<p>69. The plan also aims to provide information on the crime of trafficking in persons, 
including case law and jurisprudence, in order to gradually compensate the State&#8217;s limited 
experience in addressing trafficking as a federal crime. Through the plan, prosecutors 
investigating crimes relating to articles 145 bis and ter of the Criminal Code are mandated 
to establish communication with the Unit from the outset, and to demand, if necessary, its 
assistance to guarantee the coordination and use of equal criteria followed by the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>70. Another important Public Prosecutor resolution, No. 99/09, makes reference to the 
work that the Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Extortive Kidnapping has carried out in assisting 
investigations related to trafficking and how it has become clear that the national norms 
regarding the prohibition of brothels are not being observed. Although prostitution is not 
penalized as such, the promotion, facilitation or exploitation of prostitution is prohibited by 
law, including the establishment of brothels. Nevertheless, sexual exploitation has been 
proven to be taking place in these establishments. The resolution calls on all federal 
prosecutors to order the closure of all brothels that operate under the cover of legal 
establishments.  
</p>
<p>71. Through the above resolutions, the Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Extortive 
Kidnapping acquired the faculty to carry out preliminary investigations on trafficking 
activities which have subsequently led to police raids in suspected brothels. Information 
leading to these raids has also been provided by victims, non-governmental organizations, 
consulates, the Office for the Integral Assistance to Victims of Crime and, sometimes, the 
press. However, most criminal investigations into trafficking for sexual purposes are 
brought to justice when victims file a complaint directly, indirectly or anonymously. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to prosecution, the anti-trafficking law has been criticized by several 
women&#8217;s and human rights organizations in the country in that it distinguishes between 
victims who are over 18 years of age and those who are under that age when referring to the 
issue of &#8220;consent&#8221;. In practice, adult victims have had to prove they did not initially consent 
to engage in the activities to which they were subjected and that their exploiters used 
violence, abuse, deceit and so on to force them into such activities. Others argue that it is 
not the law per se that is faulty but rather the way investigations are conducted, as 
prosecutors and judges have lacked the sensitivity to understand that the victim&#8217;s initial 
&#8220;consent&#8221; is coerced and sometimes vitiated by subsequent events, and should therefore not 
have any effect on the way traffickers are prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>73. Other criticisms refer to the weak penalties envisaged by the relevant law in the 
Criminal Code. Traffickers may be subjected to a prison term of three to six years (four to 
ten years in aggravating circumstances)19 if trafficking adults, and a prison sentence of four 
to ten years (and up to 15 years in aggravating circumstances)20 if trafficking children. 
Some organizations have pointed out that the current penalties for stealing livestock in 
some cases might be harsher, ranging from four to ten years in prison.21 However, the 
possibility of increasing further the penalties for trafficking is limited owing to the 
&#8220;proportional&#8221; nature of the Criminal Code, which establishes a maximum penalty of 25 
years of prison for the crime of homicide. As mentioned above, a new draft of the law is to 
</p>
<p>  
 19 Aggravating circumstances refer to (a) when the perpetrator is related to the victim; (b) the crime 
</p>
<p>being committed by more than three people; and (c) the crime having involved more than three 
victims.  
</p>
<p> 20 Aggravating circumstances refer to the victim being under 13 years of age and the means used for 
their recruitment. 
</p>
<p> 21 Criminal Code, art. 167 quater.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>be approved by the plenary of the Chamber, which would eliminate the issue of consent and 
modify penalties imposed to convicted traffickers.  
</p>
<p>74. The crime of trafficking is within federal competence and jurisdiction, although 
many of the crimes associated to trafficking, such as exploitation, reduction to servitude, 
and crimes against sexual integrity, fall inside the competence of local authorities. Since 
trafficking cases are usually detected at the time of exploitation and prosecutors do not 
always have the sensibility to link exploitation with a situation of trafficking, cases tend to 
be addressed by local jurisdiction and are not always channelled to the federal authorities. 
This not only has an impact on the severity of the penalties but may even affect the judicial 
proceedings from the onset if corrupt local authorities are involved with the traffickers. 
According to information received, the few convictions that have been handed down on 
trafficking charges have not reached the highest-ranking members of trafficking networks. 
</p>
<p>75. Another shortcoming identified by the Special Rapporteur was the lack of 
investigations into the financial resources that should be recovered when a trafficking case 
is being handled. This is something that is missing in investigations relating to organized 
crime in general, not just to trafficking. By investigating the financial resources of crime 
with the same rigour and at the same time as the crime itself, the establishing of 
compensation for victims could be easier and performed within the same criminal process. 
</p>
<p><b> F.  Cooperation with civil society  
</b></p>
<p>76. Civil society organizations in Argentina have played a crucial role in raising 
awareness of and fighting against trafficking in persons. The women&#8217;s movement has been 
particularly active in both national and international debates concerning anti-trafficking 
legislation and programmes. Non-governmental organizations in Argentina have also 
played a crucial role in rescuing and providing assistance to victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern the great constraints faced by activists, 
non-governmental organizations and even public servants fighting against human 
trafficking in the country.<b> </b>She met with a judge who is currently under protective custody 
of the Gendarmerie because of threats he received following his intervention in the 
dismantlement of a trafficking network in 2008. The Special Rapporteur also received 
information regarding acts of intimidation against a magistrate in the Province of Rio Negro 
who had been falsely accused of corruption, apparently in retaliation for investigating 
trafficking cases in the region since 2007. 
</p>
<p>78. Non-governmental organizations carry out their work in many provinces of 
Argentina, offering services such as free training and technical assistance to public 
servants, activists and parliamentarians; drafting guidelines and training material on 
trafficking; and opening and managing shelters for victims. They have also helped victims 
to file formal complaints with the judicial system. The organizations provide direct 
assistance to victims and their families, and thus face important financial constraints and 
the threat of reprisals from traffickers. Reports of telephones having been tapped or bugged, 
computers hacked and written threats are common. This is coupled with persecution and 
criticism from certain Government authorities, who discredit their work and sometimes 
even portray them as troublemakers and &#8220;traitors&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> G. International and regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>79. Argentina is part of Ni&#241;@ Sur initiative of the Common Market of the South 
(MERCOSUR) that aims to promote the coordination of national efforts to comply with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the harmonization of national laws with relevant 
international instruments. Through the initiative, the recommendations on the rights of and 
assistance for children and young people who have been victims of trafficking or sexual </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>exploitation were approved in 2006. Another Ni&#241;@ Sur project is the &#8220;Twin Cities&#8221; 
initiative, which is aimed at developing a regional strategy to fight against human 
trafficking and the smuggling of children and adolescents in 15 MERCOSUR border cities. 
It includes prevention and assistance activities designed to improve the living conditions of 
children and adolescents and thus prevent them from becoming potential victims.  
</p>
<p>80. Several governmental agencies also work in cooperation with the United Nations 
system in Argentina. In collaboration with UNICEF, the office of the Ombudsman of 
Buenos Aires has been working on specific projects to help children and adolescents to 
protect themselves when sharing information through social networks and other Internet 
forums. UNICEF has also provided training activities, toolkits and materials to various 
public authorities on issues such as child sexual exploitation and child labour.  
</p>
<p>81. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 
IOM have been providing the executive secretariat of the National Refugee Commission 
with support in training activities relating to trafficking in persons, with the aim of 
improving its ability to identify trafficking victims. Collaboration has also included joint 
eligibility interviews with UNHCR and the elaboration of informative material on 
trafficking and its provision to asylum-seekers and refugees. Argentina has been party to 
the UNHCR Regional Solidarity Resettlement Programme since 2005. Since that year, a 
growing number of refugees has found protection in the country, with one case being of a 
trafficking victim who was at risk in the first country of asylum.22  
</p>
<p>82. Furthermore, Argentina attended and participated in the Regional Conference on 
Refugee Protection and International Migration in the Americas: Protection Considerations 
in the Context of Mixed Migrations, co-organized by IOM and UNHCR and which resulted 
in a series of specific recommendations on trafficking in persons, which are yet to be 
implemented.23 
</p>
<p>  
 22 In line with the needs of the population in the countries of first asylum in the region, in 2008, 
</p>
<p>UNHCR, its implementing partners (HIAS) and the Government of Argentina initiated a project 
aiming to ensure the minimum conditions for facilitating local integration of refugee women at risk 
(namely, women who lack the traditional protection of their families or communities and face 
physical and/or psychological threats, such as rape, sexual harassment, violence, exploitation and 
torture, among others). As a result, five cases (14 people) were resettled between 2008 and 2010, 
many of them under the Woman at Risk criterion. 
</p>
<p> 23 The recommendations on trafficking made at the conference included (a) a joint screening instrument 
should be elaborated by all stakeholders to better identify trafficked persons in mixed migration, and 
to ensure adequate and timely referrals to assistance and protection mechanisms; (b) existing 
cooperation mechanisms should be broadened to include more actors in counter-trafficking initiatives, 
in particular labour ministries and the private sector, given the recognition of the existing nexus 
between trafficking in persons and the dynamics of labour markets; (c) all stakeholders are 
encouraged to strengthen national coalitions against trafficking in persons, and replicate good 
practices in countries that have not yet established such a coalition; (d) States are encouraged to 
integrate counter-trafficking provisions into national legislation and policies concerning migration, 
labour, gender, children and security; (e) States are encouraged to develop common performance 
indicators in the framework of regional mechanisms and national counter-trafficking coalitions to 
facilitate the continual follow-up and evaluation of results of regional and national counter-trafficking 
plans of action; (f) international/regional and civil society organizations are encouraged to carry out a 
regional study to document the trends and characteristics of internal trafficking; (g) States are 
encouraged to replicate the good practice of other States in recognizing refugee status for those 
victims of trafficking who fulfil the refugee criteria; (h) regional forums could be used to enhance 
awareness campaigns and to alert societies of the criminal nature of human trafficking and the 
protection needs of victims. The adoption of guidelines with proper safeguards for the protection of 
victims of human trafficking, as adopted at the Regional Conference on Migration, should be 
replicated in other regional migration forums; and (i) all stakeholders engaged in mixed movement

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Statistical information essential to determine the prevalence rate, forms, trends 
and manifestation of human trafficking is lacking. Although several Government 
agencies come into contact with trafficking victims at different stages, there is no 
harmonized database to register such interaction.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Law on the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons has 
limitations, given the fact that victims over 18 years of age have to prove that they did 
not initially give their consent to engage in activities to which they were subjected, and 
that short sentences are given to convicted traffickers. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Coordination of anti-trafficking activities is weak, especially among 
governmental institutions and between federal and provincial authorities. Although 
the Ministry of Justice at the federal level has established a special office to rescue and 
assist victims of trafficking, the office mainly operates in the province and the city of 
Buenos Aires, and does not have enough resources to permanently assist and offer 
shelter services in other provinces of the country. Furthermore, the office only 
provides assistance to victims until they make a statement in a judicial proceeding; 
little follow-up on victims is provided beyond that stage. There is also a lack of 
appropriate shelters and other direct assistance for victims, including men. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Protection and access to justice are inadequate, including in the case of witness 
protection for victims and their families before and after trial. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Although the Ministry of Social Development, through its Secretary for 
Childhood, Adolescence and the Family, may provide assistance to victims of 
trafficking once they have gone through a judicial procedure, there is little follow-up 
after they have been repatriated or resettled, and lack of resources make it difficult 
for the institution to provide comprehensive assistance to victims sufficient to 
guarantee their well-being and to ensure that they do not fall back into trafficking 
networks.  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Trafficking in children, particularly for the purposes of bonded labour/peonage 
and forced prostitution, is an especially worrying issue. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The safety and security of persons involved in fighting trafficking in persons 
and providing assistance and support to victims is not guaranteed.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> Tools and referral mechanisms are not effectively in place for easy 
identification of victims, especially at the point of entry or of first contact with law 
enforcement agents. Currently, there are no solid and well-functioning inter-agency 
procedures in place to deal with victims of trafficking with international protection 
needs. The National Refugee Commission has never had a case of trafficking referred 
by relevant authorities, such as the Fiscal Unit of Assistance in Extortive Kidnapping 
or the National Secretariat of Childhood, Adolescence and Family. For this reason, 
the challenge of establishing mechanisms to better identify, refer and process asylum 
claims from potential victims in compliance with international protection needs 
remains. 
</b></p>
<p>  
management should be trained to identify trafficked persons, to appreciate the different forms of 
human trafficking and to be sensitive to the protection needs of women and of 
unaccompanied/separated children in particular. </p>

</p>
<p>91.<b> The capacity to address certain human trafficking issues is poor, including the 
sensitive issue of police corruption and of other members of the security forces 
directly involved in the implementation of the anti-trafficking measures taken by the 
Government, especially at the provincial level, where they receive bribes and collude 
with traffickers, who are thus able to evade arrest and prosecution.  
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> Trafficking for labour exploitation is on the rise, but hidden. Labour inspectors 
appear not to have the necessary capacity for effective oversight. 
</b></p>
<p> <b>B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Argentina: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Approve the proposed amendments to Law No. 26.364 in order to 
guarantee more stringent penalties against traffickers and to eliminate the issue of 
consent and distinction based on age; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Allocate adequate resources to existing anti-trafficking offices and units 
within the Government to ensure that protection and assistance measures are carried 
out throughout the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Provide holistic, reintegration and rehabilitative assistance to victims of 
trafficking, in full recognition of their human rights. Programmes of assistance to 
victims should be made available &#8211; not just in the city of Buenos Aires, but in all 
provinces &#8211; to reach victims of trafficking and potential victims who might fall prey to 
trafficking, without discrimination on grounds of sex, gender and/or sexual 
orientation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establish a federal central agency to enhance coordination, not only 
among federal offices and units that have already been set up to combat trafficking in 
persons and assist victims, but also between them and authorities at the provincial and 
municipal levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e)  Demonstrate serious commitment and political will as part of the 
prevention effort to regulate businesses, such as within the textile industry, 
agriculture (including fisheries) and construction, as well as in the entertainment and 
sex industry; Adequate inspections should be carried out to ensure that these 
businesses are not involved in trafficking or using trafficked persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Make adequate budget allocations to improve the effectiveness and 
sustainability of anti-trafficking initiatives, including financial support for civil society 
organizations currently providing victims of trafficking with assistance through their 
own (scarce) human and financial resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Establish a zero-tolerance policy with regard to corruption to ensure 
that any State agent involved in the crime of trafficking is duly prosecuted and 
severely punished; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Develop a comprehensive, holistic and integrative national plan of action 
on combating trafficking in persons that clearly sets out strategic objectives, allows 
for cooperation among State authorities, as well as between them and civil society 
organizations, and produces measurable indicators and monitoring and evaluation 
tools. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Consider establishing a special fund for the compensation of victims of 
trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Raise public awareness on the issue of human trafficking by means of the 
media, information and communications technology and other channels that appeal 
particularly to the young, including at all levels of education;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/35/Add.4</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Carry out a national study in collaboration with United Nations agencies 
and international organizations to inform evidence-based interventions, thus 
heightening the effectiveness and sustainability of actions to combat human 
trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Scale up capacity-building training of all actors, especially the Police, the 
Gendarmerie, naval, airport and border guards, as well as of judges, prosecutors and 
labour inspectors, to increase their knowledge and skills to identify, protect and assist 
victims of trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Strengthen labour laws and raise public awareness, especially in migrant 
communities, on labour rights to check exploitative labour, which is rampant in the 
informal sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Guarantee the safety of and protection for human rights defenders 
involved in the campaign to end human trafficking; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Strengthen cooperation with neighbouring countries and other countries 
of origin of victims of trafficking, in particular Bolivia (Plurinational State of), the 
Dominican Republic and Paraguay;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) Implement relevant training and capacity-building activities for 
authorities, including measures to establish a proper referral system to the refugee 
status determination procedure, as a mean to ensure that the right of victims to seek 
and be granted asylum, when appropriate, is fully respected; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (q) Improve witness protection programmes and allow for an adequate 
reflection period for victims before judicial proceedings or repatriation, and work 
with countries of origin to ensure that victims are not re-trafficked or re-victimized; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) Design, adopt and disseminate comprehensive checklists and protocols 
that assist in the prompt identification and referral of victims and potential victims of 
trafficking at the first point of contact. 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> Action should be taken by the Parliament to transform the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children to 
attain a constitutional status and become enforceable throughout Argentina. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the acceptance by Argentina of a refugee 
victim of trafficking under the resettlement programme in 2009, and encourages the 
Government to continue to use resettlement as a response to trafficking victims with 
international protection needs. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The National Refugee Commission, with the technical assistance of UNHCR, 
should develop a full set of standard operating procedures, with the full participation 
of other stakeholders, including civil society. The procedures should include different 
measures to improve the identification, referral, risk assessment, social assistance and 
coordination among governmental and non-governmental actors to respond 
effectively to trafficking victims with international protection needs.
