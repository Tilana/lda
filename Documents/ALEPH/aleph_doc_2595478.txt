Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Certain matters contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the
safe harbor protections provided under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Form 10-Q regarding the prospects of our industry,
our anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects,
outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters, may constitute forward-looking statements. In
addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "may," "will,"
"expect," "intend," "estimate," "foresee," "project," "anticipate," "believe," "plans," "forecasts," "continue" or "could" or the
negative of these terms or variations of them or similar terms. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct. These
forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks, and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Factors that might
cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K, entitled "Risk Factors," risk factors discussed in other reports and documents that we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the following:
The closing, expected timing, and benefits of the proposed transaction pursuant to which we will acquire all of the
outstanding common units of our subsidiary, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. (“Rose Rock”), not already owned by us;
Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our debt obligations and our current and
expected dividends or to fund our other liquidity needs;
The ability of our subsidiary, Rose Rock, to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to provide the level of cash
distributions we expect;
Any sustained reduction in demand for, or supply of, the petroleum products we gather, transport, process, market and
store;
The effect of our debt level on our future financial and operating flexibility, including our ability to obtain additional capital
on terms that are favorable to us;
Our ability to access the debt and equity markets, which will depend on general market conditions and the credit ratings
for our debt obligations and equity;
•The loss of, or a material nonpayment or nonperformance by, any of our key customers;
•The amount of cash distributions, capital requirements and performance of our investments and joint ventures;
•The amount of collateral required to be posted from time to time in our purchase, sale or derivative transactions;
•The impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions;
•Our ability to obtain new sources of supply of petroleum products;
•Competition from other midstream energy companies;
Our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our credit agreements and the indentures governing our senior
notes, including requirements under our credit agreements to maintain certain financial ratios;
•Our ability to renew or replace expiring storage, transportation and related contracts;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•The overall forward markets for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;
The possibility that the construction or acquisition of new assets may not result in the corresponding anticipated revenue
•
increases;
•Changes in currency exchange rates;
•Weather and other natural phenomena, including climate conditions;
•A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates;
The risks and uncertainties of doing business outside of the U.S., including political and economic instability and changes
in local governmental laws, regulations and policies;
Costs of, or changes in, laws and regulations and our failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations,
particularly with regard to taxes, safety and protection of the environment;
•
•

•The possibility that our hedging activities may result in losses or may have a negative impact on our financial results; and
•General economic, market and business conditions.
New factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements emerge
from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors, or the extent to which any such factor or
combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statement.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, which
reflect management’s opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise
or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements.

SEMGROUP CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
 
1.OVERVIEW
SemGroup Corporation is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The terms "we," "our," "us,"
"SemGroup," "the Company" and similar language used in these notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements refer to SemGroup Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Basis of presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which is derived from audited financial
statements, and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that, in the
opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company and the results of its
operations and its cash flows.
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our controlled subsidiaries. All significant
transactions between our consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Although management believes these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from
these estimates. The results of operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.
Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not
include all of the information and notes normally included with financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform
previously reported balances to the current presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31,
2015, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC.
Our significant accounting policies are consistent with those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-
13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which
introduces new guidance for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses
and the timing of the recognition of such losses. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted in the year prior to the effective
date. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2020. The impact is not expected to be material.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting'', which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-
based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We will
adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017. The impact is not expected to be material.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)", which amends the existing lease guidance to
require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by operating
and finance leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. This
ASU also provides clarifications surrounding the presentation of the effects of leases in the income statement and
statement of cash flows. For public entities, this ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim periods within those years. The new guidance shall be applied using a modified retrospective approach
and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our
consolidated financial statements. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
1.OVERVIEW, Continued
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes", which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial
position. For public entities, this ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those years. The new guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is
permitted. We have not determined which method we will apply when we adopt the standard. We will adopt this guidance
in the first quarter of 2017. The impact is not expected to be material.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory", which
requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value rather
than the lower of cost or market. The standard will be effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The new guidance shall be applied prospectively
and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2017. The impact is not expected to be
material.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”, which is designed to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs. The standard
requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-15, “Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt
Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff
Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting,” which amended the SEC paragraphs of ASC Subtopic 835-30 to include
the language from the SEC Staff Announcement indicating that the SEC would not object to presenting deferred debt
issuance costs related to line-of-credit agreements as assets and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance
costs ratably over the term of the agreement. The standards are effective for U.S. public companies for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The new guidance has been applied on a retrospective basis for all periods
presented. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. The impact was not material. For presentation purposes,
$16.8 million of debt issuance costs which had previously been reported as other noncurrent assets were reclassified as a
reduction of long-term debt on the December 31, 2015 balance sheet. Capitalized loan fees related to our revolving credit
facilities continue to be presented as other noncurrent assets.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis,” which adds requirements that limited partnerships must meet to qualify as voting interest entities and modifies
the evaluation of whether limited partnerships are variable interest entities or voting interest entities. It also eliminates the
presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. This guidance is effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016. The
impact was not material.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," which supersedes nearly all
existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").
The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services.
ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may
be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard permits
using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in
each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the
cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote
disclosures). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one
year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08 which amended the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance
set forth in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the
principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-10 which amended certain aspects of the guidance related to identifying performance obligations and
licensing implementation within ASU 2014-09. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12 which narrows the scope
around certain aspects of the criterion used in determining when to recognize revenue. We are currently evaluating the
impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the
method by which we will adopt the standard. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018.

2.ROSE ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P.
We control the operations of our consolidated subsidiary, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. (NYSE: RRMS) ("Rose Rock"),
through our ownership of the general partner interest. As of June 30, 2016, we own the 2% general partner interest and a
55.1% limited partner interest. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2015-02, Rose Rock is considered to be a variable
interest entity due to the limited partners' lack of substantive kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We will
continue to consolidate Rose Rock as we are the primary beneficiary due to our general partner interest, majority limited
partner interest and incentive distribution rights.
Rose Rock's assets are pledged as collateral under its senior secured revolving credit facility agreement. The credit
agreement restricts Rose Rock’s ability to make certain types of payments relating to its units, including the declaration or
payment of cash distributions; provided that Rose Rock may make quarterly distributions of available cash so long as no
default under the agreement then exists or would result therefrom. The agreement is guaranteed by all of Rose Rock’s
material domestic subsidiaries and secured by a lien on substantially all of the property and assets of Rose Rock and the
guarantors, subject to customary exceptions. Rose Rock's creditors have no recourse to the credit of SemGroup.
Cash distributions
We receive distributions from Rose Rock on our common units, our 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution
rights. Rose Rock intends to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.3625 per unit, to the extent it has sufficient
available cash, as defined in Rose Rock’s partnership agreement.

Pending acquisition of outstanding common units
On May 30, 2016, SemGroup entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Rose Rock
whereby SemGroup would acquire all of the outstanding common limited partner units of Rose Rock not already
beneficially owned by SemGroup in exchange for shares of SemGroup Class A common stock. Each common limited
partner unit of Rose Rock would be acquired in exchange for 0.8136 shares of SemGroup Class A common stock.
Subsequent to the transaction, Rose Rock would be wholly owned by SemGroup or would be merged into SemGroup.
If completed, the merger will be accounted for in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 810,
Consolidation - Overall - Changes in a Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary. As SemGroup controls Rose Rock and
will continue to control Rose Rock after the merger, the changes in SemGroup’s ownership interest in Rose Rock will be
accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in SemGroup’s consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the merger.
Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (i) majority approval of Rose Rock common
unitholders; (ii) all material required governmental consents and approvals having been received; (iii) the absence of legal
injunctions or impediments prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) the effectiveness of a
registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of SemGroup Class A common stock to be issued in
exchange for Rose Rock common limited partner units; (v) approval of the listing on the New York Stock
Page 11

SEMGROUP CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
2.ROSE ROCK MIDSTREAM, L.P., Continued
Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, of the SemGroup Class A common stock to be issued; and (vi) majority
approval by SemGroup stockholders of the SemGroup Class A common stock issuance.
A subsidiary of SemGroup which beneficially owns a majority of Rose Rock's common units has agreed to deliver a written
consent approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreement.
The Merger Agreement provides for certain termination rights for Rose Rock. The Merger Agreement provides that upon
termination of the Merger Agreement (i) in connection with the failure of the stockholders of SemGroup to approve the
SemGroup stock issuance, SemGroup will pay Rose Rock's out-of-pocket expenses in an amount up to $3.8 million and
(ii) in connection with a change by SemGroup of its recommendation in favor of approval of the SemGroup stock issuance
under certain circumstances, SemGroup will pay to Rose Rock a termination fee in the amount of $15.5 million. Under no
circumstance will SemGroup be required to both reimburse Rose Rock's expenses and pay Rose Rock the termination fee.
Rose Rock’s currently outstanding senior notes will remain outstanding after the merger is consummated, and no “change
of control” will occur thereunder. It is currently contemplated that SemGroup and its subsidiaries that currently are
guarantors of SemGroup’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of Rose Rock’s senior notes once the merger
is consummated. In addition, it is currently contemplated that Rose Rock and its subsidiaries that currently are guarantors
of Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of SemGroup’s senior notes and secured revolving credit
facility once the merger is consummated. In connection with the consummation of the merger, Rose Rock’s existing senior
secured revolving credit facility is contemplated to be terminated and SemGroup’s senior secured revolving credit facility is
contemplated to be amended and upsized to cover the needs of the combined company. SemGroup is currently
considering consummating certain internal “clean-up” mergers after the merger occurs, which would ultimately result in
Rose Rock merging into SemGroup, with SemGroup being the surviving entity of that merger. If SemGroup determines to
consummate these internal mergers after the merger occurs, SemGroup, upon consummation of these internal mergers,
would directly assume and become the successor issuer of Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes.

The equity in earnings of White Cliffs for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is less than 51%
of the net income of White Cliffs for the same periods. This is due to certain general and administrative expenses we incur
in managing the operations of White Cliffs that the other owners are not obligated to share. Such expenses are recorded by
White Cliffs and are allocated to our ownership interest. White Cliffs recorded $0.4 million and $0.4 million of such general
and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. White Cliffs recorded $0.9
million and $0.7 million of such general and administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,

NGL Energy Partners LP
At June 30, 2016, we no longer own common units representing limited partner interests in NGL Energy Partners LP
(NYSE: NGL) ("NGL Energy"). On April 27, 2016, we sold all of our NGL Energy limited partner units for $13.00 per unit
and recorded a $9.1 million gain on disposal. We continue to hold an 11.78% interest in the general partner of NGL Energy
which is being accounted for under the equity method in accordance ASC 323-30-S99-1, as our ownership is in excess of
the 3 to 5 percent interest which is generally considered to be more than minor.
The general partner of NGL Energy is not a publicly traded company. The information below pertains to our limited partner
and general partner investments in NGL Energy.
See Note 4 for discussion of the other-than-temporary impairment of our common unit investment in NGL Energy.
Under the equity method, our policy is to record our equity in earnings of NGL Energy on a one-quarter lag, as we do not
expect to have information on the earnings of NGL Energy in time to consistently record the earnings in the quarter in
which they are generated.
During the three months ended December 31, 2015, NGL issued common units which diluted our limited partnership
interest. As we record activity on a one-quarter lag, we recognized a non-cash loss of $41.0 thousand associated with
these issuances for the six months ended June 30, 2016. In the first quarter of 2015, NGL announced several transactions
in which they issued common units publicly and privately which diluted our limited partnership interest. As we record
activity on a one-quarter lag, we recognized a non-cash gain of $5.9 million associated with these issuances in the second
quarter of 2015.

4.IMPAIRMENTS
SemGas goodwill impairment
In March 2016, our SemGas segment revised the volume forecast for its northern Oklahoma system based on revised
volume forecasts provided by certain producers who have chosen to adjust plans for production following release of the
Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Regional Earthquake Response Plan that curtails the amount of volume that can be
injected into disposal wells.  
Based on the reduction to our forecast, we tested our SemGas segment's long-lived assets, finite-lived intangible assets
and goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2016. No impairment was indicated for SemGas' long-lived assets and finite-lived
intangible assets based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. However, we did record an impairment of SemGas'
goodwill for the entire balance of $13.1 million.
To test the goodwill for impairment, we used an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to calculate the fair
value of the reporting unit. Under the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair
value of our SemGas operations. Significant judgments and assumptions included the discount rate, anticipated revenue
and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and
capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. A significant underlying assumption is that commodity prices will eventually
improve, water injection issues will be resolved and production volumes will begin to increase. If production does not
increase in the future or the production takes longer than anticipated to return, this would negatively affect our key
assumptions and potentially lead to finite-lived intangible and long-lived asset impairments in the future. We considered
the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of
comparable companies for reasonableness.
Other-than-temporary impairment of equity method investment in NGL Energy
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the market price of NGL Energy common units fell below our carrying value per unit and
remained below our carrying value as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2015, in accordance with ASC 320-10-S99
“Investments - Debt and Equity Securities” we assessed whether such decline in value was other-than-temporary. During
this initial assessment, the decrease in value was determined not to be other-than-temporary. The evidence management
considered in such assessment included the nature and volatility of such decline, as well as the latest public financial
guidance, condition, and results of NGL Energy. Subsequently, we continued to monitor events and developments and,
based on NGL Energy's April 21, 2016 announcement of a reduction in its quarterly distribution and lowering of financial
performance guidance for the most recent quarter, we concluded that the decline in the value of our investment is other-
than-temporary as of March 31, 2016. As such, we recorded an impairment of $39.8 million to our investment in the limited
partner units of NGL Energy for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The value of our limited partner investment in NGL
Energy was written-down to the market price of $11.04 on December 31, 2015, the date through which we have recorded
our equity in earnings as discussed in Note 3. See Note 3 for discussion of the sale of our NGL Energy limited partner units
on April 27, 2016.
Our investment in the general partner of NGL Energy is not considered to be impaired. There is no readily available market
price for our general partner investment as these units are not publicly traded. Based on the relatively low book value of our
general partner investment, the value of incentive distribution rights and comparable general partner transactions, we do
not believe our investment in the general partner of NGL Energy is impaired.
5.SEGMENTS
Our businesses are organized based on the nature and location of the services they provide. Certain summarized
information related to our reportable segments is shown in the tables below. None of the operating segments have been
aggregated. Although Corporate and Other does not represent an operating segment, it is included in the tables below to
reconcile segment information to that of the consolidated Company. Eliminations of transactions between segments are
also included within Corporate and Other in the tables below.
The accounting policies of each segment are the same as the accounting policies of the consolidated Company.
Transactions between segments are generally recorded based on prices negotiated between the segments. Certain
general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level were allocated to the segments based on our
allocation policies in effect at the time.

5.SEGMENTS, Continued
Our equity investment in NGL Energy was previously included within the SemStream segment. However, in the second
quarter of 2016, we disposed of our limited partner interest in NGL Energy. Subsequent to this disposal, amounts related to
our remaining general partner investment in NGL Energy are not material and are not expected to be material for the
foreseeable future. As our investment in NGL Energy is the only asset of SemStream, we have ceased to report
SemStream as a segment. Prior period amounts have been recast to include the former SemStream balances as part of
Corporate and Other. See Note 3 for additional information.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, management made the decision to disaggregate certain activities and
functions within the domestic crude oil business to provide additional granularity, both internally and externally, to our
operating results. As such, the prior period results of the former Crude segment have been recast to reflect the resulting
reportable segments: Crude Transportation, Crude Facilities and Crude Supply and Logistics. Certain amounts formerly
included in the Crude segment have been included in Corporate and Other in the current presentation. No other segments
were impacted. Additionally, current year activity includes intersegment revenues generated by our Crude Transportation
and Crude Facilities segments for services provided to our Crude Supply and Logistics segment. With the exception of
intersegment trucking revenues of our Crude Transportation segment, these intersegment charges did not exist in the prior
year.

7.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair value of financial instruments
We record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each balance sheet date. The tables below summarize the
balances of commodity derivative assets and liabilities at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

Commodity derivatives:
Assets
Liabilities
*Relates primarily to exchange traded futures. Gain and loss positions on multiple contracts are settled net on a daily basis
with the exchange.
"Level 1" measurements are based on inputs consisting of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. These include commodity futures contracts that are
traded on an exchange.
"Level 2" measurements are based on inputs consisting of market observable and corroborated prices for similar derivative
contracts. Assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 include over the counter ("OTC") traded physical fixed priced
purchases and sales forward contracts.
"Level 3" measurements are based on inputs from a pricing service and/or internal valuation models incorporating
observable and unobservable market data. These include commodity derivatives, such as forwards and swaps for which
there is not a highly liquid market and therefore are not included in Level 2 above.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the measurement requires judgment and may
affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value levels. At June 30, 2016, all of our
physical fixed price forward purchases and sales contracts were being accounted for as normal purchases and normal
sales.
There were no financial assets or liabilities recorded at fair value which were classified as Level 2 or Level 3 during the
three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. As such, no rollforward of Level 3 activity has been
presented.
Commodity derivative contracts
Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for petroleum products.
This exposure to commodity price risk is managed, in part, by entering into various commodity derivatives.
Page 19
Table of Contents
SEMGROUP CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
7.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, Continued
We seek to manage the price risk associated with our marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through
(i) the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of petroleum products to create back-to-back transactions that are
intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing, location or quality of the petroleum products purchased and
delivered or (ii) derivative contracts. Our storage and transportation assets can also be used to mitigate time and location
basis risks, respectively. All marketing activities are subject to our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which
establishes limits in order to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure.
Our commodity derivatives can be comprised of swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts of crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids. These are defined as follows:
Swaps – OTC transactions where a floating price, basis or index is exchanged for a fixed (or a different floating) price,
basis or index at a preset schedule in the future, according to an agreed-upon formula.
Futures contracts – Exchange traded contracts to buy or sell a commodity. These contracts are standardized by the
exchange in terms of quality, quantity, delivery period and location for each commodity.
Forward contracts – OTC contracts to buy or sell a commodity at an agreed upon future date. The buyer and seller agree
on specific terms (price, quantity, delivery period and location) and conditions at the inception of the contract.
The following table sets forth the notional quantities for commodity derivative instruments entered into (in thousands of
barrels):

We have posted margin deposits as collateral with brokers who have the right of set off associated with these funds. At
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our margin deposit balances were in a net asset position of $5.1 million and $2.9
million, respectively. These margin account balances have not been offset against our net commodity derivative instrument
(contract) positions. Had these margin deposits been netted against our net commodity derivative instrument (contract)
positions as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we would have had net asset positions of $4.8 million and $2.6

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, one customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment accounted for more
than 10% of our consolidated revenues at approximately 33%. We purchased approximately $39.5 million of product from
one third-party supplier of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, which represented approximately 11% of our costs of
products sold.
At June 30, 2016, two third-party customers, primarily of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, accounted for
approximately 42% of our consolidated accounts receivable.
8.INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate was 32% and 34% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively and 128% and
36% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Significant items that impacted the effective tax rate
for each period, as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, include earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at
lower rates and a non-controlling interest in Rose Rock for which taxes are not provided. Further, the foreign earnings are
taxed in foreign jurisdictions as well as in the U.S., since they are disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. These combined factors, and the magnitude of the permanent items impacting the tax rate relative to income
from continuing operations before income taxes result in rates that are not comparable between the periods.
We have a valuation allowance on a small portion of our state net operating loss carryovers with shorter carryover periods
and our foreign tax credit carryover. We have not released the valuation allowance on the foreign tax credits due to the
foreign tax credit limitation and the relative subjectivity of forecasts of the relational magnitude of U.S. and foreign taxable
income in future periods, as well as the shorter carryover period available for the credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when a determination is made that it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized based on the weight of all available evidence. Evidence which is objectively verifiable carries a
higher weight in the analysis. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient
taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward period available under the tax law.
Sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future earnings and available
tax planning strategies.
We have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal, state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income
tax returns and determined that no accruals related to uncertainty in tax positions are required. All income tax years of the
Company ending after the emergence from bankruptcy remain open for examination in U.S. jurisdictions under general
operation of the statute of limitations, including special provisions with regard to net operating loss carryovers. In foreign
jurisdictions, all tax periods prior to the emergence from bankruptcy are closed. The statute of limitations has not been
waived with respect to any foreign jurisdictions post emergence and tax periods are open for examination in accordance
with the general statutes of each foreign jurisdiction. Currently, there are no examinations in progress for our federal and
state jurisdictions. Canada Revenue Agency has initiated an income tax audit of SemCAMS ULC for the tax years 2013
and 2014. No other foreign jurisdictions are currently under audit.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $5.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of interest
expense related to $300 million of 7.50% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "SemGroup Notes") including the
amortization of debt issuance costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $11.7 million and
$11.7 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the SemGroup Notes including the amortization of debt issuance

At June 30, 2016, we had no outstanding cash borrowings on our $500 million revolving credit facility.
At June 30, 2016, we had outstanding letters of credit under the facility of $6.0 million, for which the rate in effect was 2.0%.
We incurred interest expense related to the SemGroup revolving credit facility of $1.2 million and $1.0 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. We
incurred interest expense related to the SemGroup revolving credit facility of $2.6 million and $2.0 million for the six months

the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $11.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, of interest
expense related to the Rose Rock 2022 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs.
Rose Rock senior unsecured notes due 2023
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “Rose Rock 2023 Notes”),
which were issued on May 14, 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $5.2 million and
$2.7 million, respectively, of interest expense related to the Rose Rock 2023 Notes including amortization of debt issuance
costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $10.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of
interest expense related to the Rose Rock 2023 Notes including amortization of debt issuance costs.
Rose Rock revolving credit facility
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had $41.0 million of outstanding cash borrowings under the $585 million Rose Rock
revolving credit facility, which incurred interest at the alternate base rate ("ABR"). At June 30, 2016, the interest rate in
effect on ABR borrowings was 5.25%.
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had $37.7 million in outstanding letters of credit, and the rate in effect was 2.75%.
Rose Rock had $18.9 million of secured bilateral letters of credit outstanding at June 30, 2016. The interest rate in effect
was 1.75%. Secured bilateral letters of credit are external to the facility and do not reduce availability for borrowing on the
revolving credit facility.
We incurred $1.6 million and $2.0 million of interest expense related to this facility during the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs. We incurred $3.1 million
and $4.2 million of interest expense related to this facility during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, including letters of credit and amortization of debt issuance costs.
SemMexico revolving credit facility
At June 30, 2016, SemMexico had a $100 million Mexican pesos (U.S. $5.4 million at the June 30, 2016 exchange rate)
revolving credit facility, which matures in May 2018. There were no outstanding borrowings on the facility at June 30, 2016.
Borrowings are unsecured and bear interest at the bank prime rate in Mexico plus 1.50%.
At June 30, 2016, SemMexico had an outstanding letter of credit of $292.8 million Mexican pesos (U.S. $15.8 million at the
June 30, 2016 exchange rate). The letter of credit was issued for a fee of 0.25%.
Capitalized interest
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized interest of $1.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
Fair value
We estimate the fair value of the SemGroup Notes, the Rose Rock 2022 Notes and the Rose Rock 2023 Notes to be $290
million, $352 million and $305 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016, based on unadjusted, transacted market prices near
the measurement date, which are categorized as Level 2 measurements. We estimate that the fair value of our revolving
long-term debt was not materially different than the reported values at June 30, 2016, and is categorized as a Level 2
measurement. It is our belief that neither the market interest rates nor our credit profile have changed significantly enough
to have had a material impact on the fair value of our revolving debt outstanding at June 30, 2016.
10.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Bankruptcy matters
On July 22, 2008 (the "Petition Date"), SemGroup, L.P. and certain subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Also on July 22, 2008, SemGroup, L.P.'s Canadian subsidiaries filed for creditor
protection in Canada. Later during 2008, certain other U.S. subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization. While in
bankruptcy, SemGroup, L.P. filed a plan of reorganization with the court, which was confirmed on October 28, 2009
Page 23

10.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, Continued
(the "Plan of Reorganization"). The Plan of Reorganization determined, among other things, how pre-Petition Date
obligations would be settled, the equity structure of the reorganized company upon emergence and the financing
arrangements upon emergence. SemGroup Corporation emerged from bankruptcy protection on November 30, 2009 (the
"Emergence Date").
Claims reconciliation process
A large number of parties made claims against us for obligations alleged to have been incurred prior to our predecessor's
bankruptcy filing. We have resolved or settled all of these outstanding claims and have made all required distributions. The
Plan of Reorganization has therefore been fully administered. On November 7, 2014, SemGroup Corporation and the other
reorganized debtors moved for a final decree from the bankruptcy court closing the debtors’ bankruptcy cases. The United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware granted the request and entered its Order Granting Motion of
Remaining Debtors for Entry of Final Decree on December 18, 2014. Accordingly, the bankruptcy cases for SemCrude,
L.P., Eaglwing, L.P., SemCanada II, L.P., SemCanada L.P., SemGas, L.P., SemGroup, L.P., SemMaterials, L.P., and
SemStream, L.P. have been closed. As part of its decree, the Court retained jurisdiction over certain on-going adversary
proceedings, but the debtors have estimated and paid the claims associated with these remaining adversaries, leaving the
non-debtor parties to the adversaries to resolve their remaining claims amongst themselves. On January 2, 2015, Bettina
M. Whyte, the duly appointed Trustee of the SemGroup Litigation Trust (the “Litigation Trustee”), filed a notice of appeal of
the Bankruptcy Court’s December 18, 2014 order closing the aforementioned bankruptcy cases. However, the Bankruptcy
Court’s order of final decree was effective upon entry, and the appeal does not stay the effect of the order. The Litigation
Trustee’s appeal to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware is currently pending and will be opposed by
SemGroup Corporation and the other remaining reorganized debtors.
Dimmit County, TX claims
An employee of Rose Rock Midstream Field Services, LLC was involved in a tractor trailer accident on January 15, 2015 in
Dimmit County, Texas.  A second accident followed resulting in six fatalities and multiple injuries.  Multiple lawsuits
involving claims of wrongful death and personal injury were filed in Zavala County and Dimmit County, Texas.  These
lawsuits have been consolidated in the District Court, 293rd Judicial District, Zavala County, Texas, as cause number 15-
01-13356-ZCV, Maribel Rodriguez and the Estate of David Rodriguez, et al., vs. Rose Rock Midstream Field Services,
LLC, SemGroup Corporation, Rose Rock Midstream, L.P. and SemManagement LLC, et al.  Confidential settlement
agreements have been entered into with all plaintiffs.  There are pending claims with one defendant/cross-plaintiff for
which a Motion for Summary Judgment has been filed, however, the hearing date has not been set.  We believe that any
liability that may arise from this action will be within the limits covered by our insurance.  We will continue to defend our
position, however we cannot predict the outcome.
Environmental
We may, from time to time, experience leaks of petroleum products from our facilities and, as a result of which, we may
incur remediation obligations or property damage claims. In addition, we are subject to numerous environmental
regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the assessment of fines or penalties by regulatory
authorities.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment ("the KDHE") initiated discussions during our bankruptcy proceeding
regarding six of our sites in Kansas (five owned by Crude Transportation and one owned by SemGas) that KDHE believed,
based on their historical use, may have had soil or groundwater contamination in excess of state standards. KDHE sought
our agreement to undertake assessments of these sites to determine whether they are contaminated. We reached an
agreement with KDHE on this matter and entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order with KDHE to conduct
environmental assessments on the sites and to pay KDHE’s costs associated with their oversight of this matter. We have
conducted Phase II investigations at all sites. Four sites are in various stages of follow up investigation, remediation,
monitoring, or closure under KDHE oversight.  The environmental work at these sites is being completed under consent
orders between Rose Rock Midstream Crude, LP and the KDHE. Two of the remaining sites have limited impacts to
shallow soil and groundwater and the groundwater is currently being monitored on a semi-annual basis until such time that
closure can be granted by the KDHE.  No active remediation is anticipated for these two sites.  The final two sites have
required additional investigation and soil and groundwater remediation may be necessary to achieve KDHE closure. We
do not anticipate any penalties or fines for these historical sites.

10.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, Continued
We received a Notice of Probable Violation and Civil Penalty dated March 29, 2016 from the U.S. Department of
Transportation (the “Notice”) for alleged violations of pipeline operation and maintenance regulations related to a 2014
crude oil release that occurred on our Blackwell to See pipeline segment located in Oklahoma.  This pipeline segment was
idled in March 2016 when we initiated service on our new pipeline segment that transports Kansas crude volumes to our
Cushing, Oklahoma terminal.  The Notice proposes a penalty of $600,200. We responded to the Notice in April 2016 with
information that we believe warrants reduction of the amount of the proposed penalty.
Other matters
We are party to various other claims, legal actions, and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion
of our management, the ultimate resolution of these claims, legal actions and complaints, after consideration of amounts
accrued, insurance coverage and other arrangements, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently uncertain, and estimates
of our consolidated liabilities may change materially as circumstances develop.
Asset retirement obligations
We will be required to incur significant removal and restoration costs when we retire our natural gas gathering and
processing facilities in Canada. At June 30, 2016, we have an asset retirement obligation liability of $18.0 million, which is
included within other noncurrent liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. This amount was calculated
using the $126.0 million cost we estimate we would incur to retire these facilities, discounted based on our risk-adjusted
cost of borrowing and the estimated timing of remediation.
The calculation of the liability for an asset retirement obligation requires the use of significant estimates, including those
related to the length of time before the assets will be retired, cost inflation over the assumed life of the assets, actual
remediation activities to be required, and the rate at which such obligations should be discounted. Future changes in these
estimates could result in material changes in the value of the recorded liability. In addition, future changes in laws or
regulations could require us to record additional asset retirement obligations.
Our other segments may also be subject to removal and restoration costs upon retirement of their facilities. However, we
are unable to predict when, or if, our pipelines, storage tanks and other facilities would become completely obsolete and
require decommissioning. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability or corresponding asset, as both the amount and
timing of such potential future costs are indeterminable.
Purchase and sale commitments
We routinely enter into agreements to purchase and sell petroleum products at specified future dates. We account for
derivatives at fair value with the exception of commitments which have been designated as normal purchases and sales for
which we do not record assets or liabilities related to these agreements until the product is purchased or sold. At June 30,
2016, such commitments included the following (in thousands):

Fixed price purchases
 $218,212
Fixed price sales
Floating price purchases12,701  $601,820
Floating price sales
17,773  $786,992
Certain of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to
sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty. Many of the commitments shown in the
table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within the time frame specified in the agreement
(generally 30 to 120 days).
Our SemGas segment has a take-or-pay contractual obligation related to the fractionation of natural gas liquids through
June 2023. The approximate amount of future obligation is as follows (in thousands):

SemGas also enters into contracts under which we are responsible for marketing the majority of the gas and natural gas
liquids produced by the counterparties to the agreements. The majority of SemGas’ revenues were generated from such
contracts.
Rose Rock has a take-or-pay obligation with our equity method investee, White Cliffs, for approximately 5,000 barrels per
day of space on White Cliffs' pipeline. The agreement became effective in October 2015 and has a term of 5 years. Annual
payments to White Cliffs under the agreement are expected to be $9.4 million.

There were no significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss to net income for the three

Equity issuances
On June 22, 2016, we issued and sold 8,625,000 shares of our Class A common stock, valued at $27.00 per share, to the
public for proceeds of $228.5 million, net of underwriting fees and other offering costs of $4.3 million. Proceeds were used
to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility and will be used for future capital expenditures and general corporate
purposes.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued 30,718 shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
157,077 shares related to our equity based compensation awards.
Equity-based compensation
At June 30, 2016, there were 797,812 unvested shares that have been granted under our director and employee
compensation programs. The par value of these shares is not reflected in common stock on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet, as these shares have not yet vested. For certain of the awards, the number of shares that will vest is
contingent upon our achievement of certain specified targets. If we meet the specified maximum targets, approximately
408,000 additional shares could vest.
The holders of certain restricted stock awards are entitled to equivalent dividends (“UDs”) to be received upon vesting of
the related restricted stock awards and will be settled in cash. At June 30, 2016, the value of the UDs to be settled in cash
related to unvested restricted stock awards was approximately $390 thousand.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we granted 548,143 restricted stock awards with a weighted average grant
date fair value of $19.20 per award.

12.EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share is calculated based on income from continuing and discontinued operations less any income
attributable to noncontrolling interests. Income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents third-party limited partner
unitholders' interests in the earnings of our consolidated subsidiary, Rose Rock.  Rose Rock allocates net income to its
limited partners based on the distributions pertaining to the current period's available cash as defined by Rose Rock's
partnership agreement. After adjusting for the appropriate period's distributions, the remaining undistributed earnings or
excess distributions over earnings, if any, are allocated to Rose Rock's general partner, limited partners and participating
securities in accordance with the contractual terms of Rose Rock's partnership agreement and as further prescribed under
the two-class method. Incentive distribution rights do not participate in undistributed earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of unvested equity compensation awards.
The following summarizes the calculation of basic earnings per share for the three months and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

restrictions upon the ability of the Parent or any of the Guarantors to obtain funds from its respective subsidiaries by
dividend or loan. None of the assets of the Guarantors represent restricted net assets pursuant to Rule 4-08(e)(3) of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act.

SEMGROUP CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
15.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING GUARANTOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
In June 2015, SemCanada, L.P. and SemCanada II, L.P. were released as Guarantors and no longer guarantee our
SemGroup Notes. Prior period comparative information has been recast to reflect SemCanada, L.P. and SemCanada II,
L.P. as non-guarantors.
Unaudited condensed consolidating financial statements for the Parent, the Guarantors and non-guarantors as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented on
an equity method basis in the tables below (in thousands).
Intercompany receivable and payable balances, including notes receivable and payable, are capital transactions primarily
to facilitate the capital needs of our subsidiaries. As such, subsidiary intercompany balances have been reported as a
reduction to equity on the condensed consolidating Guarantor balance sheets. The Parent's net intercompany balance,
including note receivable, and investments in subsidiaries have been reported in equity method investments on the
condensed consolidating Guarantor balance sheets. Intercompany transactions, such as daily cash management activities,
have been reported as financing activities within the condensed consolidating Guarantor statements of cash flows. The
Parent's investing activities with subsidiaries, such as the drop down of Wattenberg Holding, LLC and Glass Mountain to
Rose Rock in the first quarter of 2015, have been reflected as cash flows from investing activities. Quarterly cash
distributions from Rose Rock representing a return on capital have been included in the Parent's cash flows from
operations. These balances are eliminated through consolidating adjustments below.

Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with
the SEC.
Overview of Business
Our business is to provide gathering, transportation, storage, distribution, marketing and other midstream services primarily
to producers, refiners of petroleum products and other market participants located in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain
regions of the United States of America (the "U.S.") and Canada. We, or our significant equity method investees, have an
•
•
•
•
asset base consisting of pipelines, gathering systems, storage facilities, terminals, processing plants and other distribution
assets located between North American production and supply areas, including the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain
and Western Canadian regions. We also maintain and operate storage, terminal and marine facilities at Milford Haven in
the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") that enable customers to supply petroleum products to markets in the Atlantic Basin. We
also operate a network of liquid asphalt cement terminals throughout Mexico. Our operations are conducted directly and
indirectly through our primary business segments – Crude Transportation, Crude Facilities, Crude Supply and Logistics,
SemGas®, SemCAMS, SemLogistics and SemMexico.
Our Assets
At June 30, 2016, our segments owned the following:
Crude Transportation operates crude oil pipelines and truck transportation businesses in the U.S. Crude Transportation’s
assets include:
a 388-mile crude oil gathering and transportation pipeline system with over 630,000 barrels of associated storage capacity
in Kansas and northern Oklahoma that is connected to several third-party pipelines and refineries;
the Wattenberg Oil Trunkline ("WOT"), a 75-mile, 12-inch diameter crude oil gathering pipeline system that transports
crude oil from production facilities in the DJ Basin to the pipeline owned by White Cliffs Pipeline, L.L.C. ("White Cliffs").
The WOT has a capacity of approximately 85,000 barrels per day as well as 360,000 barrels of operational storage;
a 16-mile crude oil pipeline that connects our Platteville, Colorado crude oil terminal to the Tampa, Colorado crude oil
market;
•a crude oil trucking fleet of over 270 transport trucks and 270 trailers;
Maurepas Pipeline, a project underway to build three pipelines to service refineries in the Gulf Coast region, which is
expected to be completed in the early part of 2017;
a 51% ownership interest in White Cliffs, which owns a 527-mile pipeline, consisting of two 12-inch common carrier, crude
oil pipelines, that transports crude oil from Platteville, Colorado to Cushing, Oklahoma (the "White Cliffs Pipeline"); and
a 50% ownership interest in Glass Mountain Pipeline, LLC ("Glass Mountain"), which owns a 215-mile crude oil pipeline
in western and north central Oklahoma ("the Glass Mountain Pipeline").
•Crude Facilities operates crude oil storage and terminal businesses in the U.S. Crude Facilities assets include:
approximately 7.6 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma, of which 6.25 million barrels are
leased to customers and 1.35 million barrels are used for crude oil operations and marketing activities; and
a 30-lane crude oil truck unloading facility with 350,000 barrels of associated storage capacity in Platteville, Colorado
which connects to the origination point of the White Cliffs Pipeline.
Crude Supply and Logistics operates a crude oil marketing business which utilizes our Crude Transportation and Crude
Facilities assets for marketing purposes. Additionally, Crude Supply and Logistics' assets include:
•approximately 61,800 barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Trenton and Stanley, North Dakota.
SemGas, which provides natural gas gathering and processing services in the U.S. SemGas owns and operates
gathering systems and four processing plants with 595 million cubic feet per day of capacity.

Outlook and Recent Developments
We expect commodity prices to remain challenged and costs of capital to remain sharply higher throughout 2016 as
compared to 2015. Fee-based and take-or-pay arrangements are a significant component of our portfolio, which serves to
somewhat reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows. However,
producer activities are being impacted by lower energy commodity prices which will reduce our volumes. The credit
profiles and financial prospects of certain of our producer customers have been challenged by the current market
conditions, which ultimately may result in further reductions of our volumes, or in re-negotiation of certain contractual
provisions affecting our revenues. Such reductions as well as further or prolonged declines in energy commodity prices
may result in non-cash impairments of our assets.
Certain of our producer customers operating in Oklahoma have chosen to adjust plans for production following the release
of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's Regional Earthquake Response Plan (the "OCC Plan") which curtails the
amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells.
On April 27, 2016, we sold all of our NGL Energy limited partner units for $13.00 per unit. We recorded a gain of $9.1
million in the second quarter related to this transaction. Subsequent to this transaction, our remaining general partner
investment in NGL Energy is not material and is not expected to be material for the foreseeable future. As our investment in
NGL Energy is its only asset, SemStream is no longer a reportable segment and its historical results have been included
with Corporate and Other.
On May 1, 2016, Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and Midstates Petroleum Company LLC (together, “Midstates”), a
customer of our SemGas segment, announced that they have filed for voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code.  The bankruptcy court granted Midstates' motions seeking authority to pay expenses
associated with production operation activities, drilling and completion activities, costs associated with gathering,
processing, transportation and marketing, and expenses related to joint interest billings for non-operated properties.  As a
result, we do not currently expect this event to have a material impact on our financial condition or future results of
operations.
On May 30, 2016, SemGroup entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Rose Rock
whereby SemGroup would acquire all of the outstanding common limited partner units of Rose Rock not already
beneficially owned by SemGroup in exchange for shares of SemGroup Class A common stock. Each common limited
partner unit of Rose Rock would be acquired in exchange for 0.8136 shares of SemGroup Class A common stock.
Subsequent to the transaction, Rose Rock would be wholly owned by SemGroup or would be merged into SemGroup.
If completed, the merger will be accounted for in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 810,
Consolidation - Overall - Changes in a Parent’s Ownership Interest in a Subsidiary. As SemGroup controls Rose Rock and
will continue to control Rose Rock after the merger, the changes in SemGroup’s ownership interest in Rose Rock will be
accounted for as an equity transaction and no gain or loss will be recognized in SemGroup’s consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the merger.
Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (i) majority approval of Rose Rock common
unitholders; (ii) all material required governmental consents and approvals having been received; (iii) the absence of legal
injunctions or impediments prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iv) the effectiveness of a
registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of SemGroup Class A common stock to be issued in
exchange for Rose Rock common limited partner units; (v) approval of the listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject
to official notice of issuance, of the SemGroup Class A common stock to be issued; and (vi) majority approval by
SemGroup stockholders of the SemGroup Class A common stock issuance.
A subsidiary of SemGroup which beneficially owns a majority of Rose Rock's common units has agreed to deliver a written
consent approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by such agreement.
Page 42
Table of Contents
The Merger Agreement provides for certain termination rights for Rose Rock. The Merger Agreement provides that upon
termination of the Merger Agreement (i) in connection with the failure of the stockholders of SemGroup to approve the
SemGroup stock issuance, SemGroup will pay Rose Rock's out-of-pocket expenses in an amount up to $3.8 million and
(ii) in connection with a change by SemGroup of its recommendation in favor of approval of the SemGroup stock issuance
under certain circumstances, SemGroup will pay to Rose Rock a termination fee in the amount of $15.5 million. Under no
circumstance will SemGroup be required to both reimburse Rose Rock's expenses and pay Rose Rock the termination fee.
Rose Rock’s currently outstanding senior notes will remain outstanding after the merger is consummated, and no “change
of control” will occur thereunder. It is currently contemplated that SemGroup and its subsidiaries that currently are
guarantors of SemGroup’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of Rose Rock’s senior notes once the merger
is consummated. In addition, it is currently contemplated that Rose Rock and its subsidiaries that currently are guarantors
of Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes will provide guaranties of SemGroup’s senior notes and secured revolving credit
facility once the merger is consummated. In connection with the consummation of the merger, Rose Rock’s existing senior
secured revolving credit facility is contemplated to be terminated and SemGroup’s senior secured revolving credit facility is
contemplated to be amended and upsized to cover the needs of the combined company. SemGroup is currently
considering consummating certain internal “clean-up” mergers after the merger occurs, which would ultimately result in
Rose Rock merging into SemGroup, with SemGroup being the surviving entity of that merger. If SemGroup determines to
consummate these internal mergers after the merger occurs, SemGroup, upon consummation of these internal mergers,
would directly assume and become the successor issuer of Rose Rock’s outstanding senior notes.
On June 23, 2016, U.K. voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union ("EU"). It is currently unknown what, if
any, impact this will have on our SemLogistics segment. Oil trading and storage is not expected to be significantly
impacted as a whole. However, SemLogistics receives and delivers products to the EU and tariffs and taxes related to
these transactions could change subsequent to the U.K.'s exit from the EU. Additionally, it is uncertain what changes in
legislation will occur subsequent to the exit which could impact our business.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
We define Adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives.
Adjusted gross margin is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of
this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results
of operations. Operating income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted gross margin. Our non-GAAP
financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all,
items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider Adjusted gross margin as
a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted gross margin may be defined differently
by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.
Management compensates for the limitation of Adjusted gross margin as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable
GAAP measure, understanding the difference between Adjusted gross margin on the one hand, and operating income on
the other hand, and incorporating this knowledge into its decision-making processes. We believe that investors benefit
from having access to the same financial measure that our management uses in evaluating our operating results.

Revenue and Expenses
Revenue and expenses are analyzed by operating segment below.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expenses of each corporate department are allocated to the segments based on criteria such
as actual usage, headcount and estimates of effort or benefit. The method for allocating cost is based on the type of service
being provided. For example, internal audit costs are based on an estimate of effort attributable to a segment. In contrast,
accounting department costs are allocated based on the number of transactions processed for a given segment compared
to the total number processed.
Interest expense
Interest expense increased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $18.9 million from $16.8 million in the three

months ended June 30, 2015. Interest expense increased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $37.8 million from
$31.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015. In both cases, the increase is primarily due to the issuance of $350
million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes on May 14, 2015 by Rose Rock.

Loss (gain) on sale or impairment of equity method investment
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we sold all of our NGL Energy limited partner units and recorded a $9.1
million gain on the sale of equity method investments. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a $30.6
million net loss on sale or impairment of equity method investment compared to a $14.5 million gain from sales of limited
partner units of NGL Energy for the same period in 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a $39.8
million impairment to our equity method investment in NGL Energy based on a fair value of the common units being lower
than the book value and NGL Energy's announced decreases in distributions and guidance. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, this impairment was offset by gains described above on the sale of common units of NGL Energy.
Income tax expense (benefit)
We reported an income tax benefit of $16.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of
$19.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The effective tax rate was 32% and 34% for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively and 128% and 36% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Significant items that impacted the effective tax rate for each period, as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%,
include earnings in foreign jurisdictions taxed at lower rates and a non-controlling interest in Rose Rock for which taxes
are not provided. The foreign earnings are taxed in foreign jurisdictions as well as in the U.S., since they are disregarded
entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These combined factors, and the magnitude of the permanent items
impacting the tax rate relative to income from continuing operations before income taxes result in rates that are not
comparable between the periods.

Adjusted gross margin
Adjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services, which are included in service
revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). As there is
no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Crude Transportation revenue, Adjusted gross margin is
equivalent to revenue for this segment. This segment's prior year revenue included product revenue related to certain
commodity purchase and sales activity performed around our pipelines. In the current year, these product revenues are
reflected in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and have been replaced in the Crude Transportation segment with
intersegment transportation fees which have been charged to Crude Supply and Logistics and which are reported as
service revenue. With the exception of intersegment truck transportation charges, these intersegment charges did not exist
in the prior year.

Three months ended June 30, 2016 versus three months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Pipeline transportation revenue decreased to $6.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $8.4 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The change is due to a decrease in fixed margin activity which is now reported with
other product revenues in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and was replaced in the Crude Transportation segment
with intersegment usage fees. Beginning January 2016, Crude Transportation is charging Crude Supply and Logistics to
move barrels through the pipeline system.
Truck transportation revenue decreased to $14.1 million in three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $17.6 million
for the same period in 2015 as a result of lower volumes.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased to $16.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $21.1 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease included reductions to field expenses of $1.4 million, maintenance and repair
of $1.4 million, allocated overhead of $1.3 million, outside services expense of $1.1 million and office expense of $0.3
million. These costs were partially offset by increases in employment costs, insurance and taxes and other expenses of
$0.7 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense decreased to $1.1 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $2.6 million
in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is a result of a reduction in overhead allocation of $1.7 million,
partially offset with an increase in outside services and insurance and taxes of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $6.2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $9.0
million in the three months ended June 30, 2015. Approximately $3.2 million of the decrease in depreciation expense is
due to prior year expense related to the revision of the estimated useful life relating to a 163-mile section of the Kansas and
Oklahoma pipeline system. Project completions increased depreciation expense by $0.2 million. Amortization expense
related to customer relationship intangible assets of our truck transportation operations increased by $0.2 million.
Loss (gain) on disposal of long-lived assets, net
Crude Transportation recorded a loss on disposal of long-lived assets of $1.7 million in the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to a gain of $22 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The loss in the three months ended
June 30, 2016 is the result of an abandonment of a 13-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system.
Earnings from equity method investments
Crude Transportation’s earnings from equity method investments decreased slightly in the three months ended June 30,
2016, to $17.1 million from $17.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 versus six months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Pipeline transportation revenue decreased to $14.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $16.2 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015. The change is due to a decrease in fixed margin activity, which is now reported with
other product revenues in the Crude Supply and Logistics segment and was replaced in the Crude Transportation segment
with intersegment usage fees. Beginning January 2016, Crude Transportation is charging Crude Supply and Logistics to
move barrels through the pipeline system.
Truck transportation revenue decreased to $30.4 million in six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $33.9 million for
the same period in 2015 as a result of lower volumes.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased to $35.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $39.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease included reductions to maintenance and repair of $3.0 million, allocated overhead of
$2.4 million, outside services expense of $1.7 million, field expenses of $0.6 million and office expense of $0.6 million.
Page 46
Table of Contents
These costs were partially offset by increases in employment costs, insurance and taxes, rent, travel and other expenses of
$2.7 million, $1.3 million, $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense decreased to $2.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $4.5 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is a result of a reduction in overhead allocation of $2.4 million, partially
offset with increases in outside services and insurance and taxes of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $12.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $17.7
million in the six months ended June 30, 2015. Approximately $6.3 million of the decrease in depreciation expense is due
to prior year expense related to the revision of the estimated useful life relating to a 163-mile section of the Kansas and
Oklahoma pipeline system. Project completions increased depreciation expense by $0.2 million. Amortization expense
related to customer relationship intangible assets of our truck transportation operations increased by $0.4 million.
Loss (gain) on disposal of long-lived assets, net
Crude Transportation recorded a loss on disposal of long-lived assets of $1.8 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to a loss of $133 thousand in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The loss in the six months ended June
30, 2016 is primarily the result of an abandonment of a 13-mile section of the Kansas and Oklahoma pipeline system.
Earnings from equity method investments
Crude Transportation’s earnings from equity method investments decreased slightly to $37.9 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016, from $38.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015.

Adjusted gross margin
Adjusted gross margin in this segment is generated by providing fee-based services. Revenues from fee-based services
are included in service revenue in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income (loss). As there is no cost of sales or derivative activity associated with our Crude Facilities revenue, Adjusted
gross margin is equivalent to revenue for this segment.
Three months ended June 30, 2016 versus three months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Revenue increased to $12.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $11.4 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Effective January 2016, Crude Facilities began charging Crude Supply and Logistics for the use of
storage and unloading facilities. As a result, the increase was primarily due to intersegment pump-over activity of $1.2
million, the addition of intersegment storage of $1.2 million and intersegment unloading activity of $0.1 million. These
increases were partially offset by a reduction in third-party storage revenue of $0.7 million, as the average capacity used
internally for crude oil operations and marketing activities increased to 1.3 million barrels from 1.1 million barrels, third-
party unloading revenue of $0.3 million and third-party pump-over of $0.1 million.

Operating expense
Operating expense increased to $2.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $2.4 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015, as a result of increased repair and maintenance expenses.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense remained constant at $1.0 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $1.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $1.4
million in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to incremental expense due to project
completions between periods.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 versus six months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Revenue increased to $25.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $22.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Effective January 2016, Crude Facilities began charging Crude Supply and Logistics for the use of storage
and unloading facilities. As a result, the increase was primarily due to intersegment pump-over activity of $2.7 million,
intersegment storage of $2.4 million and intersegment unloading activity of $0.2 million. These increases were partially
offset by a reduction in third-party storage revenue of $1.2 million, as the average capacity used internally for crude oil
operations and marketing activities increased to 1.3 million from 1.1 million, and hird-party unloading revenue of $1.2
million.
Operating expense
Operating expense showed a slight decrease in the six months ended June 30, 2016, at $4.5 million compared to $4.7
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily as a result of a reduction in field expense.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense increased to $2.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $1.8 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015, largely due to higher overhead expense allocations.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $3.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $2.8 million
in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to incremental expense due to project completions

Adjusted Gross Margin
This segment's Adjusted gross margin decreased slightly in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $11.3 million from
$11.4 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in barrels sold, as described
above, and offset by a lower spread between the acquisition and sale price for volumes of crude oil sold, as the excess of
our average sales price per barrel over our average acquisition cost per barrel decreased to approximately $0.63 in the
three months ended June 30, 2016, from approximately $0.83 in the same period in 2015. The increase in volume was
primarily due to crude oil blending and transactions related to contango market conditions.
Operating expense
Operating expense increased to $0.7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $0.2 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is due to higher employment costs of $0.4 million, outside services of $0.1
million and other expense of $0.1 million.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense increased to $0.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $0.2 million

Revenue
Revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $50.7 million from $66.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is the result of lower prices, lower volume (28,464 MMcf versus 37,305 MMcf), and
decreased gathering and processing fees ($10.9 million versus $15.7 million). The decrease in revenue was affected by a
lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $1.95/mmbtu versus $2.64/mmbtu offset by an increase in the average NGL
basket price to $0.67/gallon in the three months ended June 30, 2016 versus $0.55/gallon for the same period in 2015. The
decrease in volume is primarily a result of decreased drilling and production in the area served by our gas plants in
northern Oklahoma, which is caused by continued reduction in capital expenditures and new production.

Costs of products sold
Costs of products sold decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $27.2 million from $36.2 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily related to lower volume and prices as described above.
Operating expense
Operating expense increased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $8.9 million from $8.8 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is due to higher maintenance and repairs of $1.3 million and $0.3 million in
property taxes. These increases were offset by decreases in outside services, equipment leases, field expenses (which
includes materials and supplies, lubricants, water disposal, electricity and fuel), and employee related expenses of
approximately $0.5 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.2 million, respectively.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense decreased slightly in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $2.4 million from $2.6

Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $9.2 million from $7.4
million in the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily incremental assets placed in-service since the
prior year due to expansion in northern Oklahoma.

Net loss on disposal or impairment decreased from a loss of $1.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to
the prior year write down of certain gas gathering and compression assets in Kansas to their estimated net realizable
value.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 versus six months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Revenue decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $97.0 million from $133.0 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. This decrease is the result of lower prices, lower volume (60,402 MMcf versus 72,824 MMcf) and

decreased gathering and processing fees ($23.7 million versus $30.2 million). The decrease in revenue was affected by a
lower average natural gas NYMEX price of $2.02/mmbtu versus $2.81/mmbtu offset by higher average NGL basket price of
$0.59/gallon versus $0.56/gallon for the same period in 2015. The decrease in volume is primarily a result of decreased
drilling and production in the area served by our gas plants in northern Oklahoma, which is caused by continued reduction
in capital expenditures and new production.
Costs of products sold
Costs of products sold decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $51.8 million from $77.4 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily related to lower volume and prices as described above.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $16.2 million from $16.8 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is due primarily to lower outside services, field expenses (which includes materials
and supplies, lubricants, water disposal, electricity and fuel), employee expenses and equipment leases of approximately
$0.8 million, $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. These decreases were offset by an increase in
maintenance and repairs of approximately $1.2 million and property taxes of $0.6 million.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense remained constant at $4.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $18.1 million from $14.5
million in the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase is primarily a result of incremental assets placed in-service
since the prior year due to expansion in northern Oklahoma.
Loss (gain) on disposal or impairment, net
Loss on disposal or impairment, net increased to $13.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $1.4 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to a $13.1 million goodwill impairment recorded at
March 31, 2016. The prior year loss is due to the write down of certain gas gathering and compression assets in Kansas to
their estimated net realizable value.
In March 2016, our SemGas segment revised the volume forecast for its northern Oklahoma system based on revised
volume forecasts provided by certain producers who have chosen to adjust plans for production following release of the
OCC Plan which curtails the amount of volume that can be injected into disposal wells. Based on the reduction to our
forecast, we tested our SemGas segment's assets, finite-lived intangible and goodwill for impairment at March 31, 2016.
No impairment was indicated for SemGas' long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible based on an undiscounted cash
flow analysis. However, we did record an impairment of SemGas' goodwill for the entire balance of $13.1 million.
To test the goodwill for impairment, we used an income approach, supplemented by a market approach to calculate the fair
value of the reporting unit. Under the income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair
value of our SemGas operations. Significant judgments and assumptions included the discount rate, anticipated revenue
and volume growth rates, estimated operating expenses and capital expenditures, which were based on our operating and
capital budgets as well as our strategic plans. A significant underlying assumption is that commodity prices will eventually
improve, water injection issues will be resolved and production volumes will begin to increase. If production does not
increase in the future or the production takes longer than anticipated to return, this would negatively affect our key
assumptions and potentially lead to finite-lived intangible and long-lived asset impairments in the future. We considered
the market approach by comparing the revenue and earnings multiples implied by our income approach to those of
comparable companies for reasonableness.

Three months ended June 30, 2016 versus three months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2016, decreased to $33.8 million from $35.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower operating cost recoveries, lower maintenance capital
recovery, foreign exchange changes and lower overhead recoveries of $2.4 million, $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $0.4
million, respectively. In addition, a 30-day unplanned outage at the K3 plant decreased gathering and processing revenue
by $2.5 million. These decreases were offset, in part, by $3.4 million of higher gathering and processing revenue,
excluding the outage period, and fees of $3.1 million on true-up of take-or-pay minimum volume commitments.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $21.2 million from $23.7 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs for power, contract labor, accretion and short
term salary incentives of $1.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Foreign exchange changes
reduced operating expense by $1.0 million. These decreases were partially offset by repair costs of $1.6 million related to
the K3 plant outage.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense decreased to $3.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $4.2 million
in three months ended June 30, 2015 due to lower compensation costs.
Depreciation and amortization expense
Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $4.3 million from $3.2
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, as a result of projection completions.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 versus six months ended June 30, 2015
Revenue
Revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016, decreased to $64.7 million from $65.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to foreign exchange changes, lower maintenance capital recovery, lower
operating costs recoveries and lower overhead recoveries of $5.0 million, $1.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.4 million,
respectively. In addition, a 30-day unplanned outage at the K3 plant decreased gathering and processing revenue by $2.5
million. These decreases were offset, in part, by $6.6 million higher gathering and processing revenue, excluding the
outage period, and fees of $3.1 million on true-up of take-or-pay minimum volume commitments.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $38.3 million from $42.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower costs for power, accretion and short term salary incentives of
$2.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Foreign exchange changes reduced operating expense by $2.9
million. These decreases were partially offset by repair costs of $1.6 million related to the K3 plant outage, higher
greenhouse gas credit purchases of $1.2 million and higher general expenses of $0.6 million.

Revenue
Revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2016, decreased to $5.9 million from $6.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The decrease is due, in part, to lower throughput revenues of $0.7 million and the negative impact of
foreign exchange rates of $0.4 million. These were offset by an increase of $0.8 million in storage revenue due to
additional storage capacity being leased.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense decreased slightly in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $1.8 million from $2.2
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to lower employee related expenses of
$0.3 million and the impact of foreign exchange rates of $0.1 million.

Revenue
Revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2016, increased to $12.3 million from $11.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. This increase is primarily due to higher storage revenue of $2.1 million due to additional storage capacity
being contracted. This increase was offset, in part, by a decrease in throughput revenues of $0.5 million and the negative
impact of foreign exchange rates of $0.8 million.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased in the six months ended June 30, 2016, to $4.1 million from $4.7 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to lower site maintenance costs of $0.4 million, the impact of foreign
exchange rates which reduced operating expenses by $0.2 million and a reduction in employee costs of $0.2 million.
These decreases were offset by an increase in waste disposal costs of $0.4 million.

Revenue decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $30.3 million from $51.5 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2015. A decrease in the average sales price per metric ton between periods accounts for $13.9 million of
the decrease and lower volumes between periods (82,109 metric tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared
to 85,037 metric tons in the three months ended June 30, 2015) resulted in a decrease of $1.7 million. The change in the
foreign currency exchange rate between periods resulted in an additional decrease of $5.4 million.
Costs of products sold
Costs of products sold decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $23.4 million from $41.2 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2015. A decrease in the average cost of asphalt and lower volume between the periods accounted
for decreases of $12.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The change in the foreign currency exchange rate between
periods resulted in a decrease of $4.3 million.
Operating expense
Operating expense decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2016, to $2.1 million from $2.3 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease is due to foreign exchange variances of $0.4 million, offset by increased

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources and Uses of Cash
Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving
credit facilities. The consolidated cash balance on June 30, 2016 was $255.8 million. Of this amount, $33.8 million was
held in Canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the U.S. Potential sources of long-term liquidity include
issuances of debt securities and equity securities and the sale of assets. Our primary cash requirements currently are
operating expenses, capital expenditures, our quarterly dividends and quarterly distributions to unitholders of our
subsidiary, Rose Rock. In general, we expect to fund:
operating expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and cash dividends and distributions through existing cash and
cash from operating activities;
expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit
facilities and the issuance of debt securities and equity securities;
acquisitions through cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt securities and equity
securities; and
•debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancings when the credit facilities become due.
Our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future
operating performance and distributions from our equity investments, which will be affected by prevailing economic
conditions in our industry. In addition, we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt
securities and equity securities including common units in Rose Rock. There can be no assurance we will be able or
willing to access the public or private markets in the future. If we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets, we
could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions.
We believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day-to-day cash
requirements, distribute our quarterly dividends, distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on Rose Rock's outstanding
common units and meet our capital expenditures commitments for the coming year.

Adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net increased $32.9 million to $89.6 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 from $56.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This change is primarily a result of:
$45.2 million increase due to the other-than-temporary impairment recorded on our limited partner investment in NGL
Energy, partially offset by a $9.1 million gain on sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy in the current
year and prior year gains on the sale of a portion of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy, net of related costs;
$12.6 million due to higher net losses on disposal or impairment primarily due to the impairment of our SemGas segment's
goodwill in the current year;
•$5.9 million due to prior year losses on the issuance of common units by NGL Energy;
$4.3 million due to decreased equity earnings in the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower
equity earnings as a results of the disposal of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy and lower earnings from
Glass Mountain; and
•$3.8 million increase due to current year losses on foreign currency transactions as compared to prior year gains.
These increases were offset by decreases due to:
•$31.3 million increase in deferred tax benefit;
•$5.2 million of decreased distributions from equity investments;
$1.3 million due to net unrealized gains related to our derivative instruments in the current year as compared to prior year
net unrealized losses; and
•$1.2 million due to inventory valuation adjustments in the prior year as a result of lower commodity prices.
All other adjustments to net income for non-cash expenses, net for the six months ended June 30, 2016 remained relatively
comparable to the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 generated a net decrease in operating
cash flows of $19.3 million. The decrease to operating cash flow due to the change in operating assets and liabilities was
primarily a result of increases of $60.1 million in accounts receivable, $15.9 million in inventories, $4.3 million in
receivables from affiliates and $2.2 million in derivatives and margin deposits. These cash outflows were partially offset by
cash inflows due to increases of $60.9 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $4.0 million in payables to
affiliates. Changes in receivables, inventory, payables and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our segments' operating
activities and are subject to the timing of purchases and sales and fluctuations in commodity pricing.
Changes in operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 generated a net decrease in operating
cash flows of $17.9 million. The decrease to operating cash flow due to the change in operating assets and liabilities was
primarily a result of increases of $36.1 million in inventories, $3.1 million in other current assets, $2.1 million in other
assets, $2.2 million in accounts receivable, $1.4 million in receivables from affiliates and a decrease of $3.8 million in
payables to prepetition creditors. These were partially offset by increases of $18.7 million in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, $5.6 million in payables to affiliates and a decrease of $6.8 million in restricted cash. Changes in receivables,
inventory, payables and accrued liabilities are primarily due to our Crude segment's operating activities and are subject to
the timing of purchases and sales and fluctuations in commodity pricing. Additionally, the increase in inventory is due, in
part, to approximately 700 thousand additional barrels in storage compared to the beginning of the period at our Crude
segment. This is partially due to a strategic build to capture margins due to forward market crude oil prices being higher
than spot market prices. Accounts

receivable was also impacted by a $9.0 million decrease due to the collection of an accrued receivable at year-end which
related to proceeds from the sale of a portion of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy.
Investing Activities
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had net cash outflows of $55.8 million from investing activities, due primarily
to $126.7 million of capital expenditures and $3.4 million of contributions to equity method investments, offset by investing
cash inflows of $60.5 million in proceeds from the sale of our common limited partner units of NGL Energy and $13.8
million of distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates. Capital expenditures primarily related to the Maurepas
Pipeline, Rose Rock's pipeline projects, SemGas' Northern Oklahoma expansion projects and SemCAMS' Wapiti
expansion. Distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates represent cash distributions from White Cliffs and Glass
Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as a return of investment.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had net cash outflows of $190.8 million from investing activities, due primarily
to $237.0 million of capital expenditures and $23.5 million of contributions to equity method investments, partially offset by
investing cash inflows of $56.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of a portion of an equity method investment and $13.1
million of distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates. Capital expenditures primarily related to Rose Rock's
pipeline projects, SemGas' Northern Oklahoma expansion projects, the Maurepas Pipeline and SemCAMS' Wapiti
expansion. Contributions to equity method investments primarily represent investments to fund the White Cliffs pipeline
expansion project. Proceeds from the sale of equity method investment are due to the disposition of a portion of our
common limited partner units of NGL Energy. Distributions in excess of equity in earnings of affiliates represent cash
distributions from White Cliffs and Glass Mountain in excess of our cumulative equity in earnings and are accounted for as
a return of investment.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had net cash inflows of $177.6 million from financing activities, which related
to borrowings on credit facilities of $283.5 million and proceeds from the issuance of common shares, net of offering costs,
of $228.5 million, offset by principal payments on credit facilities of $272.9 million, dividends paid of $39.7 million,
distributions to non-controlling interests of $21.5 million and $0.9 million to repurchase common stock for payment of
statutory taxes due on equity-based compensation. Net borrowings were used primarily for capital expenditures. Proceeds
from the issuance of common shares were used to repay borrowings on our credit facility and will be used for future capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes.
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had net cash inflows of $305.6 million from financing activities, which related
to borrowings on long-term debt of $802.2 million and $89.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of Rose Rock limited
partner common units, offset by principal payments on credit facilities of $525.0 million, dividends paid of $31.5 million,
distributions to non-controlling interests of $19.3 million, $6.3 million in debt issuance costs and $4.3 million to repurchase
common stock for payment of statutory taxes due on equity-based compensation. Net borrowings were used primarily for
capital expenditures and contributions to equity method investments.
Long-term Debt
SemGroup Senior Unsecured Notes
At June 30, 2016, we had $300 million of 7.5% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "Notes") outstanding.
SemGroup Revolving Credit Facility
At June 30, 2016, we had no cash borrowings outstanding under our $500 million revolving credit facility. We had $6.0
million in outstanding letters of credit on that date. The maximum letter of credit capacity under this facility is $250 million.

Rose Rock Senior Unsecured Notes
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had outstanding $400 million and $350 million of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2022
and 2023, respectively, (the "Rose Rock Notes"). The Rose Rock Notes are guaranteed by all of Rose Rock's existing
subsidiaries other than Rose Rock Finance Corp.

Rose Rock Revolving Credit Facility
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had $41.0 million of cash borrowings outstanding under its $585 million revolving credit
facility. There were $37.7 million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility. The maximum letter of credit capacity
under this facility is $150 million. The facility can be increased by up to $200 million. The credit agreement expires on
September 20, 2018.
At June 30, 2016, Rose Rock had available borrowing capacity of $506.3 million under this facility.
SemMexico Credit Facilities
At June 30, 2016, SemMexico had no amounts outstanding on its $100 million Mexican pesos (U.S. $5.4 million at the
June 30, 2016 exchange rate) credit facility which matures in May 2018. At June 30, 2016, SemMexico had an outstanding
letter of credit of $292.8 million Mexican pesos (U.S. $15.8 million at the June 30, 2016 exchange rate).
Shelf Registration Statements
We have access to a universal shelf registration statement which provides us with the ability to offer and sell an unlimited
amount of debt and equity securities, subject to market conditions and our capital needs. This shelf registration statement
expires in March 2019. On June 22, 2016, we issued and sold 8,625,000 shares of our Class A common stock, valued at
$27.00 per share, to the public for proceeds of $228.5 million, net of underwriting fees and other offering costs of $4.3
million. Proceeds were used to repay borrowings on our revolving credit facility and will be used for future capital
expenditures and general corporate purposes.
Rose Rock has an effective shelf registration statement for the offer and sale, from time to time, of common units
representing limited partner interests in Rose Rock having an aggregate offering price of up to $150 million. On May 12,
2015, Rose Rock entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement under which Rose Rock is able to make such sales over a
period of time and, from time to time, in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices
related to market price or at negotiated prices. The counterparties to the Equity Distribution Agreement may act as sales
agents for the common units or may purchase common units for their own accounts as principals. To date, no such sales
have been made.
Capital Requirements
The midstream energy business can be capital intensive, requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing
assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:
expansion capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we
expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long-term; or
maintenance capital expenditures, which are cash expenditures (including expenditures for the addition or improvement
to, or the replacement of, our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing, or the construction or development of new,
capital assets) made to maintain our long-term operating income or operating capacity.
Projected capital expenditures for 2016 are estimated at $400 million in expansion projects, including capital contributions
to affiliates for funding growth projects and acquisitions, and $55 million in maintenance projects. These estimates may
change as future events unfold. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, we spent $126.7 million (cash basis) on capital projects and $3.4 million in capital contributions to
affiliates primarily for funding growth projects.
In addition to our budgeted capital program, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital
expenditures in the future. Consequently, our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital
requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives. We expect that our future expansion capital
expenditures will be funded by cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and
equity securities.

Credit Risk
We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We examine the
creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our exposure to credit risk through credit
analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of
credit, prepayments or guarantees.
Customer Concentration
Shell Trading (US) Company, a customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, accounted for more than 10% of our
consolidated revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016, at approximately 30%. Shell Trading (US) Company, a
customer of our Crude Supply and Logistics segment, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, at approximately 33%. Although we have contracts with customers of varying durations, if
one or more of our major customers were to default on their contract, or if we were unable to renew our contract with one or
more of these customers on favorable terms, we might not be able to replace any of these customers in a timely fashion, on
favorable terms or at all. In any of these situations, our revenues and our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders
may be adversely affected. We expect our exposure to risk of non-payment or non-performance to continue as long as we
remain substantially dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our Adjusted gross
margin.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303 of Regulation S-K.
Commitments
There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of our business from those
previously disclosed in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, although the
value of product purchase commitments is less at June 30, 2016 than it was at December 31, 2015.
We routinely enter into agreements to purchase and sell petroleum products at specified future dates. We establish a
margin for these purchases by entering into various types of physical and financial sales and exchange transactions
through which we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchases on the one hand and sales
and future

delivery obligations on the other. We account for derivatives at fair value with the exception of commitments which have
been designated as normal purchases and sales for which we do not record assets or liabilities related to these
agreements until the product is purchased or sold. At June 30, 2016, such commitments included the following (volumes
and dollars in thousands):

Certain of the commitments shown in the table above relate to agreements to purchase product from a counterparty and to
sell a similar amount of product (in a different location) to the same counterparty. Many of the commitments shown in the
table above are cancellable by either party, as long as notice is given within the time frame specified in the agreement
(generally 30 to 120 days).
Our SemGas segment has a take-or-pay contractual obligation related to the fractionation of natural gas liquids. This
obligation continues through June 2023. At June 30, 2016, the amount of future obligation is approximately $61.5 million.
In addition, our SemGas segment enters into contracts under which we are responsible for marketing the majority of the
gas and natural gas liquids produced by the counterparties to the agreements. During the three months and six months
ended June 30, 2016, the majority of SemGas’ revenues were generated from such contracts.
Rose Rock has a take-or-pay obligation with our equity method investee, White Cliffs, for approximately 5,000 barrels per
day of space on White Cliffs' pipeline. The agreement became effective in October 2015 and has a term of 5 years. Annual
payments to White Cliffs under the agreement are expected to be $9.4 million.

Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
This discussion on market risks represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming
hypothetical future movements in commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Our views on market risk
are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur, and do not represent the maximum possible gains and
losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in
commodity prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and the timing of transactions.
We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in (i) petroleum prices, particularly crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids, (ii) interest rates and (iii) currency exchange rates. We may use from time-to-time various derivative
instruments to manage such exposure. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor physical
and financial commodity positions and the resulting outright commodity price risk as well as basis risk resulting from
differences in commodity grades, purchase and sales locations and purchase and sale timing. We have a risk
management function that has responsibility and authority for our Comprehensive Risk Management Policy, which governs
our enterprise-wide risks, including the market risks discussed in this item. Subject to our Comprehensive Risk
Management Policy, our finance and treasury function has responsibility and authority for managing exposure to interest
rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the risks discussed above, we engage in price risk management activities.

our ability to sell petroleum products at prices in excess of our aggregate cost. Margins may be affected during transitional
periods between a backwardated market (when the prices for future deliveries are lower than the current prices) and a
contango market (when the prices for future deliveries are higher than the current prices). Our petroleum product marketing
activities within each of our segments are generally not directly affected by the absolute level of petroleum product prices,
but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for petroleum products and relative fluctuations in market-related
indices at various locations.
However, the SemGas segment has exposure to commodity price risk because of the nature of certain contracts for which
our fee is based on a percentage of proceeds or index related to the prices of natural gas, natural gas liquids and
condensate. Given current volumes, liquid recoveries and contract terms, we estimate the following sensitivities over the
next twelve months:
A 10% increase in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids results in approximately a $2.5 million increase to
Adjusted gross margin.
•A 10% decrease in those prices would have the opposite effect.
This sensitivity may be impacted by changes in contract mix, change in production or other factors which are outside of our
control.
Additionally, based on our open derivative contracts at June 30, 2016, an increase in the applicable market price or prices
for each derivative contract would result in a decrease in the contribution from these derivatives to our crude oil sales
revenues. A decrease in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in an increase in the
contribution from these derivatives to our crude oil sales revenues. However, the increases or decreases in crude oil sales
revenues we recognize from our open derivative contracts are substantially offset by higher or lower crude oil sales
revenues when the physical sale of the product occurs. These contracts may be for the purchase or sale of crude oil or in
markets different from the physical markets in which we are attempting to hedge our exposure, or may have timing
differences relative to the physical markets. As a result of these factors, our hedges may not eliminate all price risks.
The notional volumes and fair value of our commodity derivatives open positions as well as the change in fair value that
would be expected from a 10% market price increase or decrease is shown in the table below (in thousands):

Margin deposits or other credit support, including letters of credit, are generally required on derivative instruments used to
manage our price exposure. As commodity prices increase or decrease, the fair value of our derivative instruments
changes, thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit or other credit support requirements. Although a component
of our risk-management strategy is intended to manage the margin and other credit support requirements on our derivative
instruments, volatile spot and forward commodity prices, or an expectation of increased commodity price volatility, could
increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements. This
may limit amounts available to us through borrowing, decrease the volume of petroleum products we purchase and sell or
limit our commodity price management activities.
Interest Rate Risk
We use variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities. Therefore,
from time-to-time we may use interest rate derivatives to manage interest obligations on specific debt issuances. Our
variable rate debt bears interest at LIBOR or prime, subject to certain floors, plus the applicable margin. At June 30, 2016,
an increase in these base rates of 1%, above the base rate floors, would increase our interest expense by $0.2 million and
$0.4 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
The average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The
carrying value of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because our rates
fluctuate with prevailing market rates.

The cash flows relating to our U.K., Canada and Mexico operations are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such
amounts measured in British pounds, Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos. Assets and liabilities of our U.K., Canadian
and Mexican subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting
period. Revenue, expenses and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period.
A 10% change in the average exchange rate during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 would change
operating income by $1.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), are effective as of June 30,
2016. This conclusion is based on an evaluation conducted under the supervision and participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer along with our management. Disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

Item 1.Legal Proceedings
For information regarding legal proceedings, see the discussion under the captions "Bankruptcy matters," "Dimmit County,
TX claims," "Environmental" and "Other matters," in Note 10 of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.
Item 1A.Risk Factors
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors involving us from those previously
disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Our pending transaction with Rose Rock may not close when expected, or at all.
The consummation of our merger with Rose Rock is subject to the approval of the issuance of shares of our Class A
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement by our stockholders and the satisfaction of other customary closing
conditions. If these conditions to closing are not satisfied or waived, if waivable, the merger with Rose Rock will not be
consummated. Further, the consummation of the merger requires a waiver or amendment of certain provisions of our credit
agreement and Rose Rock’s credit agreement. Although we expect to amend and consolidate the credit agreements to
permit the merger, if the lenders do not consent and we cannot refinance the credit agreements, then we will not be able to
consummate the merger. Additionally, there is no assurance that we will complete the merger in the time frame that we
anticipate or under the terms set forth in the merger agreement, or at all.
If our pending transaction with Rose Rock is consummated, we may not realize the benefits we expect.
We entered into the merger agreement with Rose Rock because we believe that the merger will be, among other things,
immediately accretive to SemGroup stockholders, simplify our corporate capital structure and improve our cost of capital
and our capital market access and provide increased financial flexibility for execution of our strategic growth plan.
However, our assessments and expectations regarding these anticipated benefits of the merger may prove to be incorrect.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize the anticipated benefits of our merger with Rose Rock.
