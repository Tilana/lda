<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Croatia was held at the 11th meeting, on 8 November 2010. The 
delegation of Croatia was headed by the State Secretary for European Integration, Andrej 
Plenkovi&#263;. At its 15th meeting, held on 10 November 2010, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Croatia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Croatia: Burkina Faso, Pakistan and the 
United States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Croatia: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/1 and A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/1/Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/HRV/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Croatia through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 46 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. A number of 
delegations welcomed the participative approach taken to the drafting of the national report 
and the commitment shown by Croatia to the universal periodic review mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. Mr. Andrej Plenkovi&#263;, State Secretary for European Integration, stated that Croatia, 
which attached great importance to the universal periodic review, had developed an 
advanced human rights protection system over the past two decades based on the 
international human rights standards. Croatia had involved both governmental institutions 
and civil society in the preparatory process of the review, and the national report had been 
submitted to the Parliamentary Committee for Human Rights and the Rights of National 
Minorities. 
</p>
<p>7. The Croatian Constitution enshrined more than 50 articles on human rights. Croatia 
was party to most international and European human rights instruments and was 
considering adhering to others. It had also extended an open standing invitation to special 
procedures in 2003. Under the Constitution, ratified treaties were part of domestic law, had 
precedence over national legislation and could be directly invoked before a court. </p>


<p>8. Croatia paid attention to promoting tolerance and combating all forms of 
discrimination. It had formulated and continued to implement three-year national 
programmes for the protection and promotion of human rights and had developed an 
institutional framework, with a major role played by the Ombudsman and other specialized 
ombudspersons. Much attention was focused on implementing that legal framework with 
the assistance of civil society. 
</p>
<p>9. In response to advance questions, the head of the delegation stated that Croatia was 
addressing the consequences of the war as a way to build confidence and promote 
reconciliation in the region. Closing the impunity gap was another crucial component, and 
Croatia remained deeply devoted to full cooperation with the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and strongly believed that it had fulfilled all requests 
received from the Tribunal&#8217;s Office of the Prosecutor. Concerning the one request that the 
Tribunal considered to have been only partially fulfilled, Croatia had made extensive 
investigative efforts, and the Trial Chamber concurred with Croatia that it was impossible 
to verify with certainty the existence of the documents concerned. 
</p>
<p>10. Croatia then turned its attention to domestic war crimes trials, which were being 
conducted in a transparent manner, with an increase in the number of proceedings over the 
past two years. Through its Action Plan, Croatia was ensuring that the proceedings were 
carried out impartially and professionally, regardless of the ethnic affiliation of the accused. 
A study conducted by the Ministry of Justice on the judgements rendered in the presence of 
the accused between 2005 and 2009 had shown that they had been unbiased and impartial. 
Concerning the convictions delivered in absentia, new provisions had been introduced in 
the Criminal Procedure Act, and the competent authorities had reviewed those cases. 
</p>
<p>11. With regard to refugee issues, the number of registered refugees and internally 
displaced persons had now declined to less than 1,000 from more than 1 million in the 
1990s. As agreed by countries in the region at the 2005 Sarajevo Conference, return and 
local integration were the two equally legitimate alternatives offered to refugees in order to 
reach a durable solution. Croatia provided statistics on local integration and described a 
number of measures to encourage returns, notably through a major investment in the 
reconstruction of housing units. Private property had been almost entirely returned to its 
owners. As of October 2010, close to 8,000 housing requests by the ex-tenancy rights 
holders had been met with positive responses. Finally, adequate funds had been allocated 
for the implementation of a housing care programme provided for in the Revised Action 
Plan. Croatia also took part in the regional process aimed at the definitive resolution of the 
refugee issue, as had been the case at the 2010 Belgrade Conference. 
</p>
<p>12. Croatia guaranteed minority rights to all its national minorities, in accordance with 
international standards, its Constitution and the Constitutional Law on the Rights of 
National Minorities. In June 2010, the Preamble of the Constitution had been amended to 
explicitly recognize 22 national minorities, including the Roma, instead of 10. Seats were 
guaranteed to national minorities in Parliament, and Croatia was committed to increasing 
minority participation. 
</p>
<p>13. The Roma were a recognized national minority and participated in the decision--
making process at all levels. Croatia had adopted a National Programme for Roma and 
participated in the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005&#8211;2015. 
</p>
<p>14. The principle of equality was enshrined in the Constitution and enjoyed special legal 
protection, and the Criminal Code recognized the concept of hate crimes. The 2008 Anti-
discrimination Act and the National Plan for Combating Discrimination (2008-2013) were 
other instruments to counter discrimination. In 2010, Croatia had established a new 
Working Group to monitor hate crimes at the national level. Special efforts were devoted to 
combating discrimination against minorities, including the Serb and the Roma minorities </p>


<p>and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. Special attention was being paid both to 
awareness-raising activities and the strengthening of institutional capacity. Politicians were 
increasingly spreading the message of tolerance and reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>15. Recent trends had indicated an increase in the investigation of hate crimes. Criminal 
acts directed against journalists, particularly attacks on their physical integrity, were treated 
with the utmost seriousness and tended to be characterized as grave crimes under the 
Criminal Code. A number of assaults against journalists had resulted in criminal charges, as 
recently demonstrated through the first-instance judgement in respect of the killings of 
media professionals Pukani&#263; and Franji&#263;. 
</p>
<p>16. Gender equality and the empowerment of women were among fundamental 
principles of the Croatian constitutional order, as demonstrated by a comprehensive 
institutional and legislative framework, including in particular the Gender Equality Act, 
public campaigns and other awareness-raising measures. 
</p>
<p>17. Children&#8217;s rights, notably those of the most vulnerable, had always been among 
Croatia&#8217;s priorities. Croatia was party to almost all children&#8217;s rights instruments and would 
soon ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation of Inter-
Country Adoption. Croatia prohibited corporal punishment of children by law and had been 
playing a leading role within regional forums in that respect. With regard to alternative 
care, all orphaned children under the age of 7 must be placed with foster families. 
</p>
<p>18. Croatia was among the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and would adopt a Master Plan of Deinstitutionalization and 
Transformation of Social Welfare Institutions (2011-2018<b>)</b> by the end of 2010.  
</p>
<p>19. Resolution of corruption cases had been accorded high priority, as demonstrated by 
a significant number of high-level corruption cases that were being processed. As a result, 
there was a trend towards an increasing number of convictions and investigations. 
</p>
<p>20. Independence, impartiality, professionalism and efficiency of the judiciary had 
recently been further strengthened in legislation. Croatia had encountered a court backlog 
and excessive delay in conducting the procedures. Measures undertaken in that regard had 
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of unresolved cases between 2004 and 
</p><p>2010. The possibility of lodging a constitutional complaint in respect of the length of 
proceedings had been introduced, as well as the possibility of the next highest court or the 
Supreme Court protecting the right to have a trial before a specific court within a 
reasonable period of time. The most recent amendments to the Courts Act had further 
streamlined this procedure. 
</p>
<p>21. While Croatia acknowledged its own set of challenges, it remained committed to 
advancing human rights promotion and protection. The universal periodic review would 
serve to further improve the human rights situation. Croatia, in approaching the completion 
of its European Union accession negotiation process, was currently negotiating the chapter 
on judiciary and fundamental rights; it was the first country to do so. This entailed the 
adoption of the most sophisticated standards and constituted a concrete track record of their 
faithful implementation. So too would be the case with the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>22. Algeria commended Croatia for its efforts to strengthen the protection and 
promotion of human rights through its National Triennial Programme. Algeria welcomed 
the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination National Plan for 2008-2013. Algeria inquired 
whether Croatia intended to revise the Constitution, and requested information about the </p>


<p>measures taken regarding the high rate of child mortality as a result of traffic accidents. 
Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Morocco noted the challenges faced in improving the implementation of the 
normative and institutional framework and strengthening administrative and financial 
capacities. Morocco also noted the elaboration of a protection mechanism against 
discrimination.  Morocco further underlined the constructive role played by Croatia in the 
Balkan region. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>24. Cuba praised the special measures and legislation adopted to expand and strengthen 
gender equality and promotion and protection of the rights of the child. Cuba highlighted 
the achievements accomplished in social development areas such as poverty, life 
expectancy, child and maternal mortality, and access to drinking water. Cuba inquired 
about supplementary measures or programmes to create better conditions for minorities. 
Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Poland expressed appreciation for the progress made regarding the participation of 
members of ethnic minorities in public life, while expressing concern about their low 
representation in local and regional governments. Poland inquired about steps to be taken to 
facilitate returnees&#8217; repossession of their property, access to reconstruction assistance and 
reintegration into Croatian society. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Indonesia praised the progress made in improving the rights of persons with 
disabilities, noting that Croatia was among the first countries to ratify the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Indonesia expressed concern about the high 
incidence of domestic violence, while praising Government initiatives such as public 
awareness-raising campaigns and training programmes for Government officials. Indonesia 
also noted the formulation of the Third National Plan against Trafficking in Persons. 
Indonesia praised the great strides made in combating racism and other forms of 
discrimination. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. The Russian Federation noted Croatia&#8217;s progress in acceding to international human 
rights treaties and the existence of a national human rights institution that was in 
conformity with the Paris Principles. It noted the challenges faced in overcoming the 
consequences of the war in terms of ensuring non-discrimination on ethnic grounds, asking 
how Croatia was managing to implement the programme aimed at ensuring housing for 
returning refugees. 
</p>
<p>28. Azerbaijan referred to the national institutional framework set up to promote and 
protect human rights, including a national human rights institution accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; 
status. It noted positively the accomplishments made in implementing the National 
Programme for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights. It noted the great progress 
made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Canada welcomed Croatia&#8217;s efforts to update the country&#8217;s legal and institutional 
frameworks for the protection of human rights, including through adoption of the National 
Program for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2008-2011 and the Gender 
Equality Act in 2008. Canada noted reports regarding the alleged abuse of certain patients 
in mental health facilities and concerns involving the legal framework that could lead to the 
unjustified institutionalization of certain persons. While welcoming Croatia&#8217;s support for 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Canada noted continuing 
concerns over the fact that key documents had not yet been located and made available to 
the Tribunal. Further, while appreciating ongoing Government efforts to prosecute war 
crimes cases, Canada noted concerns over discrepancies between accused of Serb and Croat 
origin. Canada welcomed Government efforts to resolve problems associated with Croatian 
Serb returnees. Canada made recommendations. </p>


<p>30. France noted that Croatia had yet to ratify the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Noting the country&#8217;s efforts to 
adapt its judicial procedures in order to combat impunity for war criminals, France 
indicated that efforts must still be undertaken to reduce the backlog of cases. France noted 
Croatia&#8217;s ambitious legislation on the rights of women, children and disabled persons, the 
appointment of three ombudsmen and the adoption of multi-year national strategies. France 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Belgium regretted the lack of visibility of and follow-up to the work of the 
Ombudsperson. Belgium inquired about the measures taken to publicize the work of the 
Ombudsperson and follow up on its observations and recommendations. Belgium expressed 
concern regarding the difficulties faced by some marginalized persons in terms of access to 
justice and free legal aid, asking whether the authorities had already assessed the current 
legislation or intended to do so. Belgium made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Brazil noted the progress made on the Millennium Development Goals, including 
with regard to extreme poverty, health care and education. Brazil requested further 
information about the functioning and results of the system of free legal aid. Brazil noted 
the need for further progress by Croatia in certain areas, including gender equality and 
empowerment of women; non-discrimination and the social integration of ethnic minorities, 
particularly Serbs and Roma; and the resettlement of refugees. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Egypt highlighted the fact that Croatia&#8217;s Ombudsperson had been accredited with 
&#8220;A&#8221; status and praised the country&#8217;s efforts to promote gender. Egypt noted that Croatia 
was on track to achieve several Millennium Development Goals and requested further 
information about the progress made in promoting and protecting economic, social and 
cultural rights.  Egypt acknowledged Croatia&#8217;s openness in identifying challenges, such as 
war crimes and the rights of national minorities. Egypt referred to Croatia&#8217;s co-operation 
for the implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Turkey was pleased at the achievements accomplished in improving the enjoyment 
of the right to education, welcoming the fact that elementary school education had been 
made obligatory and free of charge. Turkey expressed appreciation for the legal prohibition 
of the corporal punishment of children. Turkey encouraged the Government to further 
develop private media in order to maintain plurality and freedom of expression. Turkey 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. The Netherlands praised the adoption of the Free Legal Act, while noting reports 
that equal access to administrative and judicial bodies was not ensured under the Act. It 
also praised the enshrinement of the right to access to information in the Constitution, 
which strengthened the possibility of citizens&#8217; enjoyment of that right. It urged Croatia to 
hold accountable those involved in human rights violations in the 1990s in order to prevent 
impunity, and encouraged Croatia to cooperate fully with the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in order to establish full accountability for past events. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. Pakistan congratulated Croatia on being on track to achieve Millennium 
Development Goals. Pakistan requested further information about how the principle of 
restriction of freedoms and rights of citizens was determined and how the monitoring of 
hate crimes could be instrumental in enacting new legislation. Pakistan made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. The Republic of Korea noted with concern that minorities still faced discrimination 
in many instances, including in repossessing their property upon their return, and their 
limited ability to acquire citizenship. It stated that strengthened protection should be </p>


<p>provided to children and minorities during legal proceedings. It inquired about the specific 
measures taken or to be taken to address this issue. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Austria noted the legislation being brought in accordance with European Union laws 
and standards, as Croatia was close to finalizing the process of becoming a State member of 
the Union. Austria praised the steps taken to facilitate the return of a large number of 
displaced persons, including members of the Serb minority. However, it noted concerns 
regarding poor conditions of detention as well as an inefficient judiciary, which had led to 
long delays in the dispensation of justice and in the full integration into society of persons 
belonging to minority groups. Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. The United States of America stated that Croatia should amplify the efforts to 
protect the rights of vulnerable minorities. It noted that ethnic Serbs still faced de facto 
discrimination in several areas, including the administration of justice, employment and 
housing, and that Roma also faced many obstacles. It noted that Croatia remained a 
destination, source and transit country for trafficking in persons.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Slovenia appreciated the progress made in Croatia&#8217;s integration into the European 
Union. Slovenia referred to the Supreme Court&#8217;s recognition of the right to the restitution of 
property nationalized after the Second World War and the lack of equal treatment for 
Slovenian minorities and other persons who were not Croatian citizens in the process. 
Slovenia also highlighted the fact that the Slovenian minority still did not enjoy all the 
rights guaranteed under the Constitution, the Law on the Rights of National Minorities and 
other laws. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Finland expressed appreciation for the measures taken to eliminate discrimination 
against the Roma communities. Finland asked how the authorities would improve the 
situation of Roma who lacked citizenship. Finland also inquired about concrete measures 
being taken to support the education of Roma children. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Norway praised the efforts to enhance equality and non-discrimination concerning 
Roma minorities. However, it noted persistent problems in the effective implementation of 
rights provided by law, particularly regarding equitable representation of minorities in the 
public sector. Norway expressed concern about reports of societal prejudice against 
minority groups (Serbs, Bosniaks and Roma) and inequalities between women and men in 
the labour market.  Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the 
importance Croatia placed on judicial reform, cooperation with the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, domestic war crimes trials, settling remaining refugee 
return issues and protection of minority groups. It encouraged further judicial reform. It 
encouraged Croatia to seek missing documents for the Gotovina trial, to pursue a thorough 
and comprehensive investigation and act on suggestions from the Chief Prosecutor. It 
encouraged Croatia to ensure domestic war crimes trials were investigated and prosecuted 
without discrimination. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. The Croatian delegation stated that Croatia was considering the issue of migrant 
workers as a part of the wider European human rights framework. Croatia had not yet taken 
a decision on the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, but already had a broad legislative 
framework for their protection. 
</p>
<p>45. With respect to hate crimes, Croatia added to the information presented in its 
introductory statement, noting that special police units had been established to conduct 
criminal investigations in that regard, with specifically trained personnel. No organized 
violence against particular groups had been reported, as incidents had been isolated, as 
evidenced by available statistics, and had been adequately prosecuted and sanctioned. </p>


<p>46. Regarding human rights education, a systematic approach had been introduced in 
1999 by Government Decree, and the Ministry of Education was obliged to implement it. 
Various areas of human rights were taught at various levels of education. The education of 
teachers was under the mandate of the Agency for Education, and seminars on various 
human rights issues were organized. Various international human rights days were 
celebrated. 
</p>
<p>47. In respect of persons with disabilities, Croatia referred to the National Strategy for 
Equal Opportunity for Disabled People. A special working group had been established to 
assess the implementation of the existing legislation and had put forward suggestions for its 
improvement, such as an amendment relating to guardianship following the deprivation of 
legal capacity. Such an amendment would require further consideration because of its 
complexity. 
</p>
<p>48. The delegation addressed the issue of child victims of traffic accidents. Although the 
number of accidents remained high, it had decreased slightly in recent years. A working 
group had been set up to prepare a National Plan for the Protection of Children from 
Injuries, and focus would be placed on the cooperation of local communities and civil 
society in improving awareness. 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia, the delegation recalled that Croatia had established a Special Interdepartmental 
Task Force to determine the fate of requested documents and deliver documents requested 
by the Office of the Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>50. Croatia recalled the information about domestic war crimes and ethnic bias that it 
had presented in its introductory statement. Concerning unprosecuted war crimes, the Chief 
State Attorney had issued instructions, and there had been an increase in the number of 
proceedings over the past two years. The major problem remained impunity for war crimes 
committed by perpetrators who were currently outside the country. The State Attorney&#8217;s 
Office and the Ministry of the Interior had assembled a priority list for further prosecutions 
to speed up the process. 
</p>
<p>51. The resolution of corruption cases had been given high priority by Croatia, and there 
had been a trend in recent years towards an increasing number of convictions. To prevent 
corruption, there had been several important legislative changes, including the amendment 
to the Access to Information Act, in addition to specific training for civil servants. At the 
regional level, a special extradition agreement had been signed with Serbia, and another 
was under discussion with Montenegro. 
</p>
<p>52. The delegation recalled the measures adopted by Croatia on reconstruction and 
repossession of property, as well as on former tenancy rights holders. Regarding the latter, 
Croatia had introduced a mechanism that provided every former holder with an opportunity 
to have a home in Croatia if they wished to return. The delegation provided statistics in that 
regard. 
</p>
<p>53. Croatia had a long-standing tradition of providing free legal aid, which had been 
enhanced by the adoption of the 2008 Free Legal Aid Act. Free legal aid was provided on a 
wide range of issues, without any discrimination.  
</p>
<p>54. Under the Constitution, the Slovenian minority, like all other minorities, enjoyed all 
their rights, including the double voting right, and Croatia supported various Slovenian 
cultural events held in the country. 
</p>
<p>55. Croatia was committed to finding appropriate solutions for foreign citizens 
regarding restitution of or compensation for nationalized property, if this was not possible 
through existing legislation. </p>


<p>56. With respect to human trafficking, Croatia was not only a transit country, but also 
had become a country of origin and destination. Therefore, a new national plan had been 
adopted and had largely been implemented, and other legal measures had been adopted.  
</p>
<p>57. Croatia stated that it was amending its Penal Code before proceeding to the 
ratification of the Convention on enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>58. Concerning Roma education, the Croatia Education Policy prohibited any kind of 
segregation, and Croatia was committed to the integrative education of Roma minorities. 
</p>
<p>59. Hungary expressed appreciation for the adoption of the strategy for judicial system 
reform in 2005, while noting challenges such as the number of delays in court proceedings, 
the unresolved war crimes cases, and providing access to legal aid. Hungary also welcomed 
the progress made in facilitating the return and reintegration of refugees, especially 
returnees belonging to the Serb minority. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Sweden referred to the fact that in 2007, the European Committee for the Prevention 
of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment had indicated that, in 
certain cases, alleged ill treatment by the police could be considered as amounting to 
torture.  Sweden requested elaboration on measures to ensure impartial investigations into 
allegations of torture and the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators. Sweden asked 
about measures to protect the rights of children with disabilities. Sweden made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Italy highlighted its intense and constructive bilateral relations with Croatia. Italy 
referred to the positive role played by the Italian minority in Croatia as having been 
instrumental in the steady improvements of political, economic and social standards in the 
Country. Italy appreciated also the in the establishment of regional cooperation frameworks 
such as the Central European initiative, the Adriatic-Ionic initiative and the Quadrilateral 
Initiative. Italy encouraged Croatia to pay attention to both the promotion of women in the 
labour market and the protection of children from abuse, international drug trafficking and 
exploitation. Italy made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>62. The Republic of Moldova inquired about Government action plans specific to 
human rights, and asked whether there were indicators/mechanisms to help monitor the 
implementation of the National Human Rights Promotion and Protection Programme. It 
also asked whether the protection granted to victims of domestic violence under the 
national Strategy for Protection from Domestic violence would be extended to potential 
victims of such violence. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Czech Republic welcomed Croatia&#8217;s readiness to tackle problematic issues, 
while expressing concern about reports that many cases of war crimes remained unresolved 
and that the selection of cases had been disproportionately directed at ethnic Serbs. It hoped 
that Croatia would adopt and implement national legislation and regulations aimed at 
resolving the issue of former tenancy rights holders, mainly ethnic Serbs, who had been 
displaced as a result of the conflict. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Belarus inquired about Croatia&#8217;s systematic efforts to combat trafficking, including a 
national plan. Belarus stressed that particular attention should be given to the rights of 
Roma and the right of refugees to return. Belarus encouraged the protection of women&#8217;s 
rights in the workplace, referring to the need to eliminate unemployment among them. 
Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Palestine welcomed the efforts made regarding refugees and noted Croatia&#8217;s 
cooperation on the issue at the regional level, highlighting the fact that Croatia had 
elaborated the framework for guaranteeing the right of refugees to return without 
conditions. Palestine also noted the adoption of a law on regional development in 2009 in 
order to reintegrate refugees into Croatian society, including re-housing programmes. In </p>


<p>addition, Palestine welcomed Government efforts to determine the fate of persons who had 
disappeared during the war. Palestine made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Bosnia and Herzegovina praised the significant progress made on various aspects of 
human rights, particularly the adoption of the 2008 Anti-Discrimination Act. It noted that 
Croatia was not a party to the 1969 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, asking 
whether the country intended to accede to it. It also praised Croatia&#8217;s efforts regarding 
refugees, encouraging further activities to find durable solutions for them. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. While noting that the human rights situation had greatly improved, Serbia raised 
concern about the security incidents directed against ethnic Serbs, returnees and tourists.  
Serbia noted the lack of proportional representation of Serbs in local government and the 
lack of use of the Serbian language, despite the provisions of the Constitutional Law on the 
Rights of Minorities. Serbia made recommendations. 
</p>

related to the sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons, Slovakia noted 
that the restitution of private houses owned by the exiled and displaced -- most of whom

</p>

national policy for the promotion of gender equality 2006-2010 and the action plan for the

made recommendations. 
</p>

a Constitutional Act on National Minorities and the National Anti-Discrimination Plan. 
However, Ghana noted concerns about the high unemployment rate among women, the

group to study the possibility of ratifying the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. On the designation of a national 
preventive mechanism relating to the Convention against Torture, a bill was currently being 
considered by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>84. With regard to statelessness, Croatia was considering the ratification of the 1961 
Convention, as its existing legislation offered broader protection for certain categories. 
</p>
<p>85. Croatia continued to implement its judicial reform strategy, in particular to enhance 
the independence and efficiency of the judiciary. Comprehensive legislative and 
organizational reforms had been adopted and, in June 2010, the Constitution had been 
amended. A new State Judicial Council Act had been adopted to better ensure 
independence, as well as new provisions relating to the selection of judges. 
</p>
<p>86. Regarding prison conditions, Croatia was facing a lack of space, but had tried to 
overcome that problem by opening a new prison by the end of 2010, in addition to two 
other projects by the Ministry of Justice, to enlarge one prison and build another. In 
addition, activities for inmates had been proposed in accordance with United Nations 
standards, and medical care was provided to them. Furthermore, a probation law had been 
adopted in 2009 to increase the use of alternative forms of punishment. 
</p>
<p>87. The prohibition of torture was enshrined in the Constitution. The Criminal Code, the 
Criminal Procedure Act, the Act on the Enforcement of Prison Terms, the Asylum Act and 
the Aliens Act also contained provisions on torture. 
</p>
<p>88. The participation of minorities in representative bodies was deemed to be adequate, 
and there had been increased recruitment of minority members in some civil service 
sectors. The representation of minorities in administration and the judiciary was sub-
optimal. Awareness-raising campaigns had been carried out throughout the country to 
address that issue. 
</p>
<p>89. Croatia intended to improve the status of women in the labour market to ensure 
gender equality. The general legislative framework had been harmonized with international 
standards, and all forms of gender discrimination in the labour market were prohibited. 
Equal salary for equal work was also guaranteed by law. The share of women entrepreneurs 
was on the increase, and this was supported through the Women&#8217;s Entrepreneurship 
Development Strategy. 
</p>
<p>90. There had been a number of activities to increase the participation of women in the 
political decision-making process, and the delegation provided statistics in that regard. 
</p>
<p>91. Croatia considered awareness-raising activities as a key preventive measure against 
domestic violence. Reports on the implementation of the National Strategy for Protection 
from Domestic Violence had been made public, and the process of drafting the new 
Strategy was ongoing. A specific law on domestic violence had been adopted in 2009. 
</p>
<p>92. The delegation recalled its opening statement relating to the protection of journalists 
and stated that it cooperated with special procedures on freedom of expression and human 
rights defenders in that respect. 
</p>
<p>93. The Convalidation Act set out rules relating to pensions for refugees who had 
worked in Croatia prior to the declaration of independence, and the delegation provided 
statistics on its implementation. </p>


<p>94. The status of Roma citizenship was regulated in a simple manner for those who had 
been born or had lived for a given period of time in Croatia. However, problems arose 
when their status was not regulated in their country of birth, as they possessed no civil-
status-related documents, and improved cooperation among the countries in the region 
would be the solution to this problem. 
</p>
<p>95. The delegation welcomed the expressions of appreciation and the recommendations 
made during the interactive dialogue, as well as the support for Croatia&#8217;s European Union 
aspiration. It reaffirmed its support for the work of the Human Rights Council, notably the 
universal periodic review.
