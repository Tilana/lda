<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report contains a comprehensive account of communications sent to 
Governments between 16 December 2008 and 25 July 2010, along with replies received 
between 1 February 2009 and 25 August 2010. It also contains responses received to 
communications that were sent in earlier years. 
</p>
<p>2. A total of 19 communications were sent to 15 different countries. However, a 
number of these communications addresses one single event involving several countries. 
For example, regarding an alleged plot against the democratically elected President of 
Bolivia and involving mercenaries, the Working Group sent letters to the Governments of 
Bolivia, Croatia, Hungary, Romania and Ireland, whose nationals were allegedly involved 
in the incident. Regarding the participation of mercenaries in the operations of the security 
forces of Guinea in September 2009 against peaceful demonstrators, the Working Group 
addressed letters to Israel and South Africa regarding the alleged involvement of their 
nationals in these operations.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group received 9 replies in response to its 19 communications. The 
Working Group thanks all the governments that have provided a reply for their cooperation 
with its mandate given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council and invite 
all others to do so without further delay.  
</p>
<p>4. The present document is submitted as an addendum to the Working Group report to 
the tenth session of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications to and from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p>5. On <b>17 July 2009</b>, the Working Group, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary and or arbitrary executions sent a communication to the government 
of Afghanistan concerning reports of a shooting incident that occurred on 29 June 2009 
between armed Afghan Special Guards (also referred to by the local population as &#8220;Afghan 
Special Forces&#8221;) and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the Attorney General&#8217;s office in 
Kandahar, Afghanistan. It is alleged that the Afghan Special Guards went to the Attorney's 
General office to forcefully and unconditionally demand the release of a suspect, who had 
been arrested by the ANP in connection with a criminal offence for theft of a motor vehicle. 
An argument reportedly erupted inside the Attorney General's office and that the Afghan 
Special Guards opened fire and killed the Chief of Police, the Chief of Crime and four other 
ANP officers. There are unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group regrets that the Government of Afghanistan did not respond to 
this communication. In light of the recent mission carried out by the Working Group in 
Afghanistan and the cooperation demonstrated by the Government of Afghanistan during 
this visit, the Working Group would like to encourage the Government to ensure follow-up 
cooperation with its mandate given by the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council.   </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Australia 
</b></p>
<p>7. On <b>11 February 2010</b>, the Working Group sent a communication to the 
Government of Australia concerning an Australian-based company operating in Papua New 
Guinea. 
</p>
<p>8. According to the information received, fourteen Fijian private security personnel 
have allegedly been hired by Allied Gold Limited, an Australian-based security company 
operating in Papua New Guinea, to provide security at the Simberi gold mine in Port 
Moresby, Papua New Guinea&#8217;s northern island province of New Ireland. The security 
guards have reportedly been recruited since early January 2010 at the mine site following 
disputes with local landowners. They are reportedly in possession of firearms.  
</p>
<p>9. Similar letters have been sent to Fiji and Papua New Guinea (see below).  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Working Group did not receive a reply to its communication. The Working 
Group regrets that the Government of Australia failed to cooperate with its mandate given 
by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council invites the Government to reply 
without further delay.   
</p>
<p><b>  Bolivia 
</b></p>
<p>11. El <b>27 de abril de 2009</b>, el Grupo de Trabajo envi&#243; una carta al Gobierno de Bolivia 
tras haber recibido alegaciones sobre un grupo que presuntamente planeaba un atentado 
contra el presidente democr&#225;ticamente elegido y otros altos funcionarios del Gobierno de 
Bolivia. El 16 de abril de 2009, la polic&#237;a Boliviana lanz&#243; una operaci&#243;n en la ciudad de 
Santa Cruz contra este grupo. Durante una confrontaci&#243;n armada con la polic&#237;a, tres 
individuos fueron muertos, y dos est&#225;n actualmente detenidos.  
</p>
<p>12. Los informes indicaron que dos miembros del grupo eran veteranos de las guerras de 
los Balcanes durante los a&#241;os 90, mientras que los tres restantes ser&#237;an un irland&#233;s, un 
rumano y un h&#250;ngaro. Las fuentes divulgaron que el Sr. Magyarosi Arpak de Rumania, el 
Sr. Michael Martin Dwyer de Irlanda y el Sr. Eduardo Rosa Flores, un ciudadano h&#250;ngaro 
con or&#237;genes bolivianos, fueron muertos durante la operaci&#243;n. Se alega que este &#250;ltimo era 
el l&#237;der del grupo y hab&#237;a luchado en la guerra para la independencia croata en los a&#241;os 90, 
donde &#233;l lider&#243; una organizaci&#243;n paramilitar. Se identificaron los dos hombres arrestados 
como Elot Toazo, un especialista en computadoras h&#250;ngaro y veterano de la guerra croata, 
y Mario Francisco Tasik Astorga.  
</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno de Bolivia de fecha 29 de abril 2009 
</b></p>
<p>13. El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores saluda muy atentamente a la Honorable 
Oficina del Alto Comisionado de Naciones Unidas para los Derechos Humanos - Grupo de 
Trabajo de las Naciones Unidas sobre la utilizaci&#243;n de mercenarios como instrumento para 
la violaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y para impedir el ejercicio del derecho de los pueblos 
a su autodeterminaci&#243;n y tiene el honor de expresar su complacencia por la preocupaci&#243;n 
recientemente manifestada acerca de que un grupo de cinco personas incluidos extranjeros, 
estuviera involucrado en un complot contra el Gobierno boliviano. 
</p>
<p>14. Al respecto, cumple informar que el Gobierno del Presidente Evo Morales Ayma 
realizar&#225; todas las acciones necesarias para que el Ministerio P&#250;blico y las instancias 
pertinentes realicen  una investigaci&#243;n exhaustiva y lleven a cabo el debido proceso relativo 
a los hechos mencionados y a la presencia de mercenarios en Bolivia. Asimismo, que </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>proporcionar&#225; todas las facilidades a la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de Derechos 
Humanos de las Naciones Unidas y al Grupo de Trabajo sobre utilizaci&#243;n de mercenarios 
para que, en cumplimiento de su mandato, monitoree y acompa&#241;e la investigaci&#243;n de este 
incidente y as&#237; se garantice el esclarecimiento pleno de estos hechos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios 
</b></p>
<p>15 El Grupo de Trabajo quisiera agradecer al Gobierno de Bolivia por la informaci&#243;n 
que ha proporcionado relativa a esto hecho. El Grupo de Trabajo solicita que se le 
mantenga informando del progreso de las investigaciones y procesos que adelanta el 
Gobierno con relaci&#243;n a esto hecho.  
</p>
<p><b>  Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>16. El 17 de noviembre de 2009<b>,</b> el Grupo de Trabajo envi&#243; una carta al Gobierno de 
Colombia tras haber recibido alegaciones en relaci&#243;n con el &#8220;Acuerdo complementario para 
la Cooperaci&#243;n y Asistencia T&#233;cnica en Defensa y Seguridad entre los Gobiernos de la 
Rep&#250;blica de Colombia y de los Estados Unidos de Am&#233;rica&#8221; firmado el pasado 30 de 
octubre, en particular, los temas que se refieren a los alcances del mandato, referidos a los 
contratistas y empleados de contratistas definidos  en el art&#237;culo I, literales d y e, del citado 
Acuerdo. 
</p>
<p>17. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el acuerdo otorga permiso a los EE.UU. de 
emplazar efectivos militares y contratistas, quienes operar&#225;n en siete bases militares 
colombianas. Al parecer, el Acuerdo establece una limitaci&#243;n al ejercicio efectivo de la 
jurisdicci&#243;n judicial de Colombia sobre los contratistas militares y de seguridad privados de 
EE.UU mediante la concesi&#243;n de la inmunidad diplom&#225;tica, conforme al art&#237;culo VIII del 
Acuerdo.  
</p>
<p>18. De la misma forma, el Acuerdo no especifica ninguna l&#237;nea de supervisi&#243;n y control 
por las autoridades colombianas sobre las empresas militares y de seguridad privadas 
contratadas por los EE.UU. para operar en territorio colombiano. 
</p>
<p><b>  Comentarios 
</b></p>
<p>19. El Grupo de Trabajo no ha recibido ninguna respuesta del Gobierno de Colombia en 
referencia a esta alegaci&#243;n. El Grupo de Trabajo env&#237;o un recordatorio en relaci&#243;n con esta 
denuncia el 30 de abril 2010 y se lamenta que el Gobierno de Colombia no haya cooperado 
con el mandato otorgado al Grupo de Trabajo por la Asamblea General y el Consejo de 
Derechos Humanos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Croatia 
</b></p>
<p>20. On 4 May 2009, the Working Group sent a communication to the government of 
Croatia regarding the alleged involvement of two citizens of Croatia in the alleged plot 
against the democratically elected President and other senior officials from the government 
of Bolivia (see Bolivia). One of the individual killed in the Bolivian police operation was a 
Bolivian-Croatian national reportedly with Hungarian and Spanish origins and allegedly the 
leader of the plot. He reportedly moved to Croatia in 1992 where he fought and led the 
Croatian forces&#8217; First International Platoon (Prvi Internacionalni Vod, known as PIV). At 
the end of the war, he was reportedly given Croatian citizenship. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Among the two men arrested during the operation, one was reported to have been 
identified as a Bolivian army veteran of Croatian descent who is also believed to have 
fought along the Croatian forces in the war. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Croatia dated 6 July 2009  
</b></p>
<p>22. The Government replied that Mr. Eduardo Flores, son of Jorge, born on 31 March 
1960, was granted Croatian citizenship and issued an identification card and passport valid 
until 3 August 2002; the validity of the aforementioned document has not been extended. 
Mr. Mario Tadi&#263; was granted Croatian citizenship on 20 August 2002 and is in possession 
of an identification card valid until 2010 and a passport valid until 7 August 2016.  
</p>
<p>23. According to the surveys carried out, no information of any kind has been obtained 
about their possible criminal activity or connection to any criminal groups or individuals. 
Likewise, no information as regard use, recruiting, financing and training of mercenaries in 
the republic of Croatia for the purposes of overthrowing governments of any country has 
been discovered.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Croatia for the 
information it provided concerning the alleged involvement of two citizens of Croatia in the 
reported plot against the Bolivian Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Fiji 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 5 February 2010, the Working Group sent a communication to the Government 
of Fiji concerning the alleged presence of Fijian private security guards in Papua New 
Guinea. 
</p>
<p>26. According to the information received, fourteen alleged Fijian private security 
personnel are providing security at the Simberi gold mine in Port Moresby, Papua New 
Guinea&#8217;s northern island province of New Ireland since the first week of January 2010. 
They are reportedly in possession of firearms. The Fijian guards are alleged to have been 
hired by Allied Gold Limited, an Australian-based company operating in Papua New 
Guinea, to provide security at the mine site following disputes with local landowners.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Working Group did not receive a reply to its communication. The Working 
Group regrets that the Government of Fiji failed to cooperate with its mandate given by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council and invites the Government to reply 
without further delay.  
</p>
<p><b>  Guinea

<p>guin&#233;en concernant les op&#233;rations de forces de s&#233;curit&#233; guin&#233;ennes au cours des journ&#233;es du 
28 et 29 septembre 2009 &#224; Conakry.  
</p>
<p>29. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 28 septembre 2009, pr&#232;s de 50 000 personnes 
manifestant contre une &#233;ventuelle candidature du Capitaine Moussa Dadis Camara aux 
&#233;lections pr&#233;sidentielles de janvier 2010 auraient d&#233;fil&#233; dans les rues et se seraient ensuite 
regroup&#233;es dans un stade de Conakry &#224; la mi-journ&#233;e. Les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; seraient alors 
intervenues afin d&#8217;&#233;vacuer le stade en utilisant des gaz lacrymog&#232;nes ainsi que leurs armes 
&#224; feu. Des membres des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient tir&#233; en l&#8217;air mais &#233;galement ouvert le feu 
en direction de la foule. Certaines sources font &#233;tat de la participation de mercenaires 
d&#8217;origine du Liberia parmi les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; lors la r&#233;pression de la manifestation. Plus 
de 150 personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;es et plus d&#8217;un millier bless&#233;es. Plusieurs corps de 
manifestants porteraient des traces de blessures multiples, caus&#233;es par arme &#224; feu et par des 
armes blanches, notamment des couteaux et ba&#239;onnettes.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>30. Le Gouvernement guin&#233;en n&#8217;a pas transmis de r&#233;ponse &#224; cette communication 
jointe. Le Groupe de travail regrette que le gouvernement n&#8217;ait pas coop&#233;r&#233; avec son 
mandat, tel qu&#8217;&#233;tablit par le Conseil des Droits de l&#8217;Homme et l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e G&#233;n&#233;rale et 
l&#8217;invite &#224; r&#233;pondre dans les plus brefs d&#233;lais.  
</p>
<p><b>  Hungary 
</b></p>
<p>31. On 30 April 2009, the Working Group sent a communication to Hungary regarding 
the alleged involvement of a Hungarian citizen in the alleged plot against the 
democratically elected President and other senior officials from the government of Bolivia 
(see Bolivia). One of the individual killed in the Bolivian police operation was a Hungarian 
citizen of Bolivian origins. It is alleged that the individual was the leader of the group and 
that he had fought in the war for Croatian independence in the 1990&#8217;s where he commanded 
a paramilitary organization. Another Hungarian citizen alleged to be a veteran of the 
Croatian war was reportedly among the two individuals that were being detained by the 
Bolivian authorities following the police operation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Hungary dated 15 May 2009 
</b></p>
<p>32. In its letter, the Government of Hungary recalled that in accordance with Section 
145 of Article 4 of the Criminal Code (Act IV of 1978 on the Criminal Code &#8211; hereinafter: 
&#8220;Criminal Code&#8221;) on the punishment of illicit recruitment, Paragraph 1 includes explicitly 
the sanction of recruitment while Paragraph 2 refers to the sanction of activities of 
mercenary. The letter also refers to the definition of mercenary as per paragraph 2 of 
Article 47 of the Optional Protocol I. to the Geneva Conventions and to the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. The 
letter emphazised that both Hungary and Bolivia are not party to the &#8216;Mercenaries 
Convention&#8217;. However, the Government noted that according to the above mentioned 
Paragraph 2 of Section 1, those who are involved in conspiring against the state, are defined 
as mercenaries. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government underlined that it did not consider the actions committed by the 
two Hungarian citizens as acts under the effect of either the regulations of the &#8216;Mercenary 
Convention&#8217; or of those of the &#8216;Protocol&#8217;, since several elements of the bearings of the case 
are lacking. Concerning the peaceful circumstances in Bolivia, the country is touched upon 
neither international armed conflict nor non-international armed conflict. It also referred to 
the notion of &#8216;Private gain&#8217; as a motivation, which is included in  the definition of 
mercenary and stated that  according to the Government knowledge and the information </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>provided by Bolivia, the two Hungarian citizens did not seek for private gains in any 
Bolivian actions.  
</p>
<p>34. The Government stressed that Eduardo R&#243;zsa Flores, who died in a police raid, had 
also Bolivian citizenship which excludes the possibility to consider him mercenary. Finally, 
the Government underlined that the trial procedure must be based on the Hungarian 
Criminal Code in Hungary and according to the Hungarian Criminal Code, the legal 
elements of the bearings of the case were not fulfilled in the cases concerning the 
Hungarian citizens due to the fact that armed conflicts do not exist in Bolivia. Moreover the 
Hungarian citizens, the one who died and the other who is in detention, were not members 
of any foreign armed force operating within organizational framework. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Hungary for the 
information it provided concerning the above-mentioned allegation.   
</p>
<p><b>  Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>36. On 30 April 2009, the Working Group sent a communication to Ireland regarding 
the alleged involvement of an Irish citizen in the alleged plot against the democratically 
elected President and other senior officials from the government of Bolivia (see Bolivia). 
One of the individual killed in the Bolivian police operation was a citizen of Ireland. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Ireland dated 9 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>37. The facts surrounding the incident in which Mr. Michael Dwyer, an Irish citizen, 
was killed in the course of a police raid in Santa Cruz on 16 April 2009 are the subject of an 
investigation by the Bolivian authorities. The Irish government has offered Irish police 
assistance in the investigation. The Bolivian authorities have undertaken to transmit the 
findings of their investigation once this is completed.  
</p>
<p>38. Mr. Michael Dwyer has been positively identified as an Irish citizen, born on 15 
June 1984 in Galway. The Irish police have confirmed that Mr. Dwyer had no criminal 
record in Ireland. Mr. Dwyer was not a member of the Irish Defense Forces.  
</p>
<p>39. Ireland has indicated to the Bolivian authorities its willingness to assist with any 
investigation into the incident resulting in Mr. Dwyer&#8217;s death including, if established, an 
international investigation.  
</p>
<p>40. Ireland is also willing to provide any further appropriate information or assistance to 
the Working Group related to this matter.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Ireland for the 
information it provided regarding this communication.  
</p>
<p><b>  Israel 
</b></p>
<p>42. On 9 December 2009, the Working Group sent a communication to the Government 
of Israel concerning reports of presence of Israeli mercenaries in Guinea.  
</p>
<p>43. According to the information received, a group of two to three thousands mostly 
ethnic forestiers is being trained by foreign mercenaries in a training camp in southern 
Guinea. Several sources referred to the presence of Israeli nationals among the mercenaries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.1

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>The spokesperson of the &#8216;Conseil national pour la D&#233;mocratie et le Development&#8217; (CNDD) 
acknowledged in an interview that Israeli nationals were training the CNDD supporters.  
</p>
<p>44. On <b>14 May 2009</b>, the Working Group sent a Follow up to a communication sent by 
the Working Group on 17 October 2008, concerning allegations that Israeli private security 
companies are being used to maintain the Wall and its associated regime, and Israeli 
settlements inside the Palestinian territories. This letter follows a response from the Israeli 
authorities dated 29 October 2008 requesting clarification on the Working Group&#8217;s 
reference to the &#8220;Wall&#8221;. The Working group replied that in all occurrences, reference is 
made to the concrete/barbed-wire/electrified fence/dirt mounds/other materials structure in 
its entirety, as described by the International Court of Justice as the &#8220;Wall&#8221;, and by the 
United Nations Secretary-General as the &#8220;barrier&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Israel dated 26 April 2010 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government of Israel responded that checkpoints management personnel 
comprise of civil service employees and Private security Companies (PSCs). It stated that 
security personnel undergo training, including on security examination and culture of Islam, 
approved and supervised by authorities. In addition, Israeli authorities requested that any 
further communication refers to &#8216;barrier&#8217; and not &#8216;wall&#8217;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Working Group thanks the Government of Israel for its response to its 
communication dated 14 May 2009. It regrets that it did not reply to its communication 
related to the alleged presence of Israeli mercenaries in Guinea and invites the Government 
to reply with no further delay.  
</p>
<p><b>  Papua New Guinea 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 5 February 2010, the Working Group sent a communication to the Government 
of Papua New Guinea concerning the presence of Fijian private security guards in Papua 
New Guinea.  
</p>
<p>48. According to the information received, fourteen alleged Fijian private security 
personnel are providing security at the Simberi gold mine in Port Moresby, Papua New 
Guinea&#8217;s northern island province of New Ireland since the first week of January 2010. 
They are reportedly in possession of firearms. The Fijian guards are alleged to have been 
hired by Allied Gold Limited, an Australian-based company operating in Papua New 
Guinea, to provide security at the mine site following disputes with local landowners.

<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group

<p>49. The Working Group did not receive a reply to its communication. The Working

<p>51. Por medio de carta enviada el 11 de abril de 2007 hemos se&#241;alado a la atenci&#243;n 
urgente del Gobierno de Su Excelencia que hab&#237;amos recibido alegaciones de amenazas de 
muerte y amenazas contra la integridad f&#237;sica dirigidas contra la Sra. Mirtha V&#225;squez 
Chuquilin, Directora de la organizaci&#243;n no gubernamental Grupo de Formaci&#243;n e 
Intervenci&#243;n para el Desarrollo Sostenible &#8216;GRUFIDES&#8217;, y el Padre Marco Arana Zegarra, 
fundador de dicha instituci&#243;n. Ambos recibieron amenazas por separado en sus respectivos 
domicilios el 30 de agosto de 2006. 
</p>
<p>52. Queremos reiterar nuestra profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la seguridad del personal del 
GRUFIDES, porque se teme que las alegaciones de amenazas directas o disfrazadas de 
agentes de empresas de seguridad privadas pueden estar relacionadas con el trabajo en 
defensa de derechos humanos y de  protecci&#243;n del medio ambiente que llevan a cabo en la 
Regi&#243;n peruana de Cajamarca.

<p>53. El Grupo de Trabajo no ha recibido ninguna respuesta del Gobierno de Per&#250; en 
referencia a esta alegaci&#243;n. El Grupo de Trabajo lamenta que el Gobierno de Per&#250; no haya 
cooperado con el mandato otorgado al Grupo de Trabajo por la Asamblea General y el 
Consejo de Derechos Humanos.

<p><b>  Romania 
</b></p>
<p>54. On <b>30 April 2009</b>, the Working Group sent a communication to the Government of 
Romania regarding the alleged involvement of a Romanian citizen in the alleged plot 
against the democratically elected President and other senior officials from the government 
of Bolivia (see Bolivia). One of the individual killed in the Bolivian police operation was a 
citizen of Romania. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Romania dated 9 July 2009 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Government of Romania confirmed that Mr. Magyarosi Arpak, a citizen of 
Romania, was killed in Bolivia on 16 April 2009. The Government was however not in a 
position to confirm the accuracy of the facts regarding the operation launched by the 
Bolivian police. 
</p>
<p>56. The Romanian authorities stated that they had not carried out investigation in 
relation to this event, because a) No official complaint has been registered in connection to 
it; and b) An ex-officio referral did not seem appropriate, since on the one hand, the fact 
that the citizen deceased excludes the possibility to apply the Romanian criminal law, based 
on the criminal law principle of personality, and on the other hand, the authorities did not 
consider timely initiating a criminal procedure, based on the criminal law principle of 
reality, as a juridical commission of the Bolivian Congress is currently investigating the 
case. The Romanian authorities are looking forward to learning the conclusions of the 
commission, which will be made public after the ends of the investigations.  
</p>
<p>57. The Romanian authorities confirmed that Mr. Magyarosi Arpak, a citizen of 
Romania, was killed in Bolivia on 16 April this year but that the authorities had no 
elements to confirm the accuracy of the facts as presented by the Bolivian authorities.

<p><b>  South Africa 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 9 December 2009, the Working Group sent a communication to the Government 
of South Africa concerning reports of presence of South African mercenaries in Guinea. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the information received, a group of two to three thousands Guinean 
from the Guerze and the related forestier tribes is being trained by foreign mercenaries in a 
training camp in southern Guinea. Several sources stated that among those mercenaries 
were South African nationals that were recruited to provide protection and security and 
military training to the Guinean Government led by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara. The 
South African mercenaries appear to be former employees of the private military company 
Executive Outcomes and are allegedly operating under the leadership of Mr. Daniel 
Oosthuizen, a South African police veteran. They are reportedly employed by the Dubai-
based company Omega Strategic Services. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of Romania dated 11 March 2010 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Government of South Africa informed that the provision of training to soldiers, 
police or any formation in Guinea or elsewhere would require prior authorization form the 
South African National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), which is 
overseen by the Department of Defence and Military Veterans. In this instance the NCACC 
did not receive any such request nor did it grant authorization under the Regulation of the 
Foreign Military Assistance Act, No. 15 of 1998 or the Prohibition of Mercenary Activities 
and Regulation of Certain Activities in Country of Armed Conflict Act, no.27 of 2006 for 
any South African person to provide any training service to soldiers, police, or any other 
formation in Guinea.  
</p>
<p>62. The Government conveyed that its position was that all bandits involved in unlawful 
acts of undermining the rule of law and disregarding the laws within a certain country&#8217;s 
jurisdiction should be apprehended and be prosecuted consistent with the laws of that 
country.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Working Group thanks the Government of South Africa for its response to its 
communication and invites the authorities to share any further relevant information in this 
regard.  
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p>64. On <b>17 July 2009</b>, the Working Group, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary and or arbitrary executions sent a communication to the government 
of the United States of America (U.S.) concerning reports of a shooting incident that 
occurred on 29 June 2009, between armed Afghan Special Guards (also referred to by the 
local population as &#8220;Afghan Special Forces&#8221;) and Afghan National Police (ANP) inside the 
Attorney General&#8217;s office in Kandahar, Afghanistan (see above).  
</p>
<p>65. While the precise identity and chain of command of the Afghan Special Guards is 
unclear, according to information received, it is an Afghan private entity<b> </b>operating as a 
security company.  Information received indicates that it may be working with, or led by, 
American Special Forces in Afghanistan, or armed international intelligence services.  </p>

<p><b>  Reply from the Government of the United States dated 23 April 2010 
</b></p>
<p>66. By letter dated <b>23 April 2010</b>, the Government of the United States replied that all 
questions relating to this incident should be referred to the Government of Afghanistan 
</p>
<p>67. On<b> 12 July 2010, </b>the Working Group, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary and or arbitrary executions, sent a follow-up letter in response to the 
reply dated 23 April 2010 of its communication of 17 July 2009. The Rapporteurs noted 
that the reply failed to address the crux of the communication, which seeks information 
about the connection, if any, between the Afghan Special Guards involved in the shooting 
of the six Afghan National Police officers and any U.S. force, agency or organization. They 
added that while the primary responsibility to investigate the incident and prosecute those 
responsible rests with the Government of Afghanistan, and while they were waiting for a 
response from the Afghan Government on this issue, they requested the Government to 
clarify the precise identity and chain of command regarding the Afghan Special Guards. 
The letter recalled that the information received indicated that Afghan Special Guards are 
an Afghan private entity<b> </b>operating as a security company working under the authority of 
the American Special Forces in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>68. On <b>7 January 2010</b>, the Working Group sent a communication to the government of 
the United States of America (U.S.) following Judge Ricardo M. Urbina of Federal District 
Court for the District of Columbia&#8217;s decision on 31 December 2009 to dismiss an 
indictment against five security guards of Blackwater, the private security firm charged 
with voluntary manslaughter and firearms violations in connection with a shooting during 
which 17 people were killed and a further 20 injured on 16 September 2007 in Baghdad.  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group had sent an allegation letter on 25 September 2007 regarding 
this incident to which the US Government responded on 21 July 2008. In its response, the 
United States Government said that the incident was subject of a thorough investigation by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It also described the numerous steps the U.S. 
Government had taken since the incident to strengthen oversight and accountability of 
private security companies working on its behalf in Iraq.  
</p>
<p>70. While stressing its respect for the independence of the judiciary and the 
requirements for due process, the Working Group highlighted is concerns that this decision 
may lead to a situation where no one would be held accountable for what could be unlawful 
killings.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government of the United States dated 23 April 2010 
</b></p>
<p>71. The U.S. Government stated in its reply that it deeply regrets the suffering and loss 
of life caused by the Nissour square shooting on 16 September 2007 and informed that it 
had taken steps to hold legally accountable the individuals allegedly responsible. It added 
that the U.S. Department of Justice has file charges against five Blackwater Worldwide 
security contractors. On 31 December 2009, a federal judge dismissed the indictment 
against the defendants arguing the mishandling of certain evidence by prosecutors. The 
Department of Justice filed its notice of appeal with the court on 29 January 2010 and the 
appeal is pending. Te Government added that the prosecution of these five individuals was 
one of the many steps taken by the U.S. Government to ensure effective oversight and 
accountability for private security companies working in Iraq. <b>
