For the second quarter of 2016, revenue was sourced 94% from precious metals (72% gold, 16% silver and 6% PGM) and
84% from the Americas (14% U.S., 19% Canada and 51% Latin America). Costs and expenses increased due to higher
depletion and cost of sales as a result of the recent Antamina and Antapaccay stream acquisitions. Oil & gas production
levels were stable but lower oil prices resulted in lower revenue year-over-year. Cash provided by operating activities
before changes to working capital was $109.9 million.
Portfolio Updates
·                  Precious Metals — U.S.:  GEOs from U.S. precious metals assets were flat year-over-year
with increases from Goldstrike largely offsetting decreases at Stillwater and Bald Mountain. GEOs
received from the U.S. assets were 16,707 GEOs.
·                  Bald Mountain (0.875-5% NSR/GR) — Kinross reported that first half 2016 production was
weak due to higher than anticipated stripping.  It expects to almost double production for 2017 and
2018 and sees further reserve upside.
·                  South Arturo (4-9% GR with AMR) — The project currently being advanced by Barrick Gold
and Premier Gold Mines is expected to contribute revenue to Franco-Nevada in the second half of
2016.
·                  Hollister (3-5% NSR) — Klondex Mines, Franco-Nevada’s partner at Fire Creek/Midas,
announced it is acquiring the Hollister Mine in Nevada on which Franco-Nevada has up to a 5%
NSR royalty.
·                  Castle Mountain (2.65% NSR) — NewCastle Gold has raised additional funding to advance
the Castle Mountain project in California.  Franco-Nevada renegotiated its royalty covering the asset
during the second quarter 2016 and now covers all concessions with a 2.65% NSR.
·                  Precious Metals — Canada:  GEOs from Canadian precious metals assets increased by
approximately 25% compared with the second quarter 2015 to 14,919 GEOs.  The main contributor to
the increase was the Sudbury operation which benefitted from stronger production.
·                  Musselwhite (5% NPI) — Goldcorp has announced approval for a materials handling project
which it expects will increase production by 20% over 2016-2018.
·                  Brucejack (1.2% NSR) — Pretium Resources reported an increased resource estimate for
the Brucejack project and that it still expects to begin commissioning of the underground mine in mid-
2017.
·                  Timmins West (2.25% NSR) and East Timmins (0.25-15% NSR) — Operatorship of several
Canadian royalties moved into stronger hands with Lake Shore Gold being acquired by Tahoe
Resources and St Andrew Goldfields by Kirkland Lake Gold.
·                  Hardrock (3% NSR) — A feasibility study for the Hardrock project in Ontario, which is being
advanced by joint venture partners Premier Gold Mines and Centerra Gold, is expected in the third
quarter.
·                  Precious Metals — Latin America:  GEOs from Latin American precious metals assets
represented the largest year-over-year increase due to the addition of the Antamina and Antapaccay
streams.  GEOs delivered from Latin America were 60,899 GEOs.
·                  Antamina (22.5% silver stream) — Antamina delivered 11,898 GEOs during the quarter and
29,679 GEOs year to date.  With the year-to-date production results from Antamina, GEOs received
are now expected to be higher than Franco-Nevada’s original Antamina guidance for 2016 of 40,000
GEOs.
·                  Antapaccay (gold and silver stream) — Antapaccay delivered 19,581 GEOs during the
quarter with full year deliveries still anticipated within the original 60,000 to 70,000 GEOs guidance
range.
·                  Candelaria (gold and silver stream) — As Franco-Neveda expected, Candelaria deliveries
decreased year-over-year to 16,247 GEOs from 24,192 GEOs in the second quarter 2015 mainly due
to mine sequencing.
·                  Palmarejo & Guadalupe (50% gold stream) — In the third quarter, the 400,000 ounce
minimum at Palmarejo was met resulting in the termination of the original Palmarejo stream
agreement and the commencement of the Guadalupe stream agreement.  Under the new agreement,
deliveries are based on 50% of the gold produced from the Palmarejo property (including the new
Guadalupe mine) with ongoing payments equal to the lesser of $800 per ounce and the then
prevailing spot price for gold.
·                  Cobre Panama (gold and silver stream) — During the quarter, Franco-Nevada contributed
$37.7 million of its share of construction capital for the Cobre Panama project and now estimates
total funding between $120 - $140 million in 2016, down slightly from the $130 - $150 million
previously estimated.  Franco-Nevada has now contributed $376 million of its total $1 billion
commitment to fund the construction of Cobre Panama.
·                  Precious Metals — Rest of World:  GEOs from Rest of World precious metals assets
increased year-over-year mainly due to deliveries from the Karma fixed ounce obligation.  GEOs from
the Rest of World were 18,775 GEOs during the quarter.
·                  Karma (fixed gold deliveries & 4.875% gold stream) — True Gold, the operator of Karma, has
been acquired by Endeavour Mining.  2,500 GEOs were delivered in the quarter with one month of
deliveries to be carried into the third quarter 2016.  The additional 1,250 GEOs will contribute to
revenue in the third quarter 2016.
·                  Ity (1.5% capped NSR) — Endeavour Mining also now owns the Ity mine in Cote d’Ivoire and
reported an expansion of reserves.
2
·                  Sissingué (0.5% NSR) — Also in Cote d’Ivoire, Perseus Mining announced plans for the full-
scale development of its Sissingué project with first production expected in late 2017.
·                  Duketon (2% NSR) — Regis Resources has announced reserve increases at its Duketon
belt projects.
·                  Tasiast (2% NSR) — Kinross announced that the suspension of mining and processing
operations at the Tasiast mine has been resolved and that operations will resume in August.  Kinross
continues to advance development of the Tasiast Phase One expansion.
·                  Subika (2% NSR) — Newmont Mining is expected to make a decision in the second half of
2016 regarding an Ahafo mill expansion and the underground development of Subika.
·                  Oil & Gas: Revenue from oil & gas assets was $7.8 million in the second quarter 2016
compared with $10.3 million in the second quarter 2015. Production remains relatively stable.
Dividend Declaration
Franco-Nevada is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share. 
The dividend will be paid on September 29, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 15, 2016. The Canadian dollar
equivalent is determined based on the noon rate posted by the Bank of Canada on August 5, 2016. Under Canadian tax

Average Market Price, as defined in the DRIP.  However, the Company may, from time to time, in its discretion, change or
eliminate the discount applicable to treasury acquisitions or direct that such common shares be purchased in market
acquisitions at the prevailing market price, any of which would be publicly announced. The DRIP and enrollment forms are
available on the Company’s website at www.franco-nevada.com. Registered shareholders may also enroll in the DRIP

This press release contains “forward looking information” and “forward looking statements” within the meaning of applicable
Canadian securities laws and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, respectively, which may
include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future events or future performance, management’s expectations
regarding Franco-Nevada’s growth, results of operations, estimated future revenues, carrying value of assets, future
dividends and requirements for additional capital, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, production estimates,
production costs and revenue, future demand for and prices of commodities, expected mining sequences, business
prospects and opportunities. In addition, statements (including data in tables) relating to reserves and resources and gold
equivalent ounces (“GEOs”) are forward looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain
estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the estimates and assumptions are accurate and that
such reserves and resources and GEOs will be realized. Such forward looking statements reflect management’s current
beliefs and are based on information currently available to management. Often, but not always, forward looking statements
can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budgets”, “scheduled”, “estimates”,
“forecasts”, “predicts”, “projects”, “intends”, “targets”, “aims”, “anticipates” or “believes” or variations (including negative
variations) of such words and phrases or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions “may”, “could”,
“should”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Franco-Nevada
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking
statements. A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any forward looking
statement, including, without limitation: fluctuations in the prices of the primary commodities that drive royalty and stream
revenue (gold, platinum group metals, copper, nickel, uranium, silver, iron-ore and oil and gas); fluctuations in the value of
the Canadian and Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and any other currency in which revenue is generated, relative to the
U.S. dollar; changes in national and local government legislation, including permitting and licensing regimes and taxation
policies and the enforcement thereof; regulatory,  political or economic developments in any of the countries where
properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest are located or through which they are held;
risks related to the operators of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest, including
changes in the ownership and control of such operators; influence of macroeconomic developments; business
opportunities that become available to, or are pursued by Franco-Nevada; reduced access to debt and equity capital;
litigation; title, permit or license disputes related to interests on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a
royalty, stream or other interest; whether or not the Corporation is determined to have “passive foreign investment
company” (“PFIC”) status as defined in Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;
potential changes in Canadian tax treatment of offshore streams; excessive cost escalation as well as development,
permitting, infrastructure, operating or technical difficulties on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a
royalty, stream or other interest; actual mineral content may differ from the reserves and resources contained in technical
reports; rate and timing of production differences from resource estimates, other technical reports and mine plans; risks
and hazards associated with the business of development and mining on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada
holds a royalty, stream or other interest, including, but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological and metallurgical
conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest or an outbreak of
contagious diseases; and the integration of acquired assets. The forward looking statements contained in this press
release are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation: the ongoing
operation of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest by the owners or operators of
such properties in a manner consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures made by the
owners or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse change in the market price of the commodities that
underlie the asset portfolio; the Corporation’s ongoing income and assets relating to determination of its PFIC status; no
material changes to existing tax treatment; no adverse development in respect of any significant property in which Franco-
Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; the accuracy of publicly disclosed expectations for the development of
underlying properties that are not yet in production; integration of acquired assets; and the absence of any other factors
that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. However, there can be
no assurance that forward looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ
materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are not
guarantees of future performance. Franco-Nevada cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these
forward looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements due to the
inherent uncertainty therein. For additional information with respect to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to
the “Risk Factors” section of Franco-Nevada’s most recent Annual Information Form filed with the Canadian securities
regulatory authorities on www.sedar.com and Franco-Nevada’s most recent Annual Report filed on Form 40-F filed with the
SEC on www.sec.gov. The forward looking statements herein are made as of the date of this press release only and
Franco-Nevada does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new information, estimates or opinions,
future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

NON-IFRS MEASURES:  Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional
information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and should not
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance
with IFRS.  These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from
operations as determined under IFRS.  Other companies may calculate these measures differently.
For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the
Company’s current MD&A disclosure found on the Company’s website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR.
(1)         GEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are
estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment
of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated
taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals were
converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the
average gold price for the period. For Q2 2016, the average commodity prices were as follows:
$1,259/oz gold (2015 - $1,193/oz); $17.17/oz silver (2015 - $16.41/oz); $1,004/oz platinum (2015 -
$1,127/oz) and $568/oz palladium (2015 - $760/oz).
(2)         Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are non-IFRS financial
measures, which exclude the following from net income and earnings per share (“EPS”): foreign
exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses; gains/losses on the sale of investments;
impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; unusual non-
recurring items and; impact of income taxes on these items.
(3)         Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which
exclude the following from net income and EPS: income tax expense/recovery; finance expenses;
finance income; depletion and depreciation; non-cash costs of sales; impairment charges related to
royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on the sale of investments and;
foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses.
