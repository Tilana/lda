<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report supplements the main report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/11/41). It reflects 
specific situations alleged to be affecting the independence of judges or lawyers or violating the 
right to a fair trial in 52 countries. Further, it includes replies received from the Government of 
the country concerned in response to specific allegations together with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
comments and observations. Readers will thus find in it: 
</p>
<p> (a) Summaries of the urgent appeals and allegation letters transmitted by the 
Special Rapporteur to governmental authorities between 16 March 2008 and 15 March 2009, and 
of press releases issued during the same reporting period. In this connection, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the communications presented in the report exclusively 
reflect allegations he received and subsequently acted upon. Where information was insufficient 
and could not be supplemented, or where the information received was outside the mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur was not in a position to act. Hence such allegations were not included in the 
report. 
</p>
<p> (b) Summaries of the replies received from several States concerned between 
1 May 2008 and 10 May 2009. In certain instances, the Government reply was obtained late and 
referred to allegations that were presented in the previous reports (A/HRC/8/4/Add.1 and 
A/HRC/4/25/Add.1). In those cases, the Special Rapporteur has included the respective 
allegation in the section of communications sent, in order to facilitate the reader&#8217;s 
comprehension. On the other hand, it may be noted that certain responses to urgent appeals or 
allegation letters sent during the reporting period, and for which the Special Rapporteur wishes 
to thank the Governments, could not be included in the report owing to the fact that they were 
either not translated in time or received after 10 May 2009. To the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s regret, 
they will therefore be reflected only in next year&#8217;s report. Finally, due to restrictions on the 
length of the report, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged to summarize the details of all 
correspondence sent and received. As a result, requests from Governments to publish their 
replies in their totality could regrettably not be accommodated. 
</p>
<p> (c) Observations and specific comments by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>2. In the first chapter, this report also includes 10 charts reflecting statistical data so as to help 
the Human Rights Council to have an overview of developments in 2008 and the first trimester 
of 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  STATISTICAL DATA 
</b></p>
<p>3. The following tables of statistical data are aimed at helping the Human Rights Council to 
have an overview of developments in 2008 and the first trimester of 2009. 
</p>
<p>4. The tables show that action had to be taken in all parts of the world and that it covered a 
very wide range of issues. Since it is far from uncommon that situations affecting the judiciary 
occur in contexts in which other democratic institutions are also at risk, or where a variety of 
human rights are being violated - for example the right to life, the right not to be subjected to 
torture and ill-treatment, the right to freedom of expression, women&#8217;s rights, indigenous people&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and minorities&#8217; rights - the Special Reporter&#8217;s action often had to be taken jointly with other 
special procedures. Thus, 77% of communications were sent to Governments jointly with other 
special procedures (<b>See chart 1</b>). This also reflects the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s will to work in 
close collaboration with other mandate holders so as to strengthen the impact of the special 
procedures system.

<p>5. As compared to previous years, the Special Rapporteur is glad to mention that he enjoyed 
increased cooperation on the part of governments: 38 States of the 50 States referred to in this 
report (76%) have replied to his communications and most answers offered detailed, substantive 
information regarding the allegations received (<b>See chart 3</b>). The Special Rapporteur underlines 
that it is crucial that governments share their views on the allegations received with him. 
</p>
<p>6. He highlights his preoccupation in relation to the proportion of specific allegations of 
serious human rights violations that remain unanswered. Thus, he can only express his deep 
concern at the lack of cooperation of 24% of those States he contacted, more especially where 
the cases at hand were especially serious and revealed systemic violations affecting not only the 
judiciary, but the institutional structures of the Member State at large. In addition, the 
Special Rapporteur notes that replies are often received with a considerable delay. This is 
certainly a matter of concern, in particular in situations in which the life or the physical integrity 
of a person or a group of persons is at stake. The Special Rapporteur encourages Member States 
to reply to his communications within reasonable deadlines. </p>

<p>7. It may be of interest to note that, by region, the level of cooperation by governments 
enjoyed by the Special Rapporteur may be classified in decreasing order as follows: 81% in 
Europe, North America and Central Asia, 81% in Asia and the Pacific, 77% in the Middle East 
and North Africa, 57% in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 22% in Africa. These figures 
could, at the one hand, reflect the degree of political will to engage into dialogue with the 
Special Rapporteur. These figures could, at the one hand, reflect the degree of political will to 
engage into dialogue with the Special Rapporteur. Furthermore, they could reflect the level of 
national awareness of and attention to the impact of the special procedures, but also the level of 
administrative capacity of governments to prepare answers within the required deadlines. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur welcomes and encourages further cooperation from governments, 
on the understanding that a lack of reply, whatever its reasons, exposes Member States to have 
acknowledged the allegations of violations of human rights by omission. Early, precise and 
detailed answers on the other hand, allow for a dialogue which, in many cases, lead to clarify 
matters and even to a settlement of the case. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes that communications have been sent to Member States of all 
regions of the world <b>(See chart 4)</b>. The Asia and Pacific region (30%) and the Middle East and 
North Africa region (29%) represent more than half of the total of communications sent (59%). 
The Europe, North America and Central Asia region comes on the third place with 17% of the 
communications. Finally, the Africa region has received 14 % of the communications, while the 
Latin America and the Caribbean region has been addressed in 10 % of the cases.

<p><b>Chart 4: Communications sent by the Special Rapporteur per region 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letters addressed to the governments from 16 March 2008 
to 15 March 2009 on alleged human rights violations covered a wide range of subjects (<b>See 
chart 5</b>). The two main concerns which represent almost 50 % of all cases are the lack of access 
to a lawyer and access to a court and a fair trial. It should be noted that these two violations 
frequently occur at the same time and concern particularly those individuals under arrest or 
detention. Harassment or threats to lawyers represent 11 % of the communications addressed to 
the governments. Violations of the right to be informed of charges and the concern of evidence 
used in the proceedings and of obtained by unlawful methods represent each 5 %. 3 % of the 
letters related to allegations were civilians were being tried by military courts. The amount of 
cases in which lawyers were identified with the interests of their clients was 3 %. The remainder 
of the communications (24 %) addressed 16 different categories of alleged violations. They have 
been reflected in only one category because individually they represent a very small percentage </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of the total of the communications sent. The 16 categories can be clustered into the following six 
main thematic groups: i) specific guarantees of due process of law (including the right to be 
brought promptly before a judge, the right to be tried in one&#8217;s presence, the right to a public 
hearing, the right to a trial within a reasonable time or to release, the right to choose a lawyer, 
access to information by lawyers, and the right to have the conviction and sentence being 
reviewed by a higher tribunal) ii) freedom of expression and association of lawyers; iii) lawyer&#8217;s 
immunity for pleading statements; iv) the proper role of prosecutors; v) disciplinary standards for 
judges and; vi) legislative developments likely to impact on the independence of judges and 
lawyers or fair trial guarantees.

</b></p>
<p>11. Thematic issues as addressed by the Special Rapporteur classified by regions are reflected 
in <b>charts 6 to 10</b>. 
</p>
<p>12. The main concerns of lack of access to a lawyer and lack of access to court and a fair trial 
represented almost half of the cases sent to governments in the Middle East and North Africa 
region and 45 % of those sent to governments in the Asia Pacific region. In the Africa region, 
those two categories represent over 60 % of the cases while in the Europe, North America and 
Central Asia region and the Latin America and Caribbean region, these two categories 
concerned 34% and 32 % of the communications, respectively. 
</p>
<p>13. Harassment of or threats to lawyers represented 14 % of the cases in the Middle East and 
North Africa region and 13 % of the cases on the Europe, North America and Central Asia 
region. In the Latin America and Caribbean region this concern amounted to even 25 % and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>therefore represents the most frequent violation in this region. Elevated percentages for the 
harassment or threats of lawyers were also noted with 17 % for the Asia Pacific region and 14 % 
for the Africa region. 
</p>
<p>14. Threats to judges were a serious concern with 13 % in the Latin America and Caribbean 
region. 
</p>
<p>15. Violations of the right to be informed of charges represented 6 % in the Middle East and 
North Africa region and 11 % in the Africa region. 
</p>
<p>16. The issue of civilians tried by military courts was most prominent with 9 % in the 
Middle East and North Africa region. 
</p>
<p>17. The concern of evidence obtained by unlawful methods and used in judicial proceedings 
represented 5 % of the communications sent to governments in the Middle East and North Africa 
region and 4 % of those sent to the Asia Pacific region. 
</p>
<p>18. Concerns of access to a lawyer in private constituted 4 % of the cases in the Europe, 
North America and Central Asia region, while alleged violations of the guarantee of public 
hearings concerned 4 % in this region. Another important fact is that 4 % of the cases in the 
Europe, North America and Central Asia region concerned alleged violations of the right to 
choose a lawyer of one&#8217;s own choice.

<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>19. On 1 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, regarding allegations relating to trials taking place in Afghanistan of 
detainees previously held in custody in the U.S. administered Bagram Theatre Internment 
Facility (BTIF), as well as detainees repatriated from Guant&#225;namo Bay Naval Base facilities to 
Afghanistan. The Special Rapporteurs also addressed a similar letter to the Government of the 
United States of America. According to the information received, some of the individuals 
formerly detained by the United States Government at Guant&#225;namo Bay and Bagram had been, 
and continued to be, transferred to the Afghan National Detention Facility (ANDF) where they 
awaited prosecution. Based on the information received, in the opinion of the 
Special Rapporteurs, the system of detention and transfer of detainees fails to comply with 
international fair trial standards, including the right to court review over any form of detention, 
the presumption of innocence, the right to defence and access to legal counsel, and the right to be 
tried without undue delay as laid down in Articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). According to the information received, prior to the transfer 
to the ANDF, many detainees had been under United States custody without charge for several 
years. In addition, information suggested that trials of ANDF detainees lack many basic due 
process of law guarantees, including access to a lawyer while under investigation and adequate 
time and facilities for the preparation of the defence. With respect to trials and the evidence 
before the prosecution, the information the Special Rapporteurs received suggests that the 
United States Government provides the Afghan prosecution team, that investigates national 
security cases, with supposedly general and declassified versions of the Detainee Assessment 
Branch Reports of Investigation (ROIs), which typically state the date of capture, the capturing 
force and the detainee&#8217;s alleged actions. These ROIs then form the basis of the Afghan 
Government&#8217;s prosecution charges. However, this was done without any examination of 
individual witnesses or statements in the court dossier-sworn or unsworn, often United States 
personnel or officials involved in the capture and/or interrogation of the detainee. According to 
the information received, an estimated number of 303 detainees have been transferred from 
United States custody to the Government of Afghanistan. Furthermore, the National Directorate 
for Security has investigated some 201 cases. The situation of the other 102 detainees was not 
clear regarding the grounds for their detention, and concerning some of them having been 
detained for several months. Furthermore, it has also been brought to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; 
attention that the default status for these detainees transferred to the ANDF is that of pre-trial 
detention until a judicial decision regarding their cases are taken. The Special Rapporteurs were 
concerned over the potential negative effects of the prolonged pre- charge detention in 
Guantanamo Bay and BITF that may compromise the ability of the Government of Afghanistan 
to ensure a fair trial for these persons. Moreover, the trials are conducted based on the in-court 
reading of investigative summaries prepared by United States and Afghan officials which do not 
respect the principle of equality of the parties before the court. The use of evidence in this way 
and the fact that the convictions can be based on it, may violate international standards, including 
the prohibited use of evidence obtained under torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment. The Special Rapporteurs reminded that the Afghan Constitution </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>explicitly prohibits the introduction, as evidence, of statements obtained &#8220;by means of 
compulsion&#8221; and &#8220;recognizes a confession as voluntary only if taken before a judge.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to assure full compliance with the Afghan criminal 
procedure code and international fair trial standards included in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UDHR) and the ICCPR, including by requiring in-court witness testimony, and 
by allowing the defendant to challenge the evidence through cross-examination. The 
Special Rapporteurs called on the Government to ensure that trials be conducted in accordance 
with international fair trial standards, as laid down in the UDHR and ICCPR.

<p>20. On 14 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and as Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding the case of Ms Mary Akrami, 
member of the <i>Afghan Women&#8217;s Skills Development Centre (AWSDC)</i>, a non-governmental 
organization (NGO) dedicated to reducing the suffering of Afghan women and children through 
rehabilitation and development projects and the promotion of peace. According to information 
received, on 21 July 2008, Ms Mary Akrami went to the Attorney General&#8217;s office with a client 
who had been summoned there. In an argument with the women, the Attorney General claimed 
that the AWSDC supported prostitutes and that its members must pay the price for this. 
Ms. Mary Akrami was detained for three hours. No reason was given for her detention. Concern 
was expressed that the detention of Ms Mary Akrami may be related to her legitimate and 
peaceful activities to defend women&#8217;s rights in Afghanistan.

de la r&#233;ponse du Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie, en date du 15 novembre 2006 en relation avec les 
pr&#233;sents faits. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, le 30 mars 2008, le proc&#232;s pour 
diffamation de Me Sidhoum aurait eu lieu devant la premi&#232;re section p&#233;nale du Tribunal de 
Sidi M&#8217;hamed, &#224; Alger. Le 23 ao&#251;t 2006, Me Sidhoum aurait re&#231;u une convocation du juge 
d&#8217;instruction du tribunal de Sidi M&#8217;Hammed &#224; Alger qui le notifiait d&#8217;une plainte d&#233;pos&#233;e &#224; son 
encontre par le Ministre de la Justice pour &#171; diffamation &#187; &#224; la suite de ses d&#233;clarations publi&#233;es 
dans l&#8217;article &#171; Aoufi passe son trenti&#232;me mois en d&#233;tention &#187; paru dans le quotidien arabophone 
El Chourouk le 30 mai 2004. Me Sidhoum aurait &#233;t&#233; accus&#233; de jeter le discr&#233;dit sur une d&#233;cision 
de Justice et de porter outrage &#224; un corps constitu&#233; de l&#8217;Etat. Lors de son entretien avec la 
journaliste auteure de l&#8217;article susmentionn&#233;, Me Sidhoum aurait d&#233;nonc&#233; la d&#233;tention arbitraire 
de son client dans la prison de Seradji qui durait depuis 30 mois. Cependant, la journaliste, alors 
journaliste stagiaire au quotidien, n&#8217;aurait pas rapport&#233; de mani&#232;re fid&#232;le les propos de 
Me Sidhoum, &#233;crivant que le client de ce dernier &#171; passe son trenti&#232;me mois &#224; Serkadji suite &#224; 
une d&#233;cision arbitraire rendue par la Cour Supr&#234;me &#187;. En effet, au moment o&#249; Me Sidhoum avait 
tenu ces propos, aucune d&#233;cision n&#8217;aurait encore &#233;t&#233; rendue par la Cour Supr&#234;me, qui ne se serait 
prononc&#233;e que le 28 avril 2005, soit un an apr&#232;s la parution de l&#8217;article. Le 27 mai 2007, 
Me Sidhoum aurait re&#231;u un t&#233;l&#233;gramme lui notifiant sa convocation devant la 6&#232;me chambre 
d&#8217;accusation de Sidi M&#8217;Hamed, &#224; Alger, le 12 juin 2007, suite &#224; une demande de compl&#233;ment 
d&#8217;information effectu&#233;e par le procureur dans le cadre de ces poursuites. L&#8217;audience du 12 juin 
devait permettre une confrontation entre Me Sidhoum et une journaliste du quotidien El 
Chourouk, mais cette derni&#232;re ne s&#8217;&#233;tant pas pr&#233;sent&#233;e, l&#8217;audience aurait &#233;t&#233; repouss&#233;e &#224; une date 
ult&#233;rieure. Par la suite, l&#8217;audience aurait &#233;t&#233; repouss&#233;e &#224; de nombreuses reprises. A la fin de 
l&#8217;audition des parties le 30 mars 2008, le Procureur aurait requis deux ans de prison ferme contre 
Me Sidhoum. Le verdict &#233;tait attendu pour le 13 avril. De vives craintes furent r&#233;it&#233;r&#233;es quant au 
fait que les charges retenues contre Me Amine Sidhoum viseraient &#224; emp&#234;cher ce dernier de

<p>24. Le 10 septembre 2008, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement de l&#8217;Alg&#233;rie, 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, 
inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, un appel urgent concernant la situation de M. Mohamed Rahmouni. Le 
groupe de travail sur les disparitions forc&#233;es ou involontaires a &#233;t&#233; saisi de ce cas le 
14 August 2007 et a re&#231;u une r&#233;ponse dat&#233;e du 2 Janvier 2008. Cependant le groupe a d&#233;cid&#233; que 
l&#8217;information re&#231;ue par le Gouvernement &#233;tait insuffisante pour consid&#233;rer ce cas comme 
&#233;lucid&#233;. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, M. Mohamed Rahmouni, qui aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le 
18 Juillet 2007 &#224; Bourouba (Alger), aurait &#233;t&#233; accus&#233; d&#8217;avoir particip&#233; aux attentats des 11 avril 
et 11 juillet 2007. Il aurait &#233;t&#233; inculp&#233; &#171;de complot ayant pour but de porter atteinte &#224; l&#8217;autorit&#233; 
du commandant militaire [&#8230;]&#187; (article 284 du Code de justice militaire), un crime qui porte la 
peine de mort. M. Rahmouni se trouverait momentan&#233;ment &#224; la prison militaire de Blida. Depuis 
son arrestation, M. Rahmouni n&#8217;aurait pas pu voir son avocat. Le 27 ao&#251;t 2008, son avocat, 
Me Sidhoum, se serait rendu pour la 4&#232;me fois &#224; la prison de Blida pour rendre visite &#224; son 
client. Selon une note qui aurait &#233;t&#233; laiss&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;attention de l&#8217;avocat de M. Rahmouni par le 
Pr&#233;sident du tribunal militaire, il serait interdit &#224; Me Sidhoum de voir son client. Cette 
interdiction se fonderait sur l&#8217;article 18 du Code de justice militaire qui dispose que dans les 
affaires relatives aux infractions sp&#233;ciales, le d&#233;fenseur choisi par l&#8217;inculp&#233; ne peut assister, 
d&#233;fendre ou repr&#233;senter ce dernier, tant au cours de l&#8217;instruction qu&#8217;&#224; l&#8217;audience, que s&#8217;il y a &#233;t&#233; 
autoris&#233; par le Pr&#233;sident du tribunal militaire permanent saisi; dans le cas contraire, le d&#233;fenseur 
est d&#233;sign&#233; par le pr&#233;sident. Le Pr&#233;sident du tribunal n&#8217;aurait pas motiv&#233; son refus. En outre, il 
n&#8217;aurait non plus d&#233;sign&#233; un avocat pour d&#233;fendre M. Rahmouni. De plus, Me Sidhoum n&#8217;aurait 
toujours pas pu acc&#233;der au dossier de son client. M. Rahmouni aurait fait l&#8217;objet des mauvais 
traitements en prison, dont t&#233;moigneraient plusieurs blessures. </p>

<p>26. Le 27 avril 2008, le Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 11 avril 2008, 
indiquant que, s&#8217;agissant des deux affaires ant&#233;rieures reprises dans l&#8217;appel urgent cit&#233; ci-dessus, 
la Mission Permanente voudrait rappeler au Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de 
l&#8217;homme que le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien avait d&#233;j&#224; fourni des r&#233;ponses qui ont fait l&#8217;objet des 
deux envois suivants : note verbale KH/ NO 554 / 06 du 20 juillet 2006 et note verbale 
MPAG/MedB/SS/AA/ N&#176; 458/ 07 du 26 juin 2007. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien consid&#232;re, en 
cons&#233;quence, que ces deux affaires sont closes. Il estime que la r&#233;p&#233;tition dans l&#8217;&#233;vocation des 
ces deux cas dans l&#8217;appel urgent susmentionn&#233;, constitue une tentative de cr&#233;dibiliser le pr&#233;sum&#233; 
d&#233;fenseur des droits de l&#8217;homme. Le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien souligne, &#224; cet &#233;gard, que la

<p>27. Le 10 juillet 2008, le Gouvernement d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 13 juin 2008, 
indiquant que Monsieur Abderhamane Amine Sihoum a fait l&#8217;objet de poursuites engag&#233;es &#224; son 
encontre le 8 juillet 2006 par le procureur de la R&#233;publique d&#8217;Alger, Sidi M. Hamed du Chef

articles 146 et 147 du Code p&#233;nal. Ces poursuites sont cons&#233;cutives &#224; un article de presse publi&#233; 
par le quotidien &#171; El Chourouk &#187; dans lequel Abderhamane Amine Sidhoum d&#233;clare en

Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>30. On 26 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the detention 
and sentencing of Mr Novruzali Mammadov, Head of the Talysh Cultural Centre, and the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>detention of his son, Mr Emil Mammadov. Mr Novruzali Mammadov is a defender of the 
cultural rights of the Talysh people in the south of Azerbaijan. According to information 
received, on 2 February 2007, Mr Novruzali Mammadov was called to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs where he was interrogated about his participation at a science conference in Iran in 2004 
and beaten. He was released but later detained again the following day when he was sentenced 
to 15 days&#8217; imprisonment for failing to cooperate with police officers. This sentence was passed 
despite the fact that Mr Novrulazi Mammadov was already over 65 and, according to a provision 
of Article 30 of the Administrative Code, citizens of that age cannot be sentenced to punishment 
such as custodial placement. Mr Novrulazi spent 15 days in the Investigation Isolation Centre of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and was physically and psychologically pressurized to confess to 
espionage. He did not have access to legal support and his whereabouts were unknown to his 
relatives. On 17 February 2007, he was accused under Article 274 of the Criminal Code of high 
treason and espionage. He had been in detention since that moment. On 24 June 2008, 
Mr Novruzali Mammadov was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment following a closed trial. His 
lawyer was reportedly not present when the verdict was announced in an empty room. 
Mr Novruzali Mammadov was charged with high treason and espionage. The charges were 
related to the gathering of information necessary to establish an administrative autonomy in 
Azerbaijani territories with dense Talysh population and the damaging of Azerbaijan&#8217;s image 
abroad through sending appeals to international organizations about human rights violations 
against Talysh people. During his trial Mr Novruzali Mammadov pleaded not guilty and testified 
that he had been subjected to physical and psychological torture while in detention. The forms of 
torture to which he was allegedly subjected include beating, deprivation of food and water, 
interrogation at night, and threats against his family. He was awaiting the hearing of his appeal in 
detention at a pretrial prison. Following the sentencing of Mr Novruzali Mammadov, a number 
of clarifications were made with respect to the sentence. However, these clarifications were 
reportedly based on confessions of a journalist which may have been obtained through torture 
and ill-treatment. Both Mr Emil Mammadov and his now deceased brother had reportedly been 
abducted and subjected to physical and psychological ill-treatment in the past. Furthermore, on 
16 July 2008, Mr Emil Mammadov, the son of Mr Navrulazi Mammadov, was detained for 
illegal possession of drugs. On 19 July 2008, he was sentenced to three months&#8217; pretrial 
detention before investigations started. However, because of a medical condition, 
Mr Emil Mammadov always carried prescription drugs and no information has been given by the 
police in relation to the drugs found on his person. He was detained in the investigatory jail of 
the Ministry of Justice without access to his family or legal representation, and potentially 
without access to the necessary medical care. Concern was expressed that the ill-treatment and 
sentencing of Mr Novrulazi Mammadov, as well as the detention of Mr Emil Mammadov, may 
be related to his legitimate activities in the defense of the cultural rights of the Talysh people. 
Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr Novrulazi Mammadov and that of his family members.

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>31. On 13 March 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 26 August 2008, stating 
that the authorities have analysed the information obtained from Sebail and Yasamal District 
Courts, the Court of Serious Crimes of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Baku Court of Appeal, 
Investigatory isolator no 1 of the Penitentiary system and Legal Consultancy office no. 4. It was 
determined that Novruzali Mammadov had been arrested for 15 days pursuant to the decision of 
Yasamal district court, dated 3 February 2007 and that since that time his rights were defended </p>

<p>by Ramiz Mammadov, a lawyer at the Legal Consultancy office no. 4, according to the 
agreement signed by his relatives. During the examination the information about the physical 
and psychological pressure exerted on Novruzali Mammadov did not prove to be accurate. 
During the primary investigation, the forensic medical examination held on 7 April 2007 at the 
request of his lawyer R. Mammadov revealed no injuries on his body. On 26 November 2007, 
the criminal case was given to the consideration of the Court of Serious Crimes of the Republic 
of Azerbaijan (Judge - Sakir Alasgarov). During the Court examination, a forensic medical 
examination was held pursuant to the appeal of the defendant. The examination found that no 
injuries were found on his body. It was also found that since 1992 Novruzali Mammadov carried 
out hostile activities against the Republic of Azerbaijan by helping Special Services of a foreign 
country, providing them with special information, finding and contracting persons having the 
required information and providing that country with information about those persons. It was 
also proven that by cooperating confidentially with these organizations, which aim at carrying 
out separatist propaganda in the area of the Republic of Azerbaijan where Tallishs live, he 
accepted money from the organizations for implementing these activities and was involved with 
these activities since then until his imprisonment. Novruzali Mammadov was sentenced to 
10 years imprisonment, alongside with the confiscation of property according to the judgement 
dated 27 June 2008 of the Courts of Serious Crimes of the Republic of Azerbaijan, being charged 
with Article 274 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan (treason). According to the 
mentioned article, the given punishment is the lowest degree of sanction, the highest is 15 years. 
While passing the sentence, the Court considered factors relieving the punishment, including that 
Novruzali Mammadov was being convicted for the first time and having regard to his academic 
activities and the fact that three individuals were under his guardianship on the time of committal 
of the crime. The Government informs that Novruzali Mammadov&#8217;s lawyer, R. Mammadov, 
participated throughout the whole process, made a speech for his defense and was notified about 
the date when the judgement would be read. He did, however, not participate in the hearing. On 
25 June 2008, N. Mammadov was placed in the investigatory isolator No. 1 of the Penitentiary 
Service of the Ministry of Justice and is being held there. N. Mammadov&#8217;s lawyer lodged an 
appeal against the sentence dated 24 June 2008 issued by the Court of Serious Crimes of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan. Subsequently, the case was transferred to the Baku Court of Appeal. The 
Baku Court of Appeal having considered the criminal case decided that the decision of the Court 
of Serious Crimes of 24 June 2008 was legal and reasonable, so the appeal was declined. While 
investigating the information on Emil Mammadov, son of N. Mammadov, it was determined that 
he had been convicted for 6 years pursuant to the Article 80 of Criminal Code of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan (previous edition). On 18 July 2008, the Police Office of Sabail district of Baku city 
started a criminal case against E. Mammadov pursuant to the Article 234.1 of Criminal Code of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan. A lawyer was appointed on public expense on that date, for 
defending E. Mammadov&#8217;s rights. According to the Decision of the Sabail district Court of 
19 July 2008, E. Mammadov was arrested and placed at the investigatory isolator No. 1 of the 
Penitentiary Service of the Ministry of Justice. The opinion of the forensic chemical examination 
dated 28 July 2008 indicated that the substance obtained from E. Mammadov was hand-made 
drug-heroin. During the primary investigation, in the interrogation with the presence of his 
lawyer E. Mammadova, mother of E. Mammadov, applied to the Sabail district Police Office, 
Baku city, indicating that her son takes the narcotics substance against depression. The opinion 
of the forensic-psychiatric examination dated 5 August 2008 indicates that E. Mammadov had a 
serious disturbance of personality resulting from narcotics addiction. E. Mammadov&#8217;s criminal 
case on charges under Article 234.1 of Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan was given </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>to examination to the Sabail district Court on 28 August 2008. By judgement of the Court dated 
07 October 2008, E. Mammadov was found guilty under the Article 234.1 of Criminal Code and 
deprived of liberty for a year (the highest degree of punishment is deprivation of liberty for 
3 years according this provision). Considering the character of the committed crime, the level of 
its threat against public safety and the lack of circumstances aggravating the punishment, the 
punishment was applied to E. Mammadov pursuant to article 70 of the Criminal Code. A 
probationary period of 6 months (pursuant to the 70 Article, duration of probation is applied 
from 6 months to 5 years) was determined. No appeal or protest was lodged against the Court&#8217;s 
judgement. The Government also informs that E. Mammadov has not applied for medical care, 
and did not complain of prison staff.

<p>33. On 24 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the cases of the arrest of 47 persons over four 
weeks and the detention of 26, notably of Ammar Hassan Ali Hassan Al-Basri, 17; Sayyed Hadi 
Hameed Adnan Alawi, 28; Mohammed Abbas Mohammed Ali, 29; Saleh Ali Mohammed Ali

Hussain Ali Dhaif, 28; Hussain Mohammed Khatam Hussain Mohammed, 28; and 
Ebraheem Saleh Ebraheem Jaffer, 22. According to information received, 47 people from the 
villages of Karzakkan, Demistan, Sadad and Malekkya were arrested between 27 March and 
15 April 2008, mostly during house raids by Special Security Forces, allegedly with the support 
of the secret intelligence and armed militia. In one case, the person wanted by the security forces 
was absent, and his brother Jassim Mohammed Habeeb was arrested in his place and taken to 
Hamad Town police station. He was still in detention although his brother presented himself to 
the police station. Others were arrested after they presented themselves to the Hamad Town 
police station in response to official summons. Of the 47 arrested people, 26 were still being 
detained, including one minor, Ammar Hassan Ali Hassan Al-Basri. The detainees were being 
held in the premises of the Criminal Investigations Bureau (CIB) in Adleyya, Manama. Since 
their arrests, they had not had access to lawyers and no visits had been allowed. Some of the 
detainees had been taken before the Public Prosecutor to have their detention extended. In 
addition, Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal, aged 26, from Hamala, was summoned </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>on 15 April 2008 to Hamad-Town police station, from where he was transferred to an unknown 
place. Since then, his whereabouts had been unknown. Mr. Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal had 
briefly been detained on 2 February 2007 for delivering a speech criticizing the government, 
arrested again on 21 December 2007, along with other members of the Committee for the 
Unemployed, in relation to the December protests, and released a month later. His arrest in 
December was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 10 January 2008 by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of 
human rights defenders. Allegations were received that he was subjected to torture including 
being blindfolded and handcuffed for several days, hanged by the arms for two days and exposed 
to electric shocks during his detention. The arrests were triggered by two violent incidents: the 
burning on 6 March 2008 of a farm belonging to a former high Government official and the 
killing on 9 April 2008 of a member of the Special Security Forces. However, accusations 
regarding the killing of the Special Security officer were reportedly not supported by evidence. 
Concern was expressed that these men were arrested and detained for their alleged involvement 
in social movements, such as the Committee for the Unemployed and the Underpaid, the 
Committee for the Defence of Detainees, the Committee against High Prices, etc., as well as 
their community activism. 
</p>
<p>34. On 30 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, regarding the case of Messrs Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein 
Abdul-Aal, aged 26, Sadeq Jawad Ahmed Al-Fardan, aged 27, and Hasan Kathom 
Ebrahim Ahmed, aged 30, members of the Unemployment Committee; Ali Mohamed 
Habib Ashoor, aged 31, and Habib Mohamed Habib Ashoor, aged 20, of the Committee for 
Detainees; Fadhel Abbas Mohamed Ashoor, aged 25, of the Committee Against High Prices; and 
Sayed Omran Hameed Adnan, aged 24, of the Committee Against One Percent. The arrest of the 
aforementioned, together with 19 other men, was subject of an urgent appeal sent on 
24 April 2008 by the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. Mr Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussain was the subject of 
two previous urgent appeals sent by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders and other mandate holders; on 10 January 2008 and on 
18 January 2008. The Special Rapporteurs acknowledged the receipt of the reply of the 
Government dated 26 February 2008. According to the new information received, since their 
arrest in early April 2008, Messrs Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal, Sadeq Jawad 
Ahmed Al-Fardan, Hasan Kathom Ebrahim Ahmed, Ali Mohamed Habib Ashoor, 
Habib Mohamed Habib Ashoor, Adhel Abbas Mohamed Ashoor and Sayed Omran 
Hameed Adnanhave had reportedly been tortured, beaten, held in solitary confinement and 
deprived of food and sleep. A form of torture known as Falaqah has been applied on them, 
whereby a hard stick is inserted between the detainee&#8217;s cuffed hands and tied legs, and then used 
to suspend the detainee in the air for hours with his legs facing upwards and his blind-folded </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>head facing downwards. The detainee&#8217;s feet are then beaten until he makes a confession or loses 
consciousness. The men were reportedly held without charge or access to lawyers and access to 
families have been restricted. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and mental 
integrity of the aforementioned human rights defenders in view of the reported ill-treatment. 
Further concern was expressed that their arrest, detention and treatment amounting to torture 
may be related to their non-violent activities in defense of labour rights in the country. The above 
mentioned allegations were adding to other serious allegations raised by mandate holders 
regarding cases of torture of detained human rights defenders in Bahrain, and serious concern 
was expressed over this apparent emerging trend of repression against human rights defenders in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>35. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the case of 
Messrs Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan, Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh and Abdullah Mohsen 
Abdulah Saleh of the Unemployment Committee; Mr Naji Ali Fateel of the Bahrain Youth 
Society for Human Rights (BYSHR); Mr Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais, head of the 
Committee to Combat High Prices; Mr Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali, former member of the 
Unemployment Committee; and Mr Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab, founding member of the 
Martyrs and Victims of Torture. All of the aforementioned were detained between 21 and 
28 December 2007 following unrest and protests. All were the subject of urgent appeals sent by 
various mandate-holders on 10 January 2008 and 18 January 2008. The Special Rapporteur 
thanked the Government for his response dated 26 February 2008. According to new information 
received, on 13 July 2008, Mr Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan was sentenced to seven years&#8217; 
imprisonment and fined around 9,980 Bahrain Dinars. Messrs Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh, 
Naji Ali Fateel and Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais were sentenced to five years&#8217; 
imprisonment. Mr Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali was sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment for 
taking part in the demonstration, violence against the police officers and setting fire to a 
government vehicle. The High Criminal Court found them guilty of offences such as burning a 
police jeep, illegal gathering and use of force against security officials. In addition, 
Mr Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh was found guilty of theft of a government fire arm and 
possession of a fire arm without permission while Mr Naji Ali Fateel and 
Mr Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais were found guilty of theft of government ammunition and 
possession of part of a fire arm without permission. The judge of the High Criminal Court failed 
to consider medical evidence indicating that some of the human rights defenders may have been 
beaten while in detention. The medical evidence was not fully conclusive because the 
examination by independent forensic experts had been delayed. Messrs Abdullah Mohsen 
Abdulah Saleh and Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab were acquitted. On 18 July 2008, peaceful 
demonstrations, organized by family members of the detained in protest against the sentences, 
were violently dispersed by riot police. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used against the 
protesters. As a result, the four-year-old son of Mr Maytham Bader Jassim Al Sheikh was rushed 
to hospital in an ambulance. While the Special Rapporteurs welcomed the acquittals of 
Messrs Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh and Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab, they were 
concerned that the sentencing of the other above-mentioned human rights defenders may not 
result from a fair trial and may be related to their work in the defense of human rights. They also 
expressed concern that confessions obtained under torture may be the basis of the verdicts of 
those found guilty. </p>

<p>36. On 26 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding the 
concerns that the Special Rapporteurs had pertaining to current judicial practices in family 
matters and the absence of a Family Code in the Kingdom of Bahrain, with implications on 
women&#8217;s ability to enjoy family rights upon divorce and leave abusive relationships. They noted 
with interest the reply by the Bahrain Government to a previous letter (AL G/SO 214 (89-11) 
BHR 4/2006) that the Special Rapporteur sent, which stressed that &#8220;[w]ith regard to the subject 
of family law, the legislature (...) has been examining this question for some time now with a 
view to guaranteeing the rights of everyone in the Kingdom.&#8221; In this joint letter, the 
Special Rapporteurs had noted with concern the absence of a codified family law that states clear 
and equitable norms on divorce or child custody. They had further noted that in the absence of a 
family code, judges seemed to decide cases according to their personal interpretation of Shari&#8217;a, 
often favouring men. In this regard, the Committee against Torture cited the broad discretionary 
powers of Shari&#8217;a courts in the application of the law to personal status cases and recommended 
that Bahrain adopt a Family Code. The Special Rapporteurs also noted with interest that, during 
the Universal Periodic Review of the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Government indicated that it had 
been working on implementing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) since its ratification in 2002, to provide women full 
equality with respect to rights and obligations bearing in mind the Sharia. In this regard, the 
Government committed to &#8220;conduct wide consultations between different partners, in particular 
the legislative authority, with the view of adopting a family law.&#8221; Another matter raised by the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review was the role of the Supreme Council for 
Women. Established in 2001, the Supreme Council for Women plays a role in recommending 
general policy on the development and advancement of women&#8217;s issues in constitutional and 
civil society institutions. It also sought to empower women in public life and to integrate their 
efforts into comprehensive development programmes. The Council&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Complaints 
centre dispenses legal aid to women. However, this legal aid was allegedly not effective due to 
the Council&#8217;s reluctance to interfere in ongoing judicial cases. Furthermore, it was alleged that, 
in May 2007, the Women&#8217;s petition Committee, in a letter to the King of Bahrain, called for the 
dissolution of the Supreme Council for Women, citing its failure in &#8220;building and supporting 
Bahraini women&#8221;. In light of the above, the Special Rapporteurs brought a case to the attention 
of the Government. They understood that the case was under judicial proceedings at the moment; 
without pre-judging the outcomes of such proceeding, they were mentioning it in this letter as it 
is symptomatic of the implications for women&#8217;s family rights of the legal and institutional 
frameworks mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>37. According to the information received, Ms. Saddeeqa Al-Munfaredi, a Bahraini citizen, is 
divorced from her husband, with whom she had a daughter. When the girl reached seven years of 
age this year, her father filed a case at a Shari&#8217;a Court to obtain the guardianship of his daughter. 
It was reported that according to Shari&#8217;a Law, guardianship of a child who reaches seven is 
transferred from the mother to the father. Through the help of a lawyer, Ms. Saddeeqa 
Al-Munfaredi filed a case at the First Level Shari&#8217;a Court n&#176; 3, Jaffaria Division 
(n&#176; 14/2008/01533/6). Hearings between Ms. Saddeeqa Al-Munfaredi and her ex-husband were 
held on 6 May, 20 May and 15 June 2008. The next hearing was scheduled on 
7 September 2008. Both parties had reached an informal agreement at the end of June for the 
mother to keep the daughter, with an increased number of visits by the father. However, during 
the hearing held on 29 June 2008, Ms. Al-Munfaredi&#8217;s ex-husband allegedly refused any </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>agreement. It was reported that Ms. Saddeeqa Al-Munfaredi approached the Supreme Council 
for Women in April 2008, seeking legal aid and support. She filed a case (n&#176; 365) but since then 
has never heard back from the Supreme Council. Ms. Saddeeqa Al-Munfaredi reportedly also 
tried several times to contact the wife of the King of Bahrain, without receiving any response. 
Ms. Al-Munfaredi also had contacts with the brothers and sisters of her ex-husband, who 
confirmed her allegations that he is mentally unstable. She also alleged that her ex-husband had 
sexually abused the child when she was 3 years old. She apparently had a medical certificate 
attesting to the abuse. It was reported that Ms. Al-Munfaredi contacted the Child Protection Unit 
within the Ministry of Social Affairs. This Unit promised to provide an independent report to the 
Shari&#8217;a Court, based on observations and assessment of living standards at her home as well as at 
that of her ex-husband. It was however alleged that judges of Shari&#8217;a Courts are not obliged to 
follow any of the recommendations of the report. Concerns were expressed that the guardianship 
of that child will not be decided upon based on objective criteria, which take into account the 
best interests of the child and consider both parties equally.

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>38. On 14 August 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 24 April 2008 
and 30 May 2008, stating that first, the Department of Public Prosecutions undertook an 
investigation into the persons named in the attached note who had been accused of offences that 
are punishable by law under the Criminal Code. Two investigations were carried out into these 
incidents, as described below. Regarding the first case, the Government informs that the 
Department of Public Prosecutions laid charges against a total of 19 persons on the counts 
described below. They participated in a public demonstration involving more than five persons 
for the purpose of carrying out criminal attacks against property and persons. The accused 
committed the following offences, knowing the purpose behind the demonstration: a) The 
intentional and premeditated murder and ambushing of Majid Ashgar Ali; they had planned and 
conspired to set fire to any police vehicle that passed by the scene of the crime and to kill the 
occupants. They had prepared Molotov cocktails and stones in advance and hid in a place where 
they were certain that a police car would pass. As soon as the victims&#8217; car appeared, they 
showered it with a hail of these materials with the intent of killing the occupants. They caused 
the fatal injuries described in the forensic report on the victim. b) They attempted deliberately to 
murder and ambush Salih Ali Salih and Ammar Mas`ad Hamud; they had planned and conspired 
to set fire to any police vehicle that passed by the scene of the crime and to kill the occupants. 
They had prepared Molotov cocktails and stones in advance and hid in a place where they were 
certain that a police car would pass. As soon as the victims&#8217; car appeared, they showered it with 
a hail of these materials with the intent of killing the occupants. The crime failed to achieve the 
desired effect for reasons beyond their control, namely, the victims&#8217; decision to get out of the 
vehicle, and the fight which the second victim put up. c) They set fire to a police car belonging to 
the Ministry of the Interior and endangered lives and property, after surrounding the vehicle and 
bombarding it with Molotov cocktails, which exploded and set fire to parts of the vehicle. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the second case, the Department of Public Prosecutions brought charges 
against 15 persons on the counts described below. They participated in a public demonstration 
involving more than five persons for the purpose of carrying out criminal attacks against 
property and persons. The accused committed the following offences, knowing the purpose 
behind the demonstration: Setting fire to the movable and immovable property described and 
listed in the case documents as belonging to Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Atiyah Allah Al Khalifah, thus </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>endangering lives and property; throwing Molotov cocktails; dousing them with flammable 
material (gasoline) and setting light to them, as described in the documents. The Government 
further informs that, second, the Department of Public Prosecutions referred all the accused 
persons in the two cases to the Criminal High Court on the charges described above. In referring 
the accused to the Criminal Court, the Department of Public Prosecutions submitted a great deal 
of evidence, including confessions by a number of the accused; confessions in which some of the 
accused implicated others in the same investigation; the testimony of police officers who had 
witnessed the incidents and others who had been present at the scene; and forensic evidence, 
reports and photographs of the accused committing the offence. Third, none of the persons who 
were arrested and detained made any statement when questioned by the Department of Public 
Prosecutions about having been assaulted. The Department of Public Prosecutions nevertheless 
ordered a medical examination of the accused in order to clarify whether or not they had 
sustained any injuries. The medical reports found no evidence of any injuries. Four, 
Shakir Mohammed Abd al-Hussayn Abd al-Al was charged in the second case and was detained 
pending trial. Five, the second case was sent before the Criminal High Court and is still being 
heard by the Court. Six, the Department of Public Prosecutions, at the very outset of the 
investigation, gave orders that the accused and their defence counsel should be provided with 
every assistance to facilitate the presentation of a defence in the framework of the law. Nothing 
was done which vitiates the legal procedures followed by the Department of Public Prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>40. On 21 October 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 26 August 2008, 
stating that further to consultations with the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Bahrain 
(the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Council for Women), the following matters have been 
clarified. With regard to the first question, the Government provided the following 
clarifications: On 29 January 2001, the husband of Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi filed a suit 
(case No. 8/158/2003/14) against his wife before the competent (sharia) court. In it, he demanded 
that his wife return to the marital home. Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi filed two counter-suits 
(Nos. 3/186/2003/14 and 3/1138/2004/14) before the competent (sharia) court, petitioning for a 
divorce from her husband. The court decided to join the latter two suits to the one filed by the 
husband (case No. 8/158/2003/14). The court delivered the following rulings on these cases: In 
case No. 3/186/2003/14, in which the wife (Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi) petitioned for a 
divorce from her husband, a judgement was delivered granting the wife a divorce; In case 
No. 8/158/2003/14, in which the husband demanded that his wife (Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi) 
return to the marital home, the court issued a judgement dismissing the petition on the grounds 
that the divorce rendered it void; In case No. 3/186/2003/14, in which the wife 
(Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi) petitioned for payment of the deferred part of the marriage gift 
(mu&#8217;akkhar al-sadaq), the matter was referred to the competent sharia court. On 
1 February 2006, the husband filed an appeal further to case No. 8/158/2003/14. On 
20 May 2006, a judgement was issued dismissing the appeal. On 22 April 2008, the husband 
filed a suit (case No. 9/1058/2008/14), petitioning for custody of his daughter and an annulment 
of the maintenance payment arrangement. The wife (Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi) filed a 
counter-suit (registered as case No. 6/1533/2008/14), asking to be allowed to retain custody of 
the child and to continue to receive maintenance payments. The court decided to consider both 
cases together and set a date of 28 October 2008 for the hearing. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to the abduction of the child by the father, a judgement was handed down in 
case No. 3/1207/2004/7 finding the husband guilty of abducting the child, ordering him to pay 
a 200 dinar fine and granting the mother (Ms. Saddeeqa Ali Munfaredi) the right to retain </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>custody of the child. The legal procedures followed by the court, in deferring sessions, hearing 
the testimony of both the parties and the witnesses and assessing the documentary and other 
evidence, were based on its competence and knowledge of the specific nature of sharia cases, 
together with its assessment of the actual damage in the case. The court furthermore acted in 
conformity with the rules set out in the Code of Procedures issued by Decree Law No. 26 
of 1986, concerning the sharia courts. With regard to the second question, concerning the 
regulations applied by the sharia courts on the guardianship of children upon divorce, the courts 
follow the rules of the Islamic sharia in cases referred to them by the Sunni and Ja`fari divisions, 
and are essentially guided by the best interests of the child, which constitute the basis of all the 
measures taken in accordance with the Islamic sharia and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. With regard to the third question on the steps taken by the Government to implement the 
national action plan on implementing Bahrain&#8217;s voluntary pledges to the Human Rights Council 
regarding the adoption of a family code, in order to enable the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
the relevant national authorities to follow up, in an effective and concrete manner, on the 
implementation of the Government&#8217;s voluntary commitments and pledges and the 
recommendations and outcomes of the universal periodic review conducted with the Kingdom of 
Bahrain, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the bureau of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) in the Kingdom signed a project document (on 28 July 2008) to support the 
implementation of an action plan relating to the universal periodic review conducted with the 
Kingdom of Bahrain. In the same month, a committee was set up to oversee the implementation 
of the outcomes and the commitments and voluntary human rights pledges made by the 
Kingdom in connection with the universal periodic review report. The members of the 
committee include: the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Social 
Development; the Ministry of Education; the Ministry of Information; the Ministry of Justice and 
Islamic Affairs; the Department of Public Prosecutions; the Ministry of Labour; the 
Supreme Council for Women; the Labour Market Regulatory Authority; the Central Bureau of 
Statistics; the Chamber of Commerce and Trade; representatives of civil associations and of: the 
Bahrain Human Rights Association; the Society for Public Freedom and Democracy Support; the 
Transparency Society; the Bahrain Human Rights Watch Association; the Women&#8217;s Union; and 
the UNDP bureau in the Kingdom. This committee, the members of which represent 
governmental and non-governmental organizations, is currently engaged in translating the 
project document (which was attached to the reply) into concrete action aimed at achieving the 
set objectives within three years from the date of signature. The project focuses on five major 
outputs: gathering information on human rights; applying human rights on the ground; applying 
a human-rights based approach to development programmes; creating a national system for the 
protection and promotion of human rights; and strengthening the normative framework for 
human rights. As will be clear from the above, one of the main project outputs is ensuring the 
application of human rights on the ground, including the implementation of laws in the most 
effective manner, as explained on page 4 of the project. The Government underscores that there 
is a detailed timetable for the selection of a draft human rights law such as a family bill and a 
process to ensure that it is adopted and implemented with the assistance of governmental and non 
governmental stakeholders who are members of the committee (output 2 of the attached annex). </p>

<p>42. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Bahrain for the detailed 
responses to his letters of 24 April, 30 May and 26 August 2008. He is, however, concerned at 
the absence of an official reply to his letter of 28 July 2008 and therefore the Government to 
provide at the earliest possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.

</b></p>
<p>43. On 29 May 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeals 
of 22 May 2007, 7 November 2007 and 8 February 2008 concerning alleged extortion 
charges/threat by RAB officials to Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash, a journalist. The Government 
stated that the competent authorities have investigated the allegations mentioned in the 
communication and provided them with the following response: One Mr. Mahfuzul Alam Loton 
lodged an FIR (First Information Report) with the Boalia Police Station stating that Mr. Jahangir 
Alam Akash demanded money by criminal intimidation. The investigation officer examined the 
witnesses. On the basis of sufficient prima-facie evidence against the accused Mr. Jahangir Alam 
Akash, the investigation officer submitted charge sheet No. 398 dated 30.10.2007 in the court 
under section 385/386 of the Penal Code. During the special operation conducted by RAB-5, 
RaJshahi, Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash was challenged on 24.10.2007 at 01.15 hours as it was an 
unusual to return to the residence. Mr. Akash tried to run away. He was arrested under section 54 
of the code of criminal procedure. Being confirmed, after preliminary inquiry, that Mr. Jahangir 
Alam Akash was the FIR-named accused, RAB-5 handed over Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash to the 
Boalia Model Police Station (PS). Police of Boaliathana (PS) sent him to the Magistrate&#8217;s court 
on the basis of General Diary (GD) No. 1239 dated 24.10.2007 under section 16 (2) of the 
Emergency Power Rules-2007. He was also arrested in connection with the case No. 13, dated 
23.10.2007 under section 385/387/508 of the Penal Code in Putia police station of Rajshahi 
District. The Government further said that Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash is a yellow journalist and 
he was engaged in so many illegal activities by using his journalist&#8217;s profession as a shield. The 
Government further states that no complaint has been lodged either by Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash 
or on his behalf to police or a court. He has submitted a writ petition to the Honorable High 
Court bearing No. 10905 of 2007 to obtain bail. The Honorable High Court released him on bail. 
Moreover, the Government stated that two charge sheets, No-398 dated 30.10.2007 under 
section 385/386 of Penal Code and No. 01 dated 06.01.2008 under section 385/387/506 of Penal 
Code were submitted by the Putia police Station, Rajshahi against Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash. 
With regard to the legal basis for the charges and his re-arrest, the Government referred to the 
following legal bases (1) GD No. 188 dated 05.12.2000 (2) GD No. 1104 dated 24.02.2001 (3) 
GD No. 1239 dated 24.10.2007 (4) Case No. 02 dated 02.10.2007 (MGR case No. 843/2007 and 
session case No. 672/2007) charge sheet No. 398,<b> </b>dated 30.10.2007 ail under Boalia Model 
Police Station, Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, Rajshahi and case No. 13, dated 23.10.2007 under 
section 38513871506 charge sheet No. 01 dated 06.01.2008 under Putia Police Station, Rajshahi. 
The Government also informs that that he was granted bail from the Honorable High Court for 
which he should have surrendered to the lover court, but he failed to do so. For the violation of 
the bail conditions he was warranted for re-arrest by the court of law. It would be apparent from 
the investigation that no physical and mental torture was made against former CSB news reporter 
Mr. Jahangir Alam Akash who is known for his yellow journalism and extortion charges. He was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sent to the court on the basis of specific legal complaint. What has been done was clearly in 
conformity with the law. Thus, the Government concluded that no human rights violations have 
occurred in connection with the arrest of Mr. Akash.

<p>45. On 23 January 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal,<b>1</b> together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
regarding the case of Mr. Aleksandr Sdvizhkov, editor at the weekly newspaper Zhoda, which 
had been shut down by the government. According to the information received, on 
18 January 2008, Mr. Sdvizhkov was found guilty by the Minsk City Court of &#8220;incitement to 
religious hatred&#8221; for reprinting the cartoons of Prophet Mohammed that originally appeared on 
September 2005 in the Danish newspaper Jylland Posten. He was sentenced to three years in a 
high-security prison following a trial conducted in camera. The cartoons were published in the 
Zhoda newspaper in February 2006. A month later, the newspaper was shut down by the 
Government. Fearing prosecution, Mr. Sdvizhkov fled the country. He was arrested by the 
Security Service in November 2007 when he returned to Belarus to attend his father&#8217;s funeral. 
Mr. Sdvizhkov and the Zhoda newspaper were one of the few independent voices in the 
Byelorussian press, in particular during the presidential election of 2006, when the Zhoda 
newspaper decided to also give coverage to the opposition candidate who took part in the 
elections. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Sdvizhkov may be directly linked to 
his reportedly legitimate exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.

<p>46. On 28 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding the case of Vladimir Anatolevich 
Russkin, aged 37, citizen of Belarus, who was currently held at Novopolock correctional colony 
n. 10. According to the information received, he was arrested by ten officers from the Belarusian 
Committee for State Security (KGB) on 5 January 2007 at Varshavsky Most customs 
checkpoint. Following his arrest he was severely beaten, his face was shoved into the dirt; he 
was hand-cuffed behind his back and blind-folded. He was then pushed into a car, with his face 
downwards and officers put their feet dressed in heavy army boots on his back. At the KGB 
detention centre in Minsk he was put in a small room of 2 square metres, which resembled a 
grave, with no natural daylight and no ventilation. A small lamp remained switched on all the 
time. When he attempted to cover his eyes in order to be able to get some sleep, the guards came

<p>to prevent him from doing so. He could not leave the cell to go to the toilet and had to eat the 
low-quality food that he received in the same place where he relieved himself. At one instance 
several buckets with concentrated chlorine were put into the room and, although he was asking 
for help, they were not removed until he lost consciousness. He was repeatedly interrogated, at 
any time of the day, sometimes for long periods. After ten days at the KGB he was transferred to 
Minsk&#8217;s pre-trial detention centre (SIZO), which was overcrowded (40 persons on 12 square 
metres) and where officers beat those who did not immediately follow all orders. The food was 
also of bad quality and access to sanitary facilities was restricted. Then he, together with about 
19 persons, was put in a minibus with maximum capacity for eight persons, and taken to a train 
station. There, while being beaten by officers, they were moved into a railway wagon with dogs 
barking at them. For 12 hours they had to stay there, without being given any water or being 
allowed to use a toilet. Novopolock correctional colony n. 10 was equally overcrowded (1 square 
metre per prisoner). The building where Mr Russkin was staying has the capacity to house up to 
170 persons, but up to 700 were detained there. Hygiene and sanitation were insufficient, 
prisoners were allowed to shower only once per week, there was no hot water available in the 
living quarters. The food was of bad quality. For minor offenses, persons were severely punished 
by being put in overcrowded cells with even worse conditions and with no possibility to appeal 
this decision. People were forced to work for 8 hours, 6 days a week for 3 EUR per month. If 
they refuse, they were subjected to punishment, such as denial of family visits, prolongation of 
the prison terms (up to 10 additional years) and prolonged stays in punishment cells. On 
14 September 2007, Mr Russkin was convicted by the Military Chamber of the Belarus Supreme 
Court to ten years of imprisonment for treason under article 356 of the Belarus Criminal Code 
and espionage under article 358. He did not have access to a lawyer of his choice at any stage of 
the criminal process including during the trial. Instead, the State provided a lawyer. All petitions 
Mr Russkin filed with the courts were reportedly ignored. The trial protocol was falsified. The 
investigation and trial were biased and there was not enough time for the accused to study the 
case files. Mr Russkin was not given the opportunity to call his own witnesses and to question 
witnesses of the prosecution. Finally, he was not given the opportunity to appeal the court&#8217;s 
decision. 
</p>
<p>47. On 22 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defender, regarding the 
case of Mr Pavel Levinov, human rights lawyer and member of the Belarus Helsinki Committee, 
a human rights non-governmental organization (NGO). A letter of allegation was sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression and the then Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 8 April 2008, regarding the 
arrest and subsequent hunger protest of Pavel Levinov. No response from the Government had 
been received. According to new information received, since his arrest on 26 March 2008 after 
providing legal aid for journalist Vadim Borschevskiy, Mr Pavel Levinov made efforts, which 
have included a 15-day hunger strike, to have his case investigated fairly. Nevertheless, on 
26 May 2008, a court ruling was passed, in Mr Pavel Levinov&#8217;s absence, condemning him to ten 
days of detention and a fine of 700,000 rubles. According to Mr Pavel Levinov, accusations 
against him were made by a senior militia officer and supported by subordinate officers acting 
under orders. On 15 July 2008, Mr Pavel Levinov visited the Public Prosecutor of Vitebsk who 
promised to inquire into the matter. However, before any inquiries could be made 
Mr Pavel Levinov was approached outside the office of the Public Prosecutor by militiamen </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>from a special militia troop who presented him with evidence of the court decision for him to be 
arrested for ten days. They brought him to Pershamayski District Militia Station. There, 
Mr Pavel Levinov fell ill and was taken to hospital. After a telephone conversation the 
cardiologist on duty at the hospital refused to admit Mr Pavel Levinov for treatment. On leaving 
the hospital he lost consciousness. He recovered in the hospital&#8217;s resuscitation ward hours later. 
He was transferred directly from there to Pershamayski District Militia Station. Officials at the 
hospital where Mr Pavel Levinov had been refused treatment would not answer questions about 
whether or not he was in a fit condition to be held in detention. Mr Pavel Levinov was being held 
in a temporal isolation centre in Vitebsk. He has been visited by a doctor but did not have access 
to legal aid. On 16 July 2008, Mr Pavel Levinov began another hunger strike. Concern was 
expressed that Mr Pavel Levinov may have been detained as a result of his activities in defense 
of human rights. Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr Pavel Levinov. In light of reports that members of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee and 
other human rights activists in Belarus have been insulted on national Belarusian television over 
the last month, concern was also expressed about the situation of human rights defenders in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>48. On 18 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the case of Ms Yana Paliakova, a human rights defender, lawyer and member of the Human 
Rights Alliance of Belarus. According to the information received, on 9 October 2008 
Ms Yana Paliakova was attacked by an unidentified man as she entered her house in Salihorsk. 
She was hit on the head and back. The attacker also told her that &#8220;if she didn&#8217;t shut up, this 
would be her last warning&#8221;. As a result of the attack, she was diagnosed in hospital with a 
concussion. Following the medical check-up Ms Paliakova went to the Salihorsk police station to 
file a complaint. When she felt ill at the station and tried to go outside, a policeman grabbed her 
by her sweater and pushed her to the floor, causing a bruise on her hip. Ms Paliakova previously 
lodged a complaint against the Salihorsk police station on 1 September 2008, concerning 
physical assault by the police that took place the previous day. Ms Paliakova was stopped by the 
district policeman Mr Pugachev and two other men, and taken to the regional office of Internal 
Affairs where she had been hit on her arms and legs. Although Ms Paliakova lodged repeated 
complaints regarding this incident with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s office and the District 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, no inquiry has yet been launched. Ms Paliakova defended several victims of 
excessive violence of the police, and one of the cases resulted in the dismissal of a policeman. 
Concern was expressed that the attacks on, and harassment of, Ms Paliakova was related to her 
activities as a human rights lawyer, acting on cases of excessive violence of the police. Further 
concern was expressed at the apparent lack of investigation and criminal proceedings in the cases 
of physical assault by members of the police forces.

<p>49. On 24 February 2008, the Government replies to the allegation letter of 28 April 2008, 
stating that on 14 September 2007 the Military Division of the Supreme Court of the Republic of 
Belarus convicted Vladimir Anatolyevich Russkin, born on 26 March 1971, resident of Kobrin in 
Brest province and national of Belarus, of two offences committed as a foreign citizen: 
espionage with the intention of prejudicing the security and defensive capability of Belarus (high </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>treason), and setting up the collection and transfer of other information on behalf of a foreign 
intelligence service for use to the detriment of the interests of Belarus, committed by a foreign 
national (organization of espionage). V.A. Russkin was sentenced to nine years&#8217; imprisonment in 
accordance with article 356, part 1, of the Criminal Code of Belarus, deprivation of the military 
rank of reserve senior lieutenant pursuant to article 60 of the Code and eight years&#8217; imprisonment 
under article 16, part 4, and article 358, part 1, of the Code. In accordance with article 72, part 3, 
of the Code, the final aggregate sentence imposed on V.A. Russkin following partial 
combination of punishments for several offences was 10 years&#8217; imprisonment to be served in a 
penal colony under a strengthened regime and deprivation of the military rank of reserve senior 
lieutenant. V.A. Russkin began serving his term on 14 September 2007. The period spent by 
V.A. Russkin in police custody and detention between 5 January and 14 September 2007 will be 
deducted from the prison term. Mr. V.A. Bogdan, Mr. P.G. Petkevich and Mr. S.G. Kornilyuk 
were sentenced in this same case under article 356, part 1, of the Criminal Code. The sentence 
entered into force as soon as it was handed down, as article 370, part 6, of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure of the Republic of Belarus lays down that regular appeals or appeals in cassation may 
not be lodged against sentences of the Supreme Court. The law does offer an opportunity to 
appeal against sentences of the Supreme Court under the supervisory procedure, but the 
convicted person V.A. Russkin and his defence lawyer E.S. Chizhevskaya did not lodge such an 
appeal. During the preliminary criminal investigation the lawyer I.A. Pankov defended the 
accused V.A. Russkin. The rights of suspects and accused persons under article 41, part 2, 
paragraphs 1 to 18, and article 43, part 2, paragraphs 1-28 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
including the right to a defence, the right to lodge challenges and petitions and the right to lodge 
complaints against the actions and decisions of the authorities leading the criminal proceedings, 
were explained to V.A. Russkin, as his signing of the relevant records attests. He made 
statements acknowledging his guilt from the outset of the initial questioning and throughout the 
preliminary investigation. The accused was questioned during working hours only in the 
presence of a lawyer and for no longer than the standard period established under criminal 
procedure law. V.A. Russkin was in a remand centre of the Belarus State Security Committee 
(KGB) from 6 January to 20 September 2007. Russkin bore no signs of bodily harm when he 
entered the centre. After completing the registration forms, Russkin was placed in a four-person 
cell measuring 10.5 square metres (article 13 of the Detention Procedures and Conditions Act 
sets the minimum prison cell living space at 2.5 square metres per person). KGB detention 
centres have no cells measuring 2 square metres. Russkin&#8217;s cell had individual sleeping quarters, 
bedding and tableware. The cell was equipped with sanitary facilities, to which access was not 
restricted. Russkin was served three meals a day and given the opportunity for walks in the 
prison yard and eight hours of sleep. He was allowed to receive and send an unlimited number of 
letters and telegrams. The prisoner did not receive any short-term visits, since none of his close 
relatives and family members submitted any applications in writing to the remand centre 
administration. No parcels of any kind were sent to Russkin. The doctor on duty found no signs 
of bodily harm to Russkin during examinations when he entered and left the remand centre. 
Throughout the entire investigation Russkin did not file any complaint against the actions of the 
investigators or administration of the centre. Nor did Russkin register any complaint about the 
prison conditions with the procurator during his monthly inspections. As the record shows, the 
accused V.A. Russkin and his lawyer I.A. Pankov familiarized themselves with the facts of the 
case from 27 to 30 July 2007 by personally reading and reviewing the material evidence. 
V.A. Russkin and his lawyer did not register any petition after familiarizing themselves with the 
facts of the case. A qualified lawyer, E.S. Chizhevskaya, was assigned to defend the accused </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>V.A. Russkin in court and familiarized herself with the facts of the case in good time. The 
criminal proceedings against V.A. Russkin and other persons took place in strict accordance with 
the requirements of chapters 34 to 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which set out the 
conditions and procedures for conducting court proceedings. In the preparatory part of the court 
proceedings the accused V.A. Russkin had his rights under article 43 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure explained to him. V.A. Russkin did not object to E.S. Chizhevskaya&#8217;s participation in 
the trial as his defence lawyer and expressed his trust in her. During the court examination 
V.A. Russkin and the other accused were questioned about the charges against them. Moreover, 
witnesses were questioned and documents and material evidence were examined. The court 
examined the circumstances of the case in a comprehensive, full and objective manner. 
Furthermore, the accused V.A. Russkin did not submit any request for the questioning of 
additional witnesses and did not make any statement that improper methods were used against 
him during the pretrial investigation. The record of the trial kept by the court reporter covers the 
entire court proceedings. The participants in the proceedings did not make any remarks on the 
record of the trial. On 26 September 2007 V.A. Russkin was transferred from the remand centre 
to serve his sentence in penal colony No. 10 in Navapolatsk in Vitsebsk province. The prisoner 
arrived in the colony on 27 September 2007. The number of persons held in the section where 
the convict V.A. Russkin is living may not exceed 18. Today, 16 convicts aside from 
V.A. Russkin are living in this section. The convicts take baths once a week. There was no 
interruption in the supply of hot water in penal colony No. 10 between 2007 and 2008. A 
qualified nutritionist ensures that the meals of the prisoners are balanced. The relevant 
authorities have received no complaints or claims from the prisoners about the quality or 
shortage of food. No prisoners were found to be detained beyond the sentences handed down to 
them by the courts during the monitoring of the conditions of detention. The reports of the 
violation of V.A. Russkin&#8217;s right to a defence, the falsification of the record of the court 
proceedings, the biased consideration of the petitions of the accused and the criminal case and 
the use of improper methods of investigation during the pretrial proceedings are groundless. 
</p>
<p>50. On 10 June 2008, the Government replied to the urgent appeal of 23 January 2008, stating 
that criminal proceedings against Mr. A.M. Sdvizhkov were instituted on 22 February 2006 by 
the investigative department of the Committee for State Security following the publication in the 
17 February 2006 issue of the newspaper Zhoda of caricatures offending the sensibilities of 
believers in the religion of Islam. The investigation was conducted by the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Belarus. Mr. Sdvizhkov was indicted on 31 March 2006 and, as a 
preventive measure, he was required to sign an undertaking not to leave the area. However, he 
violated this undertaking and went into hiding, and on 21 April 2006 the preventive measure was 
changed to remand in custody and a search was declared. On 18 November 2007, Mr. Sdvizhkov 
was arrested by militia officers involved in the search. During the investigation it was established 
that, in February 2006, Mr. Sdvizhkov, an official (publishing editor of the newspaper Zhoda), 
personally searched the Internet for caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that defiled the 
symbols of the Islamic faith, and published them in the issue of the newspaper that came out on 
17 February 2006 as material illustrating an article on the subject of the &#8220;caricature scandal&#8221;. For 
the aforementioned acts, on 29 November 2007 Mr. Sdvizhkov was indicted for the offence 
covered under article 130, paragraph 2, of the Belarusian Criminal Code, namely the commission 
by an official, using his or her official powers, of deliberate acts intended to incite religious 
enmity and discord. On 10 December 2007, the case was referred to the court for consideration. 
The circumstances mentioned in the indictment were fully confirmed in the course of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>proceedings and were not denied by the defendant. Having considered the evidence, including 
the testimony of the mufti of the Muslim Religious Association and the mufti of the Clerical 
Department of Muslims in Belarus, and the conclusions of an expert theological study, the court 
came to the well-founded conclusion that the publication in the media of caricatures defiling the 
religious symbols of Islam damaged the foundations of the religious outlook of persons of the 
Muslim faith, and incites religious animosity among representatives of diverse religious 
denominations, creating conditions for the stirring up of religious intolerance and 
discord - which was acknowledged by the defendant. On 18 January 2008, pursuant to 
article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code, the Minsk city court sentenced Mr. Sdvizhkov to 
three years&#8217; deprivation of liberty in a high-security correctional colony. This punishment is the 
minimum punishment for an offence that is classified in Belarusian law as a serious offence. The 
sentence was appealed by the defendant and did not enter into force. On 22 February 2008, the 
cassation division of the Supreme Court of Belarus amended the sentence that the criminal 
division of the Minsk city court issued on 18 January 2008 with respect to Mr. Sdvizhkov. 
Bearing in mind that Mr. Sdvizhkov suffers from a number of chronic illnesses, that he has an 
elderly mother and that his actions did not have serious consequences, the cassation division 
came to the conclusion that the sum total of the aforementioned circumstances substantially 
reduce the degree of social danger of the act, recognized them as exceptional and applied 
article 70 of the Belarusian Criminal Code, in accordance with which it substituted the 
punishment imposed on Mr. Sdvizhkov pursuant to article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal 
Code (deprivation of liberty for three years) with arrest for a period of three months. Since 
Mr. Sdvizhkov has served this sentence, he was released from custody. The conviction relating 
to Mr. Sdvizhkov&#8217;s admission that he was guilty of deliberate acts intended to incite religious 
enmity and discord, committed by an official with the use of official powers, and also relating to 
his conviction under article 130, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code, was upheld. Mr. Sdvizhkov 
was prosecuted and sentenced for committing an offence, in strict accordance with the criminal 
and criminal procedural legislation currently in force in Belarus; such legislation is in no way 
contrary to international norms and standards for the protection of the rights and freedoms of 
citizens, including the right to freedom of opinion and its expression, as contained in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. In its sentence, the court noted that the publication of caricatures has nothing in common 
with freedom of speech but constitutes the dissemination of insults and provokes retaliatory acts 
on the part of the Muslim community, including the need to defend religious symbols. 
</p>
<p>51. On 18 August 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 22 July 2008, stating 
that on the basis of a judgement by a judge of the Pervomaisky district court in Vitebsk, of 
26 May 2008, Mr. P.I. Levinov was sentenced to 10 days&#8217; administrative detention and a fine of 
700,000 roubles for offences under articles 17.1 and 23.4 of the Code of Administrative Offences 
of the Republic of Belarus, namely petty hooliganism and refusing to follow lawful instructions 
from an official. On 27 March 2008 at 3.55 p.m., on the 4th floor landing of 28-3 Chkalov Street 
in Vitebsk, Mr. Levinov committed petty hooligansim: in the presence of militia officers, he 
provoked a conflict, insulted a militia officer on duty and ignored the resulting requests and 
admonitions addressed to him, thereby breaching public order and disturbing the peace. In 
response to militia officers&#8217; lawful demand that he accompany them in their official car, 
Mr. Levinov grabbed hold of the banister on the landing and refused to go to the militia station 
voluntarily, which constituted refusal to follow lawful instructions or demands from an official 
on duty. Having been convicted of administrative offences, Mr. Levinov lodged a complaint with </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the prosecutor&#8217;s office for Vitebsk province regarding the actions and rulings of the judge and 
violations of procedural legislation, which, he claimed, had prevented him from appealing the 
judgement of conviction. Under article 7.2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure and 
Enforcement of the Republic of Belarus, complaints concerning the actions and rulings of a 
judge may be made to the president of the court. Examining such complaints does not fall within 
the purview of the prosecutor&#8217;s office. Furthermore, in accordance with the Act of the Republic 
of Belarus on Stamp Duty, when complaints are submitted to the prosecuting authorities 
regarding judgements by judges in administrative offence cases, the stamp duty must first have 
been paid. Taking into account the above, and the fact that no stamp duty was paid in respect of 
Mr. Levinov&#8217;s complaint regarding violations of procedural legislation, which was essentially a 
complaint about the court&#8217;s verdict that he had committed administrative offences, there were no 
grounds for the prosecutor&#8217;s office for Vitebsk province to examine the complaint&#8217;s substance. 
As a result, the prosecutor&#8217;s office for the province legitimately refused to examine the substance 
of Mr. Levinov&#8217;s complaint, clarifying to the complainant the legally established procedure for 
submitting to the prosecuting authorities complaints in respect of judgements by judges in 
administrative offence cases. Concerning the search conducted at the apartment of 
Mr. L.V. Svetik, the Special Rapporteurs wished to state the following: at present, the Vitebsk 
provincial department of the Committee for State Security of the Republic of Belarus is 
investigating a criminal case under article 130, section 1, of the Criminal Code of the Republic 
of Belarus (Incitement of racial, ethnic or religious enmity or discord), brought in connection 
with the distribution around Vitebsk by persons unknown of leaflets containing calls to incite 
enmity between ethnic groups and intended to tarnish the ethnic honour and dignity of persons of 
Jewish descent. In the course of this investigation, on 23 May 2008, on the basis of a decision 
approved by the deputy prosecutor for the province, as the competent authority, that a search 
should be carried out, a search was undertaken in the presence of witnesses at Mr. Svetik&#8217;s 
residence, as a result of which a laptop computer, printer, scanner and some compact discs were 
confiscated for further investigation. The search of Mr. Svetik&#8217;s residence and the confiscation of 
office equipment took place not on account of his human rights activities but because certain 
materials in the criminal case gave grounds for suspecting him of committing an offence under 
article 130, section 1, of the Criminal Code. Mr. Svetik was declared a suspect, and, in 
accordance with the requirements of criminal procedure legislation, he was questioned as a 
suspect in the presence of a lawyer. The preliminary investigation in this case is continuing. With 
regard to the investigation carried out in relation to Mr. V.P. Borshchevsky, the 
Special Rapporteurs wished to state the following: the prosecutor&#8217;s office for the city of Minsk is 
examining a criminal case brought against a group of individuals for committing offences under 
article 367, section 1, of the Criminal Code (Defamation against the President of the Republic of 
Belarus). During the investigation into this case, the need arose to conduct a search of 
Mr. Borshchevsky&#8217;s apartment in Vitebsk. Accordingly, on 27 March 2008 a search was carried 
out at Mr. Borshchevsky&#8217;s residence, on the basis of a decision approved by the deputy 
prosecutor for the city of Minsk that a search should be undertaken by officials of the Vitebsk 
provincial department of the Committee for State Security in compliance with the requirements 
of criminal procedure legislation. During the search, office equipment - a computer, printer, 
scanner, cassettes, discs and printing materials - was seized. Following examination by the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office for Vitebsk province of the complaint submitted on 31 March 2008 by 
Mr. V.P. Borshchevsky and Ms. E.N. Borshchevskaya regarding possible violations of criminal 
procedure legislation by officials of the Vitebsk provincial department of the Committee for 
State Security during the search, the complainants&#8217; allegations were not upheld. The items seized </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>during the search were examined in the established manner, after which the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
for the city of Minsk ruled that they should be returned to their owners. In the course of the 
investigation into this case, Mr. Borshchevsky was not detained. The preliminary investigation in 
this case has been suspended.

<p>54. On 31 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte, founder of the National Movement for Human Rights, 
former General Coordinator of the State Program for Education in Human Rights, long-term 
employee of the Commission of Pontifical Justice and Peace in the arch-diocese of Natal, and 
member of the National Committee of Human Rights, the Centre of Human Rights and Popular 
Memory, and the State Council of Human Rights. He was also central to the creation of DHNet, 
a website which provides information on the issue of human rights. According to information 
received, in late October 2005, an accusation was made to the Military Court by the Military 
Public Prosecutor against Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte. The accusation came after 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte gave a lecture entitled &#8220;Human Rights - Thing of the Police&#8221; at an 
event organized by the Association of Soldiers of the Brazilian Army. In his lecture 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte promoted respect for the rule of law within the armed forces, 
defended the creation of human rights commissions for the armed forces, and objected to the ban 
on unionization for soldiers. He also raised registered cases of internal human rights abuses in 
the army whereby members of the military were allegedly deprived of sleep, forced to drink 
chicken&#8217;s blood, and made remain on their knees in ant colonies. On 24 January 2008, the 
Military Public Prosecutor, who had objected to what he considered inappropriate comparisons 
between current and former army officials by Mr Roberto de Oliveira in the lecture, filed a 
complaint against Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte for incitement to disobedience and offense to 
the Armed Forces under Articles 155 and 219 of the Military Penal Code. These charges carry 
possible prison sentences of four years and one year respectively. On 23 July 2008, 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte was scheduled for interrogation at the Special Council of the 
Army&#8217;s Court. This interrogation did not take place, reportedly because there were not enough 
colonels available to represent the Council. No new date for the interrogation has been given. 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte was the only civilian out of a total of 14 defendants in the process 
Number 20/08-0, in the 7th Division of the Military Court, established in relation with the 
declarations realized during the Congress of Military Law. In addition to Mr Roberto de Oliveira 
Monte, the colonel of the Military Police of Alagoas Joilson Gouveia was charged as well as the </p>

<p>56. On 24 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention, regarding the case of Said Kadzoev, aged 29, Russian national of 
Chechen origin. According to the information received, Said Kadzoev arrived in Bulgaria in 
October 2006 to ask for asylum. However, he was stopped at the Bulgarian border because he 
only had Chechen identity papers and no internationally-recognized Russian documentation. The 
Bulgarian border guards detained Said Kadzoev and issued an order of deportation. Since 
1 November 2006 he has been held in the Special Centre for the Temporary Accommodation of 
Foreigners (SCTAF) in the village of Busmantsi, near Sofia. He was in solitary confinement 
from 28 May 2007 until 2 April 2008 and repeatedly subjected to beatings by the staff of 
SCTAF. During this period, Said Kadzoev developed gallstones, a painful medical condition. 
The doctor who saw him indicated that he needed an operation to remove the gallstones. 
However, he was only given painkillers. Mr Kadzoev&#8217;s asylum application was registered on 
31 May 2007 by the Bulgarian State Agency of Refugees and was rejected on 4 June 2007. The 
Sofia Court rejected his appeal in October 2007. A complaint was filed with the European Court 
of Human Rights in December 2007. The deportation order against him was confirmed by the 
Yambol Regional Court on 15 March 2007 and on 17 April 2008, the Supreme Administrative 
Court upheld this decision. His lawyers did not have access to the documents filed on him by the 
Bulgarian authorities. Said Kadzoev alleged that he was previously detained and tortured by 
Russian police. According to his testimony, in October 2002, he was detained for five months by 
the Federal Security Bureau in Moscow, where he was tortured in order to force him to &#8220;confess&#8221; 
participating in a terrorist attack on a Russian military air base, which he denied. During those 
months, Said Kadzoev was held incommunicado and officially reported as having &#8220;disappeared&#8221;. 
Furthermore, after a conflict with the Chechen local authorities, his house was burned down in 
August 2006. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Said Kadzoev, 
should he been forcibly returned to the Russian Federation. </p>

<p>communaut&#233; Mbororo, Lamido Ahmadu Sabga, serait d&#233;c&#233;d&#233; le 13 juin 2007. En accord avec la 
loi coutumi&#232;re de la communaut&#233;, le Conseil traditionnel Mbororo aurait &#233;lu, le 15 juin 2007, &#224; 
la majorit&#233; des votes, M. Adamu Kawuyel Buba en tant que nouveau chef traditionnel. Il &#233;tait 
all&#233;gu&#233; que la nomination de M. Adamu K. Buba aurait &#233;t&#233; explicitement object&#233;e par 
M. Baba Danpullo, qui, depuis la mort de l&#8217;ancien Lamido, aurait essay&#233; d&#8217;influencer le 
processus et nomm&#233; l&#8217;un de ses collaborateurs pour le remplacer. Dans ce contexte, lors des 
condol&#233;ances de l&#8217;ancien Lamido Ahmadu Sabga, M. Adamu K. Buba aurait, selon les 
informations rapport&#233;es, menac&#233; un des membres du Conseil traditionnel avec les mots suivants: 
&#171;Je vous conseille de choisir un bon chef et si vous choisissez une personne qui ne me convient 
pas, je ne l&#8217;accepterai pas &#187;. En accord avec leur pratique, apr&#232;s l&#8217;&#233;lection du nouveau Lamido, 
les autorit&#233;s des Mbororos auraient envoy&#233; une lettre au Chef Provincial de Mezam, l&#8217;informant 
de l&#8217;intronisation. Cependant, le 19 juin 2007, ce dernier aurait publi&#233; une D&#233;cision Pr&#233;fectorale 
(n&#176; 129 PD/E29/PS) d&#233;clarant la nullit&#233; de l&#8217;intronisation de M. Adamu K. Buba, interdisant 
toutes les r&#233;unions et les assembl&#233;es de la communaut&#233; Mbororo et fermant le palais traditionnel 
du Lamido. Un Recours Gracieux (R&#233;f. MLF/RG/001/07) aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; le 28 juin 2007 par 
les dirigeants de la communaut&#233; contre cette d&#233;cision pr&#233;fectorale. Sans tenir compte de cette 
plainte en cours, et, n&#233;gligeant les pratiques traditionnelles des Mbororos, le Chef Provincial de 
Mezam aurait, selon les informations re&#231;ues, annonc&#233; la vacance du poste du Lamido 
traditionnel. Le 12 juillet 2007, tous les membres du Conseil traditionnel Mbororo auraient &#233;t&#233; 
convoqu&#233;s &#224; la Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la Recherche Ext&#233;rieure du Poste de Liaison du 
Nord-Ouest-Bamenda. Pour n&#8217;avoir re&#231;u aucune information officielle sur les motifs de cette 
convocation, et par crainte de repr&#233;sailles pour l&#8217;intronisation du nouveau Lamido, les membres 
du Conseil traditionnel auraient choisi de ne pas se rendre &#224; la gendarmerie. Le 13 juillet 2007, 
aux alentours des 5h00 du matin, approximativement 500 personnes de la communaut&#233; Mbororo, 
y compris le Lamido r&#233;cemment &#233;lu, Adamu K. Buba, ainsi que les membres du Conseil 
traditionnel, auraient manifest&#233; contre la d&#233;cision pr&#233;fectorale annulant l&#8217;intronisation du 
nouveau Lamido. Au cours de cette manifestation, les protestataires auraient paisiblement bloqu&#233; 
la route principale qui traverse la communaut&#233; de Sagba. Tous les membres du Conseil 
traditionnel, y compris le Lamido Adamu K. Buba, auraient &#224; nouveau &#233;t&#233; convoqu&#233;s &#224; la 
Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la Recherche Ext&#233;rieure du Poste de Liaison du Nord-Ouest-Bamenda, 
interrog&#233;s, puis lib&#233;r&#233;s. Selon les all&#233;gations, le 8 ao&#251;t 2007, le Lamido Adamu K. Buba aurait &#224; 
nouveau &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233; avant d&#8217;&#234;tre lib&#233;r&#233;. Selon les all&#233;gations, le Chef Provincial de Mezam 
aurait inform&#233; la population de Sagba qu&#8217;au cours de la journ&#233;e du 20 ao&#251;t 2007, apr&#232;s d&#233;p&#244;t de 
nouvelles candidatures, une nouvelle intronisation serait discut&#233;e. Cependant, aux alentours des 
6h00 du matin, le 20 ao&#251;t, une troupe de plus de 100 soldats aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;ploy&#233;e dans le village 
de Sabga, le Chef Provincial de Mezam aurait intronis&#233; Mamuda Sagba, suppos&#233;ment par d&#233;faut 
d&#8217;autres candidatures. Vers 16h00, M. Baba Danpollo et le Lamido de Banyo du d&#233;partement 
d&#8217;Adamawa seraient entr&#233;s dans Sagba. L&#8217;arriv&#233;e de M. Baba Danpollo aurait accentu&#233; la 
r&#233;volte des membres de la Communaut&#233; Mbororo. Une utilisation abusive de la force aurait alors 
&#233;t&#233; employ&#233;e par les soldats, avec utilisation de gaz lacrymog&#232;ne et coups de fusil. Les 
personnes suivantes et un b&#233;b&#233; de quelques mois auraient alors &#233;t&#233; bless&#233;es: 
Mme Maimouna Dawuh, ag&#233;e de 29 ans; Mme Fatimatou Manjo, ag&#233;e de 22 ans; 
M. Abdou Moussa, 31 ans; M. Yakubu Alim, 22 ans, M. Kabiru Oumarou, 21 ans. Par ailleurs, 
des chevaux auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;s. Un total de 21 personnes, comprenant des membres du Conseil 
traditionnel ainsi que de l&#8217;organisation MBOSCUDA auraient &#233;t&#233; inscrites sur une liste </p>

<p>d&#8217;individus &#224; arr&#234;ter. Plus de vingt Mbororos auraient quitt&#233; le village ce m&#234;me soir pour 
Yaound&#233;. D&#8217;autres les auraient rejoints ult&#233;rieurement, et 34 personnes se seraient rassembl&#233;es 
devant l&#8217;ambassade des Etats-Unis.

conjointement avec la Repr&#233;sentante sp&#233;ciale du Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral concernant la situation des 
d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, un appel urgent concernant la situation de 
M. Abdoulaye Math, pr&#233;sident du Mouvement pour la D&#233;fense des Droits de l&#8217;Homme et des 
Libert&#233;s (MDDHL) et chef de file de l&#8217;Observatoire r&#233;gional des droits de l&#8217;Homme du Grand 
nord Selon les informations re&#231;ues, dans l&#8217;apr&#232;s-midi du 28 mars 2008, M. Kou&#233; Kaokamla, 
Procureur de la R&#233;publique aupr&#232;s des Tribunaux de premi&#232;re et grande instance de Maroua, 
aurait appel&#233; M. Abdoulaye Math et aurait d&#233;clar&#233; : &#8220;je suis au courant de ce qui s&#8217;est pass&#233;. Toi 
et moi jusqu&#8217;&#224; la mort, tu es mon ennemi jur&#233;!&#8221;, sans pr&#233;ciser ce qu&#8217;il reprochait exactement &#224; 
M. Math. Le 29 mars 2008, M. Abdoulaye Math aurait d&#233;nonc&#233; ces agissements dans une lettre 
adress&#233;e au Procureur de la R&#233;publique. Il aurait &#233;galement saisi le Pr&#233;sident de la Cour d&#8217;appel 
de Maroua, qui se serait engag&#233; &#224; intervenir aupr&#232;s du Procureur de la R&#233;publique afin 
d&#8217;&#233;claircir la situation. Le 3 avril 2008, M. Math se serait vu refuser l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; la prison de 
Maroua alors qu&#8217;il devait rencontrer des clients pour lesquels il avait &#233;t&#233; commis d&#8217;office par la 
Cour d&#8217;appel. Les gardiens de la prison auraient justifi&#233; ce refus sur la base d&#8217;une lettre du 
Procureur de la R&#233;publique aupr&#232;s des Tribunaux de premi&#232;re et grande instance de Maroua qui 
lui interdirait tout contact avec les d&#233;tenus. Le 8 avril 2008, M. Math aurait rencontr&#233; le 
Pr&#233;sident de la Cour d&#8217;appel afin de lui demander de lui permettre de reprendre ses visites dans 
les prisons. Une r&#233;ponse du Pr&#233;sident &#233;tait attendue &#224; ce moment. Des craintes furent exprim&#233;es 
quant au fait que les actes d&#8217;intimidation contre M. Math et les entraves &#224; son travail furent li&#233;s &#224; 
ses activit&#233;s non-violentes de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme.

<p>61. Le 20 octobre 2008, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement du Cameroun, 
conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur du Groupe de Travail sur la 
d&#233;tention arbitraire et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la situation des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de 
l&#8217;homme, un appel urgent concernant la situation de M. Ngalle Moussombo, conseiller municipal 
&#224; la Mairie de Njomb&#233;-Penja et de Ma&#238;tre Jean Ren&#233; Manfo Songong, avocat au Barreau du 
Cameroun et responsable de la cellule juridique de l&#8217;organisation non gouvernementale l&#8217;Action 
des Chr&#233;tiens pour l&#8217;Abolition de la Torture (ACAT) Littoral. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 
8 octobre 2008, M. Ngalle Moussombo aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenu sans mandat judiciaire, lors de la 
c&#233;r&#233;monie de passation de commandement entre les sous-pr&#233;fets entrant et sortant de la localit&#233; 
de Penja. Post&#233;rieurement il aurait &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233; dans les locaux du groupement de gendarmerie 
de Nkongsamba. M. Ngalle Moussombo n&#8217;aurait pas eu acc&#232;s &#224; son avocat, Me Jean Ren&#233; 
Manfo Songong. Il n&#8217;aurait pas non plus eu la possibilit&#233; qu&#8217;un juge se prononce sur la l&#233;galit&#233; 
de sa d&#233;tention. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, le Commandant de police M. Amougou aurait 
re&#231;u l&#8217;ordre d&#8217;arr&#234;ter Me Manfo Songong du fait de son opposition &#224; l&#8217;arrestation arbitraire de 
son client. En outre, Me Jean Ren&#233; Manfo Songong aurait fait l&#8217;objet de menaces t&#233;l&#233;phoniques 
anonymes en relation avec sa participation en tant que conseiller juridique dans les proc&#232;s de 
Paul Eric Kingue, ancien Maire de Njomb&#233;-Penja contre le Minist&#232;re Public, concernant les 
&#233;meutes de fin f&#233;vrier 2008. D&#8217;apr&#232;s les informations re&#231;ues, durant ces &#233;meutes de nombreuses 
personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenues et accus&#233;es sans preuves &#224; l&#8217;appui d&#8217;incitation &#224; la r&#233;volte et 
vandalisme. Certains responsables politiques souhaitant acc&#233;der &#224; certains postes auraient saisi </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;occasion pour d&#233;noncer leur sup&#233;rieur. Ce serait le cas du Maire de la localit&#233; de Penja. Depuis 
son arrestation, les membres du conseil municipal se d&#233;chireraient entre collaborateurs et 
opposants au Maire.

<p>62. Le 18 d&#233;cembre 2007, le Gouvernement camerounais a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent 
du 29 ao&#251;t 2007, au sujet de la destitution du Chef traditionnel des Mbororos. Le Gouvernement 
a indiqu&#233; que la r&#233;ponse sera communiqu&#233;e dans les meilleurs d&#233;lais. La Mission Permanente du 
Cameroun porta &#233;galement &#224; la connaissance des Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux que le Premier Ministre, 
Chef du Gouvernement vient de mettre sur pied en date du 31 avril 2007, une commission 
minist&#233;rielle ad hoc charg&#233;e de recueillir sur le terrain toute information relative &#224; la crise de 
succession &#224; la t&#234;te de la chefferie de Sagba. Cette commission a men&#233; du 23 
au 25 septembre 2007 une enqu&#234;te administrative dans le D&#233;partement concern&#233;. Ses 
conclusions seront communiqu&#233;es aux trois mandataires dans la r&#233;ponse qui leur sera transmise. 
</p>
<p>63. Le 13 ao&#251;t 2008, le Gouvernement camerounais a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent 
du 29 ao&#251;t 2007, indiquant que le processus de d&#233;signation des chefs traditionnels du Cameroun 
est r&#233;gi par le D&#233;cret N&#176; 77/245 du 15 juillet 1977. Aux termes de celui-ci, en cas de vacance 
d&#8217;une chefferie, l&#8217;autorit&#233; administrative (Pr&#233;fet ou sous-pr&#233;fet) proc&#232;de, au cours d&#8217;une r&#233;union 
et sans d&#233;lais, aux consultations en vue de la d&#233;signation d&#8217;un nouveau chef. Les notabilit&#233;s 
coutumi&#232;res sont obligatoirement consult&#233;es. Le d&#233;roulement des consultations est consign&#233; dans 
un proc&#232;s verbal sign&#233; du pr&#233;sident de la r&#233;union. Le dossier du candidat issu des consultations 
est transmis par voie hi&#233;rarchique pour leur nomination par le Premier Ministre (chefs de 
premier degr&#233;), le Ministre de l&#8217;Administration Territoriale (chefs de 2e degr&#233;) ou le pr&#233;fet (chef 
de 3e degr&#233;). &#171;Les chefs traditionnels sont, en principe, choisis au sein des familles appel&#233;es &#224; 
exercer coutumi&#232;rement le commandement traditionnel. Les candidats doivent remplir les 
conditions d&#8217;aptitudes physiques et morales requises, et savoir autant que possible, lire et &#233;crire&#187; 
(Chapitre II, Article 8). Dans la pratique, l&#8217;autorit&#233; administrative tient compte du mode de 
succession traditionnelle en vigueur dans la chefferie. La d&#233;volution du pouvoir traditionnel est 
mystico-religieuse. Le chef est avant tout celui qui pr&#233;side aux cultes. D&#8217;o&#249; sa position &#224; vie au 
tr&#244;ne. La d&#233;signation du chef n&#8217;est pas donc d&#233;mocratique mais ob&#233;it &#224; un syst&#232;me de valeurs 
qui tient compte des lignages sp&#233;cifiques. Conform&#233;ment &#224; la tradition et au testament du 
4e Ardo (le chef traditionnel chez les Mbororos du Nord-Ouest), Mamuda Sagba, dernier des 
5 enfants du fondateur de la dynastie Sagba, devrait &#224; la mort de son fr&#232;re, prendre la t&#234;te de 
l&#8217;Ardorat. C&#8217;est apr&#232;s son d&#233;c&#232;s que la g&#233;n&#233;ration suivante, dont son neveu Adamu K. Buba est 
l&#8217;ain&#233;, pourrait, toujours selon l&#8217;ordre de naissance, pr&#233;tendre &#224; tour de r&#244;le au tr&#244;ne. Le 
13 juin 2007, Ahmadou Sagba, cinqui&#232;me chef de l&#8217;Ardorat de Sagba d&#233;c&#232;de. Il est inhum&#233; le 
lendemain en pr&#233;sence du Pr&#233;fet de la Mezam. Le 15 juin 2007, deux jours plus tard, un groupe 
de 14 personnes, non reconnu par l&#8217;administration camerounaise, et s&#8217;auto-proclamant 
&#171;King-makers &#187;, d&#233;pose aupr&#232;s du Pr&#233;fet de la Mezam un dossier d&#233;signant Adamu Kawuyel 
Buba, neveu du chef d&#233;funt, comme nouveau chef de l&#8217;Ardorat de Sagba. Le non respect de la 
proc&#233;dure r&#233;glementaire et de la tradition de succession, l&#8217;opposition d&#8217;une partie de la 
population Mbororo, la condamnation pour vol de b&#233;tail pesant sur Adamu K. Buba et un certain 
nombre des &#171;king-makers&#187; ont conduit le pr&#233;fet de la Mezam &#224; d&#233;clarer la nullit&#233; de cette 
d&#233;signation et ouvrir la vacance de la chefferie. Un d&#233;lai de 8 jours a &#233;t&#233; accord&#233; aux &#233;ventuels 
pr&#233;tendants pour d&#233;poser leur dossier de candidature. Le 20 ao&#251;t 2007, conform&#233;ment aux 
dispositions r&#233;glementaires, l&#8217;autorit&#233; administrative a pr&#233;sid&#233; les consultations des notabilit&#233;s </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>coutumi&#232;res en vue de la d&#233;signation du nouveau chef. Le seul dossier re&#231;u &#233;tait celui de 
Mamuda Sagba. A l&#8217;issue des consultations, celui-ci a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;sign&#233; chef de l&#8217;Ardorat de Sagba. La 
tradition de succession de fr&#232;re en fr&#232;re en vigueur, le testament dat&#233; de 1998 du Lamido Adamu 
Sagba qui prime sur celui pr&#233;sent&#233; par Adamu K. Buba et datant de 1989, les t&#233;moignages de 
nombreuses notabilit&#233;s du village et surtout du Fon de Kedjom Ketinguh confirmant &#224; la fois la 
validit&#233; du testament et le mode de succession chez les Sagba, la tradition locale selon laquelle 
un oncle ne peut faire all&#233;geance &#224; son neveu expliquent entre autres cette d&#233;signation. M. Buba, 
le chef d&#233;chu, explique sa tentative de prise de pouvoir par les griefs qu&#8217;il avait contre son oncle, 
Mamuda Sagba. Il lui reproche notamment sa proximit&#233; avec M. Danpoullo, personnage riche et 
influent de la r&#233;gion et propri&#233;taire de l&#8217;Elba Ranch ; son &#233;loignement momentan&#233; de son 
village; les origines d&#8217;esclave de sa m&#232;re. Il a affirm&#233; &#224; la Commission d&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
interminist&#233;rielle ordonn&#233;e par le Premier Ministre pour faire la lumi&#232;re sur cette crise, que ses 
partisans et lui ont r&#233;cus&#233; Mamuda Sagba &#171; parce qu&#8217;il n&#8217;est pas aim&#233;, il est pauvre, sans 
domicile &#224; Sagba et manipulable. &#187; A l&#8217;annonce de la d&#233;signation de son oncle comme chef, 
Adamu K. Buba a, avec ses partisans, exprimer leur opposition, notamment par la pose de 
barricades sur la voie publique, des incitations &#224; la r&#233;volte, des manifestations ill&#233;gales sur la 
voie publique, perturbant ainsi l&#8217;ordre publique et portant atteinte aux droits et libert&#233;s des 
populations concern&#233;es. Ces infractions sont r&#233;prim&#233;es par les articles 219, 230(1), 231 et 157(1) 
du Code p&#233;nal camerounais. En application des dispositions des lois du 19 d&#233;cembre 1990 
portant r&#233;gimes des r&#233;unions et des manifestations publiques et relatives au maintien de l&#8217;ordre 
public, le Pr&#233;fet a d&#233;cid&#233; de l&#8217;intervention des forces de maintien de l&#8217;ordre pour r&#233;tablir le 
calme dans cette r&#233;gion. Il n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; fait usage d&#8217;armes &#224; feu ni de violence. Aucune atteinte &#224; 
l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique des populations de ce village n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;plor&#233;e du fait des Forces de l&#8217;ordre. 
Convoqu&#233;s au Bureau de liaison de la Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale de la Recherche Ext&#233;rieures (DGRE), 
pour r&#233;pondre des infractions sus cit&#233;s, les manifestants ont, &#224; leur pr&#233;sentation dans ces 
Services, pr&#233;f&#233;r&#233; l&#8217;organisation d&#8217;un sit-in d&#8217;une dizaine de jours &#224; l&#8217;Ambassade des Etats-Unis &#224; 
Yaound&#233;, d&#8217;o&#249; ils escomptaient une meilleure audience internationale. La crise de succession &#224; 
la t&#234;te du Lamida de Sagba n&#8217;est en r&#233;alit&#233; qu&#8217;une tentative de coup de force organis&#233;e par 
Adamu Kawuyel Buba et ses partisans en vue d&#8217;acc&#233;der ill&#233;galement &#224; la t&#234;te de la chefferie 
traditionnelle. Elle a &#233;t&#233; instrumentalis&#233;e par des hommes politiques et des Associations telles le 
MBOSCUDA, le SADM (Sagba Development Meeting) et UNOWHURO (Union of Meeting of 
North West Human Rights Organisations) dans le but d&#8217;une part de se constituer un fief politique 
parmi les Mbororos, et d&#8217;autre part de b&#233;n&#233;ficier de subventions internationales. Le d&#233;cret sus 
&#233;voqu&#233; portant organisation de la chefferie traditionnelle pr&#233;voit un certains nombre 
d&#8217;avantages, notamment mon&#233;taire, attach&#233;s &#224; la fonction de chef traditionnel. Il convient de 
rappeler les Mbororos au Cameroun se retrouvent principalement dans les Provinces du Nord, du 
Nord-Ouest, de l&#8217;Adamoua et de l&#8217;Est. La destitution de Adamu K. Buba ne concerne que les 
Mbororos de l&#8217;Ardorat de Sagba, l&#8217;une des plus petites chefferies de l&#8217;arrondissement. De plus, 
les autres chefs des communaut&#233;s Mbororos, se sont d&#233;solidaris&#233;s de la tentative de prise de 
pouvoir par la force et ont r&#233;affirm&#233; leur soutien &#224; l&#8217;administration camerounaise lors d&#8217;une 
audience que leur a accord&#233; en novembre 2007 le Ministre d&#8217;Etat, Ministre de l&#8217;Administration 
Territoriale et de la D&#233;centralisation. Aussi, assimiler la crise de succession &#224; la t&#234;te de l&#8217;Ardorat 
de Sagba &#224; la destitution du Chef traditionnel de tous les Mbororos, est au sens du Gouvernement 
du Cameroun, une g&#233;n&#233;ralisation abusive, qui ne rend pas la r&#233;alit&#233; exacte de la situation des 
Mbororos au Cameroun et des efforts fournis par le Gouvernement en vue de la protection de 
leurs droits. </p>

<p>64. Par une demande dat&#233;e du 10 octobre 1985, El Hadj Baba Ahmadou Danpoullo, a sollicit&#233; 
l&#8217;obtention d&#8217;un titre foncier sur une parcelle du domaine national &#224; Ndawara, Arrondissement 
de Fundong, Province du Nord-Ouest du Cameroun, en vue de cr&#233;er un ranch. A la suite de 
l&#8217;Arr&#234;t&#233; pr&#233;fectorial N&#176; S1/86 du 7 mars 1986, la Commission Consultative de Fundong a 
effectu&#233; une visite sur le terrain le 20 mars 1986 aux fins de bornage de ladite parcelle. Cette 
op&#233;ration s&#8217;est heurt&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;opposition de 44 personnes dont celle de MM. Ardo Hassan Yakubo 
et Acaji Saidou, qui avaient d&#233;pos&#233; aupr&#232;s de la Commission une requ&#234;te &#233;crite. A la suite d&#8217;un 
accord, M. Danpoullo s&#8217;est engag&#233; &#224; indemniser toutes celles des personnes qui avaient des 
mises en valeurs sur l&#8217;espace que devait occuper son ranch. Une r&#233;union s&#8217;est ensuite tenue entre 
les autorit&#233;s administratives, municipales, traditionnelles et les populations de la localit&#233;. 
Celles-ci ont autoris&#233; et encourag&#233; la cr&#233;ation de l&#8217;Elba Ranch sur une superficie de 7400 ha 53a. 
La Commission a donc d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;attribuer par voie d&#8217;immatriculation directe une superficie de 
4726 ha (titre foncier n&#176; 140 du 1er d&#233;cembre 1989) et une concession provisoire de 1335 ha 
(d&#233;cret pr&#233;sidentiel n&#176; 89/351 du 2 mars 1989) ; M. Danpoullo, Mbororo lui-m&#234;me, ayant h&#233;rit&#233; 
de son p&#232;re une partie de cette parcelle. La superficie de ce ranch n&#8217;a pas connu d&#8217;extension 
au-del&#224; des limites l&#233;gales sus-&#233;voqu&#233;es. A ce jour, aucune r&#233;clamation d&#8217;indemnisation ou 
revendication domaniale sur les terres de l&#8217;Elba Ranch n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; enregistre aupr&#232;s des autorit&#233;s 
camerounaises. Par ailleurs, une &#233;tude du mode de vie des Mbororos r&#233;v&#232;le que ceux-ci sont des 
populations nomades qui malgr&#233; les efforts du Gouvernement de les s&#233;dentariser dans les 
chefferies se d&#233;placent sur le territoire camerounais et des pays voisins &#224; la recherche de 
p&#226;turages. Sociologiquement, ils ne poss&#232;dent pas de sentiment de propri&#233;t&#233; fonci&#232;re sur les 
p&#226;turages ou autres terres qu&#8217;ils ont momentan&#233;ment occup&#233;s et n&#8217;en d&#233;tiennent pas la propri&#233;t&#233; 
juridique et l&#233;gale en dehors des chefferies sur lesquelles l&#8217;Etat les a install&#233;s. Aussi, le 
Gouvernement du Cameroun r&#233;cuse-t-il toute all&#233;gation de d&#233;possession de Mbororos de leurs 
terres traditionnelles de p&#226;turages et de violation de leurs droits au logement, &#224; l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; l&#8217;eau et 
&#224; la nourriture. En ce qui concerne les exactions qu&#8217;aurait commises M. Danpoullo et le 
personnel de son ranch, &#224; l&#8217;encontre des Mbororos, il importe de souligner que les populations 
Mbororos riveraines dudit ranch, se sont &#224; plusieurs reprises rendues coupables de vol de b&#233;tail. 
Arr&#234;t&#233;s en flagrant d&#233;lit par le personnel du ranch, des plaintes ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;guli&#232;rement port&#233;es 
contre les coupables, qui g&#233;n&#233;ralement font l&#8217;objet de jugement devant les tribunaux de la 
R&#233;publique, dans le strict respect des lois et proc&#233;dure de l&#8217;Etat du Cameroun. A cet &#233;gard, il 
ressort d&#8217;un jugement que 6 personnes, dont Adamu K. Buba ont &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;es, le 
4 juillet 2006 par le Tribunal de Grande instance de Bamenda (province du Nord-Ouest) &#224; 5 ans 
d&#8217;emprisonnement et &#224; payer au plaignant la somme de 10 420 000 FCFA (environ 5 210 USD) 
pour le vol de 22 b&#339;ufs. Ce jugement, ainsi que les nombreuses plaintes d&#233;pos&#233;es par 
M. Danpoullo sont une preuve de la non-existence d&#8217;un tribunal et d&#8217;une prison priv&#233;s dans 
l&#8217; &#171;Elba Ranch&#187;. Les tribunaux traditionnels (tribunaux coutumiers) sont reconnu par la loi, en 
vertu de la loi N&#176; 2006/015 du 29 d&#233;cembre 2006 portant organisation judiciaire. L&#8217;Alkali Court 
de Ndawara, localit&#233; voisine du village de Sagba, n&#8217;est pas situ&#233; au sein de l&#8217;Elba Ranch. Elle 
n&#8217;a pas &#233;t&#233; &#233;tablie par M. Danpoullo. Seule la loi peut cr&#233;er une Alkali Court ou tout autre 
tribunal traditionnel. Le jugement sus &#233;voqu&#233; montre que l&#8217;Affaire du vol de b&#233;tail &#224; l&#8217;Elba 
Ranch a d&#8217;abord &#233;t&#233; examin&#233;e par l&#8217;Alkali Court de Ndawara avant d&#8217;&#234;tre prot&#233;e devant le 
tribunal de Grande instance de Bamenda. Il convient &#233;galement de rappeler qu&#8217;au Cameroun, les 
prisons sont des lieux de d&#233;tention publics sous l&#8217;autorit&#233; de l&#8217;administration p&#233;nitentiaire, 
rattach&#233;e au Minist&#232;re de la Justice. Il n&#8217;existe donc aucune prison priv&#233;e au Cameroun. Les 
chefs traditionnels, sous l&#8217;autorit&#233; desquels sont plac&#233;s les tribunaux traditionnels cr&#233;&#233;s par la loi 
ne sont pas habilit&#233;s &#224; punir &#171;leurs sujets&#187;. L&#8217;article 29 du d&#233;cret de 1977 r&#233;gissant les chefferies </p>

<p>traditionnelles au Cameroun interdit implicitement entre autres &#171;les exactions des chefs &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard 
des populations&#187;, qui constituent d&#8217;ailleurs une cause de r&#233;vocation. Le Gouvernement du 
Cameroun, inform&#233; des exactions commises par les Chefs traditionnels prend r&#233;guli&#232;rement et 
imm&#233;diatement des mesures pour y mettre fin et punir les coupables. C&#8217;est ainsi que des 
poursuites judiciaires et des sanctions p&#233;nales sont tr&#232;s souvent prises &#224; l&#8217;encontre des Chefs 
incrimin&#233;s. En ce qui concerne la collusion entre les autorit&#233;s camerounaises et les chefs 
traditionnels en vue de l&#8217;incarc&#233;ration dans des prisons d&#8217;Etat de personnes &#171;condamn&#233;es&#187; par 
les tribunaux traditionnels, cette all&#233;gation est irr&#233;aliste et irr&#233;alisable au Cameroun. Une 
v&#233;rification des registres de la prison centrale de Bafoussam, index&#233;e dans l&#8217;appel urgent, 
permettra de constater l&#8217;absence d&#8217;incarc&#233;ration de Mbororos apr&#232;s jugement de l&#8217;Alkali Court 
de Ndawara ou de tout autre tribunal traditionnel. Cette m&#234;me v&#233;rification peut &#234;tre effectu&#233;e 
aupr&#232;s des autres prisons du Cameroun. La Constitution du Cameroun prot&#232;ge les populations 
autochtones. Le Cameroun a sign&#233; la D&#233;claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples 
autochtones. Toutefois, le Gouvernement du Cameroun tient &#224; souligner que les Mbororos, 
arriv&#233;s au Cameroun vers 1905, ne sont pas reconnus par l&#8217;administration camerounaise comme 
des populations autochtones. N&#233;anmoins, du fait les risques li&#233;s &#224; leur environnement et &#224; leur 
mode de vie, ils ont &#233;t&#233; class&#233;s dans la cat&#233;gorie sociale de &#171;population vuln&#233;rables&#187;. Dans ce 
cadre, ils appartiennent &#224; la couche de population dites marginales qui cr&#233;e un r&#233;gime de 
protection d&#8217;exception et une protection accentu&#233;e de leurs droits. La crise de succession &#224; 
l&#8217;Ardorat de Sagba a &#233;t&#233; g&#233;r&#233;e par les autorit&#233;s locales puis nationales. Une commission 
d&#8217;enqu&#234;te interminist&#233;rielle s&#8217;est rendue, du 23 au 26 septembre 2007, sur les lieux pour &#233;valuer 
la situation. Le calme r&#232;gne dans cette partie du pays et le nouveau chef est accept&#233; par les 
populations de Sagba.

<p>detained pro-democracy campaigner and HIV-Aids activist Mr Hu Jia, who was already the 
subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the working group on arbitrary detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture, on 4 January 2008. According to information received, on 
10 January 2008, Mr Li Jinsong was reportedly placed under house arrest for several hours in a 
Beijing hotel, after inviting foreign journalists to confirm that it was impossible for him to see 
Mr Hu Jia&#8217;s wife, Ms Zeng Jinyan. He was allegedly under surveillance by the police. According 
to reports, Mr Hu Jia&#8217;s other lawyer, Mr Li Fangping, was not detained but he was allegedly 
strongly urged not to try to approach Ms Zeng Jinyan&#8217;s home. Previously, the authorities 
prevented them from visiting Mr. Hu in prison on 4 January on the grounds that the case had 
been classified as a &#8220;state secret&#8221;. Furthermore, foreign journalists and friends and relatives of 
Ms Zeng Jinyan and her husband were reportedly prevented by police from visiting or 
communicating with her on 11 January 2008. The police allegedly stated that it was because a 
&#8220;criminal investigation&#8221; was underway. Concern was expressed that the aforementioned arrest of 
Mr Li Jinsong and the intimidation of Mr Li Fangping may be directly related to their human 
rights activities, particularly their defence of Mr Hu Jia. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr Hu Jia while in detention, as well as that of the 
members of his family. 
</p>
<p>68. On 14 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders pursuant, regarding the case of 
Mr Hu Jia. Mr Hu Jia is a pro-democracy campaigner and HIV-AIDS activist. Mr Hu Jia was the 
subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on 4 January 2008, 
following his detention on 27 December 2007. Mr Hu Jia was also subject of communications 
sent by mandate holders on 30 November 2007, 31 May 2007 and 2 June 2004. According to 
new information received, on 3 April, 2008, Mr Hu Jia was sentenced to three years and six 
months&#8217; imprisonment and one year of political rights deprivation for &#8220;inciting subversion of 
state power&#8221; by the Beijing Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. Mr Hu Jia was 
convicted on the basis of political articles he wrote for the internet, interviews he had given to 
the media, and his signing of the letter &#8220;The Real China Before the Olympics&#8221;, which demands 
an end the pre-Olympics human rights abuses. Mr Hu Jia was officially charged on 
30 January 2008 by the Beijing Municipal Peoples Procurate, and he stood trial on 
18 March 2008. Reports indicated that his lawyers were given only 20 minutes to deliver a 
defense during the four-hour session and were prevented from responding or interjecting 
throughout the proceedings. International observers and diplomats were barred from the 
courtroom during the trial, as were Mr Hu Jia&#8217;s father and wife. Some of Mr Hu Jia&#8217;s friends and 
colleagues were detained and moved to locations outside Beijing, allegedly to prevent them from 
speaking to the media outside the courtroom. Reports indicated that the Beijing Public Security 
Bureau (PSB) has refused to supply Mr Hu Jia with necessary medication in detention and to 
deliver him the medication brought by his relatives to the detention centre. Mr Hu Jia suffers 
from a liver disease and must take daily medication. Concern was expressed that the alleged </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>verdict of Mr Hu Jia may be directly related to his human rights activities, particularly his 
exercising of the right to freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed for Mr Hu Jia&#8217;s 
medical condition and psychological integrity while in detention. 
</p>
<p>69. On 23 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders, regarding the case of Mr. Hu Jia, a Beijing-based HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and 
former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute for Health Education. Mr Hu Jia has been the 
subject of communications sent by several mandate holders following his detention on 
27 December 2007 and his sentencing on 3 April 2008 to three years and six months&#8217; 
imprisonment and one year of deprivation of political rights for &#8220;inciting subversion of state 
power&#8221;. According to new information received, Mr. Hu Jia has been prevented from submitting 
an appeal. According to the law, Mr Hu Jia had ten days to appeal the sentence from the day it 
was issued by the Beijing Municipal No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court. However, Mr Hu Jia 
was denied legal representation in this period, preventing him from discussing the details of a 
possible appeal. Reports further indicate that Mr. Hu Jia has not been able to see his relatives 
since 3 April 2008, and that his health condition has been deteriorating. Concern was expressed 
that the denial of access to legal representation and the consequent absence of any opportunity 
for Mr Hu Jia to appeal the sentence might be related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in 
the defence of human rights and in disseminating information about HIV/AIDS. Further concern 
was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Hu Jia while imprisoned. 
</p>
<p>70. On 24 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang, a human rights defender and petitioner in Ji County, Tianjin. According to 
information received, on 29 February 2008, the Tianjin police arrested Ms. Zheng Mingfang at 
her home. She has been held incommunicado since the arrest. Her family has not received any 
formal detention order and their requests to contact and meet with her have been repeatedly 
denied by the police. In addition, she has not been allowed to meet with a lawyer. According to 
unofficial sources, Ms. Zheng Mingfang has been sentenced to two years of reeducation through 
labor (RTL) and was currently being held at the Xian district centre in Tianjin, east of Beijing. 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s health had deteriorated and she was beginning to lose her sight. 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s husband&#8217;s mobile phone and computer equipment were confiscated after 
her arrest. On 4 April 2008, the Tianjin police warned Ms. Zheng Mingfang&#8217;s family not to 
communicate with foreigners. The husband was told that, if he did not comply, 
Ms. Zheng Mingfang would not be released. Her sister was ordered to turn off her mobile phone 
and keep away from journalists. Shortly before her detention, Ms. Zheng Mingfang had 
campaigned and protested against the arrests of Ye Guozhu and Hu Jia. In particular, she had 
been collecting signatures to demand that authorities release Mr. Hu Jia. Concerns were 
expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Zheng Mingfang might be solely connected to her 
peaceful activities in defending human rights and the exercise of her right to freedom of opinion 
and expression. In view of the reported incommunicado detention of Ms. Zheng Mingfang at an 
unknown place of detention, further concerns were expressed that she might be at risk of 
ill-treatment. Further concern was expressed at the restrictions on the exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression imposed on the family of Ms. Zheng Mingfang. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>71. On 25 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the Law on Lawyers as 
amended on 28 October 2007 and the 1996 Ministry of Justice regulations on &#8220;Methods for the 
Management of Lawyers Professional Licenses&#8221;. In this connection, the Special Rapporteurs 
drew the Excellency&#8217;s Government attention to two substantive areas that give rise to concern: 1) 
the legal regime of re-registration of licenses of lawyers and its application; and 2) articles 37, 40 
para. 7 and 49 paras. 7 and 8 of the amended Law on Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>72. Regarding the first area of concern, the Special Rapporteurs point out that Article 12 of the 
Ministry of Justice&#8217;s regulation of &#8220;Methods for the Management of Lawyers Professional 
Licenses&#8221; requires that lawyers&#8217; licenses must be registered yearly. Pursuant to this provision, a 
lawyer&#8217;s application for renewal of his/her license must be submitted to the judicial bureaus by 
the law firm for which he works. This application must include information on the lawyer&#8217;s work 
during the past year, among other requirements. It is then the local judicial bureau which adopts 
an opinion on the subject matter before transmitting it to the relevant institution for registration. 
According to the information received, the respective judicial bureau has broad discretion in this 
regard. Provisions that allow for the denial of re-registration are contained in articles 9 para. 11 
(using media and publicity or other means to carry out untrue or unsuitable publicity); 9 para. 23 
(other acts for which a penalty is appropriate) and 10 para. 3 of these regulations (other illegal 
acts, that seriously damage the image of the legal profession). These provisions are overly broad 
and thus raise concerns as to legal certainty. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs had received 
information concerning Teng Biao and Jiang Tianyong, human rights lawyers. Both of them 
appear to have not been granted renewal of their licenses after declaring publicly their 
willingness to defend individuals of Tibetan origin charged to have been involved in the events 
of March 2008. While Mr. Teng Giao was reportedly informed that his application for 
re-registration was rejected at final stage, the application of Mr. Jiang Tianyong appears to be 
reconsidered by the judicial bureau in the following weeks. In this connection, the 
Special Rapporteurs drew to the Excellency&#8217;s attention the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crimes and the 
Treatment of Offenders held in Havana, Cuba, in 1990, and in particular to principles 16 a) and 
c), 18 and 23. Furthermore the Special Rapporteurs referred to the fundamental principles set 
forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, in particular articles 1, 2 and 9 para. 3 point c). 
</p>
<p>73. Regarding the second area of concern, the Special Rapporteurs, while having noted with 
satisfaction that the revised Law on Lawyers, adopted by the 10th Standing Committee of the 
National People&#8217;s Congress on 28 October 2007, reflected commendable progress made in 
relation to the issues of access to legal counsel (article 33), access to and photocopying of case 
files and documents (article 34), no progress has been made with respect to the establishment of 
a truly independent and self-regulatory body governing activities of lawyers. In this connection, 
the Special Rapporteurs referred the Excellency&#8217;s Government to principles 24 and 25 of the 
above mentioned Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers relating to professional self-governing 
associations that are entrusted to ensure the lawyers&#8217; independence. 
</p>
<p>74. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs refer to article 37 paras. 1 and 2 of the revised Law 
on Lawyers, which reads &#8220;[t]he personal rights of a lawyer in practicing law shall not be 
infringed upon. The representation or defense opinions presented in court by a lawyer shall not </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>be subject to legal prosecution, however, except speeches compromising the national security, 
maliciously defaming others or seriously disrupting the court order.&#8221; In addition, article 40 
para. 7 of the Law prohibits to instigate a party to &#8220;settle disputes by illegal means disrupting 
public order or compromising public safety&#8221;. These provisions are to be read in conjunction with 
article 35 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which stipulates &#8220;[t]he responsibility of a defender 
shall be to present, according to the facts and law, materials and opinions proving the innocence 
of the criminal suspect or defendant, the pettiness of his crime and the need for a mitigated 
punishment or exemption from criminal responsibility, thus safeguarding the lawful rights and 
interests of the criminal suspect or the defendant.&#8221;; and with article 5 of the Standards of Ethics 
and Disciplines of Professional Lawyers issued by the All China Lawyers&#8217; Association, which 
reads &#8220;[l]awyers shall abide to honesty, credibility, diligence and responsibility in fulfilling the 
requirement and responsibility of the profession for the defense of the legal interests of clients.&#8217; 
In addition to that, article 24 of the Standards of Ethics requires that &#8216;lawyers shall fully exercise 
professional knowledge and skills, complete the entrusted tasks under legal parameters; and with 
commitment and responsibility, maximize protection of the legal interests of the clients.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>75. While article 37 of the Criminal Procedure Code defines the lawyers&#8217; immunity in respect 
of submissions made before the court in general terms, the Special Rapporteurs were concerned 
at the overly broad formulation of &#8220;except speeches compromising the national security, 
maliciously defaming others&#8221;. He had the same concern as regards &#8220;to settle disputes by illegal 
means disrupting public order or compromising public safety&#8221;, as enshrined in article 40 para. 7. 
Given that lawyers have the above mentioned responsibilities related to the defense of their 
clients, the overly broad clauses contained in article 37 and 40 may deter lawyers from defending 
certain cases. In this context, it should also be noted that article 49 paras. 7 and 8 of the Law 
stipulates such behaviour may cause the withdrawal of a lawyer&#8217;s license and the criminal 
liability of a lawyer. In this context, the Special Rapporteurs referred to the Excellency&#8217;s 
Government to principle 18 and 20 of the above mentioned Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>76. In summary, the Special Rapporteurs were concerned that many provisions of the Law on 
Lawyers, as entered into force on 1 June 2008, are not in accordance with international human 
rights standards. They therefore urged the executive and legislative branches of government in 
the China to consider and initiate amendments to the Law on Lawyers and related provisions of 
the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in order to prevent human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>77. On 20 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, regarding threats 
against voluntary lawyers involved in a campaign initiated by Mr. Li Fangping, a human rights 
lawyer in Beijing. The campaign aims to bring about justice for the children victim of milk 
contamination following more than 50,000 cases of kidney infections reportedly caused by 
drinking milk mixed with melanin. At least 22 Chinese companies are allegedly responsible for 
the contamination. Communications regarding Mr. Li Fangping were sent by various mandate 
holders on 7 April 2006, 21 December 2006, 5 January 2007, 22 January 2008, and 
15 July 2008. Responses from the Government were received on 14 June 2006, 
14 February 2007, 3 September 2008 and 10 September 2008. According to information </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 49 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>received, as of 24 September more than 100 lawyers from 22 provinces had signed up to offer 
voluntary legal aid to the victims of contaminated milk powder products. On 28 September 2008, 
many of those lawyers had dropped out of the group because of pressure from officials. The 
lawyers were reportedly told that &#8220;they would face serious repercussions if they stayed involved&#8221; 
in the campaign. Concern was expressed that the threats against the voluntary lawyers involved 
in the campaign organized by Mr. Li Fangping might have been related to their legitimate 
activities to seek justice for the victims of contaminated milk. Serious concern was expressed for 
the physical and psychological integrity of the lawyers involved in this campaign. It was feared 
that, because of the pressure faced by the lawyers in question, they may no longer feel able to 
continue with their campaign. In addition, the Special Rapporteurs have been informed that some 
of the companies&#8217; infant formula milk had been certified as an &#8220;inspection-exempt product&#8221; for 
three years by the General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. It 
appeared that such certification means that the products are exempt from quality monitoring and 
inspection by public authorities. 
</p>
<p>78. On 7 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Cheng Hai and Li Subin, members of the Beijing Yitong Law Firm, and Tang Jitian, 
previous member of the Beijing Haodong Law Firm. According to the information received, 
Cheng Hai, Li Subin and Tang Jitian were among 35 lawyers who signed and published an 
appeal on the internet on 26 August 2008 calling for direct elections of the chairperson and the 
board of directors of the Beijing Lawyers Association, which operates under the control of the 
Bureau of Justice. Subsequently, the lawyers used text messages, letters and other means to 
disseminate their appeal to all Beijing lawyers and called upon them to demand their rights and 
actively participate in the upcoming elections for representatives to the Lawyers Association. 
The Association issued a reply to the appeal on its website on 5 September 2008. This appeal 
allegedly states that the use of text messages, the internet or other media to privately promote 
and disseminate the concept of direct elections and to express controversial opinions related to 
the Association is illegal. On 30 October 2008, officials of the Haidian District Bureau of Justice 
came to the Yitong Law Firm, which has dealt with several rights defense cases in the past. The 
officials took photographs and questioned members of the law firm about cases the firm has 
handled. Following this visit, the director of the law firm expressed concern as he felt strong 
pressure from the authorities to stop taking on such cases and employing individuals supporting 
the direct election of the Lawyers Association. In early September, Tang Jitian was asked by his 
superiors to leave his post in order not to put the future of the firm in peril. On 
24 September 2008, Tang had filed a complaint with the Xicheng District Court against the 
Beijing Lawyers Association, stating that the written statement by the Association violated 
domestic law and international treaties signed by the Chinese Government. This complaint has 
allegedly not yet been registered. In mid-October, the Haodong Law Firm terminated Tang&#8217;s 
employment, reportedly under pressure of the authorities. Information has also been received 
that many lawyers who have signed the appeal were summoned by the district bureaus of justice 
to report on their motivation to participate in the appeal. Several directors of law firms were also 
informed by the bureaus of justice that in case the concerned lawyers refused to withdraw their 
signatures, their firms would risk difficulties in the annual licensing procedure. 
</p>
<p>79. On 24 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 50 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
information the Special Rapporteurs have received regarding the situation below. According to 
the allegations received, Mr. Wo Weihan might have been at imminent risk of execution. He was 
sentenced to death in May 2007 for spying following a closed trial in Beijing. His appeal was 
rejected on 29 February 2008. Mr. Weihan had been detained in Beijing on 19 January 2005, but 
was not formally arrested until 5 May. Mr. Weihan, who reportedly had not had any health 
problems prior to his detention, suffered a brain haemorrhage in a detention centre on 
6 February 2005, following which he was allowed to recuperate at home for six weeks. In 
March 2005, he was taken to Beijing Municipal Bo Ren Hospital (a prison hospital) where he 
has been held since. Reports indicate that Mr. Weihan was held incommunicado during the first 
ten months of his detention and only then allowed regular meetings with his lawyers. It was 
further alleged that he confessed to the charges while in detention. Concern has been expressed 
that Wo Weihan may have confessed to the spying charges under torture, in the absence of a 
lawyer. 
</p>
<p>80. On 12 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of 
Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a human rights lawyer. Mr. Zhisheng was the subject of several 
communications sent on 28 September 2007, 1 December 2006, 30 November 2006, 
21 December 2005 and 25 November 2005. According to the information received, 
Mr. Gao Zhisheng was taken away from his home in Shaanxi Province by more than 10 security 
agents on 4 February 2009. He had previously been taken into custody on or shortly after 
19 January 2009 and held incommunicado at an unknown location. He was considered to be at 
high risk of torture and other ill-treatment in light of the harsh treatment he received while in 
detention in 2006 and 2007. His current whereabouts were unknown. Mr. Gao Zhisheng had 
been previously detained on 22 September 2007 and held incommunicado for six weeks. During 
this time, he was allegedly stripped and beaten by a group of police officers in civilian clothes. 
He was also beaten, given electric shocks to his genitals and had cigarettes held close to his eyes 
for several hours, leaving him partially blind for a number of days. During his detention in 2006, 
he was reportedly handcuffed and forced to sit in an iron chair or cross-legged for more than four 
days at a time, in addition to having bright lights shone in his eyes. In April 2007, 
Mr. Gao Zhisheng publicized the torture and ill-treatment he had suffered while in custody, 
which led to an escalation of harassment of his family. 
</p>
<p>81. On 12 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, regarding the case of Liu Yao, 
lawyer in Shenzhen. According to the information received, in June 2008, Mr. Liu was sentenced 
to four years in prison by the Dongyuan County People&#8217;s Court for &#8220;intentional destruction of 
properties&#8221;. The Heyuan Municipal Intermediate Court in Guangdong revoked the judgment for 
unclear facts and insufficient evidence and referred it back to the lower court. On 
17 December 2008, the Dongyuan County People&#8217;s Court, reportedly without any explanation, 
sentenced Mr. Liu to two years imprisonment, even though no new facts or additional evidence 
were presented during the retrial. Liu Yao has appealed the sentence to the Heyuan Municipal 
Intermediate Court. Mr. Liu represented peasants in Paitou Village, located in Dongyuan </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 51 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>County, Heyuan City, Guangdong Province, whose land was expropriated at the end of 2006 by 
the local government to make way for a new power station planned by the Fuyuan Industrial 
Group. In December 2007, Liu Yao went with peasants to the hydroelectric plant 
construction site to try to stop work at the construction site, which had continued in spite of an 
order issued by the State Land Bureau in Dongyuan County to halt the construction. A dispute 
ensued between the peasants and Mr. Liu on the one side and the staff of the Fuyuan Industrial 
Group on the other, which resulted in the destruction of some items at the construction site. 
On 17 January 2008, the Dongyuan County Prosecutor&#8217;s Office authorized Mr. Liu&#8217;s arrest. 
</p>
<p>82. On 12 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding Mr. Gao Zhisheng, a 
human rights lawyer. Mr. Zhisheng was the subject of several communications sent on 
28 September 2007, 1 December 2006, 30 November 2006, 21 December 2005 and 
25 November 2005. According to the information received, Mr. Gao Zhisheng was taken away 
from his home in Shaanxi Province by more than 10 security agents on 4 February 2009. He had 
previously been taken into custody on or shortly after 19 January 2009 and held incommunicado 
at an unknown location. He is considered to be at high risk of torture and other ill-treatment in 
light of the harsh treatment he received while in detention in 2006 and 2007. His whereabouts 
were unknown. Mr. Gao Zhisheng had been previously detained on 22 September 2007 and held 
incommunicado for six weeks. During this time, he was allegedly stripped and beaten by a group 
of police officers in civilian clothes. He was also beaten, given electric shocks to his genitals and

in his eyes. In April 2007, Mr. Gao Zhisheng publicized the torture and ill-treatment he had 
suffered while in custody, which led to an escalation of harassment of his family. 
</p>
<p>83. On 18 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the cases of 
Mr. Lobsang Lhundup, 38 years old, born in Gemo Village, in Litang County, Ganzi, Tibetan 
Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, a monk of Nekhor Monastery; his brother, 
Mr. Sonam Tenpa, 29 years old; Mr. Jampa Thokmey, 30 years old; Mr. Gelek Kunga, 26 years 
old; Mr. Lobsang Tenzin, 23 years old; Mr. Lobsang Phendey, 37 years old; Mr. Jampa Yonten, 
30 years old; Mr. Sanggey, 29 years old; Mr. Jampa Tsering, 28 years old; 
Mr. Lobsang Wangchuk, 30 years old; Mr. Lobsang Tashi, 21 years old; Mr. Gendun Choephel, 
30 years old; Mr. Dargye, 37 years old; Mr. Gedhun, 29 years old; Mr. Jampa, 40 years old; 
Mr. Amdo Gyaltsen, 41 years old; and Mr. Damdul, head of Dekyi village, all of them residing 
in Litang County. According to the information received, Mr. Lobsang Lhundup was arrested on 
15 February 2009 for staging a peaceful solo demonstration at the main market square of Litang 
town for about 15-20 minutes, chanting slogan such as &#8220;Long live the Dalai Lama&#8221;, 
&#8220;Independence for Tibet&#8221;, &#8220;Swift return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet&#8221;, or &#8220;No Losar celebration 
this year&#8221; (Losar being the New Year celebrated by ethnic Tibetans). He was arrested and </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>detained by officials of the Public Security Bureau (PSB) and People&#8217;s Armed Police (PAP) and 
taken to the Litang PSB Detention Centre for further interrogation. In the morning of 
16 February 2009, a group of twenty Tibetans from Litang County was also arrested after staging 
a similar peaceful protest march at Litang main market square. In addition to the sixteen 
individuals named above, they included two Tibetans, whose identities are not known, and 
Yanglo and Dolma, two Tibetan Nomad women from Sako village, who were released on the 
evening of the same day. Mr. Sonam Tenpa, who led the peaceful protest, was carrying a portrait 
of the Dalai Lama adorned with a traditional Tibetan scarf, while the group chanted slogans such 
as &#8220;Long Live the Dalai Lama&#8221;, &#8220;Independence for Tibet&#8221;, &#8220;Swift return of the Dalai Lama to 
Tibet&#8221; and &#8220;No Losar celebration this year&#8221;. Eyewitnesses to the scene reported that the 
members of the group were beaten, manhandled and forcibly loaded into military trucks by PSB 
and PAP forces. Some of the protesters were badly bruised and injured with blood dripping from 
their nose, head and arms. Mr. Sonam Tenpa and Mr. Lobsang Tenzin sustained particularly 
serious injuries from the beatings at the site of the demonstration. Mr. Lobsang Lhundup was 
detained at Litang County PSB Detention Centre, whereas the other detainees are said to be held 
at Tsagha PSB Detention Centre. However, when the family members of Mr. Gelek Kunga 
arrived for a visit they could not find him at this detention centre. Concerns were expressed for 
the physical and mental integrity of the abovementioned individuals, in particular of 
Mr. Gelek Kunga whose whereabouts were unknown. Further concerns were expressed that their 
arrest and detention might be solely based on their reportedly peaceful exercise of their right to 
freedom of assembly, opinion, and expression of political beliefs. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>84. On 13 June 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 24 April 2008, stating 
that Zheng Mingfang, female, born on 5 July 1963, junior middle-school education, from Ji 
County in Tianjin City. On 1 March 2008, Zheng concocted a terrorist message, claiming that a 
man driving a vehicle supposedly filled with explosive was going to blow up a State gymnasium. 
Since the story she made up and spread caused a disturbance and seriously disrupted public 
order, the Tianjin public security authorities, acting in accordance with the relevant Chinese 
regulations on re-education through labour, applied re-education through labour to Zheng on 
1 April 2008. Re-education through labour in China is conducted on basis of the decision on the 
matter approved in 1957 by the Standing Committee of the National People&#8217;s Congress and other 
such laws and regulations. It is not a criminal punishment but an administrative one. The 
people&#8217;s government in every province, autonomous region, city reporting directly to the 
Government, and every large and medium-sized city in China has established a re-education 
through labour management committee, and re-education through labour activities are supervised 
by the people&#8217;s procuratorates. Under the regulations, re-education through labour is applicable 
only to people aged 16 years and older who have disrupted the social order in large or 
medium-sized cities and refused to mend their ways, or who have committed petty offences not 
meriting a criminal penalty, and who meet the conditions laid down in the regulations. There is a 
strict legal procedure for ordering re-education through labour, and a statutory supervision 
system. Persons wishing to challenge a re-education order can appeal to the re-education through 
labour management committee or, under the terms of the Administrative Proceedings Act, to the 
people&#8217;s courts. Apart from being required to comply with disciplinary measures under the 
re-education through labour regulations which restrict some of their rights, individuals subject to </p>

<p>re-education retain the wide range of civil rights afforded to them by the Constitution and laws, 
including permission to see family members while undergoing re-education and freedom of 
correspondence, rest on holidays and so forth. 
</p>
<p>85. On 10 September 2008, the Government replies to the communication of 22 January 2008. 
First, the Government indicates that Li Jinsong, male, is a lawyer and was the defence attorney 
for Hu Jia in the latter&#8217;s case; all his rights have been fully respected, and the Chinese judicial 
authorities have never taken any coercive measures in respect of him. Throughout the 
investigation, prosecution and trial phases of Hu&#8217;s case, Li was able to meet regularly with Hu in 
his capacity as his counsel, and he put forward a complete defence during the hearings. When the 
trial in the court of first instance was over, Li unequivocally supported Hu&#8217;s decision not to 
appeal. Second, the Government informs that Li Fangping, male, is not Hu Jia&#8217;s defence 
attorney, and the Chinese judicial authorities have never taken any coercive measures in respect 
of him. Third, the Government informs that Hu Jia, male, was born in 1973. On 
27 December 2007, the Beijing municipal public security authorities placed him in criminal 
detention on suspicion of inciting subversion of the political authority of the State. On 
3 April 2008, the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People&#8217;s Court sentenced Hu to a term of 
imprisonment of three years and six months and one year&#8217;s deprivation of his political rights for 
the crime of inciting subversion of the political authority of the State. The Government informs 
that during the investigation, prosecution and trial phases of Hu&#8217;s case, all of Hu&#8217;s rights were 
fully respected. During the trial, Hu stated in court that from the time coercive measures had 
been taken in respect of him, the public security authorities had never violated his integrity but 
had cared for and educated him in a compassionate and humane manner. The government further 
informs that he acknowledged that he had indeed broken the law, admitting his guilt and 
expressing his willingness to accept the punishment mandated by law; he did not appeal the 
verdict. Hu is currently serving his sentence in prison; his health is excellent, and his parents and 
his spouse have all been able to visit him. 
</p>
<p>86. On 13 February 2009, the Government replies to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letters 
of 20 October and 7 November 2008 stating that the Beijing Lawyers Association is an 
association having legal personality and is registered with the civil authorities in accordance with 
the law which conducts its activities independently. The Government informs that the competent 
Chinese Government authorities have never interfered in its internal affairs, such as elections, 
nor have they ever exerted pressure on any unit or individual in this regard, nor have the 
competent authorities ever received any complaint to this effect. It further states that because of 
problems involving unlawful breaches of discipline by the Beijing Yitong Law Firm and its 
lawyers in the course of their professional activities, with the parties concerned being the subject 
of numerous complaints and even being disciplined by the Lawyers Association, the Beijing 
municipal judicial authorities investigated the matter and sought on the spot for clarification 
from the law firm. Such activities are part of the judicial authorities&#8217; normal supervisory and 
managerial activities. The Government thus maintains that the allegations in the communication 
are thus inconsistent with the facts. Concerning Tang Jitian, the Government informs that his 
contract of employment with the Beijing Haodong Law Firm had expired, which meant that he 
could not continue working for that firm. In November 2008, Tang submitted an application for 
work with the Beijing Anhui Law Firm, where he is currently employed as a lawyer. The 
Government thus concludes that the allegation in the communication that pressure was placed on 
the law firm to fire Tang is inconsistent with the facts. </p>

<p>87. On 4 June 2008, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications 
of 14 and 23 April 2008. On 17 February 2009, the Government replied to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 24 November 2008. On 1 April 2009, the Government replied to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 12 February 2009 (concerning Gao Zhisheng). On 17 April 2009 
and 20 April 2009, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communications 
of 18 February 2009 and 12 February 2009 (concerning Liu Yao), respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for the replies received. At the 
time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to reflect the content 
of the replies from the Government of China dated 4 June 2008, 17 February 2009, 1 April 2009, 
17 April 2009 and 20 April 2009 as he had not received the translation from the relevant 
services. 
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur notes that the majority of the cases addressed by his mandate 
concern the situation of defense lawyers and the situation of other human rights defenders which 
often face judicial and other proceedings which fall short of the fair trial principles. 
</p><p>90. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to his 
communication of 25 June 2008. As this letter concerned his detailed comments on legislative 
amendments to the Law on Lawyers and regulations on professional licenses for lawyers, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Government of China to enter into a dialogue 
with him in order to discuss and examine the concerns highlighted in the letter.

la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de Colombia la informaci&#243;n que hab&#237;a recibido con relaci&#243;n a 
la persistencia de una situaci&#243;n delicada de amenazas y violencia contra abogados y defensores

respecto de las amenazas de que han venido siendo objeto los defensores de derechos humanos, 
en particular quienes llevan adelante actividades profesionales como abogados en defensa de los 
derechos humanos. Dicha preocupaci&#243;n ya hab&#237;a sido expresada al Gobierno de Colombia en la 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada el d&#237;a 4 de diciembre de 2007, as&#237; como en el comunicado de prensa de

embargo, manifest&#243; que resulta preocupante que este tipo de situaciones contin&#250;en sucediendo. 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, los abogados defensores de derechos humanos estar&#237;an siendo 
v&#237;ctimas de asesinatos, atentados y amenazas, llegando a veces a verse obligados a recurrir a 
desplazamientos forzados o a1 exilio. Adem&#225;s, el papel de los abogados defensores de derechos 
humanos resultar&#237;a frecuentemente estigmatizado por las autoridades. A&#250;n desde los niveles m&#225;s

<p>de hecho, criminalizantes del ejercicio profesional, particularmente cuando se trata de abogados 
penalistas, laboralistas o defensores de derechos humanos. Asimismo, el Relator Especial hizo 
referencias a alegaciones sobre violaciones al debido proceso, en particular a la garant&#237;a de la 
igualdad de armas, que estar&#237;an siendo utilizadas como herramienta para limitar las actividades 
profesionales de 1os abogados, en especial de 1os defensores de derechos humanos. As&#237;, se 
estar&#237;a violando la confidencialidad de la relaci&#243;n abogado-cliente, se estar&#237;a limitando el acceso 
de los abogados a 1os expedientes o a los lugares de detenci&#243;n y se les estar&#237;a impidiendo 
hacerse cargo de la defensa de ciertos casos. Adem&#225;s el Relator Especial anot&#243; que conforme a 
las informaciones recibidas, todas estas acciones y agresiones en contra de los abogados no son 
debidamente investigadas por las autoridades, lo cual hace a&#250;n m&#225;s dif&#237;cil el ejercicio de la 
profesi&#243;n de abogado, en especial para 1os defensores de derechos humanos. Con relaci&#243;n al 
modelo de sistema judicial, el Relator Especial indic&#243; que, de acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n remitida, 
la entrada en vigencia del sistema de tipo acusatorio como un nuevo sistema procesal penal a 
partir de 2004 habr&#237;a afectado profundamente el debido proceso. El Estado no habr&#237;a adoptado 
medidas para colaborar en el reentrenamiento de los abogados particulares, pero si lo habr&#237;a 
hecho con los funcionarios del poder judicial, quienes, pese a la vigencia del sistema de tipo 
acusatorio, seguir&#237;an utilizando las pr&#225;cticas del antiguo sistema inquisitivo. Asimismo, el 
Relator Especial indic&#243; que en Colombia no existir&#237;a la colegiaci&#243;n obligatoria, lo cual 
disminuye la defensa de 1os intereses gremiales y la protecci&#243;n personal del abogado. Asimismo, 
manifest&#243; que de acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida las medidas cautelares otorgadas por el 
Estado a las v&#237;ctimas de amenazas, aunque demuestran una<b> </b>voluntad estatal de responder a sus 
compromisos internacionales, muchas veces se tornar&#237;an en un mero acto administrativo, pues, 
de manera general, habr&#237;an perdido eficiencia debido a1 n&#250;mero significativo de perseguidos y a 
la carencia de recursos humanos, financieros y log&#237;sticos. 
</p>
<p>92. El 9 de marzo de 2009 el Relator Especial conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente para se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n 
urgente del Gobierno de Colombia la informaci&#243;n recibida con relaci&#243;n a las amenazas contra la 
Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az, abogada de la <i>Comisi&#243;n Colombiana de Juristas</i> (CCJ) y otro 
miembro de la organizaci&#243;n. La Sra. Malag&#243;n D&#237;az adelanta actividades sobre impunidad en 
casos de violaciones cometidas contra las y los sindicalistas en Colombia. El Relator Especial 
indic&#243; que seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 2 de marzo de 2009, a las 12: 21 hs, se habr&#237;a 
recibido un fax en el que se declara como objetivo militar a la Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az, 
abogada de la Comisi&#243;n Colombiana de Juristas (CCJ). En el texto de la amenaza tambi&#233;n se 
habr&#237;a mencionado a otro miembro de la CCJ, quien habr&#237;a debido salir del pa&#237;s a finales de 
2008, por haber sido v&#237;ctima de persecuci&#243;n y amenazas por parte del mismo grupo paramilitar 
autodenominado <i>Bloque Capital de las &#193;guilas Negra AUC</i>. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n 
recibida, en febrero de 2009, la Sra. Malag&#243;n D&#237;az realiz&#243; un informe sobre la impunidad 
existente en los cr&#237;menes que se cometen en Colombia contra las y los sindicalistas por sus 
actividades en defensa de los derechos laborales. Este informe habr&#237;a sido un insumo importante 
para la audiencia que se llev&#243; a cabo el 12 de febrero de 2009 en el Congreso estadounidense, 
convocado por el representante George Miller, Presidente de la Comisi&#243;n de Educaci&#243;n y 
Trabajo de la C&#225;mara de Representantes de Estados Unidos y cuyo prop&#243;sito fue examinar la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos de los trabajadores en Colombia y la violencia antisindical. El trabajo 
realizado por la CCJ para dicha audiencia se habr&#237;a coordinado con el Director de la Escuela 
Nacional Sindical, el Sr. Luciano San&#237;n V&#225;squez, quien habr&#237;a participado de la misma. Esta </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>participaci&#243;n habr&#237;a generado la reacci&#243;n del Presidente de la Rep&#250;blica, &#193;lvaro Uribe V&#233;lez, 
quien habr&#237;a se&#241;alado a los participantes en la reuni&#243;n como personas que distorsionan la verdad 
motivados por el &#8220;odio pol&#237;tico&#8221;. El Relator expres&#243; su temor de que la amenaza en contra de la 
Sra. Lina Paola Malag&#243;n D&#237;az y la CCJ est&#233; relacionada con el trabajo de la CCJ de proteger 
derechos sindicales. 
</p>
<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n recibida 
</b></p>
<p>93. El 4 de septiembre de 2008 el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el 
Relator Especial el 30 de junio de 2008. El Gobierno indic&#243; que se han adelantado esfuerzos 
sistem&#225;ticos para brindar plenas garant&#237;as a la labor que realizan los defensores de derechos 
humanos, incluidos el fortalecimiento de programas de protecci&#243;n, el mantenimiento de canales 
permanentes de comunicaci&#243;n con las autoridades, la facilitaci&#243;n de su acci&#243;n en todo el 
territorio nacional y la respuesta eficaz a sus demandas de informaci&#243;n y quejas. El Gobierno 
colombiano rechaz&#243; categ&#243;ricamente las intimidaciones y amenazas contra dirigentes de 
Organizaciones No Gubernamentales dedicadas leg&#237;timamente a la defensa de los derechos 
humanos y su declaratoria como objetivos militares por parte de grupos armados ilegales. El 
Gobierno consider&#243; que la caracterizaci&#243;n de la situaci&#243;n de este sector debe hacerse teniendo en 
cuenta que aqu&#233;llos casos que se presentan y puedan constituir motivos de preocupaci&#243;n, son 
excepcionales y aislados. Para responder con efectividad a los casos aislados de amenaza a la 
labor de Abogados y Defensores de Derechos Humanos, el Gobierno indic&#243; que se han adoptado 
medidas de protecci&#243;n sobre los casos denunciados y han sido puestos en conocimiento de las 
autoridades competentes. Tambi&#233;n se han adoptado medidas de prevenci&#243;n para evitar la 
ocurrencia de hechos similares en el futuro. En materia de los impactos del nuevo sistema penal 
oral acusatorio, el Instituto Nacional Penitenciario y Carcelario INPEC, ha informado que el 
nuevo Sistema ha dado celeridad al proceso penal, motivo por el cual al disminuirse el tiempo 
procesal, el detenido en su calidad bien sea de sindicado, iniciado o imputado, no permanece en 
esta situaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica por lapsos superiores a los previstos en la misma norma penal para llevar a 
cabo el llamamiento a juicio, el cual ten&#237;a una duraci&#243;n superior a los dieciocho (18) meses; con 
el actual proceso, de acuerdo con estudios adelantados por el Consejo Superior de la judicatura, 
el tiempo procesal de un sindicado, iniciado o imputado no supera de dos y medio (2,5) a cinco 
(5) meses. Por esta raz&#243;n, la actual situaci&#243;n jur&#237;dica de los reclusos se ha ido modificando de 
una forma m&#225;s pronta, ya que acorde con estos cambios, pasan al status de condenados, lo que 
trae consigo el cambio del establecimiento de reclusi&#243;n, acceso a los programas de reinserci&#243;n y 
redenci&#243;n de pena. 
</p>
<p><b>Comentarios y observaciones del Relator Especial 
</b></p>
<p>94. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Colombia su grata cooperaci&#243;n y aprecia que 
el mismo haya tenido a bien enviarle informaci&#243;n sustantiva en respuesta a la alegaci&#243;n enviada 
el 30 de junio de 2008. El Relator Especial nota con satisfacci&#243;n los esfuerzos realizados por 
parte del Gobierno a fin de proteger la labor de los defensores de derechos humanos y agradece 
la explicaci&#243;n sobre el sistema de protecci&#243;n puesto en marcha. Sin embargo, contin&#250;a 
preocupado por la vulnerabilidad de los defensores de derechos humanos que contin&#250;an siendo 
frecuentemente estigmatizados y amenazados por su labor, de acuerdo a lo constatado por la Alta 
Comisionada en su reciente misi&#243;n al pa&#237;s (A/HRC/10/032). Preocupa al Relator Especial que 
dichas estigmatizaciones en ocasiones provienen de altos funcionarios del Gobierno. En este 
contexto el Relator Especial llama la atenci&#243;n sobre los Principios B&#225;sicos sobre la Funci&#243;n de </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 57 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>los Abogados, en particular, el n&#250;mero 16 y 17 que establece que los gobiernos garantizar&#225;n que 
los abogados puedan desempe&#241;ar todas sus funciones profesionales sin intimidaciones, 
obst&#225;culos, acosos o interferencias indebidas y sin sufrir ni estar expuestos a persecuciones o 
sanciones administrativas, econ&#243;micas o de otra &#237;ndole. Cuando la seguridad de los abogados sea 
amenazada a ra&#237;z del ejercicio de sus funciones, recibir&#225;n de las autoridades protecci&#243;n 
adecuada. 
</p>
<p>95. De otra parte el Relator deja constancia de que el Gobierno no ha clarificado el impacto de 
la implementaci&#243;n del sistema acusatorio penal sobre las labores de los abogados, ni ha 
explicado de qu&#233; manera se ha protegido la igualdad de armas, elemento fundamental del 
derecho a un debido proceso, teniendo en cuenta las alegaciones que indican que los abogados 
no est&#225;n en igualdad de condiciones con los fiscales, en materia de capacitaci&#243;n sobre el sistema 
penal acusatorio. 
</p>
<p>96. En lo que respecta la comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 9 de marzo de 2009, el Relator espera 
recibir una respuesta del Gobierno lo m&#225;s pronto posible, para poder incluirla en su pr&#243;ximo 
informe, dado que a la finalizaci&#243;n del presente, el plazo para responder dado al Gobierno a&#250;n 
estaba vigente.

situation de Nsimba Embete Ponte, directeur du journal &#8220;<i>L&#8217;Interpr&#232;te</i>&#8221; &#224; Kinshasa et de son 
collaborateur Davin Ntondo Nzovuangu. Selon nos informations, M. Ponte aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le 
7 mars 2008 par des hommes en civil arm&#233;s et non identifi&#233;s. Il serait d&#233;tenu depuis dans les 
cellules de l&#8217;Agence Nationale de Renseignement (ANR) &#224; Kinshasa, sans avoir &#233;t&#233; inculp&#233;. Il 
semblerait que depuis son arrestation, Mr. Ponte n&#8217;ait eu acc&#232;s ni &#224; son avocat, ni aux visites de 
sa famille, ni &#224; des soins m&#233;dicaux. Les raisons de l&#8217;arrestation et de la d&#233;tention de Mr. Ponte 
seraient li&#233;es &#224; des articles qu&#8217;il aurait publi&#233;s dans son journal en f&#233;vrier 2008, relatant la 
tentative d&#8217;assassinat pr&#233;sum&#233;e contre le chef de l&#8217;Etat, ainsi que l&#8217;&#233;tat de sant&#233; de ce dernier, 
informations consid&#233;r&#233;es comme &#8220;portant atteinte &#224; la suret&#233; de l&#8217;Etat&#8221; par l&#8217;administrateur de

Les rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont &#233;galement attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de la R&#233;publique 
d&#233;mocratique du Congo sur la situation de Me Mulume et Me Cubaka, deux avocats des 
pr&#233;sum&#233;s auteurs mat&#233;riels dans le proc&#232;s Maheshe. Des dysfonctionnements entourant le proc&#232;s 
en premi&#232;re instance et des menaces prof&#233;r&#233;es contre les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme 
participant ou suivant le proc&#232;s en appel ont d&#233;j&#224; fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent que les 
Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont transmis au Gouvernement le 11 f&#233;vrier 2008. 
</p>
<p>99. Selon les informations re&#231;ues<b>, </b>le 17 avril 2008, Mme Sophie Roudil aurait re&#231;u un message 
anonyme sur son t&#233;l&#233;phone portable (SMS) la mettant en garde avec les termes suivants : &#171;Ne 
t&#8217;en fais pas. Rira bien qui rira le dernier. Ils paieront cher de leur propre sang &#224; l&#8217;issue de ce 
proc&#232;s qu&#8217;ils ont tant discr&#233;dit&#233;. Nous sommes au Congo. Au plaisir ...&#187;. Ce message viserait 
l&#8217;ensemble des observateurs qui auraient d&#233;nonc&#233; des irr&#233;gularit&#233;s dans le proc&#232;s en appel de 
l&#8217;affaire Serge Maheshe. Le m&#234;me jour, M. Jean Bedel Kaniki et M. Dieudonn&#233; Sango aurait 
re&#231;u un message similaire. Le 19 avril 2008, Mme Sophie Roudil aurait &#233;t&#233; une nouvelle fois 
menac&#233;e par le biais du SMS suivant: &#171;Avec tous les respects, tu es RESPONSABLE de ce qui 
va ARRIVER&#187;. M. Jean Bedel Kaniki, M. Jean Paul Ngongo et M. Dieudonn&#233; Sango auraient 
quant &#224; eux re&#231;u le message suivant: &#171;Plainte. Une contre attaque? Hum!!! Ok. Le plus fort 
l&#8217;emportera. C&#8217;est une question de temps. Le vin est tir&#233;&#8230;bonne chance. Enfin, M. Jean Bedel 
Kaniki (ONG ICJP) aurait de surcro&#238;t re&#231;u deux appels du m&#234;me num&#233;ro &#224; 19h27 et 20h01, mais 
n&#8217;aurait pas d&#233;croch&#233;. Le 24 avril, des menaces contre M. Jean Bedel Kaniki auraient &#224; nouveau 
&#233;t&#233; prof&#233;r&#233;es : &#171; Tu es un CADAVRE qui marche ! Ca te dit quelque chose? ksk tu gagnes &#224; salir 
comme &#231;a l&#8217;image de ton pays? J&#8217;ai donn&#233; ma t&#234;te &#224; couper. Mais en ce qui concerne toi &#8230;&#187;. 
Des plaintes auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;es aupr&#232;s de la police par les personnes susmentionn&#233;es les 19, 
21 et 25 avril. Me Mulume et Me Cubaka, seraient &#233;galement la cible de menaces. En 
t&#233;moignent les messages suivants re&#231;us le 21 avril 2008: &#171;Merci d&#8217;&#234;tre cyniques [sic]. Votre 
strat&#233;gie consiste maintenant conseiller vos clients de s&#233;cher les audiences! Le fait de les avoir 
incit&#233;s &#224; citer les militaires dans cette salet&#233; ne vous a pas suffi? Apres tout, ce proc&#232;s finira un 
jour et nous verrons qui sera ridicule ...&#187;. &#171;Me, avec respect, je te mets en garde contre cette 
fa&#231;on de vouloir salir les magistrats militaires. Tu as donc adopte la m&#233;thode de l&#8217;avocat Cubaka 
des assassins qui n&#8217;a pas du [sic] respect pour les morts et qui veut d&#233;router la cour vers une piste 
militaire inexistante. Apres tout, ce proc&#232;s finira, et ...&#187;. Le 23 avril, les deux avocats auraient 
d&#233;pos&#233; une plainte aupr&#232;s du Procureur g&#233;n&#233;ral. Me Mulume aurait ensuite annonc&#233; qu&#8217;il se 
retirait du proc&#232;s car il ne se sentait pas en s&#233;curit&#233; et n&#8217;&#233;tait pas en mesure d&#8217;exercer librement 
ses activit&#233;s professionnelles. 
</p>
<p>100. Parall&#232;lement &#224; ces actes d&#8217;intimidations &#224; l&#8217;encontre des observateurs du proc&#232;s, les 
dysfonctionnements suivants lors du proc&#232;s en appel auraient &#233;t&#233; observ&#233;s: la violation 
syst&#233;matique du principe de l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; des moyens entre les parties lors des audiences: alors que le 
Minist&#232;re Public et les avocats de la partie civile s&#8217;exprimeraient longuement et obtiendraient 
syst&#233;matiquement la parole, les avocats de la d&#233;fense, et les pr&#233;venus eux-m&#234;mes, se seraient vus 
&#224; de nombreuses reprises refuser la parole ou interrompre par le Premier Pr&#233;sident de la Cour; le 
proc&#232;s en appel n&#8217;aurait jusqu&#8217;&#224; pr&#233;sent pas proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;examen des questions controvers&#233;es en 
premi&#232;re instance mais l&#8217;instruction se serait presque exclusivement focalis&#233;e sur la lettre de 
r&#233;tractation des pr&#233;sum&#233;s auteurs mat&#233;riels. La Cour semblerait insister &#224; remettre en cause la 
validit&#233; de la r&#233;tractation des aveux alors que les pr&#233;venus auraient affirm&#233; de mani&#232;re constante 
que deux magistrats militaires les auraient forc&#233;s &#224; faire ces &#171;aveux&#187; et &#224; mettre en cause les </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>deux amis de Serge Maheshe ; les deux magistrats militaires, mis en cause par les deux auteurs 
mat&#233;riels, assisteraient &#224; toutes les audiences. Ils n&#8217;auraient jamais &#233;t&#233; isol&#233;s de la salle 
d&#8217;audience avant d&#8217;&#234;tre entendus, ce qui aurait pu influencer leurs d&#233;clarations et serait en 
violation du code judiciaire militaire. Aucune enqu&#234;te n&#8217;aurait eu lieu sur les all&#233;gations de 
subornation et l&#8217;Auditeur Sup&#233;rieur serait intervenu en personne au proc&#232;s pour prendre la 
d&#233;fense des magistrats et r&#233;futer ces all&#233;gations; un des pr&#233;sum&#233;s auteurs mat&#233;riels aurait &#233;t&#233; 
victime d&#8217;une agression &#224; la prison centrale. Ces avocats auraient qualifi&#233; l&#8217;agression de tentative 
d&#8217;assassinat et demand&#233; l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te. La Cour n&#8217;aurait ordonn&#233; aucune enqu&#234;te sur 
cet incident; aucun &#233;l&#233;ment de preuve nouveau n&#8217;aurait &#233;t&#233; examin&#233;. La Cour aurait refus&#233; de 
proc&#233;der &#224; une expertise balistique de l&#8217;arme; les pr&#233;venus militaires, principaux pr&#233;venus au 
d&#233;but du proc&#232;s en 1&#232;re instance, seraient absents du proc&#232;s qui n&#8217;aurait jusqu&#8217;&#224; pr&#233;sent jamais 
cherch&#233; &#224; examiner leur r&#244;le dans l&#8217;affaire. L&#8217;un des deux militaires ne se serait jamais pr&#233;sent&#233;, 
mais le second, notifi&#233; en personne, se serait pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; deux audiences, le plus r&#233;cemment en 
date du 9 avril, mais n&#8217;aurait pas &#233;t&#233; entendu. D&#8217;apr&#232;s le Premier Pr&#233;sident de la Cour et le 
charg&#233; des renseignements des FARDC qui aurait comparu, les deux militaires seraient 
actuellement port&#233;s disparus. N&#233;anmoins, la Cour n&#8217;aurait fourni aucun effort pour les 
rechercher et pr&#233;f&#232;rerait visiblement s&#8217;appuyer uniquement sur les diff&#233;rents proc&#232;s verbaux 
d&#8217;auditions &#233;tablis ant&#233;rieurement, faisant ainsi obstacle au r&#233;-examen des multiples 
contradictions constat&#233;es dans leurs d&#233;clarations et relev&#233;es par les avocats de la d&#233;fense. Les 
avocats de la d&#233;fense auraient &#233;t&#233; syst&#233;matiquement interrompus lorsqu&#8217;ils tentent de faire 
allusion aux pr&#233;venus militaires ; le Premier Pr&#233;sident de la Cour et le Minist&#232;re Public aurait 
tenu &#224; plusieurs reprises des propos d&#233;sapprouvant ouvertement la pr&#233;sence et le travail des 
observateurs du proc&#232;s depuis l&#8217;audience du 26 mars 2008. Lors de cette audience, le Minist&#232;re 
Public aurait &#233;t&#233; le plus explicite en indiquant que l&#8217;observation &#8216;subjective&#8217; qui serait men&#233;e 
exposait leurs auteurs &#224; des poursuites pour outrage &#224; la magistrature. Parlant de l&#8217;entrevue d&#8217;un 
membre d&#8217;une ONG observatrice sur RFI, il aurait qualifi&#233; d&#8217;h&#233;r&#233;sies les informations diffus&#233;es. 
De vives craintes furent exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les menaces prof&#233;r&#233;es contre 
Mme Sophie Roudil, Me Jean Bedel, M. Jean-Paul Ngongo, M. Dieudonn&#233; Sango, Me Mulume 
et Me Cubaka soient li&#233;es &#224; leurs activit&#233;s non-violentes de d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme. Des 
craintes furent &#233;galement exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les dysfonctionnements pr&#233;cit&#233;s lors du 
proc&#232;s en appel puissent compromettre le principe du droit &#224; un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable.

<p>103. On 21 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr Mohamed Bayoumi, a lawyer and representative of the Association for Human Rights 
and Legal Aid (AHRLA). He was the defence lawyer of Ms Awleel, a Sudanese refugee who 
was assaulted and raped by two Egyptian police officers. As a result of the court case, one of the 
police officers was sentenced to 25 years in prison. According to the information received, 
Mr Mohamed Bayoumi and members of his family have been harassed and intimidated several 
times over the past two months. In July 2008, the sentenced police officer offered him a bribe of 
50.000 LE in order to drop the charges against him, which Mr Bayoumi refused. On 
2 August 2008, relatives of the sentenced police officer stopped Mr Bayoumi in the street, beat 
his leg and stole his case files on Ms Awleel. On 13 August 2008, his family received a phone 
call claiming that Mr Bayoumi had been shot dead and that his body could be found in the 
morgue. Mr Mohsen, who is Mr Bayoumi&#8217;s partner on the Awleel case, received a similar phone 
call. Concern was expressed with regard to the acts of harassment and intimidation against </p>

<p>104. On 31 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the 
alleged threats against Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd. Mr. Nasser Amine is 
the Director General of the <i>Arab Centre for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal 
Profession (ACIJLP)</i>. Mr. Hammad Wadi Sannd is a lawyer and a researcher with the same 
organization. The ACIJLP is a non-governmental institution that works to reinforce the status of 
justice, the independence of the judiciary and the legal profession, and the respect of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms in the Arab region. In Darfur, Sudan, it works to strengthen the 
implementation of criminal justice and to advocate for the intervention of the <i>International 
Criminal Court (ICC). </i>According to the information received, on 25 October 2008, threats were 
sent by email to the official ACIJLP address by a group which called itself the Middle East 
Mujahedeen in Cairo. The email threatened to kill Mr. Nasser Amine if he, the ACIJLP, or the 
International Criminal Court, continued to intervene in the Darfur crisis. Threats were also made 
against Mr. Hammad Wadi Sannd. Concern was expressed that the threats against 
Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd may be related to their legitimate activities in 
the strengthening of criminal justice in Darfur. Serious concern was expressed for the physical 
and psychological integrity of Messrs. Nasser Amine and Hammad Wadi Sannd.

<p>105. On 20 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment together, regarding the case of 
Mr. Dia&#8217; el Din Gad, an Egyptian citizen and student blogger. According to information 
received, on 6 February 2009, Mr. Dia&#8217; el Din Gad was arrested outside his home in Qotour city, 
near Tanta city (north of Cairo) by State Security Investigations (SSI) officers. Just before his 
arrest, Dia&#8217; el Din Gad had returned to his home in Qotour city. When he left the house, he was 
immediately arrested by SSI officers and allegedly beaten as he was taken away. He was 
reportedly held incommunicado in an unknown location, and his whereabouts have not been 
disclosed by the Egyptian authorities, despite inquiries by his family and his lawyer with the 
Ministry of the Interior and the office of the Public Prosecutor. According to local activists, a 
few days before he was arrested, Dia&#8217; el Din Gad had taken part in demonstrations organized by 
the liberal Wafd opposition party in Cairo in solidarity with the people of Gaza. On his blog 
Dia&#8217; el Din Gad criticized the Egyptian policy regarding Gaza - including the restrictions on 
humanitarian aid delivered through Egypt to Gaza - and regarding the 4 February arrest of 
Ahmed Doma, a leading member of a youth movement, the Popular Movement to Free Egypt. 
Mr. Dia&#8217; el Din Gad reportedly frequently suffered panic attacks which made it difficult for him 
to breathe. He also had difficulty walking or bending one of his legs, due to injuries suffered in 
childhood. He took medication, which he did not have with him when he was arrested. </p>

<p>111. On 14 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
regarding the case of Ms. Birtukan Mideksa, aged 34, and leader of the registered opposition 
party Unity for Democracy and Justice Party. Ms. Birtukan Mideksa was the subject of two 
urgent appeals by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 3 November 2005, and by 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 18 November 2005, respectively. The response of the Government dated 
23 November 2005 was acknowledged. According to new information received, on 
29 December 2008, Ms. Birtukan Mideksa was arrested by several officers of the security forces 
and has since then been detained in solitary confinement at Qaliti prison outside Addis Ababa, in 
a cell measuring 2 m2 which is reported to be often unbearably hot. It was believed that her arrest 
might have been carried out in connection with a trip to Europe in November 2008 during which 
she discussed the terms of her previous release from prison. Ethiopian government media 
reported that she had denied apologizing for the crimes she had allegedly committed and that she 
was given three days to revoke her statement. Shortly afterwards, the Pardons Board decided to 
recant her pardon and to re-impose her original life sentence passed in 2007. Ms. Mideksa, 
together with thousands of individuals including opposition parliamentarians, opposition party 
leaders, journalists and human rights defenders, had been arrested in 2005 following 
demonstrations against the results of elections held in May 2005. In 2006, Ms. Mideksa was 
charged with treason, tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. The majority of those found 
guilty were released in 2007 following pardons after they had negotiated an agreement with the 
Government and signed letters of apology. However the exact terms and conditions of pardon 
remain unclear. Since her arrest Ms. Mideksa had reportedly been allowed one visit from her 
close family but had not been granted access to legal counsel or medical treatment. She had 
refused food to protest against her arrest and detention. During her arrest a person who was with 
her, Professor Mesfin Weldemariam, was severely beaten by one security officer with a rifle 
butt. He sustained injuries to his leg as a result of the assault. In view of the reported conditions 
of detention including solitary confinement, the alleged denial of further family visits and access 
to legal counsel and medical treatment, concern was expressed for Ms. Birtukan Mideksa&#8217;s 
physical and psychological integrity. Further concerns were expressed that her arrest and 
detention might solely be connected to the reportedly peaceful exercise of her rights to freedom 
of opinion and expression, association, assembly, and to take part in the conduct of public 
affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives. </p>

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>112. On 12 February 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 14 January 2009, 
concerning Ms. Birtukan Mideksa. The Govemment of Ethiopia stated that the revocation of the 
pardon granted to Ms. Birtukan Mideksa was carried out in accordance with the law in force on 
the subject. However before going to the legal grounds on revocation of the pardon and the 
compliance of the measures to domestic and international human rights standards, it is necessary 
to discuss on the accuracy of facts alleged on the conditions of Ms. Birtukan&#8217;s detention. The 
facts brought to the special procedures&#8217; attention concerning the arrest and detentions of 
Ms. Birtukan Mideksa were flawed. Ms. Mideksa was arrested and detained according to the law 
with due regard to her rights under the Constitution and international human rights instruments. 
Ms. Mideksa is not subjected to special treatment than other prisoners. Ms. Mideksa has not been 
denied of her right to be visited by her family. Federal Prison Administration reported that since 
her detention, she has maintained contact with her family, in particular with her mother, daughter 
and sister on Saturdays and Sundays. The Government is unaware of Ms. Mideksa&#8217;s refusal of 
food to protest against her detention. In contrast, her family is providing her with varieties of 
meal daily. The Government of Ethiopia is cognizant of the Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers, which provides for an arrested or detained person right to access a lawyer. This 
principle is also reflected in the domestic legal system and is guaranteed for any arrested and 
detained person. Ms. Mideksa is in contact with her lawyer and the allegation that she is denied 
of her right to consult with her lawyer is incorrect. The special procedures have expressed your 
concerns that the situation of Ms. Mideksa detention is detrimental to her physical and 
psychological integrity. The Government respects its obligations to protect the right to physical 
and mental integrity of all persons under Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Accordingly, Ms. Mideksa is being 
treated as any other person under the protection of law with due regard to her physical and 
mental integrity. With regard to the concern that the arrest and detention of Ms. Mideksa is 
solely connected to the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
association, assembly, and to take part in the conduct of public affairs, the Government states 
that the said allegations are not correct. Let me draw your attention to the fact there are many 
groups that are exercising such rights. No one in the country is arrested and detained merely on 
the ground of exercising sacred rights of human beings, among other things, freedom of 
expression, association and assembly. The true facts that cause the revocation of the pardon are 
discussed below. Ms. Birtukan Mideksa and others in the leadership of the former Coalition for 
Unity and Democracy (CUD) party were granted conditional pardon, after submitting a signed 
written petition for pardon, on 19 July 2007 by the President of the Federal Democratic Republic 
of Ethiopia on the basis of the procedure of Pardon Proclamation No. 395/2004. It was 
understood at the outset that the pardon granted would remain valid only as long as they 
conducted themselves in accordance with the conditions of the pardon they freely accepted. Most 
of these beneficiaries of the pardon are carrying out their political and social activities in 
accordance with the laws of the country. However, Ms. Mideksa on different occasions 
misrepresented the circumstances of the pardon by making an open statement to her supporters 
saying &#8220;she did not make any plea for pardon&#8221; and rather the pardon was granted solely through 
the intervention of elders and by the pressure of her supporters. In effect, Ms. Mideksa denied 
her request for pardon to the Ethiopian Government and the people. She violated the very 
premise and basis of the pardon by making it manifest she was not remorseful and did not have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 65 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>regrets about her former illegal acts. Specifically she acted in contravention of the first and 
second conditions of the pardon, namely, acceptance of individual and collective responsibility 
for the destructive acts committed and to refrain from such acts in the future. By denying that she 
ever petitioned the government for pardon Ms. Birtukan has in effect disavowed the first 
condition of the pardon, by which she in effect also disavowed the second condition. As such, 
violation of any of the condition of pardon in the case of conditional pardon inevitably triggers 
the provisions of the pardon proclamation relating to revocation of pardon with all its legal 
consequences. The procedure of the revocation of pardon is as follows: Despite this behavior on 
the part of Ms. Birtukan and in the hope that the statement by Ms. Birtukan could possibly have 
been an honest mistake and could be rectified with out difficulty, the Federal Police discharging 
its responsibility of ensuring compliance with the conditions of pardon and protecting the 
Constitutional order from criminal acts, talked to Ms. Birtukan on more than one occasion about 
her statement with a view to set the record straight. However, after Ms. Birtukan made it clear 
she made no request for pardon, the Federal Police asked her to officially rectify her statement 
within three days failing which appropriate legal action will be taken to revoke the pardon 
granted by the government. The Government informs that this cooperative gesture on the part of 
the federal police did not meet with any positive response from Ms. Birtukan. On the legality of 
the revocation of the pardon: On the basis of the Pardon Proclamation, the Federal Police, having 
observed Ms. Mideksa&#8217;s final statements of refusal to rectify her misrepresentation, requested 
the Board of Pardon for revocation of the pardon. The Board of Pardon, according to the 
Procedure of Pardon Proclamation, has the power to examine such cases and submit 
recommendations of revocation to the President when persons granted conditional pardon by the 
President have allegedly failed to meet such condition or have violated same. The Board, having 
considered the lapse of time given to her to renounce her denial of pardon and having being 
convinced of the existence of sufficient ground for revocation, submitted its recommendation to 
the President of the FDRE for revocation of the pardon. The Government therefore maintains 
that the revocation of the pardon for Ms. Mideksa is fully in line with the procedure provided in 
the Pardon Proclamation. Due to the conditional nature of the pardon, the penalty of life 
imprisonment imposed by the Federal high court was reactivated starting from the day of 
revocation of the pardon. The Govemment reiterates that Ms. Mideksa has not been deprived of 
her liberty arbitrarily. Her case was tried in fair proceedings before an independent and impartial 
court. She was convicted of crimes against the constitutional order and sentenced for life 
imprisonment. After she has requested the Government and the people for pardon, the Board of 
Pardon considered her case and recommended to the President to grant her pardon. But she failed 
to respect the conditions attached to the pardon, which entails its revocation.

&#224; la question de l&#8217;immunit&#233;, le Gouvernement fran&#231;ais faisant r&#233;f&#233;rence au jugement Congo c. 
Belgique de la Cour Internationale de Justice (CIJ). En statuant que M. Yerodia, le Ministre des 
affaires &#233;trang&#232;res &#224; l&#8217;&#233;poque, jouissait de l&#8217;immunit&#233; devant les cours nationales pendant toute 
la dur&#233;e de son mandat, la CIJ soulignait implicitement qu&#8217;il n&#8217;aurait pas joui de cette immunit&#233; 
s&#8217;il n&#8217;avait pas &#233;t&#233; ministre en exercice. De plus, la CIJ a soulign&#233; que cette immunit&#233; p&#233;nale ne 
signifiait pas que des auteurs pr&#233;sum&#233;s de violations graves ou crimes contre l&#8217;humanit&#233; 
pouvaient agir en toute impunit&#233;. La CIJ a aussi remarqu&#233; que, dans tous les cas, des ministres 
peuvent faire l&#8217;objet de proc&#232;s devant des cours p&#233;nales internationales. 
</p><p>115. Dans ce contexte, les Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux ont rappel&#233; l&#8217;article 27 du Statut de Rome de la 
Cour P&#233;nale Internationale, qui stipule que &#171; 1. Le pr&#233;sent Statut s&#8217;applique &#224; tous de mani&#232;re 
&#233;gale, sans aucune distinction fond&#233;e sur la qualit&#233; officielle. En particulier, la qualit&#233; officielle 
de chef d&#8217;&#201;tat ou de gouvernement, de membre d&#8217;un gouvernement ou d&#8217;un parlement, de 
repr&#233;sentant &#233;lu ou d&#8217;agent d&#8217;un &#201;tat, n&#8217;exon&#232;re en aucun cas de la responsabilit&#233; p&#233;nale au 
regard du pr&#233;sent Statut, pas plus qu&#8217;elle ne constitue en tant que telle un motif de r&#233;duction de 
la peine. 2. Les immunit&#233;s ou r&#232;gles de proc&#233;dure sp&#233;ciales qui peuvent s&#8217;attacher &#224; la qualit&#233; 
officielle d&#8217;une personne, en vertu du droit interne ou du droit international, n&#8217;emp&#234;chent pas la 
Cour d&#8217;exercer sa comp&#233;tence &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de cette personne. &#187; Etant donn&#233; le fait que le Statut de 
Rome est un trait&#233; international, tous les Etats-membres, y compris la France, acceptent ce 
principe et renoncent &#224; la possibilit&#233; d&#8217;invoquer l&#8217;immunit&#233;. 
</p>
<p>116. Bien que la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains 
ou d&#233;gradants ne contienne pas de disposition explicite visant exceptions des r&#232;gles relatives &#224; 
l&#8217;immunit&#233;, il est clair que sa lecture doit s&#8217;inspirer d&#8217;autres instruments internationaux, y 
compris le Statut de Rome. De plus, il est difficile d&#8217;imaginer qu&#8217;un instrument comme la 
Convention contre la torture, dont le but est de p&#233;naliser la torture et d&#8217;&#233;tablir la juridiction 
universelle pour &#233;viter que les auteurs des actes de torture &#233;chappent &#224; la justice, soit interpr&#233;t&#233;e 
d&#8217;une fa&#231;on qui conf&#233;rerait des immunit&#233;s importantes aux anciens repr&#233;sentants de l&#8217;Etat, y 
compris pour des actes de torture. Pour les raisons pr&#233;cit&#233;es, les r&#232;gles traditionnelles 
d&#8217;immunit&#233; du droit coutumier doivent &#234;tre interpr&#233;t&#233;es d&#8217;une mani&#232;re tr&#232;s restrictive. 
</p>
<p>117. C&#8217;est cette approche qui a &#233;t&#233; privil&#233;gi&#233;e par la Chambre des Lords britannique quand elle 
a examin&#233;e le cas de Pinochet. La majorit&#233; a d&#233;cid&#233; que l&#8217;ancien chef d&#8217;Etat et S&#233;nateur ne 
b&#233;n&#233;ficiait pas d&#8217;immunit&#233; et pouvait &#234;tre extrad&#233; vers l&#8217;Espagne pour des poursuites li&#233;es aux 
actes de torture commis apr&#232;s l&#8217;entr&#233;e en vigueur de la Convention contre la torture en Espagne, 
au Chili et au Royaume Uni. En consid&#233;rant le troisi&#232;me rapport p&#233;riodique du Royaume Uni 
en 1998, le Comit&#233; contre la torture a confirm&#233; cette interpr&#233;tation en recommandant &#171;que 
l&#8217;affaire du s&#233;nateur chilien Pinochet soit d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;e au parquet en vue de d&#233;terminer si un proc&#232;s 
est r&#233;alisable, et, le cas &#233;ch&#233;ant, que des poursuites criminelles soient engag&#233;es en Angleterre si 
la d&#233;cision de ne pas l&#8217;extrader &#233;tait prise. Ceci serait conforme aux obligations incombant &#224; 
l&#8217;&#201;tat partie en vertu des articles 4 &#224; 7 de la Convention et de l&#8217;article 27 de la Convention de 
Vienne de 1969 sur le droit des trait&#233;s.&#187; Ce m&#234;me Comit&#233;, dans le cas de Habr&#233;, l&#8217;ancien 
dictateur du Tchad, a constat&#233; une violation par le S&#233;n&#233;gal de ses obligations d&#8217;exercer la 
juridiction universelle sous les articles 5 and 7 de la Convention contre la Torture, ce qui signifie 
implicitement qu&#8217;il consid&#232;re qu&#8217;un ancien chef d&#8217;Etat ne jouit pas d&#8217;immunit&#233; diplomatique 
pour des actes de torture. </p>

<p>119. El 27 de mayo de 2008 el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente junto con la 
Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos en relaci&#243;n con 
las amenazas en contra del Sr. Fredy Peccerelli, director de la Fundaci&#243;n de Antropolog&#237;a 
Forense de Guatemala (FAFG)- dedicada a investigaciones forenses y a la exhumaci&#243;n de 
cad&#225;veres de personas enterradas en fosas secretas durante el conflicto interno de Guatemala, la 
Sra. Bianka Monterroso, hermana de Fredy Peccerelli, el Sr. Omar Bertoni Gir&#243;n, coordinador 
de laboratorio de la FAFG y esposo de Bianka Peccerelli Monterroso, el Sr. Gianni Peccerelli, 
hermano de Fredy Peccerelli, el Sr. Jos&#233; Suasnavar, director adjunto de la FAFG, el 
Sr. Leonel Paiz, jefe del departamento de arqueolog&#237;a de la FAFG, y del Sr. Eduardo Cojul&#250;n, 
Juez Und&#233;cimo de Instancia Penal. El Sr. Peccerelli y la FAFG ya hab&#237;an sido objeto de varias 
comunicaciones enviadas el 27 de julio del 2002, 19 de agosto del 2003, 16 de septiembre del 
2005 y el 21 de marzo del 2006 por la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de 
derechos humanos. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 19 de mayo se habr&#237;a enviado al 
Sr. Fredy Peccerelli un mensaje de correo electr&#243;nico que conten&#237;a amenazas de muerte contra 
de &#233;l, su hermana y los cuatro miembros de la FAFG arriba mencionados, con el siguiente texto: 
&#8220;Bueno malditos les ha llegado el d&#237;a. Est&#225;n vigilados y los mataremos. Freddy te vamos a 
quebrar el culo, a Omar lo tenemos vigilado en la Universidad de ni mierda le servir&#225; su titulo, 
su felicidad de padre poco le durara, a su mujer la vamos a violar y la enviaremos en pedazos a la 
FAFG. Malditos revolucionarios. Su seguridad a la mierda, todos est&#225;n vigilados Freddy pronto 
te llegara tu d&#237;a y a los dem&#225;s miembros de la Instituci&#243;n les tocara despu&#233;s, nunca llegaras a 
declarar maldito hijo de puta. La lista es larga pero mataremos a todos tu familia ser&#225; la primera 
Freddy maldito&#8221;. Se teme que esta amenaza est&#233; relacionada con las declaraciones recientemente 
prestadas ante el Juez Eduardo Cojul&#250;n por unos testigos del genocidio guatemalteco de la 
d&#233;cada de 1980. El tribunal presidido por el Juez Cojul&#250;n actuar&#237;a en nombre de los tribunales 
espa&#241;oles como parte de una causa por genocidio que se sigue actualmente en Espa&#241;a contra ex 
altos mandos de la junta militar guatemalteca de principios de los a&#241;os ochenta. La relaci&#243;n entre 
las investigaciones llevadas a cabo por el juez Cojul&#250;n y el trabajo de exhumaci&#243;n de la FAFG se 
hizo p&#250;blica, a trav&#233;s de un art&#237;culo period&#237;stico. A su vez, el 20 de mayo, el juez Eduardo 
Cojul&#250;n habr&#237;a declarado p&#250;blicamente que el fin de semana del 17 y 18 de mayo hab&#237;a recibido 
amenazas telef&#243;nicas por su papel en esas vistas. Se teme que las amenazas en contra de los 
integrantes de la FAFG y del juez Cojul&#250;n est&#233;n relacionadas con su trabajo de investigaci&#243;n de 
los cr&#237;menes del pasado. Los expertos tambi&#233;n expresaron preocupaci&#243;n por que los integrantes </p>

insuficiente.

Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n y la Relatora 
Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, con relaci&#243;n a la 
situaci&#243;n del Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n, quien desde el mes de mayo de 2008, ha trabajado con 
una comisi&#243;n rogatoria organizada por la Audiencia Nacional Espa&#241;ola. El tribunal por &#233;l 
presidido actuar&#237;a en nombre de los tribunales espa&#241;oles como parte de una causa por genocidio 
que se sigue actualmente en Espa&#241;a contra ex altos mandos de la junta militar guatemalteca de 
principios de los a&#241;os ochenta. La comisi&#243;n rogatoria estar&#237;a investigando denuncias de 
presuntos cr&#237;menes - muchos de ellos en contra de la etnia maya - de genocidio, torturas, 
asesinatos y detenciones ilegales durante el conflicto armado interno de Guatemala. La situaci&#243;n 
del Juez Cojul&#250;n y las amenazas en su contra ya hab&#237;an sido objeto de un llamamiento urgente 
enviado el 27 de mayo de 2008. No obstante, y de acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recientemente 
recibida, el 12 de junio de 2008 le habr&#237;an retirado los dos escoltas al Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo 
Cojul&#250;n, sin reemplazarlos. La explicaci&#243;n oficial que se habr&#237;a dado ser&#237;a que los escoltas 
necesitaban vacaciones. Adem&#225;s, la Polic&#237;a Civil Nacional (PCN) habr&#237;a dicho que no hab&#237;a 
ning&#250;n guardia, ni veh&#237;culo civil disponible cuando los solicit&#243; por tel&#233;fono el mismo d&#237;a. Los 
expertos manifestaron su preocupaci&#243;n respecto de la decisi&#243;n de retirar los escoltas del 
Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n a pesar de las amenazas en su contra. Asimismo, expresaron su 
preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n. 
</p><p>121. El 19 de agosto de 2008 el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente junto con el 
Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de 
los ind&#237;genas y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos 
para se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de Guatemala la informaci&#243;n que recibida en 
relaci&#243;n con el Sr. Amilcar Pop y la Asociaci&#243;n de Abogados y Notarios Mayas de Guatemala 
(AANMG). El Sr. Amilcar Pop es abogado y presidente de la AANMG, organizaci&#243;n que 
proporciona asistencia legal a comunidades ind&#237;genas de Guatemala, en particular en asuntos 
relacionados con los recursos naturales de las comunidades. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, 
el 2 de agosto de 2008, poco despu&#233;s de medianoche, el Sr. Amilcar Pop fue perseguido y 
amenazado con un arma de fuego, por los pasajeros de una pick-up blanca doble cabina con 
vidrios polarizados y sin placas, quienes llevaban m&#225;scaras que hac&#237;an imposible su 
identificaci&#243;n. Los individuos lo habr&#237;an amenazado de muerte. El Sr. Amilcar Pop, quien logr&#243; 
escapar, habr&#237;a resultado lesionado en la lengua, motivo por el cual se dirigi&#243; a un hospital. Una 
vez en el hospital, descubri&#243; que la pick-up se encontraba estacionada detr&#225;s de su coche. Sin 
embargo, cuando sali&#243;, aproximadamente a las 6 a.m., ya no estaba all&#237;. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, a 
lo largo de los a&#241;os 2007 y 2008, los integrantes de AANMG habr&#237;an recibido varias amenazas 
de muerte, tanto por tel&#233;fono, como por correo, para que dejaran de proporcionar asistencia legal 
a las comunidades de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez en la defensa de sus recursos naturales y en contra 
de la empresa Cementos Progresos SA. Asimismo, la AANMG habr&#237;a sido objeto de varias 
denuncias ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico por parte del Consejo Municipal por intimidaci&#243;n, 
amenazas y coacci&#243;n. Se alega que dichas denuncias no est&#225;n sustentadas en ninguna evidencia. 
Asimismo, se informa que la AANMG habr&#237;a sido falsamente acusada de ser responsable del 
asesinato del Sr. Francisco Tepeu Piri, un habitante del Municipio de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez, 
quien muri&#243; despu&#233;s de una protesta contra Cementos Progresos SA, la cual tuvo lugar el </p>

<p>21 de junio de 2008. El Relator Especial expres&#243; su temor de que las amenazas y acusaciones en 
contra del Sr. Amilcar Pop y de otros miembros de la AANMG, as&#237; como la persecuci&#243;n de este 
&#250;ltimo, podr&#237;an estar directamente relacionadas con sus actividades leg&#237;timas de defensa de los 
derechos de las comunidades ind&#237;genas de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez. 
</p>
<p><b>Comunicaciones recibidas 
</b></p>
<p>122. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 20 de agosto de 2008, el Gobierno de Guatemala proporcion&#243; 
informaci&#243;n con respecto al llamamiento urgente enviado el 4 de julio de 2008. El Gobierno 
inform&#243; que al respecto no hay ninguna denuncia presentada ante los tribunales. En ese sentido 
informa que un funcionario de la Fiscal&#237;a de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico se 
aperson&#243; ante el Juez Jos&#233; Eduardo Cojul&#250;n, quien manifest&#243; que no iba a brindar informaci&#243;n 
sobre la situaci&#243;n y que no deseaba presentar una denuncia. Asimismo, inform&#243; que el 
Juez Cojul&#250;n se neg&#243; a aceptar el servicio de seguridad personalizada del agente de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional Civil, Sr. Canahui, en reemplazo del agente Aceytuno, alegando que prefer&#237;a esperar 
que regresara de vacaciones el agente Aceytuno. A ra&#237;z de ello, el Oficial III de la PNC, 
Salvador Donis Delgado, le solicit&#243; que le diera una nota en la que explicara el porqu&#233; prescind&#237;a 
del agente Canahui, pero en forma cortante el Juez Cojul&#250;n le dijo que no le daba nada por 
escrito. Seg&#250;n informaci&#243;n proporcionada por la Subdirecci&#243;n de Unidades Especialistas de la 
PNC, el Juez Cojul&#250;n goza de seguridad personalizada desde el mes de enero de 2006 hasta la 
fecha, por orden del entonces Director General de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil. Por lo tanto el 
Estado no ha retirado los escoltas del Juez Cojul&#250;n, quien a&#250;n sigue contando con seguridad 
proporcionada por el Estado. 
</p>
<p>123. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n del 20 de marzo de 2009 el Gobierno brind&#243; informaci&#243;n con 
relaci&#243;n al llamamiento urgente enviado el 19 de agosto de 2008. Al respecto el Gobierno 
inform&#243; que la Comisi&#243;n Presidencial Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en Materia de 
Derechos Humanos (COPREDEH) est&#225; en conocimiento de los hechos a los que se refieren las 
alegaciones presentadas. Tambi&#233;n inform&#243; que el Licenciado Amilcar Pop interpuso una 
denuncia por amenazas e intimidaciones ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico en Agosto de 2008, que a&#250;n 
se encuentra en investigaci&#243;n. Asimismo, se informa que a la fecha de la comunicaci&#243;n enviada 
por el Gobierno, el Sistema Interamericano no hab&#237;a adoptado medidas cautelares en favor del 
Licenciado Amilcar Pop.

<p><b>Comentarios y observaciones del Relator Especial 
</b></p>
<p>124. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Guatemala su grata cooperaci&#243;n y aprecia que 
el mismo haya tenido a bien enviarle informaci&#243;n en respuesta al llamamiento enviado el 
4 de julio de 2008. Sin embargo, el Relator expresa preocupaci&#243;n por no haber recibido respuesta 
alguna del Gobierno de Guatemala con relaci&#243;n a las comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 27 de mayo 
de 2008 y le pide encarecidamente tenga a bien enviarle a la brevedad posible, y preferentemente 
antes de la clausura del und&#233;cimo per&#237;odo de sesiones del Consejo de Derechos Humanos, 
informaciones precisas y detalladas acerca de la alegaci&#243;n arriba resumida. En efecto, el Relator 
Especial nota con inquietud las frecuentes amenazas e intimidaciones a los miembros de la 
Fundaci&#243;n de Antropolog&#237;a Forense de Guatemala (FAFG) y teme que las mismas est&#233;n 
relacionadas con su trabajo de investigaci&#243;n de los cr&#237;menes del pasado. En tal sentido, el 
Relator recomienda al Gobierno la ratificaci&#243;n del Estatuto de Roma y de la Convenci&#243;n </p>

</p>
<p>125. En lo que respecta a la comunicaci&#243;n de 19 de Agosto de 2008, El Relator Especial 
tambi&#233;n agradece la respuesta dada por el Gobierno. Si embargo, solicita al Gobierno que lo 
tenga al tanto de los resultados de las investigaciones que est&#225;n siendo llevadas a cabo con base 
en la denuncia interpuesta por el Sr. Amilcar Pop ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico en Agosto de 2008. 
Asimismo, hace un llamado al Gobierno para que adopte las medidas necesarias para proteger al 
abogado Amilcar Pop, de manera urgente. Asimismo, solicita al Gobierno que se le mantenga 
informado sobre la ejecuci&#243;n de las mismas. 
<b>Comunicado de prensa 
</b></p>
<p>126. El 30 de enero de 2009, en la ciudad de Guatemala, el Relator Especial emiti&#243; el siguiente 
comunicado de prensa, el cual contiene sus observaciones preliminares sobre la situaci&#243;n del 
sistema de justicia en Guatemala, despu&#233;s de su visita al pa&#237;s: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;El Relator Especial de las Naciones Unidas sobre la independencia de los magistrados y 
abogados, Sr. Leandro Despouy, visit&#243; Guatemala a invitaci&#243;n del Gobierno, del 26 al 
30 de enero de 2009. Visit&#243; la capital, Guatemala y la ciudad de Quetzaltenango. El 
Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Guatemala por la invitaci&#243;n y la plena 
colaboraci&#243;n prestada durante su visita, la cual fue realizada con toda libertad. Asimismo, 
agradece al Sistema de las Naciones Unidas en Guatemala, en especial a la Oficina del 
Alto Comisionado para los Derechos Humanos, por el excelente apoyo prestado en la 
organizaci&#243;n de su visita. Asimismo, el Relator agradece a la prensa y los medios de 
comunicaci&#243;n por el seguimiento dado a la misma. 
</p>
<p>Durante su visita el Relator Especial se reuni&#243; con altas autoridades del Gobierno y del 
Organismo Judicial. Tuvo la oportunidad de reunirse, entre otros, con el Canciller, el 
Ministro de Defensa, los magistrados de la Corte de Constitucionalidad, el Presidente en 
funciones de la Corte Suprema de Justicia, el Procurador de los Derechos Humanos, el 
Fiscal General, la Directora del Instituto de la Defensa P&#250;blica Penal, la Comisi&#243;n 
Presidencial contra la Discriminaci&#243;n y el Racismo (CODISRA), la Defensor&#237;a de la Mujer 
Ind&#237;gena (DEMI) y la Directora de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil. El Relator Especial tambi&#233;n 
se reuni&#243; con la Comisi&#243;n Internacional contra la Impunidad en Guatemala (CICIG), 
jueces, fiscales y abogados, as&#237; como con numerosas organizaciones de la sociedad civil, 
incluyendo representantes de organizaciones de derechos humanos, de movimientos 
ind&#237;genas y de mujeres. Finalmente, el Relator Especial tuvo reuniones con representantes 
de las embajadas acreditadas, de las agencias de cooperaci&#243;n internacional y del sector 
acad&#233;mico. 
</p>
<p>En su calidad de experto independiente de las Naciones Unidas, el Relator Especial 
presentar&#225; un informe sobre su visita a Guatemala ante el Consejo de Derechos Humanos 
en los pr&#243;ximos meses. Asimismo, presentar&#225; un informe a la Asamblea General a finales 
del a&#241;o 2009. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 71 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Siguiendo la pr&#225;ctica habitual, el Relator Especial ha querido reunirse con la prensa al final 
de su visita, con el fin de hacer p&#250;blicas sus primeras impresiones, as&#237; como algunas 
recomendaciones preliminares, sin perjuicio de las que presentar&#225; una vez finalizado el 
informe. 
</p>
<p>Entre las cuestiones m&#225;s relevantes, el Relator se permite adelantar las siguientes 
observaciones: 
</p>
<p>Todos los interlocutores del Relator coinciden en que existe un clima de impunidad 
generalizado en Guatemala, con notorias deficiencias del sistema de justicia, provenientes 
principalmente de factores estructurales y de la presi&#243;n ejercida sobre los operadores de 
justicia. El Relator detallar&#225; cada uno de estos elementos en su informe, pero por el 
momento s&#243;lo enunciar&#225; los m&#225;s preocupantes. 
</p>
<p>El Relator quisiera hacer referencia a la ausencia de pol&#237;ticas p&#250;blicas en materia de 
prevenci&#243;n del crimen, as&#237; como la falta de una pol&#237;tica criminal y criminol&#243;gica del 
Estado. En general, en otros pa&#237;ses dichas funciones est&#225;n bajo la responsabilidad del 
poder Ejecutivo, a trav&#233;s de un Ministerio de Justicia. 
De otra parte, el Relator ha constatado que existe una concentraci&#243;n de funciones en 
cabeza de la Corte Suprema de Justicia que junto con otros factores de notoriedad p&#250;blica 
ha desembocado en la crisis actual. En efecto, la Corte est&#225; a cargo de un sinn&#250;mero de 
funciones administrativas que han dificultado su funci&#243;n espec&#237;fica de impartir justicia. 
En cuanto a la investigaci&#243;n criminal, el Relator ha constatado que adolece de varias 
deficiencias, derivadas principalmente de la falta de personal y de instrumentos adecuados, 
tanto dentro del Ministerio P&#250;blico, como dentro de la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil, que en tanto 
auxiliar de justicia no cuenta con los instrumentos t&#233;cnicos y cient&#237;ficos que le permitan 
llevar a cabo una eficiente investigaci&#243;n criminal, as&#237; como una ausencia de articulaci&#243;n 
institucional. 
</p>
<p>El Relator tambi&#233;n considera que el hecho de que los jueces est&#233;n supeditados a un 
mandato de cinco a&#241;os debilita el poder judicial, afecta su independencia y su desarrollo 
profesional. El Relator considera que reformas de tipo legislativo podr&#237;an solucionar este 
problema en la medida en que se centren en la construcci&#243;n de una verdadera carrera 
judicial. 
El Relator nota con preocupaci&#243;n que el Congreso de la Rep&#250;blica no ha aprobado a&#250;n 
leyes que son imprescindibles para fortalecer el sistema de justicia y la seguridad 
ciudadana. Resulta inadmisible que la ley de armas y municiones no haya sido a&#250;n 
aprobada por el Congreso. 
</p>
<p>El pa&#237;s mantiene varias asignaturas pendientes, sobretodo en cuanto a su naturaleza 
pluricultural, multi&#233;tnica y multiling&#252;&#237;stica. El Relator pudo constatar que a&#250;n existen 
graves obst&#225;culos en el acceso a la justicia, en especial de los sectores pobres de la 
poblaci&#243;n y de las comunidades ind&#237;genas. El Gobierno no ha adoptado las medidas 
necesarias para solucionar este problema. La ni&#241;ez, la adolescencia y las mujeres forman </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 72 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>parte de los sectores m&#225;s afectados. De los 591 ni&#241;os muertos en el a&#241;o 2008, el 80% son 
v&#237;ctimas de muerte con arma de fuego. El femicidio se ha incrementado, 722 mujeres 
fueron asesinadas en el 2008. 
</p>
<p>A ello se suman otros indicadores sumamente inquietantes: de cada 100 homicidios, s&#243;lo 
2 son juzgados y de cada 100 delitos, s&#243;lo 4 son juzgados. Adem&#225;s, la amenaza de la 
penetraci&#243;n del narcotr&#225;fico y el crimen organizado puede plantear una situaci&#243;n 
irreversible. Es necesaria la reconducci&#243;n de la actividad del Estado frente a la justicia, la 
impunidad y la reparaci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas. A este respecto el Relator considera prioritario: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; La creaci&#243;n de un Ministerio de Justicia que tome a su cargo las funciones cl&#225;sicas de 
definici&#243;n de las pol&#237;ticas p&#250;blicas en materia de justicia, en especial la pol&#237;tica criminal 
y dem&#225;s funciones que en el momento se encuentran dispersas en la cabeza de 
diferentes instituciones. En este punto, el Relator considera indispensable y urgente la 
creaci&#243;n de un sistema coherente de protecci&#243;n de operadores de justicia, testigos y 
v&#237;ctimas. El Relator considera que har&#237;a falta que la protecci&#243;n estatal de dichas 
personas se brinde de manera unificada.

violencia y el creciente uso de armas de fuego y el consumo de municiones en el

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>127. On 16 Septembre 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, regarding the case of Ranvanlee Chan, aged 10; Patrick Sumner, Victor Jones and 
David Leander; Damyoun Wordsworth, aged 19. Ranvanlee Chan was arrested on 
1 January 2008 after being accused of having stolen 6,000 Guyanese dollars from a neighbour 
and taken to the Sisters Police Station in East Bank Berbice, where police officers beat him, 
flogged him with a belt, a broom and a tamarind whip and made him kneel half-naked and forced 
to lift a stack of heavy books over his head. Ranvanlee Chan was held in custody for two days 
and hospitalized on the third day. He remained under police guard while in the hospital. 
Patrick Sumner and Victor Jones were arrested by GPF and GDF officers in early 
September 2007 in connection with the 2006 murder of the Minister of Agriculture 
Satyadeow Sawh, Sawh&#8217;s siblings and bodyguard. Mr. Sumner and Mr. Jones were taken to an 
unidentified military camp on the Linden-Soesdyke Highway and subjected to beatings. They 
had their feet bound, eyes blindfolded, and were thrown in a pool of water by members of the 
security service. At some point policemen threw gunpowder and a corrosive liquid on the 
detainees. They were released after three days and never charged for the crimes for lack of 
evidence. Damyoun Wordsworth was approached by two policemen who took him to Blairmont 
police station on 15 September 2007. The two men were dressed in civilian clothing and did not 
identify themselves. Whilst at the police station, he was questioned over a theft. At all times, 
Mr Wordsworth denied this allegation. Whilst at the police station, he was suffocated with a 
plastic bag, which was placed over his head, on numerous occasions. He was hit with a lemonade 
bottle on his left hand and was handcuffed. A gun was held over his mouth and he was lashed 
with the gun across his left forehead. This led to bleeding on his forehead. He was taken to Fort 
Wellington Hospital, where he was provided with medication. However, once he returned to 
police custody, he did not receive any medicine. He was released on 17 September 2008 without 
having been charged with any criminal offences. The Special Rapporteurs also referred to their 
communication of 12 February 2008 to the Government, relating to the cases of Alvin Wilson 
and Michael Dunn, to which they have regrettably not received any response. The Special 
Rapporteurs re-iterated their earlier request for information on the progress of the investigations 
and on whether the alleged perpetrators have been brought to justice. 
<b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>128. On 31 December 2008, the Government replies to the letter of 16 September 2008, stating 
that any victim and/or his/her relatives under the circumstances alleged may approach any or all 
of the following entities to report, investigate and seek redress: 1) the Police Service 
Commission in relation to the Guyana Police Force (a constitutional body established by a 
parliamentary consensual mechanism); 2) the Police Complaints Authority (established through 
the Police Complaints Authority Act, Cap. 17:02, Laws of Guyana with the specific permit to 
investigating allegations of human rights abuses and infringements of police codes. On average 
the Police Complaints Authority receives 330 complaints per year. The year of its highest reports 
was in 1989 with over 500. The Government has provided the Committee against Torture with 
copies of the annual reports of the PCA for the years 2002-2007); 3) the Office of Professional 
Responsibility, Guyana Police Force (established as part of the Police reform in 2000); 4) the </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Heads of the Disciplined Forces, i.e. the Guyana Defence Force, the Guyana Police Force, the 
Guyana Service and the Guyana Fire Service who would establish Boards of Inquiries whenever 
required; 5) the Parliament, through the relevant Oversight Committee or individual Member of 
Parliament to raise the issue publicly in the House; 6) the Judiciary. The Government advised 
further that the relevant agencies have conducted inquiries concerning this matter and 
determined that no reports of allegations of torture or abuse of human rights were made to any of 
the designated complaints agencies by any of the persons listed in the letter: Ranvalee Chan, 
Patrick Sumner, Victor Jones and David Leander, Damyoun Wordsworth. The Government is 
therefore not in a position to verify or otherwise comment on the accuracy of the allegations 
made. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations

<p>129. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Guyana for its reply 
dated 31 December 2008. With regard to the seriousness of the allegations described above, the 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to pursue its efforts to provide detailed substantive 
information on the above-mentioned cases.

<p>130. On 16 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with 
Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders pursuant, regarding the case 
Dr Binayak Sen, medical doctor and General Secretary of the People&#8217;s Union for Civil Liberties 
(PUCL), Chhattisgarh, and Vice-President of PUCL National. Dr Sen had been the subject of a 
letter of allegation sent by the Special Representative on the situation of human rights defenders 
to the Government on 1 June 2007, to which no reply had been received. According to 
information received, on 15 March 2008, Dr Binayak Sen, who had been in detention at the 
Raipur Central Prison since May 2007, was placed under solitary confinement at the Raipur 
Central Jail, in Chhattisgarh. It was not known why the conditions of Dr Sen&#8217;s detention have 
changed and he had not had any access to legal representation since being placed in solitary 
confinement. Dr Sen had been detained since 14 May 2007 under the Chhattisgarh Special 
Public Security Act 2006 (CSPSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 2004, due to 
alleged links with the Naxalite Maoist guerrilla. It was not known whether any charges had been 
brought against Dr Sen since his detention. Concern was expressed that the reported continued 
detention and the placement under solitary confinement of Dr Binayak Sen may be directly 
related to his activities in defense of human rights, particularly his advocacy of the rights of 
adivasi communities in his capacity as a leader of the People&#8217;s Union for Civil Liberties. In light 
of reports of Dr Sen&#8217;s detention in solitary confinement, further concern was expressed for his 
physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>131. On 8 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the case of 
Dr Andana Chatterji convener of the International People&#8217;s Tribunal on Human Rights and 
Justice in Indian-administered Kashmir and Mr Parvez Imroz, lawyer and also convener of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>tribunal, who have been subjected to intimidation and harassment. The civil society established 
tribunal, which began on 5 April 2008, was created in order to investigate allegations of 
systematic violence and human rights violations in Indian-administered Kashmir. Mr Imroz was 
previously the subject of urgent appeals sent by the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human-rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers on 1 May and 14 September 2006, of an urgent appeal sent 
by the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders on 11 May 2005, and of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture on 5 October 2004. According to information received, on 
21 June 2008, Dr Andana Chatterji was followed from her hotel to the office of the tribunal by 
eight members of the intelligence service, who remained outside the office throughout the day 
and questioned anybody entering or leaving the building. The previous day, 20 June, 
Dr Andana Chatterji and Mr Parvez Imroz had been visiting mass graves in Indian-administered 
Kashmir and in the course of the day had been questioned by twelve intelligence personnel from 
Special Branch Kashmir (SBK) and Counter Intelligence Kashmir (CIK) regarding their 
activities, the villages they had visited and whether they had taken photographic or video 
evidence of what they had observed. After being questioned, they were followed and their 
vehicle was forcibly boarded in Shangargund, Sopore by members of intelligence personnel who 
did not show identification. They were then briefly detained at a police station where officers 
confiscated their tapes, claiming they contained objectionable and dangerous material and from 
where they were followed once again. Dr Andana Chatterji has previously been subject to 
harassment and intimidation. In April 2008, after announcing the formation of the tribunal, she 
was stopped and intimidated at immigration control when leaving India for the USA, where she 
is resident. In June 2008, when she was returning to India, she was subjected to similar 
treatment. Concern was expressed that the intimidation and questioning of Dr Andana Chatterji 
and Mr Parvez Imroz may be directly related to their activities in defense of human rights, in 
particular in their role in the civil society established International People&#8217;s Tribunal on Human 
Rights and Justice in Indian-administered Kashmir. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of both individuals. Finally, concern was expressed that the 
incidents outlined may represent an attempt to restrict the work of the individuals, including as a 
lawyer, in addressing human rights violations in the region. 
</p>
<p>132. On 7 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the case of Mr. Kirity Roy, lawyer and Secretary of Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha 
(MASUM) and State Director of the National Project on Preventing Torture in India (NPPTI). 
MASUM is a human rights non-governmental organization based in Kolkata, West Bengal. On 
9 and 10 June 2008, in Molali, Kolkata, MASUM coordinated the People&#8217;s Tribunal on Torture 
(PTT), an initiative which works within the framework of the NPPTI and aims to bring about 
justice in cases of police torture. Mr. Kirity Roy was the subject of communications sent by 
mandate holders on 14 December 2005, 25 January 2006, 9 January 2007 and 18 June 2008. The 
PTT was the subject of a communication sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression on 10 June 2008. No responses to any of these </p>

<p>communications had been received from the Government. According to new information 
received, on 18 September 2008, a complaint was filed by MASUM (Writ Petition 25022 
(W)/2008 Kirity Roy vs State of West Bengal and others) before the Honorable High Court, 
Kolkata, regarding the alleged raid on their offices on 12 June 2008. On 27 September 2008, at 
approximately 4.00 p.m., a group of Kolkata Police agents whose identities were known entered 
the offices of MASUM to search for Mr. Kirity Roy who was not there at the time. They then 
requested three documents relating to three alleged victims of police torture who had sworn 
affidavits for the PTT. Concern was expressed that the harassment of Mr. Kirity Roy and 
MASUM may be related to their legitimate activities in the defense of victims of police torture. 
Further concern was expressed that the incident described above may form part of an ongoing 
trend of harassment against human rights defenders involved in the investigation of police torture 
in India.

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>133. By letter dated 26 February 2009 (received by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on 19 March 2009) the Government if India replied to the joint allegation letter of 
8 July 2008. The Government rejects the allegations raised in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication. The Government informed that, owing to the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is a 
sensitive border State of India that has been victim of cross-border terrorism for nearly two 
decades, any person venturing near the Line of Control without informing the authorities is liable 
to be questioned and asked to prove credentials by the law enforcing agencies. Since 
Dr. Chatterji and Advocate Parvez Imroz had been frequently visiting areas falling close to the 
Line of Control without informing the authorities, they may have been stopped by law enforcing 
agencies to ascertaining the purpose of their visit close to the line of Control. The Government 
argues that such actions are necessary to maintain public order in a terrorism-prone area and 
cannot be termed as harassment/intimidation. It may also be noted that a vigil over the 
movement of foreigners in such a sensitive State is for their own safety as well as to prevent 
activities by them that might cause public disorder.

Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the following 
case, which was noted in the report by the Special Rapporteur on Torture to the Human Rights 
Council on his visit to Indonesia (A/HRC/7/3/Add.7, Appendix I, para. 75). On 18 October 2007, 
Sabar Olif Iwanggin, assistant lawyer and human rights activist, was arrested in Jayapura by the 
Anti-Terror Special Force Unit of the National Police (Mabes Polri). Afterwards, he was 
transferred to Mabes Polri in Jakarta where he was held for interrogation until 1 November 2007. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Subsequently he was brought back to Polda Papua. Sabar Olif Iwanggin was accused of 
forwarding a short-message-service (sms) to his family and his friends defaming the Indonesian 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Sabar Olif Iwanggin was being tried since 
7 January 2008 before the State Court of Jayapura. He was charged for insulting the President, 
based on articles 134 and 160 of the Indonesian Criminal Code. According to article 134, 
deliberate insult against the President shall be punished by a maximum prison sentence of six 
years. Article 160 stipulates that any person who incites in public to commit a punishable act, a 
violent action against the public authority or any other disobedience shall be punished by a 
maximum prison sentence of six years or a maximum fine of three hundred rupiahs. According 
to the information received, Sabar Olif Iwanggin&#8217;s trial has violated due process guarantees, as 
stipulated by Indonesia&#8217;s Criminal Procedure Code and international human rights standards. It 
was alleged that Sabar Olif Iwanggin was arrested without an arrest warrant and that he was not 
accompanied by his lawyer during part of the interrogation. Moreover, he would have confessed 
to committing the offense as a result of psychological pressure exerted by police officers. It was 
also alleged that the prosecution presented nine witnesses of whom none was able to testify 
against Sabar Olif Iwanggin, which led the prosecution to ask for further witness examination, 
even though both the examination of the witnesses as well as the examination of the defendant 
had been closed. This would have breached the Indonesian Criminal Procedural Code 
(article 182). Furthermore, it was alleged that although the prosecution did not prove that the sms 
of Sabar Olif Iwanggin led to anarchic actions in the districts of Yahukimo and Boven Digul 
where several stores were destroyed and burned down in September 2007, Sabar Olif Iwanggin 
was charged with violating article 160 of the Penal Code. Finally, the judges allegedly shouted 
and blamed the accused during the trial.

regarding the case of Behrooz Karimizadeh, Peyman Piran, Ali Kantouri and Majid Pourmajid, 
four students and members of the organisation &#8220;<i>Students Seeking Freedom and Equality</i>&#8221;. 
According to information received, three of the four students were arrested in December 2007, 
apparently to prevent demonstrations to commemorate the &#8220;Students Day&#8221; on 7 December 2007. </p>

house of a friend in Tehran; Peyman Piran was arrested on 4 December 2007 by plainclothes 
agents from the Ministry of Information as he was leaving Tehran University campus following 
a peaceful demonstration; and Ali Kantouri was arrested approximately two weeks later in the 
town of Ghazvin. Behrooz Karimizadeh and Peyman Piran were being detained in Units 209 and 
305 in Evin prison in Tehran, and Ali Kantouri was detained in Ghezel Hesare near Tehran. Bail 
was refused for Mr. Kantouri, and prohibitively high bail was set for Mr. Piran and Karimizadeh. 
Majid Pourmajid was arrested on 29 March 2008 in Tabriz; he was hospitalized three days after 
his arrest and transferred two days later from the hospital to an undisclosed location by the 
authorities. Since then his whereabouts were not known. The four students were accused of 
taking part in &#8220;armed activities&#8221; and &#8220;forming groups against the State&#8221;. Their lawyers did not 
have access to their clients or their files. The detained students were reportedly being subjected 
to long periods of solitary confinement and physical and psychological ill-treatment. 
Approximately 40 students had been arrested since December 2007, and all except these four 
were later released, some of them alleging that they were ill-treated during their detention. 
Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Behrooz Karimizadeh, Peyman Piran, 
Ali Kantouri, and Majid Pourmajid may be linked to their non-violent activities in defense of 
human rights, in particular in the exercise of their right to freedom of expression and assembly.

Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar, a Kurdish journalist and environmentalist, by Branch 
No. 1 of the Revolutionary Court in Marivan City in the Province of Kordestan. An urgent

23 December 2006 and 25 January 2007 respectively, and reportedly held incommunicado in the 
Ministry of Intelligence facility in Marivan until 26 March 2007, when they were transferred to 
Marivan prison. They were tried on 12 June 2007 on charges of espionage and crime of 
&#8220;Moharebeh&#8221; (enemy of God) and sentenced to death on 17 July, although information received 
indicated that the charges were not supported by evidence. They appealed the sentence, and on 
23 October 2007 the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence against Adnan Hassanpour, while 
it overturned the sentence against Hiwa Butimar for procedural irregularities and sent it back to 
the Marivan Revolutionary Court for re-examination. According to information received,

Ms Nasim Khosravi were the subjects of a joint urgent appeal sent by the same mandate-holders 
on 22 February 2008. No response to either correspondence had been received from the 
Government. According to information received, on 4 July 2008 Ms Hana Abdi began a 
five-year prison sentence. Her detention started on 4 November 2007, when her computer and 
pamphlets relating to the One Million Signatures Campaign were also confiscated. The sentence 
was passed on 18 June 2008 for &#8220;gathering and collusion to threaten national security&#8221; under 
Article 610 of the Islamic Penal Code. The sentence was reportedly based on interrogations 
carried out whilst Ms Hana Abdi was in isolated detention and was not allowed access to her 
lawyer. During her detention she was reportedly tortured. An appeal against her sentence was 
filed by her lawyer. The appeals court had not issued a decision in relation to the appeal at the 
time of writing of the letter. On 20 July 2008, Ms Raheleh Asgarizadeh and Ms Nasim Khosravi 
appeared in court. They were arrested on 14 February 2008 while collecting signatures as part of 
the One Million Signatures Campaign. The following day they were charged with &#8220;propaganda 
against the state&#8221; and transferred to Evin prison. The Special Rapporteurs were concerned that 
the prison sentence of Ms Hana Abdi and the trial of Ms Raheleh Asgarizadeh and 
Ms Nasim Khosravi may be related to their work in the defense of human rights, in particular 
their work to defend the rights of women in Iran. They were also concerned by the allegations of 
ongoing harassment of women human rights defenders involved in the One Million Signatures 
Campaign in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>140. On 31 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of 
Mr. Qulamriza Nejefi, aged 36; Mr. Hemid Valai, aged 27, a university graduate of law and an 
associate of the Association of Southern Azerbaijani Academics; Mr. Vedud Esedi, aged 28, a 
student reading geology at the Open University in Rasht, former student in the Open University 
in Ardebil, former Secretary-General of the Islamic Student Society and Director of the students&#8217; 
publication &#8220;Seher&#8221;; Mr. Sejjad Radmehr, aged 26, student of mechanical engineering; 
Mr. Aydin Khajei, aged 23; Mr. Feraz Zehtab, aged 23, both students reading law and members 
of the Islamic Student Society at Tabriz University; Mr. Dariyush Hatemi, aged 29, student; and 
Mr. Shahrukh Hatemi, aged 27, dentistry student in Turkey, all of them activists supporting 
cultural rights of Iranian Azerbaijanis. According to the information received, the above 
mentioned persons have been arrested and detained without indictment or trial since 5 June 2008 
together with other individuals, whose identities were not yet known. They were being held in 
incommunicado detention without access to lawyers and have not been allowed visits by their 
relatives. Mr. Qulamriza Nejefi was arrested at his workplace in Tabriz on 5 June. One of the 
charges brought against him relates to a number of student publications issued under licence, 
which had been found during the searches of his workplace at the time of the arrest. Security 
agents, who then searched his home without a court warrant, confiscated his computer, books, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 81 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>CDs and posters. Mr. Nejefi&#8217;s family was unaware of his whereabouts for 15 days when it 
learned that he had been transferred to Tabriz prison, where he was not allowed to receive visits 
from his relatives. It was believed that the shutting down of Mr. Nejefi&#8217;s shop at the Rasta 
Bazaar in Tabriz despite a valid licence was effected by the Ministry of Information&#8217;s Office in 
Tabriz. Mr. Hemid Valai was detained on 15 June 2008 at the Ministry of Information&#8217;s 
interrogation unit in Tabriz after he had been summoned there. His current place of detention 
was unknown. When family members inquired about his whereabouts with Iranian judicial and 
security authorities they were threatened not to publicise the case. Mr. Valai has been active in 
defending and researching ethnic rights. His articles have been published in a host of Azerbaijani 
student publications as well as in the &#8220;Dilmaj&#8221;, which was banned by Iranian authorities. At the 
intervention of the Ministry of Information he was barred from membership of the bar of 
judiciary lawyers, despite fulfilling all professional requirements. Mr. Vedud Esedi was arrested 
at his home in Rasht on 22 July 2008 by four security agents who confiscated his computer, CDs, 
books, handwritings, a photo album, a wedding video tape and a diary. It was feared that 
Mr. Esedi has been transferred to Section 209 of the Evin Prison in Tehran, however, his family 
has not been able to establish his exact whereabouts. It was believed that Mr. Esedi&#8217;s arrest was 
attributed to his wedding ceremony, where the colour decorations on his wedding cake coincided 
with the three colours contained in the national flag of Azerbaijan and where folk songs in 
Azerbaijani Turkic were sung. Mr. Esedi had been detained by the Ministry of Information in 
Tabriz and Ardebil before following his participation in the May 2006 demonstrations. He was 
released after three months and reportedly ill-treated while in detention. Mr. Sejjad Radmehr, 
Mr. Aydin Khajei, and Mr. Feraz Zehtab were arrested by security agents on 17 July at Tabriz 
University. All have been taken to a location undisclosed by the Iranian authorities and did not 
reveal their places of detention during one single short phone call they have been allowed to 
make to their families. It was believed that the men were arrested in connection with 
Mr. Radmehr&#8217;s viva voce of his master thesis. He was only allowed to defend his thesis after 
staging a &#8220;sit-in&#8221; protest in the mosque of the University on 11 May 2008 and a hunger strike, 
and following a signature campaign at Tabriz and Urmiye Universities and the publication of 
open letters sent to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mr. Aydin Khajei and Mr. Feraz Zehtab 
supported Mr. Radmehr during the sit-in protests and had been banned from the University for 
one year before. Mr. Dariyush Hatemi and his brother, Mr. Shahrukh Hatemi, were also arrested 
by security agents on 17 June 2008 at their home in Tabriz. There was no confirmed information 
on their whereabouts and the charges brought against them were unknown. In view of their 
reported incommunicado detention, grave concerns were expressed as regards the physical and 
psychological integrity of the above mentioned persons. Further concern was expressed that their 
arrests and detention might be solely connected to their reportedly peaceful exercise of their right 
to, in those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, enjoy their own culture 
or to use their own language, in community with the other members of their group. 
</p>
<p>141. On 14 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Ms Shirin Ebadi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and lawyer. Ms Ebadi was the subject of an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 16 April 2008; an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>defenders on 11 August 2006; an urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 4 August 2005; an urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 13 January 2005 and an urgent 
appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and the then Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders on 
8 December 2003. According to the new information received, on 8 August 2008, an article was 
published on the website of the Iranian Republic News Agency (IRNA), entitled &#8220;Ebadi bogged 
down with the Bahai&#8217;s&#8221;. The article reacts to the fact that Ms Ebadi has undertaken the defence 
of seven members of the Baha&#8217;i community. The article contains allegations such as that human 
rights are used as means of pressure to impose Western norms to other cultures, and criticizes 
Ms Ebadi for taking up the defence of homosexuals, Bahai&#8217;s and &#8220;CIA agents&#8221;. The article also 
refers to the conversion to the Baha&#8217;i faith of Ms Nargess Tavassolian, the daughter of Ms Ebadi. 
Another article, which was published on IRNA&#8217;s website, alleged that the reason why Ms Ebadi 
took up the defence of the seven Baha&#8217;i members was in connection with her daughter&#8217;s 
conversion to the faith. On 4 August 2008, the newspaper &#8216;Kayhan&#8217; also published an article 
insinuating links between Ms Ebadi, Israel and the Baha&#8217;i community. Concern was expressed 
that the recent slander campaign may be perceived as incitement to further harassment against 
Ms Ebadi and her family, especially in conjunction with the death threats against her in 
April 2008. Further concern was expressed with regard to the physical and psychological 
integrity of Ms Edabi and her family, as well as her ability to carry out her work. 
</p>
<p>142. On 18 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, regarding the case of 
Mr Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad, a journalist and activist working in defense of the cultural and civil 
rights of Baluchi peoples in northern Iran. Mr Mehrnehad was a civic activist and the 
General Secretary of the <i>Youth Association of Justice Voice</i> in Zahidan. Mr Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad 
had been the subject of a previous urgent appeal, sent on 15 February 2008 by the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteurs had not 
received a reply to that communication from the Government. According to the new information 
received: Mr Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was executed on 4 August 2008 after his death sentence was 
approved by the Prosecutor-General of Iran. Mr Mehrnehad was sentenced to death in 
February 2008, a fact which was confirmed at a press conference by Judiciary spokesman 
Mr Ali Reza Jamshidi on 19 February 2008. Mr Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was arrested in early 
May 2007 along with five other members of the association after they attended a meeting in the 
provincial office of Culture and Islamic Guidance. The five other men were later released. Five 
months after his arrest, Mr Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was allowed visits from his lawyer and his family 
who alleged that he had been tortured, had lost about 15 kg and was unable to keep his balance. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>According to the Public and Revolution Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Zahedan, Mr Mehrnehad was 
accused of being a member of Jondallah (also known as the Iranian Peoples&#8217; Resistance 
Movement) and considered having aided Mr Abdolmalek Rigi, the head of a Baluchi armed 
group. Ya&#8217;qub Mehrnehad was charged with <i>Mohareb</i> (enmity with God) and <i>Mofsed fi&#8217;l arz</i> 
(corruption on earth). 
</p>
<p>143. On 22 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Massoud Kordpour, founding member of the Foundation for Democracy and Human Rights 
in Iranian Kurdistan, who works on human rights and environmental issues. According to the 
information received, on 8 August 2008 Mr Kordpour was arrested in his home, in Boukan. 
Allegations against him included &#8220;espionage for foreign powers&#8221;, apparently due to interviews 
he allegedly gave to Kurdish and Farsi language news sources. His current place of detention as 
well as the charges brought against him was unknown. He might have been kept in 
incommunicado detention. Concern was expressed that the detention of Mr Kordpour at an 
unknown location may be connected to his activities in defence of human rights and his work on 
minority issues. Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and mental integrity of 
Mr Kordpour. 
</p>
<p>144. On 26 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, regarding the case of Ms Mahboubeh Karami, a 
journalist and active member of the Campaign for Equality, a women&#8217;s rights movement in Iran 
which calls for reform of laws that discriminate against women, and a member of the One 
Million Signatures Campaign in Tehran. Members of the One Million Signatures Campaign have 
been the subject of previous communications sent to the Government by mandate holders. 
According to information received, on 13 June 2008, Ms Mahboubeh Karami was arrested by 
plain clothed security officers, who boarded a bus she was travelling on from Tajrish Square near 
Mellat Park, Tehran. Prior to her arrest Ms Mahboubeh Karami used her cell phone to call her 
mother to tell her that she was on her way home but that the bus was delayed in traffic. A short 
time later, Ms Mahboubeh Karami reportedly called her mother again to tell her that she was 
being forcibly removed from the bus. Her cell phone was then disconnected. Prior to 
Ms Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s arrest, a demonstration had taken place near Mellat Park in Tehran. 
The protest had been organised to demonstrate against the arrest, on 11 June 2008, of 
Mr Abbas Palizdar, a member of Iran&#8217;s Majlis&#8217;s (Parliament) Judicial Inquiry and Review 
Committee, who had apparently accused several senior Iranian officials of financial corruption. 
According to reports, security forces used tear gas and electric shock batons to disperse the 
crowd, and check points were also set up by security forces in Vali Asr Street which runs 
alongside Mellat Park. Several public buses were stopped and boarded by plain clothed officers. 
According to reports, on the day Ms Mahboubeh Karami was detained, her family was unable to 
ascertain her whereabouts despite enquiries made by her brother at Vozara detention centre. The 
following day, a fellow passenger who had been on the bus with Ms Mahboubeh Karami 
returned her bag to her family, informing them that all the women on the bus had been removed 
by security officers, and that seemingly none of them had been involved in any demonstration. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 84 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 14 June 2008, the Head of Tehran&#8217;s Judiciary reportedly issued a press statement declaring 
that 200 people had been arrested the previous day and that those who were innocent or were 
suspected of committing only minor offences would learn about the status of their cases within a 
week. On 25 June, Ms Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s mother received a call from her daughter from Evin 
Prison saying that she was being held along with 90 other alleged female protesters. On 6 July, 
Ms Mahboubeh Karami along with nine other women reportedly went on hunger strike to protest 
about the prison conditions. At that time they were all being held in a section of Evin Prison 
where detainees are not permitted visits. The protest ended after the other nine women were all 
released by 25 July. Ms Mahboubeh Karami remained in detention but was moved to a &#8216;general&#8217; 
section of Evin Prison, and from that moment on was allowed weekly visits from her family. 
According to reports, Ms Mahboubeh Karami was charged with &#8220;acting against national 
security,&#8221; and the Revolutionary Court in Mahabad has scheduled her next hearing for 
1 November 2008. Ms Mahboubeh Karami&#8217;s lawyer has reportedly only recently been allowed 
to see the court documents concerning her case, and will shortly meet with her for the first time 
since her arrest. The court set bail of one billion rials (approximately US$110,000) on 
12 July 2008. However, Ms Mahboubeh&#8217;s family had been unable to raise such a large amount. 
Concern was expressed that the aforementioned events may be in relation to Ms. Karami&#8217;s 
involvement in the Campaign for Equality and the One Million Signatures Campaign and may 
represent an attempt to prevent freedom of assembly and expression. 
</p>
<p>145. On 23 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants, regarding the case of Dr. Mehdi Zakerian, a scholar of international relations and 
international law, chair of the <i>International Studies Association of Iran (ISAI)</i>, also known by its 
French name and acronym <i>Association iranienne des &#233;tudes internationales (AIEI)</i>, an 
independent body aimed at promoting the teaching, research and debate on international 
relations. According to the information received, Dr. Zakerian, was arrested on or around 
15 August 2008. The exact circumstances of his arrest and the place of detention where he was 
being held were not known. His family had been permitted to meet him only once, on 6 or 
7 September, at Branch 12 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran under the supervision of court 
officials. Since then Dr. Zakerian had not been in contact with them. It was unclear whether this 
meeting was meant as an official courtroom appearance, since Dr. Zakerian has been accused of 
offences relating to national security including espionage, but has not formally been charged. 
During the meeting Dr. Zakerian appeared to be weak. It was believed that Dr. Zakerian&#8217;s 
detention might be an attempt to prevent him from travelling to the United States of America to 
take up a new post at the University of Pennsylvania as he was awaiting his visa when he was 
detained. Dr. Zakerian used to be an assistant professor at the Islamic Azad University in Tehran 
until September 2007, when he was dismissed from the post without explanation. He had taught 
for more than 10 years, holding posts at a number of important Iranian universities, and has 
written numerous articles. In view of Dr. Zakerian&#8217;s reported incommunicado detention at an 
undisclosed place of detention, grave concern was expressed as regards his physical and mental 
integrity. Further concerns were expressed that his detention might be solely connected to his </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 85 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>reportedly peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes 
the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, 
and of his right to freely leave any country, including his own. 
</p>
<p>146. On 20 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the case of 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour, a journalist, an advocate of cultural rights for the Kurdish people in Iran, 
and a former member of the editorial board of the Kurdish-Persian journal, <i>Aso</i> (Horizon), which 
was shut down by the Iranian authorities in August 2005. On 25 August 2008, 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour began a hunger strike, with 130 Kurdish prisoners in Iran, in protest 
against human rights violations such as torture. Urgent appeals were sent to the Government by 
various mandate-holders on 26 June 2007, and 24 April 2008, regarding the death sentences 
given to Mr. Adnan Hassapour and his cousin, Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar, a Kurdish journalist 
and environmentalist. A response from the Government was received on 23 August 2007. 
According to new information received, on 3 September 2008, Branch 32 of the Supreme Court 
overturned Mr. Adnan Hassanpour&#8217;s death sentence because the charges on which he had been 
convicted did not amount to moharebeh (enmity with God). However, he will be retried by 
Branch 1 of the Revolutionary Court in Marivan, Kordestan, on charges of espionage. 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour reportedly confessed under duress to the charges brought against him but 
retracted his confession. The Government&#8217;s response received on 23 August 2007, states that the 
charges against both Mr. Adnan Hassanpour and Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar were not related to 
their work as professional journalists. While this was acknowledged and the overturning of 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour&#8217;s death sentence was welcomed, concern was expressed that both his and 
Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar&#8217;s work to defend the rights of Kurdish people in Iran is inhibited as 
long as there were charges against them. Serious concern was also expressed for 
Mr. Adnan Hassanpour&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity as well as that of 
Mr. Abdolwahed Butimar. 
</p>
<p>147. On 1 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, regarding the case of two brothers Arash and Kamiar Alaei, doctors 
specialising in the prevention and management of HIV and AIDS and harm-reduction 
programmes for HIV drug-users in Iran. According to the information received, Dr Arash Alaei 
was arrested by security forces on 22 June 2008, and held overnight at an unknown location. On 
23 June 2008, he was reportedly accompanied to his home, where his brother, Dr Kamyar Alaei 
was also arrested. It was also alleged that security forces seized material and documents against 
them. It was further alleged that authorities have refused to disclose information about where the 
Alaei brothers were being held and have not provided them access to counsel. In view of their 
alleged detention at an unknown place concerns were expressed regarding their physical and 
mental integrity. It was alleged that the detention of Drs. Arash and Kamiar Alaei will prevent 
drug users and others from accessing needed health care services which are necessary for the 
protection of their health and further prevention of HIV transmission. Drs. Arash and 
Kamiar Alaei are leading experts on HIV/AIDS and have pioneered HIV/AIDS prevention and 
treatment activities throughout Iran. Since 1986, they have worked to integrate care of 
HIV/AIDS sexually-transmitted diseases and drug-related harm reduction programs into Iran&#8217;s 
national health care system. Their programmes have focused on harm reduction for injecting </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 86 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>drug users and they have received wide acclaim internationally. In addition to their work in Iran, 
the Alaei brothers have held training courses for Afghan and Tajik medical workers and have 
encouraged regional cooperation among 12 Middle Eastern and Central Asian Countries. 
</p>
<p>148. On 12 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the case of Mr. Kamiar Alaei and Mr. Arash Alaei. They were already subject of an earlier 
communication by Special Procedures sent on 1 December 2008. According to recent 
information received, Messrs Kamiar and Arash Alaei were held by Iran&#8217;s Intelligence Ministry 
in Section 209 of Evin Prison, where detainees are reportedly routinely subjected to prolonged 
interrogation while blindfolded and without counsel, to solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, 
threats, beatings and stress positions. Moreover, during the criminal process that led to the trial 
of Messrs Kamiar and Arash Alaei before Tehran&#8217;s Revolutionary Court on 31 December 2008 
neither their defense lawyer, nor Messrs Kamiar and Arash Alaei had been informed of all the 
charges against them, nor had they been allowed to review all the evidence in the case. 
Eventually, charges of communicating with an &#8220;enemy government&#8221; were brought against them. 
Additional charges that the prosecution had not disclosed before were submitted at the trial. A 
verdict by the Court had been expected to be issued already on 7 January; however it was not 
known whether this has been the case and what the outcome was. With a view to consistent 
allegations of ill-treatment at Section 209 of Evin Prison, grave concern for the physical and 
mental integrity of Messrs Kamiar and Arash Alaei was expressed. 
</p>
<p>149. On 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding several cases of 
persons sentenced to death by stoning on charges of adultery. According to the information 
received, on 26 December 2008, Mr. Houshang Khodadadeh and another man whose name has 
not been reported to<b> </b>the Special Rapporteurs were executed by stoning in Mashhad. These 
executions were confirmed on 13 January 2009 by Mr. Ali Reza Jamshidi, spokesman of the 
judiciary. A third man, identified as a citizen of Afghanistan named Mahmoud Gh., reportedly 
managed to free himself of the pit where he was to be stoned. He was again in custody. 
Ms. Gilan Mohammadi and Mr. Gholamali Eskandari were arrested, possibly in 2003, on 
charges of adultery. In 2005 or 2006, they were tried and sentenced to death by stoning. The 
death sentences were possibly confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2008. On 14 January 2009, 
two lawyers, Mr. Mohammad Mostafaie and Ms. Shadi Sadr, travelled to Esfahan Central 
Prison, where Ms. Gilan Mohammadi and Mr. Gholamali Eskandari were detained, to offer their 
services as lawyers. The prison authorities denied the two lawyers access to the detainees. 
Mr. Mostafaie and Ms. Sadr appealed to the judicial authorities in Esfahan, which ruled that the 
lawyers could contact the two convicts only if the detainees first asked to meet with lawyers. The 
cases of Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri were the subject of two urgent appeals dated 
13 February 2008 and 30 July 2008, to which the Special Rapporteurs had not received any 
response from the Government. As stated in our previous communications, Ms. Zohreh Kabiri 
and Ms. Azar Kabiri were arrested on 5 February 2007 in connection with allegations of 
illegitimate relations other than adultery. On 17 March 2007, they were prosecuted in court, 
found guilty, and sentenced to 99 lashes. This sentence was executed. Thereafter, both women 
were returned to prison and another trial took place for the same charges and they were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 87 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death by stoning on 5 August 2007. Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the 
death sentence in 2007. According to information received since then, the Head of the Judiciary 
subsequently quashed the death sentence imposed against Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and 
Ms. Azar Kabiri and sent their case back to Branch 77 of the General Court in Karaj. This court 
reportedly again imposed the death sentence by stoning and, in the first half of January 2009, 
Branch 27 of the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence. The charges against 
Ms. Zohreh Kabiri and Ms. Azar Kabiri were primarily based, as evidence, on video footage 
from a camera Zohreh Kabiri&#8217;s husband allegedly had secretly installed in his house, which 
allegedly shows the two women with another man. It would appear that the lawyer defending the 
two women has never been able to view the video footage which was used as evidence by the 
court. In the Special Rapporteurs communication of 30 July 2008, they further brought to the 
Government&#8217;s attention reports they had received regarding the following other persons 
allegedly sentenced to death by stoning on charges of adultery: Ms. Kobra Najjar, 
Ms. Iran Eskandari, Ms. Malek (Shamameh) Ghorbani, Ms. Ashraf Kolhari, 
Ms. Khaeirieh Valania, Ms. Leila Qomi, and Mr. Abdollah Farivar Moqaddam. Regrettably, the 
Special Rapporteurs had not received a reply from the Government on these cases. Reportedly, 
in 2002, the Head of the Judiciary issued a directive purporting to introduce a moratorium on 
executions by stoning. However, it was reported that at least four men and one woman have been 
stoned to death since 2002, including the two men stoned to death in Mashhad on 
26 December 2008. On 13 January 2009, the spokesman of the judiciary, Mr. Ali Reza Jamshidi, 
reportedly stated that the directive on the moratorium had no legal weight and judges were 
therefore free to ignore it.

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>150. The Government of Iran replied to the urgent appeal dated 31 July 2008 in three letters, 
dated 18 February 2009, 20 February 2009 and 12 March 2009. 
</p>
<p>151. On 18 February 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 31 July 2008, stating 
that Mr. Vadoo Asadi is one of the leaders of the extremist pan-Tukism network and the director 
of the of the students publication of Sahar, the certificate of which was cancelled due to its 
illegal activities. He was arrested on 22 July 2008 and charged with propagation against state 
through distribution and publication of false information with the intention of inciting public 
opinion, distribution of immoral pornographic CD.s as well as propagation of extremist political 
issues. His file was referred to Branch 12 of Rasht Investigation Office. Mr. Asadi is presently 
out of prison through a six million tooman (6 thousand dollar) bail. He was arrested in relation 
with his illegal activities, threated in accordance with the rule of law and enjoyed all his legal 
rights before the court of justice. Mr. Asadi enjoyed all facilities existing medical services, 
similar to any other individual under detention. The Government informs that any allegation of 
mistreatment or lack of proper attention to his physical psychological integrity as well as any 
allegations of threat against his family are baseless and mere fabrication of lies. The Government 
regrets that the letters of the special procedures contain references &#8220;the victim&#8221; or &#8220;secret 
police&#8221;. Furthermore, it expresses regret that the release of Mr. Asadi was not reported to the 
special procedures by the sources of the allegation. 
</p>
<p>152. On 20 February 2009, the Government, in reply to the urgent appeal of 31 July 2008, 
forwards information received from the judiciary. In this letter, it is stated that the judicial 
procedure on different cases are carried out on the basis of law, disregarding social titles, </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>positions, profession, belief or religion and etc. of the accused individuals. Arrest of the 
individuals mentioned in the letters of the honourable Special Rapporteurs, has been the result of 
their illegal activities and on the basis of charges laid against them in accordance with the rule of 
law. Any allegation stating otherwise, including attribution of their arrest to their belief or 
ideology, is baseless and distortion of realities, with the purpose of inciting public opinion for 
politically motivated objectives. The judicial authorities received complaints of a considerable 
number of individuals of all walks of life against a sect oriented organization, attributed to 
Baha&#8217;is, under supervision of seven individuals, namely Khanjani, Tvakoli, Tizfahm, Rezaei, 
Fariba Kamalabadi, Afif Nafini and Mahvash Shahriyari. On the basis of the statements and 
evidences provided by the complainants, they had received threats and intimidation from the 
mentioned individuals or their subordinates to join the sect organization. The complainants were, 
furthermore, threatened through interference and meddling with their private lives and beliefs, to 
be expelled and disconnected from their families and relatives. Following registry of the 
complaints and seriousness of allegations, strict orders were issued, by the pertinent authorities, 
for carrying out thorough investigations into the case. The result of exhausting investigations on 
complaints and allegations revealed that the afore-mentioned individuals had played an effective 
role in the occurring and realization of the mentioned offences. Through formation of a 
clandestine and frightful organization, and systematic control of the private, social and economic 
activities of their sect members as well as accurate planning and programming for entrapping 
other people into their sect through abnormal and illegal methods including persuasion, 
temptation and threat, they intended to expand their illegal organization and ultimately achieve 
their goals through creating a deviant move. On the basis of the existing authentic evidences, the 
organization has received several directives from Israel, as the centre, as well as considerable 
financial assistances for realization of its objectives. Pursuant to the registry of complaints and 
the result of the alarming investigation findings, the mentioned individuals were legally charged 
and sued, for action against state national security. Therefore, six of them were arrested on 
14 May 2008, on the writ issued by the Tehran Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. Later, the writ was 
objected and the case was referred to the pertinent court. Pursuant to the review of the objection 
the writ was reinstated. The seventh individuals, Ms. Mahvash Shahriyari, who was arrested 
earlier in Mashad city, was transferred to Tehran due to the result of investigations and the 
statements made by the above-mentioned individuals on her connection with the dossier under 
investigation. Presently, the preliminary stage of investigations is complete, and the case is 
referred to the competent court. The Government advises that, upon exhaustion of the national 
judicial procedures, the Special Rapporteurs shall be advised of the final verdict. 
</p><p>153. On 12 March 2009, the Government, in reply to the urgent appeal of 31 July 2008, informs 
the special procedures of further information received from pertinent authorities. The letter 
informs that all the eight individuals, during their apprehension, have been in contact with their 
families. On the basis of investigations, the mentioned students in the communication have had 
extremist ethnic inclinations and their activities have constantly aimed at creating hatred toward 
other Iranian ethnic groups with the ultimate separatist objectives. They resorted to illegal 
instruments, violation and extremism and even did not hesitate to have contacts with outlawed 
groups in some neighbouring countries, for which the Iranian Government has officially taken 
measures through diplomatic channels. According to the existing information, they started their 
activities through establishment of a literature association named &#8220;Sahand&#8221; without any 
coordination or information of the university&#8217;s vice-chancellor for cultural affairs, which was a 
requirement. The association was merely used as an umbrella for their activities. They also </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 89 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>continued with their separatist and extremist ideas through propagating and releasing of articles 
and making of baseless allegations in a Website in Canada, which has been established by 
anti-Iranian groups. Iranian laws do not allow using internet websites, for advertisement or 
propagation issues, which do not observe social morality standards or incite public opinion or 
create discord among ethnic groups. They further developed their activities by formation of the 
illegal group of &#8220;Azoukh&#8221;. They later put their group at the service of the separatist and 
extremist group of &#8220;Gamouh&#8221; which located out of the country, which, in fact, alerted the Iranian 
pertinent authorities to make the necessary investigations. The illegal &#8220;Gamouh&#8221; group is 
stationed in USA and Azerbaijan and considers itself as a &#8220;national movement for awaking of 
Azerbaijan&#8221;. It is led by an Iranian, by the name of Mr. Mahmoud Cheregani, who has fled the 
country. Goumeh is known as an extremist and separatist group which has openly announced its 
goal as establishment of southern Azerbaijan government and state as well as separation from the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. The Group which receives financial assistance from foreign countries, 
has taken extensive measures toward ethnic hatred against other ethnic groups of the country, 
inter alia through propagating extremist terminology and literature (such as Fars chauvinism), 
which is against the existing national law and regulations as well as international standards. The 
group follows the extremist objectives of &#8220;Gamouth&#8221; group through creating a Weblog and a 
Website by the assistance of Gamouh members and buying of the permit from Canada. They 
collected particular pieces of News on students&#8217; activities, labour union activities/strikes and 
other ordinary News of the country and reflected and commented them in a way which incited 
separatist and ethnical ideas and unrest. The other activities of Azoukh included: a. providing 
mal-intended information to all Websites affiliated to terrorist groups which have been hostile to 
Iran, b. deceiving students and formation of covert teams with the objective of separatism and 
ethnical provocations and ultimate overturning of the government, c. distribution of books and 
written materials on their ideas as well as dragging the &#8220;Sahand&#8221; illegal literature association 
into their activities. 
</p>
<p>154. With regard to the individuals, the authorities inform of the following. Mr. Hamid Valai 
was arrested being charged with acts of extremism, disturbing of public order, act against

Websites opposing the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mr. Daryoush Hatami is a conscript soldier of 
Division 21 Hamzah of the Army and a university graduate of agriculture. He was arrested on 
18 July 2008, being charged with co-founding and management of the illegal group of 
&#8220;Azoukh&#8221;, with the intention of disturbing state security and propagation against the state in 
favour of the Gamouh group (Article 498 and 500 of the Islamic Penal law). The organizational 
role and responsibility of the accused: leasing of a house and turning it into the venue for 
meetings of the Azoukh group, preparing of computers and electronic equipments for activities 
of the group, connection with foreign illegal websites, connection with ethnical members of the 
Gamouth and its supporters as well as distribution of provocative ethnic statements and posters. 
Mr. Shahrokh Hatami is a student of dentistry in Turkey. He has a record and conviction for 
participation in gatherings, intended to incite ethnic unrest. He was charged with propagation 
against the State in favour of the Gamouh group (Article 498 and 500 of the Islamic Penal law). 
His role and responsibility in the group was the organizing of meetings, collection and 
distribution of news and information aiming at separatist ends as well as ethnic hatred and 
unrest. He was arrested on 18 July 2008 and the court of hearing was held on 19 July 2008. He 
was released on bail on 31 July 2008. His dossier was under judicial procedure. 
Mr. Vadood Asadi is one of the leaders of the extremist pan-Turkish network and the director of 
the of students publication of Sahar, the certificate of which was cancelled due to its illegal 
activities. He was arrested on 22 July 2008 and charged with propagation against state through 
distribution and publication of false information with the intention of inciting public opinion, 
distribution of immoral pornographic CD&#8217;s as well as propagation of extremist political issues. 
His file was referred to Branch 12 of Rasht Investigation Office. Mr. Asadi is presently out of 
prison through a six million tooman (6 thousand dollar) bail. He was arrested merely in relation 
with his illegal activities (and not under the allegation of Azeri sons, which are quite prevalent 
and popular in Iran or the colour of his wedding cake). He was treated in accordance with the 
rule of law and enjoyed all his legal rights before the court of justice. Charges laid down against 
the above-mentioned individuals have had no connection, whatsoever with their peaceful 
social/human rights activities. All the individuals enjoyed the existing medical services and 
facilities, similar to any other individual under detention. The Government concludes by stating 
that any allegations of mistreatment or lack of proper attention to their physical or psychological 
integrity are baseless and mere fabrication. 
</p>
<p>155. On 28 April 2009, the Government of Iran replied to the letter dated 15 April 2008, stating 
that on the basis of investigations conducted it turned out that Behrooz Karimizadeh, 
Peyman Piran, Ali Kantouri and Majid Pourabdolloah were not students and had resorted to 
illegal instruments, violation and extremism and started their activities through establishment of 
an illegal organization, with extremist Marxist inclination, named Hekmatism, Azadi guard 
brach. The Government informs that, aiming at creating insecurity in the country, the 
organization had set up a military branch disguised under the umbrella of student activities. The 
Government further informed that they absorbed students who wished to have political activities 
and gradually dragged them into criminal and terrorist acts, such as kidnapping, engineering 
bomb explosions etc. On 4 December 2007, the abnormal behaviour of the four above-mentioned 
individuals who had participated in a gathering in commemoration of the Day of Student made </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 91 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>police officers suspicious. Consequently, they were arrested and the investigations revealed the 
following: Mr. Peyman Piran, from the city of Mahabad, had been expelled from the University 
of Tehran, and he had a record of arrests for acts of extremism with leftist Marxist inclinations in 
relation with Hekmatism with armed struggle policies. Mr. Behrouz Karimizadeh, from the city 
of Mahabad, had been expelled from the University of Tehran, and Mr. Ali Kantour, from the 
city of Qazvin, who has records of illegal activities, extremist leftist inclinations, acts leading to 
public disorder, destruction of public property and one case of blackmail, were both actively 
involved in armed activities of Azadi guard of Hekmatism. Majid Pourabdollah, who has had 
records of illegal activities, extremist leftist inclinations, acts leading to public disorder, 
destruction of public property and actively participated in the implementation of armed activities. 
The above mentioned individuals were charged with: 1) founding an extremist group with the 
objective of disturbing security of the country, and 2) propagation against the state in favour of 
the hostile groups (extremist Marxist with armed struggle policies). Their cases were referred to 
branch 15 of the penal court and later on they were released on bail. Their cases have not been 
finalized yet. Charges laid down against the above-mentioned individuals had had no connection, 
whatsoever, with peaceful social/human rights activities. All the individuals enjoyed their rights 
as well as having access to the existing services and facilities, similar to any other individual 
under detention. Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani and Ms. Mahnaz Parakan were the lawyers of the 
individuals. Any allegations of maltreatment or lack of proper attention to their physical integrity 
are baseless and mere fabrication. The Government concludes by noting that according to the 
latest information, Mr. Karimzadeh and Mr. Piran have illegally left the country and are seen in 
northern Iraq. 
</p>
<p>156. On 4 May 2009, the Government of Iran replied to the joint urgent appeal 
dated 15 April 2008, stating that Mr. Reza Daghestani, born in 1981, was arrested on 
21 February 2008, under the charge of extremist incitement to ethnic feelings and sentiments, 
organizing of illegal gatherings as well as ethnic propagation against other Iranian ethnic groups. 
Following investigations, he was released on bail. On 14 May 2008, the penal court of Oroumiye 
city sentenced him, in the presence of his lawyer, Mr. Karim Najafi, to eight months of 
imprisonment, including his earlier days of detention. Taking into the consideration 
Mr. Daghestani&#8217;s young age and respecting the Islamic affection as well as his lack of criminal 
record and finally, on the basis of Article 25 of the Islamic Penal Code, the remaining of his 
sentence was suspended. As it was explained, Mr. Daghestani was treated in accordance with the 
rule of law, enjoying the highest level of affection as well as his legal rights before the court of 
justice. The charges laid down against Mr Daghestani had no connection, whatsoever, with her, 
if any, social/human rights activities, and the case was heard and settled in the shortest possible 
time. The Government concludes by stating that therefore all allegations on maltreatment or lack 
of proper attention to his physical or psychological integrity as well as any allegation on threats 
against his family are baseless, mere fabrication as well as an abuse of the 
internationally-recognised instruments. 
</p>
<p>157. On 6 May 2009, the Government of Iran replied to the letter of 5 February 2008, stating 
that Mr. Behrouz Safari and his wife, Mrs. Leila Heydari traveled to Turkey as tourists and 
participated in training sessions, which according to authentic information, were organized by 
Americans. According to the confirmed information, the agenda of the training courses included 
overthrow of the system/government through abuse of civil and social rights existing in the 
country. The participants in the training courses are taught the special methods for recognition 
and absorbtion of new members, organizational techniques, extremist propagation on the existing </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 92 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>weaknesses in the country, as well as disturbing of public opinion. Mr. Behriuz Safari and his 
wife Mrs. Leila Heydari together with other seven individuals participated in the 
above-mentioned course and took the oath to implement what they had learned in the course. 
Following their return to the country, Mr. Safari was arrested on 19 June 2007 and Mrs. Heydari 
was arrested on 27 August 2007. Following the relevant investigations, they were released on 
bail on 2 March 2008 and their case, together with the bill of indictment, was sent to branch 15 
of Tehran Penal Court. The court met on 8 June 2008, in the presence of their defense lawyers, 
Dadkhah and Raeisian Firourabad, and convicted them to one year&#8217;s suspended imprisonment, 
through verdict No. 87/104. Upon complaint of the defence, the case was raised in branch 36 of 
the Court of Appeal and reinstated through verdict No. 1257 of 28 October 2008. The 
Government further informs that the two individuals were arrested merely in relation with their 
illegal activities and they were treated in accordance with the rule of law and enjoyed all their 
legal rights before the court of justice. Any allegation on maltreatment of lack of proper attention 
to his physical or psychological integrity as well as any other allegation such as &#8220;torture to obtain 
confessions&#8221; or &#8220;arrested in relation with their peaceful activities in defence of human rights&#8221; are 
baseless and a mere fabrication. The government further informs that the law of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran are based on prohibition of any form of mistreatment of individuals. This 
overriding principle has been accorded special attention in the Constitution. In order to ensure 
effective respect for this principle, not only has the Constitution provided for the punishment of 
those who ignore the prohibitions and commit acts of mistreatment and torture, but provision 
have also been made for the legal protection of the victims of mistreatment. Furthermore, 
confession extracted through torture is invalid. The Government concludes by referring to the 
wording of article 38 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>158. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for their detailed replies 
of 18 and 20 February, 12 March, 28 April, 4 May and 6 May 2009. 
</p>
<p>159. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of any official reply to the 
communications of 24 April 2008, 11 July 2008, 14, 18, 22 and 26 August 2008, 
23 September 2008, 20 October 2008, 3 November 2008, 1 December 2008, 12 January 2009 
and 21 January 2009. He urges the Government of Iran to provide at the earliest possible date 
detailed substantive answers to the above allegations. 
</p>
<p>160. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the manifold information received about 
human rights violations against human rights defenders, as reflected in the above-mentioned 
letters sent to the Government of Iran. In this connection, he wishes also to express his 
pre-occupation about the violation of procedural rights of these individuals which lead to a 
situation in which they are not in a position to adequately defend themselves in pre-trial as well 
as judicial procedures. 
</p><p>161. In this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the Government of his request to 
visit that country, made in 2006. Given the discussions with the authorities of Iran, the Special 
Rapporteur is hopeful that the Government will invite the mandate-holder in the near future. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>162. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
regarding the case of Mr Shawan Jabarin, general director of <i>Al-Haq</i>, a Palestinian human rights 
organization based in the occupied West Bank. On 16 March 2007, Mr Shawan Jabarin was the 
subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary General on the situation of human 
rights defenders. The urgent appeal referred to travel restrictions against Mr Shawan Jabarin 
imposed on 23 March 2006. No response had been received from the Government. According to 
information received, on 7 July 2008, the Israeli High Court rejected Mr Shawan Jabarin&#8217;s 
petition to have the travel restrictions against him lifted. Previous petitions filed by 
Mr Shawan Jabarin against the travel restrictions were rejected in December 2006 and June 
2007. With the travel restrictions in place Mr Shawan Jabarin was not permitted to leave the 
West Bank. The High Court&#8217;s refusal to lift the travel restrictions against Mr Shawan Jabarin 
was reportedly based on secret information provided by the military and examined ex parte. This 
information allegedly justifies the Israeli High Court&#8217;s decision by proving that Mr Shawan 
Jabarin was a security risk. Given that neither Mr Shawan Jabarin nor his lawyer has been able to 
gain knowledge of why the travel restrictions are in place, it has been impossible to defend 
Mr Shawan Jabarin. Because he cannot leave the West Bank, Mr Shawan Jabarin has been 
unable to represent his organization at various events in other countries. The Special Rapporteurs 
were concerned that no reasons for the travel ban imposed against Mr Shawan Jabarin have been 
given and as a consequence he cannot effectively continue his non-violent activities in defence 
of human rights in the occupied West Bank territory. 
</p>
<p>163. On 31 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding the situation of 
S.S. and S.S., both aged 16, and cousins, living in Bethlehem. According to information 
received, both were reportedly due to be released on 4 October 2008. On 5 October 2008, S.S. 
and S.S. were issued a second administrative detention order for a further three-month period. 
On 6 October 2008, their appeal was rejected. The military judge Eyal Noon reportedly upheld 
the order for a further three months until 3 January 2009. The judge reportedly considered that 
these girls were still &#8216;dangerous&#8217;. Furthermore, the military prosecutor has provided no evidence 
since their arrest. On 5 June 2008, at approximately 02.00 a.m., S.S. and S.S. had been arrested 
by Israeli police and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) officers at their respective homes in 
Bethlehem. In both cases, it was alleged that officers used excessive force and abusive 
ill-treatment at the time of arrest, including by handcuffing and blindfolding. Following their 
arrest, S.S. and S.S. were taken briefly to Telmond Prison and then transferred to Ofer Prison 
where they were interrogated for one hour. During the interrogation, they were allegedly asked 
about their activities and relations with any political group. S.S. and S.S. did not confess 
anything. The ISA reportedly claimed that the girls were involved in militant activities; although 
to date, no charges have been issued against them. S.S. and S.S. were then taken back to 
Telmond prison, where they were kept for two days. They were then transferred to Addamoun 
prison, where they had been detained with other Palestinian adult female detainees. With regard 
to the military administrative detention orders, it was reported that they were issued on </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 94 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12 June 2008, and allegedly justified S.S.&#8217; and S.S.&#8217; detention on the basis of their supposed 
involvement in militant activities, deemed by authorities as &#8220;endangering the security of the 
area&#8221;. These orders set for four and five months respectively. A military court reportedly 
confirmed these orders on 18 June 2008. On 15 July 2008, S.S. and S.S. were brought from 
Addamoun prison to Al Ramle prison, in view of the appeal hearing set for 16 July 2008. They 
endured abusive behaviour during this transfer and at the place of destination. At Al Ramle 
prison, S.S. and S.S. were undressed and had undergone a full body search conducted by a 
female officer. On 16 July 2008, S.S. and S.S. were brought before an appeal hearing which 
confirmed the orders, although S.S.&#8217;s administrative term was reportedly reduced from 5 to 
4 months. It was further alleged that according to the administrative detention procedure in 
Israel, a Military commander was able to renew the administrative detention order for up to 
6 months, every 6 months, subject to review by a court (within 8 days of each order being 
issued); and the renewal can be extended perpetually. This exists even in the absence of any 
charge or trial during the whole period of detention. It was understood that a military order by 
the commander would be confirmed by a military court, and furthermore may be subject to an 
appeal. Both S.S. and S.S. have had access to legal counsel, and their families were able to visit 
them only three times since their arrest. Concerns were expressed at the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Salah and Ms. Siureh, particularly in light of their status as minors 
and in the alleged absence of charges. 
</p>
<p>164. On 4 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
regarding the case of Mr. Rami Ibrahim Mohammed Samarah, aged 22, Palestinian, identity 
document No. 938010287, usually residing at Zeita village, Tulkarm. According to the 
information received, Mr. Samarah was arrested without a warrant by a member of the Israeli 
national security forces on 28 June 2007 at Zatarah checkpoint. He has been ordered to remain in 
detention for security reasons for 36 months and was currently held at Naqib and Majido prisons, 
between which he was regularly transferred back and forth. The authority ordering the detention 
had not been reported, and the legal basis for the detention was not known. Mr. Samarah had a 
lawyer, however, up to date no charges had been brought against him. During the investigation 
Mr. Samarah was allegedly severely beaten. It was alleged that he was being detained in poor 
conditions. Prior to his arrest his house was searched by Israeli soldiers who were said to have 
destroyed parts of the interior and his personal computer. In view of allegations of ill-treatment, 
concerns were expressed as regards Mr. Samarah&#8217;s physical and mental integrity.<b>

<p>165. On 11 December 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeals sent 
on 31 October 2008, stating that Israel has been struggling with terrorism from the day it was 
founded. In recent years, the number of terrorist attacks grew significantly, and Palestinian 
terrorists have been targeting Israeli civilians more viciously than ever before, including in 
pizzerias, shopping malls, cafeterias, and buses. Particularly horrendous was March 2002, when 
more than 80 Israeli civilians were killed, and more than 400 were injured. Overall, from 
September 2000 until February 2007, 1,121 Israeli civilians were killed and 8,147 were injured. 
One of the most effective and lawful counter-measures against such continuous terrorist attacks 
is the use of administrative detentions. However, it is important to note that this measure is only </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 95 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>used in exceptional circumstances. Where sufficient and admissible evidence exists against an 
individual, the authorities are required to bring that individual to trial, rather than adopt such 
measures as administrative detention. Nonetheless, in some situations, there may be clear, 
concrete and trustworthy evidence against an individual, but for reasons of confidentiality and 
protection of intelligence sources, it cannot be presented as evidence in ordinary criminal 
proceedings. It is under such circumstances that administrative detentions are imposed. Issuance 
of administrative detention orders against detainees who pose a danger to public security in a 
defined area, in situations such as outlined above, is recognized by international law and are in 
full conformity with Article 78 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949. Moreover, the measure 
is only used in cases where there is corroborating evidence that an individual is engaged in 
illegal acts that endanger the security of a particular area and the lives of civilians, and each 
order is subject to judicial review. It is important to note that an administrative detention order is 
limited to six months in duration, and its extension requires a re-evaluation of the relevant 
intelligence material, as well as further judicial review. Furthermore, local legislation governing 
the process grants all relevant individuals the right to appeal the order to the Military Court of 
Appeals, for judicial review. Petitioners may be represented by counsel of their choice at every 
stage of these proceedings. All detainees have the additional right to petition the Israeli High 
Court of Justice for a repeal of the order. The judicial organs reviewing each and every order 
carefully examine whether the criteria outlined in case law and legislation are fully met. 
Regarding the cases at hand, Ms. Siureh was arrested on 5 June 2008. Thereafter, on 
12 June 2008, an administrative detention order for a period of five months was issued against 
her due to her activities jeopardizing the security of the area. In a judicial review regarding the 
order, in light of Ms. Siureh being a minor, the Court decided to shorten the administrative 
detention order to a period of four months. Thus her detention was scheduled to end on 
4 October 2008. An appeal regarding the above-mentioned decision was denied by the Court. 
Ms. Saleh was also arrested on 5 June 2008. Thereafter, on 12 June 2008, an administrative 
detention order for a period of four months was issued against her due to her activities 
jeopardizing the security of the area. In a judicial review regarding the order, the Court noted 
that it would have been appropriate to sentence Ms. Saleh to a longer detention period, but in 
light of her status as a minor, the original sentence of four months would stand. Thus her 
detention was scheduled to end on 4 October 2008. An appeal regarding the abovementioned 
decision was denied by the Court. On 28 September 2008, the administrative detention orders 
against Ms. Siureh and Ms. Sal&#232;h were extended for an additional three months. In a judicial 
review regarding this extension, which took place on 6 October 2008, the Court affirmed the 
order and stated that there is reliable, high-quality intelligence material indicating that there is a 
definite threat to the security of the area if Ms. Siureh and Ms. Saleh were to be released. It 
should be noted that the Court also examined if alternative and less severe procedures could be 
taken against the two appellants, but found that it was not possible at that time. An appeal 
regarding the abovementioned decision was denied by the Court who affirmed the order &#8220;in light 
of willingness of the appellants for dangerous security activity.&#8221; Ms. Saleh and Ms. Siureh are 
thus due to be released on 3 January 2009.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>166. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Israel for its reply to his letter 
of 31 October 2008. While he appreciates the detailed information on the questions of 
administrative detention, he remains concerned that military justice is used to try civilians. In 
this connection, he refers to paragraph 22 of General Comment No. 32 of the Human Rights </p>

</p>
<p>Committee, in which it stated that &#8220;Trials of civilians by military or special courts should be 
exceptional, i.e. limited to cases where the State party can show that resorting to such trials is 
necessary and justified by objective and serious reasons, and where with regard to the specific 
class of individuals and offences at issue the regular civilian courts are unable to undertake the 
trials.&#8221; Consequently, the Special Rapporteur is looking forward to receiving relevant 
information from the Government in this regard. 
</p>
<p>167. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the

<p>168. On 14 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr. Tashi Tsering, aged 38. Mr. Tashi Tsering is the Vice-Chairman of the Taiwan 
branch of the Tibetan Youth Congress. According to the information received, on 26 April 2008, 
the day the Beijing Olympic torch was brought to Japan, Mr. Tashi Tsering was participating in a 
reportedly peaceful demonstration in Nagano against the Olympic torch relay. During the 
demonstration, Mr. Tashi Tsering was taken into custody by the Nagano police authorities. 
Mr. Tashi Tsering had reportedly not committed any violent acts during the demonstration. 
Before he was arrested, he had been calling for the independence of the Tibet Autonomous 
Region by approaching the torch and shouting, &#8220;Free Tibet!&#8221;. Mr. Tashi Tsering was charged 
with &#8220;forcible obstruction of business&#8221;. While in detention, Mr. Tashi Tsering allegedly did not 
have access to a lawyer during the first days, nor was he allowed to see visitors. On 28 April, 
Mr. Tashi Tsering was brought before a prosecutor for interrogation. Thereafter, his detention 
was extended for another 10 days and he was once again not permitted to see any visitors during 
this extended detention period. On 8 May, another 10-day extension of Mr. Tashi Tsering&#8217;s 
period of detention was sought, allegedly to gather evidence against him to show that he was a 
terrorist. Mr. Tashi Tsering was detained at Nagano&#8217;s central police station. His indictment was 
reportedly scheduled for 15 May and the court hearing on his case was due to take place on 
17 May. Information was also received that if found guilty, Mr. Tsering may be sentenced to a 
fine of 500,000 Japanese yen (around US$4,800) or to a prison sentence of up to 3 years. 
Concerns were expressed that the detention of Mr. Tashi Tsering might be solely connected to 
his peaceful activities in defending human rights and the exercise of his right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>169. On 28 May 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 14 May 2008, stressing 
that it guaranteed freedom of assembly and association, as well as speech, press and all other 
forms of expression as major rights (Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan). The case referred to 
in the communication includes an action that went beyond the limits of the freedom and it was 
dealt with by the concerned authorities under appropriate legal procedures. The Government of 
Japan has no intention to restrict the freedom arbitrarily. 1484. The detailed facts of the case are </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 97 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>summarized as follows. On 26 April 2008, when the Beijing Olympic Torch Relay, co-organized 
by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad and the City of 
Nagano, was under way in the city, Mr Tashi Tsering, the accused, jumped out towards the 
running course shouting &#8220;Free Tibet&#8221; for the purpose of interfering this event, and as a result, 
prevented a runner from running forward. As it obstructed the business of the Organizing 
Committee and Nagano City by force, his action constituted &#8220;forcible obstruction of business&#8221;, 
which is stipulated under Article 234 of the Penal Code. On 26 April 2008, at 9-06 am, the police 
arrested Mr Tshering on the spot as a flagrant offender and detained him in a detention cell. On 
27 April 2008 the police referred the case to the public prosecutor. On 28 April 2008 the public 
prosecutor requested Mr Tshering to be detained for 10 days and it was authorized by the judge 
after the direct judicial inquiry. On 7 May 2008 the prosecutor requested the extension of the 
period of detention for another 10 days, and it was authorized by the judge. Mr Tshering was 
interviewed by a defense counsel 13 times between 28 April and 14 May 2008. He also had an 
interview with a staff from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan. On 
16 May 2008 Mr Tshering was fined 500.000 yen as a summary order, which he paid on the 
same day. He was released at 2.25 pm on 16 May 2008. The legal basis for the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Tashi Tsering are as follows: article 213, 212 (1), 203 (1), 216, 199 (1), 60 (1), 
61, 203 (1), 205 (1), 205 (1), (2), 207 (1), (4), 208 (1) and (2). The Government informs that in 
Japan, majority of criminal cases are completed without the suspects being arrested or detained. 
In order to arrest a suspect, there must be sufficient probable cause to suspect that an offence has 
been committed by him/her, and an arrest warrant issued in advance by a judge is required, 
except a case of emergency including on-the-spot arrest against flagrant offender. The police, the 
prosecutor and a judge, in sequence, strictly check the case and decide whether or not a suspect 
should be detained after arrest, and unless a judge authorizes the detention at the latest within 
72 hours after arrest, the suspect must be released. Extensions of a period of detention are 
authorized only when the judge deems unavoidable circumstances exist. The Government 
concludes that the procedures of arrest and detention in Japan are compatible with applicable 
international human rights norms and standards. These procedures are meant to apprehend 
suspects of criminal cases, and their appropriate enforcement does not violate the freedom of 
expression.

the question of torture, regarding the case of Ms Tatiana Aleksandrovna Krainova, aged 37, and 
her sister, Ms Olga Aleksandrovna Koroleva, aged 38. According to the information received, 
Tatiana Krainova was ordered to report to the Committee for National Security (KNB) in Almaty 
on 29 September 2007 and has not been seen since then. On 2 November 2007 Olga Koroleva 
was also invited to the Committee for National Security and has not been seen since. On

Olgo Koroleva, concern for their physical and mental integrity was expressed. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>172. On 8 June 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 10 April 2008, stating that 
Ms. T. Krainova and Ms. O.A. Koroleva were prosecuted for illegally gathering information that 
constituted State secrets and for the serious consequences of their actions. On 25 March 2008, 
the military tribunal of Aqmola garrison found Ms. Krainova, Ms. Koroleva and others guilty of 
offences contrary to article 172, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan. All of the 
guilty parties were sentenced to deprivation of liberty for a period of two years and six months. 
The sentence was appealed. At present, the question of whether the case should be referred to the 
criminal division of the armed forces military tribunal is being decided. During the pretrial 
investigation, Ms. Krainova and Ms. Koroleva were required to sign, as a preventive measure, an 
undertaking not to leave the area and a pledge of good behaviour, in accordance with article 144 
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Ms. Krainova and Ms. Koroleva were granted the right to 
defence counsel. The aforementioned persons did not submit any complaints concerning 
unlawful actions on the part of the members of the investigative group of the Committee for 
National Security in connection with restrictions on their freedom of movement, nor did they 
make any complaints about their state of health. All defendants, including Ms. Krainova and 
Ms. Koroleva, were guaranteed the participation of defence counsel at all stages of the criminal 
proceedings. Owing to the fact that the investigation involved State secrets, the criminal 
proceedings were held in camera. However, the rights of all the parties to the proceedings were 
observed.

Special Rapporteur on torture, Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and 
consequences and Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding the 
case of Ms. Oktomkan Kazakovna Almanbetova, born 8 November 1959, widowed, 
self-employed market-woman. According to the information received, Ms. Almanbetova has 
been recognised as non compos mentis (certifiably insane) by government authorities. On 
18 February 2008 she went to the local authority (akimiat) in Kerben, in order to lodge a 
complaint with Ms. Kynagul Oskombaeva, because the electricity at her home had been cut. The 
representative refused to take her complaint arguing that she complained for no apparent reaon, 
called her &#8220;crazy&#8221; and threatened to call the militia. Ms. Oskombaeva asked her to report back 
on 20 February. When Ms. Almanbetova did so, she was arrested by three members of the militia 
whose first names were Meder, Melis and Almaz. The three men violently dragged her into a car, 
which caused her pain in her shoulders and armpits, and transferred her to the police station in 
Kerben. At the police station, investigator Mamatkerin Anarbaev reportedly threatened that she </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 100 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>would be detained for many years if she did not sign a number of documents. Ms. Almanbetova 
signed 5 or 6 documents written in Russian, which she hardly understands since she is ethnic 
Kyrgyz and has difficulty reading and writing. Afterwards, Ms. Almanbetova was detained in a 
cell at the police station and raped by two police officers on guard during that night, one of 
whom was identified as Ilyas. He beat her, forced her onto the bed, removed her pants and tights 
and raped her. Later, another police officer entered the cell and also raped her. Then the two 
officers beat Ms. Almanbetova again, hit her head against a wall and told her not to talk to 
anyone about the incident. She lost consciousness several times. The officers washed her with 
cold water from a plastic bottle. This reportedly resulted in cystitis. Ms. Almanbetova attempted 
to commit suicide with 20 tablets of Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant and mood stabilising 
drug used primarily in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. She was unconscious when 
she was admitted to a hospital in Kerben, had to be artificially nourished, and only regained 
consciousness two days later on 22 February. At the hospital she was handcuffed to her bed and 
guarded by policemen, making it impossible for her to go to the bathroom, which caused her 
much distress because of her cystitis. One of the police guards, identified by his first name Altyn, 
threatened her again not to report the rape. On 22 February she was summoned to the city court 
of Kerben on charges of hooliganism brought against her, but reportedly the presiding judge 
Adyl Bazarbaev did not ask any questions or listen to her complaints. After the trial she was 
returned to the hospital. On 25 February 2008 she filed a complaint with the Deputy Prosecutor 
of Kerben, Ernis Nizambekov, who came to the hospital following the intervention of a human 
rights defender on Ms. Almanbetova&#8217;s behalf. She remained in the hospital until 26 February 
when she was transferred to the Legal Examination Unit of the National Psychiatric Hospital in 
Kyzylzhar, escorted by three guards, one of whom, Ilyas, had raped her at the police station. 
Ms. Almanbetova remained in custody at the National Psychiatric Hospital. On 17 March, a 
lawyer acting on behalf of Ms. Almanbetova contacted the Deputy Prosecutor in Kerben, 
Mr. Nizambekov, who denied the lawyer a meeting. A complaint was submitted to the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Generals Office in Bishkek on 25 March. Grave concerns were expressed for the 
physical and mental integrity of Ms. Almanbetova.

<p>177. On 20 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding the rape 
of a minor, O.M.V., of Uzbek origin, residing in Chui province, Sokuluk-1 village, 
Ulitsia Zarechnya 18. According to the information received, O.M.V. was 13 years old at the 
time of the alleged commission of the crime. O.M.V. was victim of rape at least five times 
between 7 and 15 January 2008. The incidents happened in Jalalabat Province, Kyazyljar village. 
On 7 January 2008 at night, two young men named A.T. and A.J. forced O.M.V. and her friend 
R.M. to drink alcohol, hit them, and raped them. They threatened the girls to kill them if they 
told anyone about what happened. The girls returned to their homes without mentioning the 
incident. In the evening of 10 January, the two girls decided to flee from their house. On 
11 January, K.B., the son of a woman from the girls&#8217; village, who helped them hide, took the 
girls to his flat. With his friend M.T., he harassed and hit the girls. He then raped O.M.V. On 
12 January, K.B. brought the girls to the house of Z.N., where another man was present, K.T. 
The girls were forced to drink alcohol and were beaten up. Three other men came. All of them 
harassed and hit the girls, threatened them with knives, and forced them to take unknown tablets. 
K.T. and Z.N. then raped O.M.V. and R.M. The girls were then thrown into the street. On 13 and 
14 January, the two girls accidentally met Z.N., who again raped O.M.V. twice. On 15 January, 
the girls were found and reported to the police of Tashkumyr. A medical expertise conducted by </p>

  page 101 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the doctor Kudaiberdiev in Shamalduusai the same day confirmed that O.M.V. suffered from 
wounds in her forehead, lips and shoulders, from concussion, and from pains in her abdomen and 
genital organs. Traces of different sperms were found on her. A court case was conducted, and 
four of the nine perpetrators were convicted with 10 to 15 years imprisonment. One was 
recognized mentally insane. The four others, A.T., K.M., M.D. and A.O., were not convicted. On 
22 January 2008, inhabitants of Kyzyljar gathered to discuss the rape of O.M.V. Among them 
were authorities, including the deputy of the village counsel A. Duishebaeva, representatives of 
three village <i>aksakal</i> (elderly men) counsels, the therapist of the district psychiatric hospital S. 
Mombekova, and the school principal S.A. Anataeva. The village&#8217;s inhabitants reached a 
decision to evict the victim and her family from the village within 24 hours. The perpetrators&#8217; 
relatives further demanded that O.M.V. withdraw her complaint against the perpetrators, or else 
they would make sure O.M.V.&#8217;s family be evicted from the village. The village&#8217;s inhabitants also 
decided to evict the girl from the school and to jointly act to release the assailants by writing a 
letter to the court explaining the &#8220;bad&#8221; behaviour of the girl victim. They started to harass the 
victim and her family after this meeting. In a statement signed by 104 inhabitants of the village 
and sent to the Administration of the President, they accused O.M.V.&#8217;s father-in-law to be the 
real perpetrator of the rapes, and that O.M.V.&#8217;s family had asked relatives of the perpetrators for 
USD 50,000 in exchange of the withdrawal of her complaint against them. The signatories of the 
statement further stated that O.M.V.&#8217;s mother often insulted the inhabitants on ethnic grounds. 
They finally demanded the reconsideration of the cases of the convicted perpetrators. On 
9 July 2008, the prosecutor interviewed the victim&#8217;s mother in Jalalabad Oblast, and she later 
confirmed in writing that the allegations in the statement by the village&#8217;s inhabitants were 
unfounded. A petition was filed by O.M.V. with a police investigator about the threats she 
endured from relatives of the convicted perpetrators and from the medical staff of the District 
Psychiatric Hospital during her treatment. The investigator refused to accept the complaint, 
saying that there was no basis for it, since she was not beaten. The petition was also sent to the 
Ministry of Health but she received no reply. It was alleged that the investigation and trial were 
not conducted properly. The victim&#8217;s statements were distorted by the investigator; the victim 
was not informed about her rights and duties; the investigator did not give any material about the 
criminal case to the victim&#8217;s mother and did not share documents relating to the insanity of K.T. 
The investigator also refused to reconsider the cases of the other four perpetrators who were not 
convicted, explaining that he &#8220;had a family and could not arrest everybody,&#8221; implying also that 
she was inflating the number of persons who had aggressed her. The trial was conducted in 
Kyrgyz language, although the victim and her family are ethnically Uzbek and do not speak 
Kyrgyz. No Russian translation was provided. The victim was also not provided with a lawyer. It 
was also alleged that the court wrongly considered K.T. as &#8216;insane&#8217;, thereby releasing him from 
legal liability. The family of K.T. allegedly put pressure on the medical staff and psychiatric 
experts in this regard. On 28 April 2008 a trial on his case was conducted in Kyrgyz, during 
which the Court-expert on psychiatric issues recognized him insane. The court&#8217;s decision was 
appealed but the case was not reconsidered by the Supreme Court. On 18 July 2008, the 
Jalalabad court accepted to reconsider the cases of the convicted men, upon receipt of the 
above-mentioned letter by the village&#8217;s inhabitants. A.J., convicted for 15 years in the first 
instance, was convicted and sentenced to 2 year suspended prison term upon appeal. Z.N., 
convicted for 15 years in the first instance, was released after the appeal. The 15-year conviction 
for K.B. was reduced to 10 years. M.T. was convicted for 10 years in the first instance and to 
8 years imprisonment after appeal. Concern was expressed that the court judgments on first </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 102 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>instance and on appeal did not take into consideration the gravity of the crime. It was further 
alleged that the judges were influenced by the village&#8217;s inhabitants and the perpetrators&#8217; 
relatives. 
</p>
<p>178. On 20 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
several cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment, which have been brought to our attention. 
According to the information received, R.D. and A.R., both aged 17, are orphans under state 
supervision. Both were, for the first time, detained in March 2008. During their detention, they 
were ill-treated by several investigators of the Pervomaisky District Department of Interior. At 
the time, a criminal case was instituted against the alleged perpetrators. However, the latter were 
eventually released. On 4 October 2008, the same investigators re-arrested R.D. and A.R. in 
Bishkek and took them to the Pervomaisky District police station, where they put a plastic bag 
over their heads pretending to choke them in order to make them confess to a crime committed 
on 9 September 2008. As a result of that treatment, R.D. and A.R. suffered from headaches and 
psychological trauma. Their legal representatives and lawyers were not informed about their 
arrest. They were subsequently transferred to the Investigation Isolator for juveniles in 
Bishkek, where they remained. On 4 November 2008, a police officer arrested 
Mr. Tynchtykbek Zhakypbekov at his home in Karakol without a warrant using violence. He 
then transferred him to the Jety-Oguz police station, where four officers subjected him to severe 
beatings with sticks, fists and a chair on his back, feet, hips and head and threatened with 
breaking his backbone and rape. The objective was reportedly to make him confess to the theft of 
a horse from Zhonbulak village. However, Mr. Zhakypbekov did not make any confession. He 
was hospitalized later that day. As a result of the beatings, Mr. Zhakypbekov suffered from 
craniocerebral injury and a concussion. He was still undergoing medical treatment in the 
Traumatology Division of Issyk-Kul regional hospital. On 6 November 2008, he filed a 
complaint with the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Issyk-Kul area and the Ombudsman of the 
Kyrgyz Republic. Mr. Maksat Bazarbaev, a resident of Naryn, was arrested without a warrant on 
8 August 2008 by three policemen from the Naryn Criminal Investigation Department, an 
official from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reportedly referred to as Sultan, and a policeman 
referred to as Arstan. He was suspected of murder. Mr. Bazarbaev was taken to Kara-Balta, 
where the crime had taken place. There he was handcuffed, suspended from a tree and beaten on 
his genitals. A plastic bag was placed on his head and he was threatened. At about 11 p.m., 
Mr. Bazarbaev was taken to Kara-Balta Ministry of Interior Department, where an official 
referred to as Kubich subjected him to beatings on his ears, feet, kidneys, and stomach. The 
beatings and attempted suffocation continued on the following days with the aim of obtaining a 
confession. As a result, Mr. Bazarbaev suffered from kidney problems, hypostasis and multiple 
contusions. Since 8 August 2008, he has had access to his lawyer only once. Whereas a doctor 
who visited him stated that Mr. Bazarbaev should have been hospitalized, he was transferred 
back and forth from different police departments in Sukuluk, Moskovaskaya area, Issyk-Atinsk 
area. Mr. Bazarbaev remained in detention. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental 
integrity of the above mentioned individuals.

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>179. On 4 August 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 23 April 2008, stating 
that on 20 February 2008, Ms. K. Oskonbaeva filed a complaint against Ms. O. Almanbetova </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p>with the Aksyisky district internal affairs office, accusing her of criminal mischief (hooliganism) 
committed against the complainant and her sister, Ms. N. Myrzabekova. The investigation found 
that there were grounds for the complaint. Accordingly, on 20 February 2008, the internal affairs 
office&#8217;s investigation service instituted criminal proceedings under article 234, part 3, 
paragraph 2, of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code, dealing with criminal mischief (hooliganism). On the 
same day, Ms. Almanbetova was arrested for the acts in question, in accordance with article 94 
of the Kyrgyz Code of Criminal Procedure, and taken into police custody at the Aksyisky district 
internal affairs office. On 22 February 2008, Ms. Almanbetova, in the presence of counsel and of 
human rights defender Ms. S. Varavina, was charged with the offence described in article 234, 
part 3, paragraph 2, of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code, and the Aksyisky district court issued a 
pretrial restraining order authorizing her detention. On 25 February 2008, the investigator called 
for a psychiatric report to be done, on an inpatient basis, to determine whether Ms. Almanbetova 
was fit to stand trial. (In 2002, Ms. Almanbetova had previously been convicted for acts of 
criminal mischief (hooliganism) and had undergone compulsory treatment at a psychiatric 
hospital.) On 14 March 2008, experts at the national psychiatric hospital in the settlement of 
Kyzyl Zhar-12 issued finding No. 11, according to which Ms. Almanbetova was suffering from a 
psychological disorder, &#8220;epileptic dementia&#8221;, and was thus incapable of understanding and 
controlling her actions. She was found to be unfit to plead her case, and it was recommended that 
she undergo compulsory treatment at a psychiatric hospital and be kept under routine 
observation. On 27 March 2008, following the investigation, the criminal case was referred to 
the Aksyisky district court with a view to the application of compulsory medical measures. The 
court issued a decision finding Ms. Almanbetova guilty of the offence in question, and the 
criminal case against her was closed. She was sent to the psychiatric hospital in the settlement of 
Kyzyl-Zhar for compulsory treatment, with routine observation. As for the question of measures 
taken against the staff of the Aksyisky district internal affairs office, on 23 February 2008 the 
head of the human rights NGO Nadezhda i Mir (Hope and Peace), Ms. S. Varavina, filed a 
complaint alleging that Ms. Almanbetova had been raped on the night of 21 February 2008 while 
in custody at the Aksyisky district internal affairs office. The case in question was investigated 
by the Aksyisky district deputy procurator, Mr. E. Mizambekov, who on 25 February 2008 
ordered a forensic medical examination to be carried out. On 26 February 2008, 
Ms. Almanbetova, in the presence of the human rights defender, Ms. Varavina, was unable to 
identify from among the staff of the Aksyisky district internal affairs office the persons who had 
allegedly raped her on the night of 21 February 2008. The forensic medical report concluded that 
Ms. Almanbetova had sustained minor facial injuries in the form of superficial scratches, with no 
short-term health effects, and which might have been caused by an impact with a wall or the 
corner of a bed, or possibly by a fall. No signs of sexual assault were found. In the light of the 
findings, the district procurator&#8217;s office decided not to institute criminal proceedings, as there 
had been no criminal act. The material in question was examined by the Jalalabad provincial 
procurator&#8217;s office, which found that the decision taken was justified. The allegation that 
Ms. Almanbetova was raped by staff of the Aksyisky district internal affairs office has thus been 
found to be unreliable. Furthermore, Ms. Almanbetova has not filed a statement with the national 
Procurator-General&#8217;s Office. It should be noted that the entire investigation of 
Ms. Almanbetova&#8217;s case took place with the participation of defence counsel. The assertions that 
the investigator submitted for signature documents in Russian, without making them public, are 
untrue; the proceedings in the criminal case were conducted in the national language. There were 
no violations of the legislation on criminal procedure during the handling of the case, nor were 
there any violations of Ms. Almanbetova&#8217;s rights. </p>

<p>185. On 21 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief, and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the case of Mr P. Uthayakumar, Legal Adviser of 
the Hindu Human Rights Action Force (HINDRAF), Mr M. Manoharan, Counsel of HINDRAF, 
Mr R. Kenghadharan, Counsel of HINDRAF, Mr V. Ganabatirau and Mr T. Vasanthakumar, 
members of HINDRAF. The five human rights activists were the subject of an urgent appeal sent 
on 27 December 2007 by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation 
of human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteurs acknowledged the response of the 
Government sent on 8 February 2008. According to new information received, since their arrest 
on 13 December 2007 under Section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act for allegedly carrying out 
activities that threatened national security, Mr P. Uthayakumar, Mr M. Manoharan, 
Mr R. Kenghadharan, Mr V. Ganabatirau and Mr T. Vasanthakumar have been kept in solitary 
confinement for more than 16 hours a day, and have been exposed to light continuously in order 
to prevent them from sleeping and to disorientate them. Furthermore, Mr P. Uthayakumar and 
Mr M. Manoharan are diabetic and access to appropriate medication has reportedly been denied. 
On 7 April 2008, Mr P. Uthayakumar collapsed in his cell and was taken to a doctor who 
diagnosed a heart condition. Although they have access to their lawyers, it was reported that 
discussions between the aforementioned human rights activists and their lawyer have been 
monitored by guards who have taken notes of what was said. Finally, they were denied their 
right to worship. They did not have access to temples and prayer rooms and no time to worship 
was allocated to them. In view of the above reports, serious concern was expressed for the 
physical and psychological integrity of P. Uthayakumar, M. Manoharan, R. Kenghadharan, </p>

<p>V. Ganabatirau and T. Vasanthakumar. Further concern was reiterated that their arrest and 
detention may be solely linked to their reportedly non-violent activities in defense of human 
rights - in particular the rights of members of the Indian community in Malaysia - in the exercise 
of their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. 
</p>
<p>186. On 19 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Raja Petra Kamaruddin, editor and founder of the online newspaper <i>Malaysia Today</i>. 
According to information received, on 12 September 2008, Mr Raja Petra Kamaruddin was 
arrested, together with Ms Teresa Kok, a Member of Parliament with the Democratic Action 
Party (DAP) and State Legislative Councilor, and Ms Tan Hoon Cheng, a senior journalist with 
Chinese-language newspaper <i>Sin Chew Daily</i>, under Section 73 (1) of the Internal Security Act 
(ISA) for allegedly posing a threat to &#8220;security, peace and public order&#8221;. In accordance with 
Section 73 (1) of the Act, individuals can be detained for up to sixty days without trial, and 
thereafter for a period of two years should the Home Ministry decide to extend the detention 
order. Mr Raja Petra Kamaruddin was arrested at this home in Sunglai Buloh, in the province of 
Selangor, at approximately 1:00 p.m., by ten police officers who took him for questioning to an 
unknown location in Bukit Aman. Mr Kumaruddin&#8217;s arrest was apparently related to recent 
comments he made about Islam on the website <i>Malaysia Today</i>. Mr Kamaruddin was facing 
prosecution on alleged charges of defamation and sedition in relation to articles and comments 
he had posted on his website in the past. On 26 August 2008, access to the <i>Malaysia</i> <i>Today</i> 
website was blocked following pressure from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia 
Commission, the State agency charged with oversight of the communications industry. However, 
it became accessible again on 12 September. In 2001, Mr Kumaruddin was arrested for his 
involvement with the National Justice Party. He was responsible for editing the Party&#8217;s 
newspaper, the content of which was deemed as &#8216;seditious&#8217; by the authorities. Mr Kamaruddin 
remains in detention in Bukit Aman. The exact location of his detention is unknown. However 
reports claim that he was possibly being held at the main police headquarters in Bukit Aman, 
where he was granted a visit by his wife and daughters on 16 September. He was due to meet 
with his lawyer on 18 September. At approximately 11:00 p.m. on 12 September, Ms Teresa Kok 
was arrested by police officers while on her way home. She was taken to an unknown location in 
Bukit Aman. On 15 September, Ms Kok received a visit from her family at the Bukit Aman 
police headquarters. During the visit she apparently indicated that she was being well treated, but 
that she was suffering from low blood pressure, according to a medical check she received while 
in detention. Ms Kok remained in detention at an undisclosed location in Bukit Aman and the 
reason for her arrest is unclear. Ms Teresa Kok was reportedly released on 19 September 2008. 
Ms Tan Hoon Cheng was arrested at her home in Penang in the evening of 12 September. Her 
arrest was reportedly related to an article she had written citing comments made by Minister 
Ahmad Ismail, the Malay leader of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), 
who allegedly referred to Malaysians of Chinese origin as &#8220;squatters&#8221;. Ms Cheng was taken into 
police custody for questioning in relation to her work. She was released 16 hours later, without 
charge. During a press conference on 13 September, the Interior Minister reportedly stated that 
the he had not ordered the aforementioned arrests and that he was unable to intervene, unless a 
decision was taken in accordance with the police. Lawyers acting for Mr Raja Petra Kamaruddin 
were due to file a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release. The application was expected to be </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>filed at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 15 September 2008. Concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned events may represent a direct attempt to prevent independent reporting in 
Malaysia, thus stifling freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>187. On 12 December 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 19 September 2008, 
stating that the summary of the case outlined by the experts in the communication is not entirely 
accurate. At the outset, the Government of Malaysia informs about the facts leading to the arrests 
of Mr. Kamaruddin, Ms Teresa Kok and Ms Tan Hoon Cheng as well as the subsequent release 
of the latter two individuals. All three individuals were arrested on 12 September 2008 under 
subsection 73 (1) of the Internal Security Act 1960 [Act 82]. Ms. Tan Hoon Cheng was detained 
on the grounds of publishing fabricated news regarding a statement made by Dato&#8217; Ahmad 
Ismail, Division Head, Bukit Bendera UMNO Division, Pulau Pinang that Chinese were mere 
migrants and &#8220;squatters&#8221; in Malaysia. This raised the ire of the Chinese against the Malays. 
Upon further investigation by the police, Ms Tan Hoon Cheng was released on 
13 September 2008 on the grounds that her detention under subsection 73 (1), Act 82 was 
inappropriate to be continued. Ms Teresa Kok was detained on several grounds. The first was 
causing uproar amongst the Malays Muslims by questioning the issue of Azan or the Muslim call 
to prayer and secondly by questioning the usage of the traditional Malay calligraphy known as 
jawi. Regarding the issue of azan, the police received three separate police reports on incidents 
which, according to the Government, caused conflits arising from racial and religious issues and 
are a extremely serious threat to the national security within the Malaysian context. Therefore 
swift and immediate actions had to be taken by the authorities to contain and control any 
possible threat of violence that could affect national security. These had justified the invoking of 
Act 82 or ISA. On 15 September 2008, Teresa&#8217;s father, mother, cousin and her Special Assistant 
were allowed to visit Teresa. On 17 September 2008, Mr Sankara Narayanan a/l Sankaran Nair, 
a counsel of Teresa&#8217;s choice, was given visitation right. On 19 September 2008, Teresa was 
released from detention under subsection 73(1), Act 82 as there were no grounds to continue 
Ms Teresa Kok&#8217;s detention. Mr. Kamaruddin was detained on 12 September 2008 under 
subsection 73 (1), Act 82 due to his involvement in publishing articles in his blog site &#8220;Malaysia 
Today&#8221;. The Government informs that these articles were blasphemous to Islam and were also 
tarnishing the country&#8217;s leadership to an extent that these articles had caused confusion amongst 
the populace and threatened to jeopardise national security of Malaysia. Mr. Kamaruddin had 
published an article entitled &#8220;Let&#8217;s Send Altantuya Murderers to Hell&#8221; in his blog &#8220;Malaysia 
Today&#8221; which had falsely accused a prominent leader in the Malaysian Government to be 
involved in the murder of a Mongolian national Altantuya Shaaribu. TheGovernment informs 
that this article had affected the public&#8217;s confidence and caused the public&#8217;s hatred of the 
particular leader. It had also affected diplomatic relations between Malaysia and Mongolia. 
Mr. Kamaruddin had published or allowed to be pulished in his blog &#8220;Malaysia Today&#8221; the 
articles &#8220;Malay, The enemy of Ismal&#8221;, &#8220;I Promise to be a Good, Non-Hypocritical Muslim&#8221; and 
&#8220;Not all Arabs are Descendants of the Prophet&#8221; on 16 January 2008, 8 August 2008 and 
26 August 2008 respectively, which, according to the Government, had caused extreme anger 
amongst the Muslims, mainly of the Malay race, hatred between Muslims and non-Muslims in 
Malaysia and had seriously affected national security and interest. Numerous police reports 
lodged by various Muslim Organisations in Malaysia on these articles were one of the reasons 
for Mr. Kamaruddin&#8217;s arrest and detention under the ISA. On September 2008, 
Mr. Kamaruddin&#8217;s wife and children were allowed to visit him. On 17 and 19 September 2008, </p>

<p>Mr. Kamaruddin&#8217;s counsel of his own choice was allowed to visit him. The four lawyers acting 
for Mr. Kamaruddin have filed the writ of habeas corpus and the trial of the matter began on 
23 September 2008. The matter was scheduled to be continued for trial on 28 October 2008. The 
lawyers subsequently filed another writ at the High Court in Shah Alarm and the matter had been 
fixed for trial on 22 October 2008. The presiding High Court Judge allowed the writ of habeas 
corpus on 7 November 2008 and was subsequently released from his ISA detention. 
Mr. Kamarudedin was detained under section 73 (1), Act 82 at the Detention Centre, Royal 
Malaysian Police Headquarters from 12-22 September 2008. Upon the issuance of the Detention 
Order by the Minister of Home Affairs under paragraph 8 (c), Act 82, Mr. Kamaruddin was 
detained at the Protective Detention Centre in Taiping, Perak from 22 September 2008. Upon the 
inssuance of the writ of habeas corpus by the High Cout of 7 November 2008, Mr. Kamaruddin 
was released from the said Protective Detention Centre. The Government informs that Act 82 is 
a law passed by the Malaysia on preventive detention for the internal security of Malaysia, the 
prevention of subversion, the suppression of organized violence against persons and property in 
specified areas of Malaysia, and for matters incidental thereto. Article 149 of the Federal 
Constitution provides the power to the Parliament to enact preventive laws for the purposes as 
stated above. The provisions under Act 82 authorize the preventive detention to the Minister of 
Home Affairs as provided under section 8 and the police as police provided under section 73. 
The Government of Malaysia wishes also to inform the Experts that the Malaysian courts may 
exercise judicial review in respect of detention orders issued under sections 73 and 8 of Act 82. 
According to jurisprudence, the discretion of the police in issuing detention orders under 
section 73 of Act 82 can be subject to judicial review by the court. In this regard, the burden of 
proof is on the police to prove the satisfaction of the court that the requirements of the existence 
of the reasons justifying the detention of a person under section 73 have been fulfilled. In respect 
of detention order issued by the Minister pursuant to section 8 of Act 82, section 8B provides 
that the procedural matteres of the detention orders shall be subjected to judicial review. In the 
case of Abd Malek Hussin v. Borhan Hj Daud &amp; Ors [2008] 1 CLJ 264, it was held that the first 
Defendant has to provide sufficient material evidence and particulary to show the basis of his 
reason to believe that the detention of the plaintiff was necessary to prevent him from acting in a 
manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia and further that the plaintiff had act (or was likely 
to act or was about to act) in a manner prejudicial to the security of the country. The Government 
of highlights that the legal rights provided to all persons detained under Act 82 and the 
application of the Act in compliance with the rule of law. In this connection, the Governmnet 
indicates various available safeguards under the Malaysian law including the detainee&#8217;s right to 
be informed of the reasons and grounds for his detention, his right to make representations and 
his right to counsel. The Government of Malaysia informs that the alleged arrest and detention of 
Mr. Kamaruddin by the Malaysian police was reasonable and necessary for the protection of 
national security and public order. His detention was necessary to prevent him from acting in any 
manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia. His detention was in accordance with the 
provisions of the law. Thus, the Government of Malaysia is of the view that the alleged arrest 
and detention are compatible with international norms and standards on freedom of opinion and 
expression as contained in the UDHR, the ICCPR and the Declaration on Human Rights 
Defenders. 
</p>
<p>188. On 19 December 2008, the Government of Malaysia replied to the communication 
of 21 April 2008 (the Government&#8217;s reply was received by the Office of the High Commissioner 
of Human Rights on 6 April 2009). In its letter, the Government informs that the Hindu Human </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rights Action Force (henceforth HINDRAF) is a non-registered society. It furthermore points to 
the activities of HINDRAF carried out at the end of 2007 which led to the arrest of 
Mr M. Manoharan, Mr R. Kenghadharan, Mr V. Ganabatirau and Mr T. Vasanthakumar under 
section 8 (1) of the Internal Security Act 1960 on the grounds that they were a threat to public 
order and security. The Government further informs about the placement of the above-mentioned 
individuals in the Detention protection Center Kamuntin, Taiping, Perak. Moreover, the 
Government informs about conditions of detention. With regard to the question of the 
confidentiality of the meetings between the detainees and their lawyers, the Government informs 
that - according to the existing procedure - the prison officers would stay in the meeting room 
during the meeting between the detainees and their lawyers. However, the prison officers did not 
record what was said in the meeting, which - according to the Government - is in compliance 
with Regulation 81 (5) of the Internal Security (Detainee) Rules 1960 qhich requires meeting 
surveillance to be done on the method of vision and hearing. The Government further informs 
that, due to protest from Mr. P. Uthayakumar, a direction was issued on 12 May 2008 requiring 
meeting surveillance to be carried out in a manner where such surveillance will take place at a 
range where the conversation can be seen and heard and this does not necessarily mean that the 
prison officers are required to sit together with the detainee and his lawyer in the same room. 
Due to such detention, surveillance was henceforth carried outside the meeting room. The 
Government also indicates that the Internal Security Act 1960 (Act 82) provides for the right to 
be represented in front of the Advisory Board which is also perceived as judiciary inquiry. The 
purpose of the representation in front of the Advisory Board is to enable the detainees to submit 
their defence against the validity of the detention order made against them. The Government 
further informs that during the proceedings before the Advosiry Board, the above-mentioned 
individuals were represented by lawyers of their choice (between 5 to 7 lawyers) who were able 
to call for witnesses to support their defence. The Advisory Board made a review of detention on 
1 July 2008 under section 13 of Act 82. The Government further details that section 73 of the 
Internal Security Act permits arrest without warrant and detention by the police not exceeding 
sixty days unless with a written order by the Minister pursuant to section 8. Section 8 of the 
Internal Security Act also provides the Minister with the power to order detention of any person 
without trial for up to two years on the ground that the detention is necessary to prvent the 
person from acting in any manner prejudicial to national security. Such detention order may be 
renewed for a further period not exceeding two years at a time. A person detained can petition to 
the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus to be issued. Section 11 of the Internal Security Act 
provides that any person against whom an order by the Minister under section 8 has been made 
shall be entitled to make representations against that order to an Advisory Board. Section 13 of 
the Internal Security Act provides that any detention order made by the Minister under section 8 
of the ISA shall be reviewed not less than once in every six months by an Advisory Board.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>189. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Malaysia for its detailed 
replies of 12 and 19 December 2008. With regard to the reply of 19 December 2008, he wishes 
to point to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August 
to 7 September 1990, in particular principle 22 which stipulates that &#8220;Governments shall 
recognize and respect that all communications and consultations between lawyers and their 
clients within their professional relationship are confidential&#8221;, and principle 8 which states that 
&#8220;All arrested, detained or imprisoned persons shall be provided with adequate opportunities, time </p>

<p>and facilities to be visited by and to communicate and consult with a lawyer, without delay, 
interception or censorship and in full confidentiality. Such consultations may be within sight, but

Government of Malaysia, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the long period of 
detention without effective judicial control.

<p>190. On 12 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers welcomes the 
ratification of the new Constitution by the President, on 7th August 2008. It demonstrates 
the progress made by Maldives towards the democratic principles and the rule of law, in 
particular, the independence of the judiciary. 
The new Constitution is the culmination of almost four years of work of the Special Majilis 
(Constitutional Assembly). It establishes separation of powers and recognizes the 
independence of the judiciary. It also contains provisions for the establishment of a 
Supreme Court and the post of a Prosecutor General. Furthermore, the Constitution 
provides the creation of a Judicial Service Commission, an independent body, which will 
decide on appointment, dismissal and discipline for judges. 
The Special Rapporteur notes that these provisions are in line with his recommendations, 
made after his visit to the country, in February 2007. The Special Rapporteur expresses his 
satisfaction and calls on the Government to effectively implement the Constitution.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>On 3 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the run-off in the first multi-party presidential elections in the Maldives, 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro 
Despouy, welcomes the democratic transition process and congratulates the people of 
the Maldives who have been the central actors of the reform. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur expresses profound appreciation for the work of all the 
members of the Government presided by Mr. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom for the 
political and institutional reform process during the past four years that culminated in 
the adoption of the new constitution in August this year and the subsequent conduct 
of the first multi-party presidential elections.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur congratulates the newly elected President Mohamed 
Nasheed on his election and underlines that there are great expectations towards the 
incoming President to pursue the legal and judicial reforms in accordance with the 
new Constitution and international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>Following his visit to the country in February 2007, the Special Rapporteur had 
addressed several recommendations to the Government to reform the judicial system, 
the majority of which have been introduced through the recent changes. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 113 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In his recent presentation to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur 
underlined that the Maldives&#8217; transition process provides a very interesting example 
of the benefits that can flow from a constructive dialogue between States and the 
UN&#8217;s human rights machinery. The precedent set with the Maldives should be 
considered as an example of &#8220;best practices&#8221; and can act as an inspiration for the 
entire region, particularly small Island States considering or implementing similar 
human rights reforms. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur would like to join the Secretary General in congratulating 
the Maldives and encouraging the political parties to work in a cooperative manner 
and continue to carry forward the reform process in the field of justice. In this 
connection, Mr. Despouy calls for a greater participation of women in public affairs, 
in particular in the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the United Nations 
to direct efforts for collaboration, particularly through its technical cooperation 
mechanisms, to further reform initiatives already taken by the Maldives.&#8221;

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>191. On 28 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte, founder of the National Movement for Human Rights, 
former General Coordinator of the State Program for Education in Human Rights, long-term 
employee of the Commission of Pontifical Justice and Peace in the arch-diocese of Natal, and 
member of the National Committee of Human Rights, the Centre of Human Rights and Popular 
Memory, and the State Council of Human Rights. He was also central to the creation of DHNet, 
a website which provides information on the issue of human rights. According to information 
received, in late October 2005, an accusation was made to the Military Court by the Military 
Public Attorney against Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte. The accusation came after 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte gave a lecture entitled &#8220;Human Rights - Thing of the Police&#8221; at an 
event organized by the Association of Soldiers of the Brazilian Army. In his lecture 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte promoted respect for the rule of law within the armed forces, 
defended the creation of human rights commissions for the armed forces, and objected to the ban 
on unionization for soldiers. He also raised registered cases of internal human rights abuses in 
the army whereby members of the military were allegedly deprived of sleep, forced to drink 
chicken&#8217;s blood, and made remain on their knees in ant colonies. On 24 January 2008, the 
Military Public Attorney, who had objected to what he considered inappropriate comparisons 
between current and former army officials by Mr Roberto de Oliveira in the lecture, filed a 
complaint against Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte for incitement to disobedience and offense to 
the Armed Forces under Articles 155 and 219 of the Military Penal Code. These charges carry 
possible prison sentences of four years and one year respectively. On 23 July 2008, 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte was scheduled for interrogation at the Special Council of the 
Army&#8217;s Court. This interrogation did not take place, reportedly because there were not enough 
colonels available to represent the Council. No new date for the interrogation was given. 
Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte was the only civilian out of a total of 14 defendants in the process 
Number 20/08-0, in the 7th Division of the Military Court, established in relation with the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>declarations realized during the Congress of Military Law. In addition to Mr Roberto de Oliveira 
Monte, the colonel of the Military Police of Alagoas Joilson Gouveia was charged as well as the 
Army Sergeants Anderson Rog&#233;rio dos Santos, Lindomar de Oliveira, Dalton Sim&#227;o, 
S&#237;lvio Pekanoski, Francisco Ribeiro, Francisco Lima, Ant&#244;nio Lima, Lasser Saleh, Alberto dos 
Santos, Francisco Bezerra, Marcos Fran&#231;a and Edvaldo da Silva. Concern was expressed that the 
charges brought against Mr Roberto de Oliveira Monte may be related to his legitimate activities 
in the defense of human rights, in particular his activities to promote human rights within the 
armed forces.

tortura y la Vice-Presidenta del Grupo de Trabajo sobre la Detenci&#243;n Arbitraria envi&#243; un 
llamamiento urgente con relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n del Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Tornez Hern&#225;ndez. Seg&#250;n 
las informaciones recibidas el Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Tornez Hern&#225;ndez fue arrestado el 2 de abril de 
2008 cuando se present&#243; voluntariamente a los locales de la Polic&#237;a Judicial del Estado de 
Guerrero en el Municipio de Ayutla de los Libres para aclarar su participaci&#243;n en un caso de 
asesinato y robo de cuatro agentes policiales y un funcionario p&#250;blico. El Sr. Tornez habr&#237;a sido 
detenido sin cargos, interrogado con los ojos vendados y habr&#237;a sufrido agresiones verbales, 
amenazas y descargas el&#233;ctricas para obligarle a confesar su participaci&#243;n en dichos cr&#237;menes. 
Posteriormente, un juez autoriz&#243; su puesta en &#8220;arraigo&#8221; en el estado de Guerrero. El 5 de abril de 
2008 fue trasladado a otro centro de arraigo gestionado por la Procuradur&#237;a General de la 
Rep&#250;blica en la Ciudad de M&#233;xico, sin que su familia fuese informada de dicho traslado. Sus 
posibilidades de comunicarse con sus familiares o con el mundo exterior habr&#237;an sido seriamente 
limitadas por estas medidas. Se informa tambi&#233;n que no se ha permitido que el Sr. Tornez 
Hern&#225;ndez sea representado por abogados de una organizaci&#243;n local no-gubernamental de 
derechos humanos y que en su lugar se le ha designado un abogado de oficio. Asimismo, los 
expertos fueron informados de que una de las hermanas del Sr. Tornez Hern&#225;ndez, la Sra. 
Yesenia Tornez Hern&#225;ndez, fue interrogada bajo tortura para obligarla a declarar d&#243;nde se 
encontraba su hermano. Los expertos expresaron su temor de que el Sr. Tornez Hern&#225;ndez, dado 
el grado de imposibilidad de comunicaci&#243;n con el mundo exterior y las dificultades para preparar 
su defensa, sea sujeto de un proceso judicial que no re&#250;na las condiciones necesarias del debido 
proceso legal, ni las garant&#237;as judiciales suficientes.<b>

a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de M&#233;xico la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con los Sres. Natalio 
Ortega Cruz, Romualdo Santiago Enedina, Ra&#250;l Hern&#225;ndez Abundio, Orlando Manzanarez 
Lorenzo, Manuel Cruz Victoriano y Cuauht&#233;moc Ram&#237;rez. El Sr. Ram&#237;rez es presidente de la 
Organizaci&#243;n del Pueblo Ind&#237;gena Me Phaa (OPIM) en la localidad de Ayutla de los Libres, 
Estado de Guerrero, las dem&#225;s personas mencionadas son integrantes de dicha organizaci&#243;n. De 
acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas el 24 de abril de 2008, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia 
del Municipio de Ayutla de los Libres habr&#237;a dictado un auto de formal prisi&#243;n contra los cinco 
integrantes de la OPIM antes mencionados. La detenci&#243;n de los cinco se habr&#237;a efectuado el 
18 de abril, luego de que, el 11 de abril, fueron dictadas &#243;rdenes de aprehensi&#243;n en su contra, as&#237; 
como contra otros 10 miembros de la OPIM, por su supuesta participaci&#243;n en el asesinato del Sr. 
Alejandro Feliciano Garc&#237;a, cometido el 1 de enero de 2008. Seg&#250;n los informes, hasta la fecha, 
la investigaci&#243;n del asesinato no habr&#237;a hecho mayores progresos. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, el juez 
se habr&#237;a negado a recibir las declaraciones de los detenidos tras afirmar que no dispon&#237;a del 
tiempo suficiente para leerlas, a pesar de que fueron entregadas antes del vencimiento del plazo 
correspondiente. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n, antes de conducirles a la prisi&#243;n municipal, 
agentes de la polic&#237;a habr&#237;an amenazado a los detenidos con matarles y torturarles. Estas cinco 
personas se encontrar&#237;an detenidas en el Centro de Readaptaci&#243;n Social de Ayutla de los Libres. 
No se les habr&#237;a permitido prestar declaraci&#243;n hasta el 15 de mayo, tras la presentaci&#243;n de un 
recurso de amparo. Se alega que la detenci&#243;n de estos cinco integrantes de la OPIM y los cargos 
formulados contra ellos podr&#237;an estar directamente relacionados con sus actividades leg&#237;timas 
para promover los derechos de las comunidades ind&#237;genas Me&#8217;phaa. Los expertos expresaron su 
temor de que su detenci&#243;n y las diligencias judiciales posteriores podr&#237;an formar parte de una 
pol&#237;tica de hostigamiento sistem&#225;tico y de criminalizaci&#243;n en contra de las organizaciones 
ind&#237;genas y campesinas del Estado de Guerrero.<b>

<p>195. El 26 de mayo de 2008 el Relator Especial conjuntamente con el Relator Especial sobre la 
promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y la Relatora Especial sobre la violencia 
contra la mujer, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente para se&#241;alar a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de M&#233;xico 
la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n a la situaci&#243;n de la Sra. Luz Estela Castro Rodr&#237;guez 
(conocida como Lucha Castro), Directora del <i>Centro de Derechos Humanos de las Mujeres, A.C.</i> 
y abogada de la organizaci&#243;n no gubernamental <i>Justicia para Nuestras Hijas</i>, quien trabaja en la 
defensa de los derechos de las mujeres en el contexto de la violencia de g&#233;nero y los femicidios 
en el Estado de Chihuahua. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el 14 de mayo de 2008, 
la Sra. Luz Estela Castro habr&#237;a sido amenazada en dos ocasiones, a las 10 y luego a las 11 de la 
ma&#241;ana, mediante llamadas a su tel&#233;fono celular. Durante la segunda llamada, el interlocutor le 
habr&#237;a advertido &#8220;te va a llevar la chingada y a tu pinche Centro tambi&#233;n&#8221;. Tras estos hechos, la 
Sra. Castro habr&#237;a presentado una denuncia ante la Procuradur&#237;a estatal, donde habr&#237;a solicitado 
que se le otorgaran medidas de protecci&#243;n y que se realizara una investigaci&#243;n de los mismos. 
Desde el 14 de mayo la Sra. Lucha Castro estar&#237;a acompa&#241;ada por dos agentes. El 13 de mayo, la 
Sra. Castro habr&#237;a participado en una manifestaci&#243;n convocada por la ONG <i>Justicia para 
Nuestra Hijas</i>, con ocasi&#243;n del quinto aniversario del asesinato de la joven Neyra Azucena 
Cervantes, quien fue asesinada en 2003, cuando ten&#237;a 19 a&#241;os. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, esta 
amenaza tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a sido resultado de una declaraci&#243;n de la Sra. Castro, en la cual se 
pronunci&#243; por la salida del ej&#233;rcito mexicano del Estado de Chihuahua. Anteriormente, la </p>

<p>susodicha, en su calidad de abogada de la organizaci&#243;n <i>Justicia para Nuestras Hijas</i>, se habr&#237;a 
manifestado en contra del nuevo sistema de justicia penal que entr&#243; en vigencia a principios de 
2008, el cual, seg&#250;n la Sra. Castro, no lograr&#237;a una mayor protecci&#243;n de las mujeres, respecto a la 
violencia familiar. Cabe recordar que, seg&#250;n cifras de organizaciones de derechos humanos, m&#225;s 
de 430 mujeres y ni&#241;as han sido asesinadas en el Estado de Chihuahua, junto con Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, 
desde 1993 hasta la fecha, y que m&#225;s de 40 est&#225;n en paradero desconocido. Se expres&#243; 
preocupaci&#243;n por las amenazas en contra de la Sra. Castro Rodr&#237;guez porque se teme que estos 
incidentes puedan estar relacionados con sus actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos y 
podr&#237;an formar parte de un intento de impedir sus actividades en defensa de los derechos de las 
mujeres. Se expres&#243; profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de la Sra. 
Castro.<b>

<p>196. El 22 de julio de 2008 el Relator Especial envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente junto con el 
Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, el 
Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de

Natalio Ortega Cruz, Ra&#250;l Hern&#225;ndez Abundio y Romualdo Santiago Enedina, todos integrantes 
de la Organizaci&#243;n del Pueblo Ind&#237;gena Me&#8217;phaa (OPIM) quienes est&#225;n detenidos desde el 17 de 
abril de 2008. Estos integrantes de la OPIM fueron objeto de un llamamiento urgente emitido el 
21 de mayo de 2008. Al momento del env&#237;o del presente llamamiento urgente no se hab&#237;a 
recibido respuesta del gobierno. Seg&#250;n las nuevas informaciones recibidas el 7 de julio de 2008, 
los cinco detenidos habr&#237;an presentado el amparo N&#250;mero 982/2008 ante la Justicia Federal 
como reclamaci&#243;n en contra del auto de formal prisi&#243;n que el Juez Mixto de Primera Instancia 
habr&#237;a dictado el 23 de abril de 2008 por el supuesto homicidio del Sr. Alejandro Feliciano 
Garc&#237;a. Aunque no habr&#237;a recibido suficiente evidencia el Juez Mixto de Primera Instancia de 
Ayutla, supuestamente bajo presiones pol&#237;ticas, habr&#237;a sometido a los integrantes de la OPIM a 
un procedimiento de diez meses durante los que permanecer&#237;an en detenci&#243;n. Sin embargo, el 
9 de julio de 2008 tres testigos habr&#237;an presentado nueva evidencia que habr&#237;a probado que el 
expediente en contra de los detenidos habr&#237;a sido fabricado. Por otra parte, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n 
remitida, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH) habr&#237;a solicitado al Estado 
Mexicano que ampl&#237;e a favor de los cinco ind&#237;genas de El Camalote presos en Ayutla, las 
medidas cautelares que otorg&#243; a l&#237;deres e integrantes de la OPIM desde el a&#241;o 2005. En su 
resoluci&#243;n del viernes 27 de junio de 2008, la CIDH tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a pedido extender las medidas 
de seguridad necesarias para l&#237;deres en comunidades y miembros de la OPIM que tienen orden 
de aprehensi&#243;n por el mismo delito, as&#237; como para aquellos otros integrantes que tienen el 
car&#225;cter de l&#237;deres comunitarios y un trabajo importante en la organizaci&#243;n. Los expertos 
expresaron su temor porque la detenci&#243;n de los cinco integrantes de la OPIM y los cargos contra 
ellos podr&#237;an estar relacionados con sus actividades, en particular su trabajo en defensa de los 
derechos de las comunidades ind&#237;genas Me&#8217;phaa. Tambi&#233;n se teme que la acci&#243;n judicial contra 
ellos podr&#237;a formar parte de un hostigamiento sistem&#225;tico en contra de las organizaciones 
ind&#237;genas y campesinas del Estado de Guerrero.<b>

C&#233;sar Armando G&#243;mez Lince Sardaneta, quien seg&#250;n se indica, desea seguir viviendo con su 
abuela, la que a su vez desea se le confirme definitivamente la custodia de su nieto. Por otra 
parte, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el juicio habr&#237;a sido prolongado de manera excesiva, y la 
sentencia no habr&#237;a tenido en cuenta la opini&#243;n y los deseos claramente expresados por el ni&#241;o, 
ni otras pruebas cient&#237;ficas y documentales.

<p>199. El 4 de agosto de 2008 el Gobierno envi&#243; respuesta al llamamiento urgente enviado 
el 14 de abril de 2008. Seg&#250;n dicha respuesta el 4 de abril de 2008 el Ministerio P&#250;blico solicit&#243; 
al Juez Penal del Distrito Judicial de Allende Ayutla de los Libres Guerrero una orden de arraigo 
para el Sr. Miguel &#193;ngel Tornez Hern&#225;ndez por el t&#233;rmino de 30 d&#237;as, medida que 
posteriormente fue ampliada por 30 d&#237;as m&#225;s, debido a que se requer&#237;an mayores elementos para 
comprobar su presunta responsabilidad en un hecho delictivo y por considerar que exist&#237;a el 
temor fundado que el Sr. Tornez se ausentara o se ocultara antes de que las investigaciones 
concluyeran. Respecto a la pregunta sobre si se ha presentado alguna queja, el Gobierno indic&#243; 
que representantes de la Comisi&#243;n de Defensa de los Derechos Humanos del estado de Guerrero 
(CDDH Gro), a partir de la solicitud de una organizaci&#243;n de la sociedad civil, brindaron apoyo al 
Sr. Tornez Mayo (padre) para que promoviera recurso extraordinario de exhibici&#243;n de persona

informa, el Coordinador de la Polic&#237;a Ministerial present&#243; al Sr. Tornez, aclarando que su 
presencia se deb&#237;a &#250;nicamente a que deb&#237;a rendir su declaraci&#243;n y que no se encontraba en

por parte de elementos de la Polic&#237;a Ministerial, en presencia del Coordinador de Zona de la

de investigar los hechos de tortura; el certificado m&#233;dico concluy&#243; signos de tortura ps&#237;quica con

que obran las siguientes constancias: testimonios de Miguel y Rafael Tornez Mayo, inspecci&#243;n 
ocular en el lugar de los hechos, certificados de lesiones del 7 de abril de 2008 practicados a los 
Sres. Miguel &#193;ngel y Yesenia Tornez Hern&#225;ndez por un m&#233;dico adscrito a la CEDDH Gro, 
solicitudes de informes dirigidas al Procurador General de Justicia y al Secretario de Seguridad

Con relaci&#243;n al hecho de si se han adoptado sanciones de car&#225;cter penal o disciplinario en contra 
de los culpables, el Gobierno ha informado que las averiguaciones previas y las quejas a&#250;n se

</p>
<p>200. El 19 de enero de 2009 el Gobierno envi&#243; respuesta a la carta de alegaci&#243;n enviada el 18 de 
agosto de 2008. Seg&#250;n dicha respuesta el Gobierno inform&#243; que no se encuentra en condiciones 
de determinar la exactitud y veracidad de los hechos dado que el Gobierno de M&#233;xico no tiene 
conocimiento de que el Sr. Uri&#243;stegui Salgado haya utilizado los mecanismos para la protecci&#243;n 
de la libertad en el ejercicio de la profesi&#243;n que establecen tanto la legislaci&#243;n nacional como la 
del estado de Morelos. Con relaci&#243;n a la presentaci&#243;n de alguna queja, la Procuradur&#237;a General 
de Justicia del Estado de Morelos, inform&#243; que luego de que sus autoridades ministeriales 
realizaran una b&#250;squeda exhaustiva en los libros de gobierno de las agencias del Ministerio 
P&#250;blico del Estado de Morelos, no se hall&#243; registro alguno de investigaci&#243;n ministerial o 
averiguaci&#243;n previa que tenga relaci&#243;n con los hechos referidos en la comunicaci&#243;n. Por otra 
parte, la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos del estado de Morelos inform&#243; que en sus archivos no 
existe antecedente de queja por falta de imparcialidad por parte del titular del Juzgado sexto civil 
en materia de familia y de sucesiones del primer distrito judicial del estado de Morelos. El 
Gobierno indic&#243; que aparentemente el Sr. Ur&#243;stegui Salgado no ha denunciado ante instancias 
nacionales de justicia los hechos descritos en la comunicaci&#243;n. Respecto de las medidas 
implementadas por el Gobierno para garantizar el libre ejercicio de la profesi&#243;n de abogados y 
que el Sr. Uri&#243;stegui Salgado no sea v&#237;ctima de represalias el Gobierno inform&#243; que el estado de 
Morelos cuenta desde 1968 con la Ley de Profesiones para el Estado Libre y Soberano de 
Morelos (anexada a la respuesta), la cual regula para ese estado los art&#237;culos de la Constituci&#243;n 
Pol&#237;tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos relativos a la libertad en la elecci&#243;n y el ejercicio 
profesional. Seg&#250;n se indica esta ley cuenta con los mecanismos para el libre ejercicio de una 
profesi&#243;n y establece las facultades y obligaciones que se otorgan a los profesionales para 
obtener su c&#233;dula profesional con efectos de patente. En lo relativo a posibles represalias por 
parte de representantes del Consejo de la Judicatura del Poder Judicial del estado de Morelos en 
contra del Sr. Uri&#243;stegui Salgado, el Gobierno informa, que la Ley Org&#225;nica del Poder Judicial 
del estado de Morelos establece mecanismos de defensa a los cuales se puede recurrir en casos 
de acciones violatorias de la libertad en el ejercicio de la profesi&#243;n por parte de jueces y 
empleados judiciales. Esta legislaci&#243;n establece adem&#225;s sanciones administrativas a los jueces y </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>servidores p&#250;blicos judiciales en los casos en los que son encontrados responsables 
administrativamente de las faltas que comenten en el ejercicio de sus cargos, independientemente 
de las sanciones penales a las que hubiere lugar. Por &#250;ltimo, el Gobierno recalc&#243; que hasta el 
momento no se tiene conocimiento de que el Sr. Uri&#243;stegui Salgado haya utilizado alguno de 
estos mecanismos para denunciar los hechos que se describen en la comunicaci&#243;n. Por ello el 
Gobierno agradecer&#225; invitar al Sr. Uri&#243;stegui a formular una denuncia o queja ante las citadas 
instituciones, a efecto de que inicien una investigaci&#243;n, misma que dar&#237;a el sustento jur&#237;dico 
necesario para aplicar una medida cautelar o de protecci&#243;n en su favor.

<p><b>Comentarios y observaciones del Relator Especial 
</b></p>
<p>201. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de M&#233;xico su grata cooperaci&#243;n y aprecia que el 
mismo haya tenido a bien enviarle informaci&#243;n en respuesta a las comunicaciones enviadas el 
14 de abril, el 26 de mayo y el 18 de agosto de 2008. En lo que respecta a la comunicaci&#243;n 
enviada el 14 de abril, el Relator Especial, hace un llamado al Gobierno para que lo mantenga 
informado sobre el curso y los resultados de averiguaciones previas relacionadas con las 
investigaciones penales y/o disciplinarias en contra de los culpables. Igualmente solicita al 
Gobierno que le informe sobre las medidas tomadas para garantizar al Sr. Tornez el acceso a un 
abogado de su elecci&#243;n. En lo que respecta a la comunicaci&#243;n enviada el 26 de mayo de 2008, el 
Relator Especial acoge con satisfacci&#243;n la iniciativa de solicitar medidas cautelares a la 
Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos y solicita se le informe qu&#233; medidas espec&#237;ficas 
han sido tomadas por las autoridades para proteger a la Sra. Luz Estela Castro Rodr&#237;guez. 
Asimismo, queda a la espera de la informaci&#243;n referente a las investigaciones y diligencias 
judiciales iniciadas en relaci&#243;n con el caso, as&#237; como sobre las sanciones disciplinarias y/o 
judiciales que han sido impuestas a los presuntos culpables de las amenazas y hostigamiento 
sufridos por la v&#237;ctima. 
</p>
<p>202. Asimismo, el Relator expresa preocupaci&#243;n por no haber recibido respuesta alguna del 
Gobierno de M&#233;xico con relaci&#243;n a los llamamientos urgentes del 21 de Mayo y 22 de julio de 
2008, ambas comunicaciones hacen referencia al caso de 5 personas detenidas integrantes de la 
Organizaci&#243;n del Pueblo Ind&#237;gena Me&#8217;phaa (OPIM). Preocupa sumamente al Relator Especial 
que la acci&#243;n judicial contra ellos podr&#237;a formar parte de un hostigamiento sistem&#225;tico en contra 
de las organizaciones ind&#237;genas y campesinas del Estado de Guerrero y al respecto llama la 
atenci&#243;n sobre los Principios b&#225;sicos relativos a la independencia de la judicatura, especialmente 
el principio 6 que dispone: El principio de la independencia de la judicatura autoriza y obliga a la 
judicatura a garantizar que el procedimiento judicial se desarrolle conforme a derecho, as&#237; como 
el respeto de los derechos de las partes; tambi&#233;n llama la atenci&#243;n sobre los principios de 
Bangalore sobre la conducta judicial -aprobados por el Grupo Judicial de Reforzamiento de la 
Integridad Judicial ,tal y como fue revisado en la Reuni&#243;n en Mesa Redonda de Presidentes de 
Tribunales Superiores celebrada en el Palacio de la Paz de La Haya, Pa&#237;ses Bajos, el 25 y 26 de 
noviembre de 2002- en particular el Principio 3.1 que dispone que un juez deber&#225; asegurarse de 
que su conducta est&#225; por encima de cualquier reproche a los ojos de un observador razonable. El 
Relator pide encarecidamente al Gobierno que tenga a bien enviarle a la brevedad posible, y 
preferentemente antes de la clausura del und&#233;cimo per&#237;odo de sesiones del Consejo de Derechos 
Humanos, informaciones precisas y detalladas acerca de las alegaciones arriba resumidas. </p>

<p>204. Le 20 juin 2008, le Gouvernement marocain a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent du 7 mars 2008, au 
sujet des &#233;v&#232;nements qui ont eu lieu &#224; Tan Tan en f&#233;vrier 2008. Le Gouvernement all&#232;gue que 
les droits d&#8217;opinion, d&#8217;expression, et de manifestation constituent des droits fondamentaux, 
consacr&#233;s par les instruments internationaux des droits de l&#8217;Homme. Dans ce cadre, il convient 
de souligner que l&#8217;article 19 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques stipule 
que l&#8217;exercice des libert&#233;s comporte des devoirs et des responsabilit&#233;s sp&#233;ciales. Ce droit peut 
&#234;tre soumis &#224; certaines restrictions, express&#233;ment fix&#233;es par la loi pour garantir le respect des 
droits de chacun, et la sauvegarde de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, et &#233;viter tout d&#233;rapage susceptible de 
poster atteinte &#224; l&#8217;ordre public, &#224; la sant&#233; ou &#224; la moralit&#233; publiques. D&#8217;autre part, l&#8217;exercice de 
ces droits lorsqu&#8217;il se fait de mani&#232;re irresponsable peut &#234;tre pr&#233;judiciable aux droits et libert&#233;s 
d&#8217;autrui et aura des cons&#233;quences graves sur la s&#233;curit&#233; des individus, la pr&#233;servation de leurs 
biens et le maintien de l&#8217;ordre public. L&#8217;article 20 du Pacte, interdit &#233;galement toute propagande 
en faveur de la guerre, ou l&#8217;appel &#224; la haine nationale, raciale ou religieuse qui constitue une 
incitation &#224; la discrimination, &#224; l&#8217;hostilit&#233; ou &#224; la violence. Il en va de m&#234;me du droit de 
rassemblement pacifique, reconnu par l&#8217;article 21 du Pacte, et dont l&#8217;exercice peut &#234;tre soumis &#224; 
des restrictions l&#233;gales qui sont n&#233;cessaires dans une soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;mocratique, dans l&#8217;int&#233;r&#234;t de la

Lahcen Lafkir a d&#233;clar&#233; que Yahya Mohamed El Hafed A&#226;za &#233;tait le commanditaire principal

en vue de porter atteinte &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; dans la r&#233;gion, en r&#233;compense d&#8217;une somme d&#8217;argent. Ceci

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>207. On 23 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Zarganar, a famous comedian in Myanmar who had been leading some of the relief efforts 
after the Nargis cyclone hit the country in early May 2008 and Mr Zaw Thet Htwe, Chief Editor 
of weekly journal <i>Sports Lovers</i> and former Editor-in-chief of <i>First Eleven Sports Journal</i> in 
Rangoon. According to information received, in the evening of 4 June 2008, some seven police 
led by the Yangon Western District police chief and the local council chairman came to 
Mr Zarganar&#8217;s house and searched it. They seized personal belongings as well as USD 1,000 
collected as part of the cyclone relief effort. They then arrested Mr Zarganar and took him to an 
undisclosed location. His whereabouts remain unknown as of today. Prior to his arrest, 
Mr Zarganar had given interviews to international radio stations and other media about his relief 
work and the needs of the population. He also critized the response of the State authorities to the 
cyclone&#8217;s aftermath. On 13 June 2008, Mr Zaw Thet Htwe was arrested by special branch police 
officers at his ailing mother&#8217;s residence in the central city of Minbu, Magway township, central 
Myanmar. Following the arrest, officers proceeded to Mr Zaw Thet Htwe&#8217;s home where they 
searched the premises and confiscated personal belongings, including his mobile phone, 
computer and various work related documents. Reports claim that Mr Zaw Thet Htwe&#8217;s arrest 
may be related to his involvement in organising a number of deliveries of aid to victims of 
Nargis cyclone, which devastated the Irrawaddy Delta region. He had reportedly been prohibited 
from writing openly about the disaster prior to his arrest. Mr Zaw Thet Htew has apparently been 
taken to an interrogation camp in Rangoon. Previously in July 2003, Mr Zaw Thet Htwe, was 
arrested following the publication of an article which questioned how authorities were spending 
a four-million-dollar football grant. Following his arrest, Mr Zaw Thet Htwe was charged with 
treason and sentenced to death for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. The Supreme 
Court commuted his sentence and he was released after 18 months. Concern was expressed that 
the arrest and detention of Mr Zarganar and Mr Zaw Thet Htwe may be linked to their 
non-violent activities in defense of human rights, in particular their relief work in favour of the 
victims of the Nargis cyclone. In view of their incommunicado detention, further concern was 
expressed for their physical and psychological integrity.

<p>208. On 19 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, regarding the case of Mr Myint Aye, leader of the Human 
Rights Defenders and Promoters group. Mr Myint Aye was the subject of numerous 
communications in the past years, including a joint urgent appeal sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar on 2 April 2008; a joint urgent 
appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and the then </p>

Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar and the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
18 October 2006, and a joint urgent appeal sent by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar on 6 October 2006. 
According to the new information received, on 8 August 2008, the house of Mr Myint Aye was 
searched by the Chief of Police of Kyi Myint Taing township, together with other police and 
administration officers. They seized a number of documents and personal belongings, and 
proceeded to arrest him. On 9 August, the family of Mr Myint Aye was visited by police officers 
who asked for some of his clothes and stated that he will remain in custody for an unspecified 
period of time without indicating the charges held against him. The whereabouts of 
Mr Myint Aye remained unknown. Concern was expressed that this latest arrest and detention of 
Mr Myint Aye may be linked to his non-violent activities in defense of human rights, and may 
form part of a pattern of harassment against him, and more generally against human rights 
defenders in Myanmar. In view of his in communicado detention, further concern was expressed 
for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>209. On 5 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, regarding the case of Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and 
Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, human rights lawyers who have participated in the defence of 11 youth 
members from Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon, of the National League for Democracy 
(NLD). According to the information received, in September 2008, 11 youth members from 
Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon, belonging to the NLD, were arrested for having reportedly 
peacefully marched towards the Shwe Dagon Pagoda on 19 June 2007, on Daw Aung San 
Suu Kyi&#8217;s birthday. The 11 demonstrators were arrested during the march and released the next 
day by the authorities. One year later, they were arrested again, charged with &#8216;instigation to 
public unrest&#8217; and brought to trial before the Hlaing Thar Yar Township Court. During the trial, 
the 11 defendants and their two lawyers, Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, 
submitted a complaint to the judge to address the violations of their rights, because, since the 
beginning of the trial, the lawyers have reportedly not been allowed to meet with their clients in 
private; the judge has not allowed them sufficient time to make counter questions against the 
prosecution witnesses; and their family members have not been allowed to attend the court 
hearings. Furthermore, it was alleged that the police and some plain-cloth persons have also been 
taking pictures and recording their voices during these hearings. During the trial, three 
defendants, Messrs Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min Naing (aka) Mee Thwe 
argued that they were released in June 2007 by the authorities, who claimed then that the 
authorities considered them as &#8220;sons and daughters&#8221; and gave them &#8220;great forgiveness&#8221;. 
Therefore, these three defendants reportedly requested the judge to summon the Minister of 
Home Affairs Mr Maj-Gen Maung Oo, and the Chief of Police Mr Brig-Gen Khin Yee as their 
defence witnesses. The judge rejected their request and asked their lawyers, Messrs Nyi Nyi </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 124 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, to control their clients. The two lawyers responded that they 
were to follow instructions made by their clients. Then the Prosecutor decide to sue the two 
lawyers along with Messrs Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min Naing (aka) 
Mee Thwe under Section 228 of the Penal Code, and issued a arrest warrant against 
Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min. On 29 October 2008, Mr Nyi Nyi Htwe was 
reportedly arrested by the police, and on 30 October, he was sentenced by the Yangon Northern 
District Court to six months&#8217; imprisonment reportedly for &#8220;interruption and insulting the 
judiciary proceeding&#8221; under Section 228 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced along with 
Messrs Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min Naing (aka) Mee Thwe. None of them 
were reportedly allowed to have legal representation. When Mr Nyi Nyi Htwe asked the judge to 
allow him to make his own defence, the judge threatened him with another lawsuit. They were 
all detained in Insein Prison. As for Mr Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, he failed to appear on 
30 October 2008 and his whereabouts were unknown as of today. Serious concern was expressed 
that the arrest warrant against Messrs Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min, and the 
subsequent arrest and detention of Mr Nyi Nyi Htwe may be linked to their non-violent activities 
in defence of human rights. Further concern was expressed for their physical and psychological 
integrity while in detention. Finally, concern was expressed that these latest incidents may form 
part of a pattern of harassment against human rights defenders in Myanmar.

Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special

<p>to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar on 6 October 2006. According 
to the new information received, starting on 27 August 2008, after over one year of detention 
without trial in Insein Prison, Min Ko Naing and 34 other members of the &#8220;88 Generation 
Students&#8221; have been brought before courts where they face charges under Section 130 (B) of the 
Penal Code, Section 4 of the Law Protecting the Peaceful and Systematic Transfer of the State 
Responsibility and the Successful Performance of the Functions of the National Convention 
against Disturbance and Opposition Endangering National Convention (SPDC Law No. 5/96), 
Section 17 and 20 of the Printers and Publishers Registration Act, Section 33 (A) of the 
Electronic Transactions Law, Section 17 (1) of the Unlawful Association Act, Section 505 (B) of 
the Penal Code, Section 32 (B) and 36 of the Television and Video Law and Section 24 (1) of the 
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1947) and Section 6 of the Law Relating to Forming of 
Organizations (SLORC Law 6/88) in a total of 21 trials. Their cases were initially heard by 
township courts and two district courts, but subsequently all transferred to the Rangoon Eastern 
District Court, the Yangon Western District Court and the Rangoon Northern District Court. It 
was alleged that all trials were held inside the Insein Prison Compound. During the hearing on 
27 August, the defendants requested that their family members, the public, and media should be 
allowed to attend the hearing. In addition, they demanded not to be handcuffed during the 
hearing. During the hearing on 10 September, during which they were still handcuffed, family 
members were allowed to attend the hearing; however, no access was granted to other people 
wishing to attend. During the court hearing on 29 October 2008, Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, 
Mya Aye, Nyan Lin, Pyone Choe, Aung Thu, Hla Myo Naung, and Aung Naing stood up and 
complained about the lack of an independent judiciary and that their rights were not respected. 
The judge then charged them with Section 288 of the Penal Code for disturbing the court 
procedure and sentenced them to six-month imprisonment for each of them. Subsequently, the 
judge ordered security forces to remove the defendants from the court and adjourned the trial. On 
30 October, Zaw Zaw Min was sentenced to two years of imprisonment with hard labor under 
the Section 505 (B) of the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>211. On 13 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, regarding the case of Mr. Aung Thein 
and Mr. Khin Maung Shein, lawyers, representing members of the <i>National League for 
Democracy</i> in current criminal proceedings. According to the information received, on 
7 November 2008, Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein were sentenced to four months 
of imprisonment by the High Court for contempt of court, reportedly under section 3 of the 
Contempt of Courts Act. In October 2008, their clients had complained orally during judicial 
proceedings that they did not enjoy a fair trial. In order to show their distrust in the justice 
system, the lawyers&#8217; clients had expressed their wish to no longer be represented by their defense 
counsels. On 6 November 2008, a written complaint had been submitted in this regard by the two 
lawyers to the Hlaing Township Court which reported the complaint to the High Court. The 
judge hearing the case at the Hlaing Township Court had instructed the defendants to submit 
their complaints in writing through their legal counsels. In the evening of 7 November 2008, 
Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein were arrested by the police and taken to local police 
stations. They were subsequently transferred to Insein prison where they were to serve four 
months of imprisonment. </p>

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>212. On 22 July 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 23 June 2008, stating that 
due to the information received, Mr. Zaganar&#8217;s residence was searched by the authorities and 
witnesses on 4th June 2008. According to the interrogation, action was taken related to the 
following charges: (a) section 32 (b)/36 of Television and Video Law for reproducing and 
distributing the VCDs without permission; (b) section 505 (b) (infringment of law and order) of 
the Penal Code for connecting and providing distorted information opposing the State to foreign 
news agencies; (c) section 505 (b) (infringment of law and order) and section 295-A (abusing 
religious beliefs) of Penal Code for providing supports during tbe Sanga unrest on 24 and 
25 September 2007; (d) section 17 (2) of the Unlawful Association Law (contacting terrorists 
from the unlawful association and receiving financial assistance); (e) section 33 (a)/38 of the 
Electronic Communication Law (infringing peace and law and order of the State) for possessing 
hilarious cartoons and books to discredit and impair the dignity of the Government; (f) section 
33(a)/38 of the Electronic Communication Law for infringing peace and law and order of the 
State; (g) section 33 (a)/38 of the Electronic Communication Law for accepting and replying 
anti-government letters which infringe peace and law and order of the State. The Government 
informs that the following charges, based on the interrogation, concern Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe 
(a) section 505(b) (infringment of law and order) anal section 295-A (abusing religious beliefs) 
of Penal Code for supporting the Sanga unrest by buying food for the monks with the instruction 
given from Zaganar on 24 and 25 September 2007; (b) section 33 (a)/38 of the Electronic 
Communication Law for infringing peace and law and order of the State. In this convection, the 
arrests of Mr. Zarganar and Mr. Zaw Thet Htwe were carried out according to the violations of 
the above-mentioned laws and not on the accusation of providing donations to the cyclone 
victims. 
</p>
<p>213. On 23 October 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 19 August 2008, 
stating that Mr. Myint Aye was arrested for the involvement in the bombing incident which took 
place at the office of Shwepyitha Township Union Solidarity and Development Association in 
Yangon on 1 July 2008. According to the interrogations made by the concerned authorities, he 
accepted a packet of explosive wrapped in black polythene bag from an unidentified youth aged 
about 20, who was sent by Sit Naing (his organization under investigation) at Hinthada Street in 
Sanchaung Township, Yangon on 30 June 2008. Mr. Myint Aye personally handed over the 
packet to Htantabin NLD youth named Yan Shwe who left for Shwepyitha Township to plant the 
bomb. After the bomb explosion, Yan Shwe went to Myint Aye to report their success. 
Myint Aye then reported the information by telephone to Kyaw Htet (Forum for Democracy in 
Burina-FDB) living in Maesot. According to further investigation, Myint Aye sent NLD youths 
to Maesot for the explosives and political defiance courses conducted by anti-government groups 
and accepted illegal money to carry out anti-government activities. As a consequence, he was 
arrested at his house on 8 August 2008. The government informs that actions are being taken 
against Myint Aye under the section 3 of the Explosive Act of 1908, section 15 (5) of the 
Immigration Act and section 17 (1) of the Unlawful Association Act. At the court hearing heard 
against Yan Shwe and Zaw Zaw Aung (Shwepyitha NLD) at the Shwepyitha Court on 
8 August 2008, they confessed to the judge that Mr. Myint Aye accepted the bag containing the 
bomb and he personally handed over to Yan Shwe. 
</p>
<p>214. On 29 December 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 5 November 2008, 
stating that on 15 May 2007 2007 at 7:30 a.m. eleven persons including Thant Zin Myo marched </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 127 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>from Shwe Yin Aye Bus Stop located in Hlaing Tharyar Township to Yangon-Nyaung Donc 
Road wearing white colour t-shirts with imprinted red colon logo &#8220;Free Aung San Suu Kyi&#8221; with 
an aim of creating a demonstration and attempting to disturb law and order. The group refused to 
disperse when local people led by U Tun Lwin, who did not wish to observe the demonstration, 
tried to control them. For that reason, Chief of Hlaing Tharyar Police Station took legal actions 
against them under Section 143/145/152/ 505(B) of the Penal Code on 3 July 2008. The 
information contained in the Rapporteurs&#8217; letter that they marched on the Street on 19 June 2007 
is incorrect. The correct date is 15 May 2007 at 7:30 am. In addition, the date that they were 
arrested is 28 August 2008, not in September of that year. In order to defend the charges being 
made against them at the court hearings, permissions were given to meet freely with their 
lawyers U Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min in Insein Prison as well as in the detention 
area of the Hlaing Thar Yar Township Court during the trial period. Therefore, information 
contained in the Rapporteurs&#8217; note mentioning that &#8220;the lawyers have reportedly not been 
allowed to meet with their clients in private&#8221; is incorrect. Furthormore during the trial, the 
township judge U Aung Myint Thein allowed sufficient time to make counter questions against 
the prosecution witnesses. Family members of the defendants were allowed to attend the court 
hearings which were carried out in the township court. Nevertheless, the defendants disrespected 
the court by sitting backward, saying they do not believe the justice system and talking with their 
family memberes in order to obstruct the court&#8217;s proceeding. Therefore, the court decided not to 
allow family members to attend the hearings according to Section 52 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure on 4 November 2008. After the court&#8217;s decision, hearings were continued at the court 
located in the Insein Prison. Therefore, the information contained in the Rapporterus&#8217; letter that 
&#8220;their family members have not been allowed to the court hearings&#8221; is incorrect. Due to 
disrespected behavior of Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin and Aung Min Naing toward the court, 
the township judge requested the lawyer to control their clients and to refer what they would like 
to express only through their lawyers. However, the lawyers responded that they do not have 
responsibility to control their clients because they have to follow their instructions. For that 
reason, with an appeal made by the township judge, the Northern District Court heard their case 
relating to the Section 228 of the Penal Code on 23 October 2008. On 30 October 2008, the 
district court found that Yan Naing Tun, Myo Kyaw Zin, Aung Min Naing and the lawyer U Nyi 
Nyi Htwe have violated the Section 228 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to six months 
imprisonment without labour. The district court issued arrest warrant against lawyer Saw Kyaw 
Kyaw Min due to his absence during the court hearings. Regarding the sentence given to U Nyi 
Nyi Ntwe and whereabouts of Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min: U Nyi Nyi Htwe was sentenced to six 
months imprisonment under the Section 228 of the Penal Code. Saw Kyaw Kyaw Min 
disappeared or went into hiding since the authorities are searching for him subsequent to the 
arrest warrant issued against him. Regarding the concern expressed to U Nyi Nyi Htwe and 
Saw Kyam Kyam Min, legal actions were taken against U Nyi Nyi Htwe and Saw Kyaw 
Kyaw Min for the violation of existing law. They intentionally disregarded the public servant 
who has been carrying out the judicial procedure in an attempt to obstruct it. Actions taken 
against the two lawyers are not in conflict with provisions of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the arrest made against them is also in line with the international human 
rights norms and standards 
</p>
<p>215. On 29 December 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 5 November 2008, 
stating that even though it took a year to gather information to take legal actions and apprehend 
the fugitives of the 88 Generation Students they were brought before the courts according to </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 128 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>rules and procedures of the law. Their case was acted upon on a group basis and was heard by 
the respective courts during the courts&#8217; hearing days. With the Order from the Supreme Court, 
cases of 35 members of 88 Generation Students were brought before the ten special courts on 
27 August 2008. Since the second hearing which took place on 2 September 2008, permissions 
were given to family members of the defendants to attend the hearings and to have family visits. 
Furthermore, permission was given to the defendants to hire attorneys. Therefore, the court 
hearings were open since the above-mentioned rights and privileges were granted to them and 
their family members. Yet, as stipulated by the law they were handcuffed during the court 
hearings on account of the crimes that they committed and were not entitled to obtain bail. 
Although the court allowed the defendants to hire lawyers in order to have fair trials, the 
lawyers, aligned with their defendants, challenged the court on the matters relating to open court 
procedure and handcuffing during the trials. According to Section 352 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, public audiences should not be allowed to attend the trials which are being carried out 
by the special court. The nine defendants, namely Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Htay Kyawe, 
Mya Aye, Pyone Cho, Ma Myo Naung, Nyan Lin, Aung Thu and Myo Aung Naing were given 
6 months imprisonment each under the Section 228 of the Penal Code for intentionally insulting 
the public servant sitting in judicial proceedings. Defendant Zaw Zaw Min (a member of the 
88 Generation Students) was sentenced to a total of 65 years - 60 inprisonment for the four cases 
under the Section 33A of the Electronic Transactions Law and 5 years imprisonment under the 
Section 3 of the Law Relating to Formation of Organization by the Northern District Court on 
11 November 2008. Members of the 88 Generation Students including Min Ko Naing were 
brought before the 10 special courts and allowed them to have family visits as well as granting of 
permission to their family members to attend the court hearings beginning from 
2 September 2008. Nevertheless, court hearings were obstructed by raising several questions 
unrelated to their cases, disorderly responses and misbehavior toward the court by the defendants 
and their lawyers. Starting from 22 October 2008, twenty three defendants including Min Ko 
Naing were brought before the Northern District Court. However according to the Directive 
No. 6/2008 from the Supreme Court, a decision which is in line with Section 352 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure was made by the ditrict court to allow only responsible personnel to enter the 
court after the defendants continued to show disrespect during the court hearings. Nine 
defendants including Min Ko Naing were given 6 months imprisonment each under the 
Section 228 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for intentionally disrespecting the court 
proceedings which relates to the decision made in line with the Section 352 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. According to the procedures of the law, the defendants should submit an 
appeal to the court for its decision. Instead, they defendants accused the court by not carrying out 
fair trial and decided not to hire lawyers any further and not to react during the court hearings. 
Although the court allowed having lawyers based on the rights of the defendants, the lawyers 
and defendants surrendered the appointed letter of the lawyers according to their own wishes. 
The Governmnet concludes that the court hearings of Min Ko Naing and 34 other members of 
the 88 Generation Students were carried out according to the law and the proceedings were in 
line with the Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>216. On 12 January 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 13 November 2008, 
stating that Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein represented as lawyers the defendants 
Tun Tun oo, Htar Htar Thet, Maung Maung Latt and Aung Kyaw Moe. On the hearing day of 
13 October 2008, Mr. Aung Thein and Mr. Khin Maung Shein orally presented to the court that 
they will repeal from representing their clients as defence counsels. On 20 October, they </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 129 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>submitted a letter of repeal signed by them and their clients mentioning that they are not willing 
to continue to give responses on the queries made at the hearings since the accused persons have 
no longer trust in the justice system, which was not stated during their oral appeal made on 
13 October. Due to their contempt against the justice system, the Supreme Court (Yangon) heard 
their case under Section 3 of the Contempt of Courts Act on 6 November 2008. The court found 
them guilty and sentenced them to four months imprisonment each on 7 November 2008. 
Subsequent to the court decision, they were arrested by the authorities from the Insein Police 
Station on 7 November with the warrant issued for dispatching them to prison. At 10:05 a.m. the 
next day, they were sent to the Insein Prison. During the court hearing, the defendants have not 
complained that they did not enjoy a fair trial nor did they give instructions to their lawyers not 
to be represented any longer, with an intention of showing lack of faith in the legal system. No 
further inquiry was being made since there was no complaint submitted by the lawyers to the 
court during the proceedings. The two lawyers only submitted their letter of repeal to the Hlaing 
Township Court on 20 October 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>217. On 18 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press release, together 
with the Special Rapporteurs Mr. Tomas Ojea Quintana (situation of human rights in Myanmar), 
Mr. Frank La Rue (freedom of opinion and expression), Ms. Margaret Sekaggya (situation of 
human rights defenders) and Ms. Asma Jahangir (freedom of religion or belief). 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five United Nations experts strongly condemned severe convictions and the unfair trials 
of prisoners of conscience in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>Following one year of arbitrary detention, dozens of individuals who had been arrested in 
connection with peaceful demonstrations in Myanmar last year, are since August 2008 
being tried by courts. 
</p>
<p>The closed-door hearings are being held inside prisons by courts which lack independence 
and impartiality. Three of the defence lawyers have been sentenced to several months of 
imprisonment for contempt of court, after they transmitted their clients&#8217; complaints of 
unfair trials. Since early November several other defence lawyers have been barred from 
representing their clients. 
</p>
<p>Last week, a dozen detainees, including several women, were each given 65-year prison 
sentences. More than twenty other detainees, including five monks, were recently 
sentenced to up to 24 years imprisonment. Many other detainees still await sentencing. 
</p>
<p>The UN experts strongly urge the Myanmar authorities to cease harassing and arresting 
individuals for peacefully exercising their internationally recognized human rights. They 
further demand that all detainees be retried in open hearings respecting fair trial standards 
and the immediate release of their defence counsels. 
</p>
<p>The experts reiterate previous calls to initiate reforms for a transition to a multiparty 
democratic and civil government, as envisaged by the new Constitution. In this context, 
they strongly urge the authorities to immediately commence work on ensuring those 
indispensable pre-conditions for free and fair general elections to be held in 2010. </p>

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>218. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Myanmar for its replies 
of 22 July 2008, 23 October 2008, 29 December 2008 and 12 January 2009. With a view to the 
amount of information he continues to receive on questions of fair trial and the situation of 
defense lawyers in the country, he remains gravely concerned at the situation. The Special 
Rapporteur made a request to conduct an in situ visit to Myanmar on 11 March 2009. On 
14 April 2009, the Government replies to his letter informing that Myanmar cannot 
accommodate his request at this moment. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that an 
invitation for his mandate would reflect the reform efforts by the Government and therefore 
wishes to ask for re-consideration.

<p>219. On 17 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of Ms. Sandy Cioffi, Ms. Tammi Sims, 
Mr. Cliff Worsham, Mr. Sean Porter, U.S.- citizens and members of a Seattle-based film crew 
currently working in the Niger Delta on a documentary film project about the harmful impact of 
oil production on the human rights and environmental situation in the Niger Delta since 2005 
entitled &#8220;Sweet Crude&#8221;, and Mr. Joel Bisina, Nigerian citizen and founder of an organization 
named &#8220;Niger Delta Professionals for Development&#8221;. According to the information received, 
after having entered the country legally on 5 April 2008 and informing the competent authorities 
about their intention to work on a film, the above-mentioned persons were arrested by forces of 
the military Joint Task Force under the command of Brigadier-General Rimtiip Wuyep on 
12 April in the Delta State while travelling on a boat near the town of Warri. The reason given 
for their arrests was that they were travelling without military clearance. Reportedly, no laws 
require such clearance. Following a six-hour interrogation by Brigadier-General Wuyep they 
were ordered to be placed into custody and transferred to a detention facility of the State Security 
in Abuja, where they were held without charge. Their defence lawyer, Mr. Bello Lubebe, was 
denied access to his clients in the detention facility. Concern was expressed that the arrest and 
detention of the above-mentioned persons might be solely connected to their reportedly lawful 
exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds. In view of their incommunicado detention, 
further concerns were expressed as regards their physical and mental integrity.

<p>221. On 3 October 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter,<b>6</b> together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding the case of Mr Ghulam Nabi, a lawyer 
in Peshawar. According to the information received, around 19:00 on 12 September 2007, six or 
seven men from the intelligence agency followed Ghulam Nabi as he left his office in the 
Khyber Bazaar. Some minutes later they stopped him and forced a black hood on him. Then he 
was put in a vehicle and taken to an unknown destination, where he arrived about 20 minutes 
later. He was confined in an unknown location and severely beaten for several hours, as a result 
of which he was severely injured. He was not deprived of sleep all night, and the next morning 
he was hooded again, forced to enter a vehicle and thrown out in a deserted place. 
Mr Ghulam Nabi is a member of Jamiat e Islami. He was repeatedly involved in a campaign 
against General Musharraf and the role played by the army in Pakinstan&#8217;s politics and took part 
in a protest against the killing of a lawyer in Karachi. 
</p>
<p>222. On 21 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding the case of Mr Parvez Aslam Choudhry, lawyer and Chairman of the 
non-governmental organization <i>Legal Aid for the Destitute and Settlement</i> (LADS) in Lahore. 
According to information received, on the night of 8 April 2008, Parvez Aslam Choudhry 
received an anonymous telephone call threatening both him and his family. Mr Choudhry was 
reportedly told he was to be killed because he was a Christian lawyer defending a Christian 
person accused of blasphemy. Similar threats were also made against him inside the court by 
witnesses. On 6 April 2008, Parvez Aslam Choudhry was reportedly attacked by a large mob 
when he arrived at court for the bail hearing in the aforementioned blasphemy case. His car was 
damaged and the mob threatened to kill him. Parvez Aslam Choudhry&#8217;s application for the court 
to take legal action was accepted but it was believed that no action has yet been taken. Concern 
was expressed that the harassment, intimidation and death threats made against Parvez Aslam 
Choudhry may be directly related to his peaceful work in defense of human rights. In view of the 
above-mentioned threats, serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr Choudry, as well as that of his family members.

<p>expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders, regarding the killing of at least 14 people, including Mr Haji Aftab Abbasi, a 
lawyer and Mr Naeem Querashi, General Secretary of the Karachi Bar Association, and a 
number of others beaten or disappeared following recent outbursts of violence in Karachi. 
According to information received, on 9 April 2008, 14 people reportedly died in Karachi 
following a series of violent incidents in which six of the deceased, four lawyers, including 
Mr Haji Aftab Abbasi and two clients, were reportedly burned alive. Reports from the Karachi 
Bar Association indicate that the whereabouts of 19 lawyers remain unknown and that they may 
have been abducted. More than 70 offices were reportedly ransacked and burned, including the 
office, residence and vehicle of Mr Naeem Querashi. The offices of the Malir Bar Association 
were also razed. In addition, five journalists were severely beaten, with one, a female journalist 
working for a local television channel, sustaining a fractured arm in the incident. More than 
50 vehicles were reportedly vandalized and burnt-out and the drivers of two private busses were 
shot dead. It has been reported that these attacks, killings, burnings and abductions were carried 
out by members of a the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), allegedly following-up violent 
clashes between MQM members protesting outside the city court buildings and lawyers 
demonstrating in favour of the deposed Chief Justice. It was unknown whether any arrests have 
been made in connection with the aforementioned incidents. Concern was expressed that these 
most serious incidents could be related to the activities of the lawyers in defense of human rights, 
of the exercise of their right to freedom of expression and of the independence of the judiciary in 
Pakistan. In light of these very serious reports, grave concern was expressed for those lawyers 
whose whereabouts remain unknown.

<p>224. On 7 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, regarding the execution of 
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali, which was reportedly scheduled for 8 October 2008. According to the 
information received, Mr. Zulfiqar Ali was arrested on a murder charge on 14 April 1998, 
imprisoned at Adiala prison, Rawalpindi, Punjab Province, tried, convicted and sentenced to 
death. The dates of trial, sentencing and appeals proceedings have not been reported to the 
Special Rapporteurs. In September 2008, the President of Pakistan rejected an appeal to 
commute the sentence and on 29 September 2008 the red warrant to execute Mr. Zulfiqar Ali, 
who was still detained at Adiala prison, was issued. The execution was scheduled for 
8 October 2008. Mr. Zulfiqar Ali&#8217;s family is very poor and could not hire a lawyer to defend 
him. Neither the courts nor any other institution provided him with legal counsel at any stage of 
the ten years his case has been pending, so that he had to defend himself. Moreover, 
Mr. Zulfiqar Ali does not speak English, the language of court proceedings in Pakistan.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>230. On 5 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of Atty. 
Remigio Saladero Jr., human rights and labor attorney, member of the <i>National Union of 
Peoples&#8217; Lawyers</i>, member of the chief legal counsel for the trade union alliance <i>Kilusang Mayo 
Uno (KMU)</i>, and Chairperson of the <i>Pro-labor Legal Assistance Centre (PLACE)</i>. A letter of 
allegation was sent to the Government by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders regarding PLACE on 9 November 2007. No response 
from the Government had been received. According to the information received, on 
23 October 2008, Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. was arrested by members of the Philippines 
National Police from Antipolo City. The police officers allegedly entered the office where Atty. 
Remigio Saladero works, presented a warrant for arrest on charges of multiple murder and 
multiple frustrated murder cases, handcuffed him, confiscated his mobile telephone and 
computers, and took him to Calapan City Provincial Jail where he remained in detention. The 
warrant, issued by branch 40 of the Mindoro Oriental Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Calapan 
City, Oriental Mindoro, was apparently invalid given that the name on it was not that of Atty. 
Remigio Saladero Jr., showed a different address and was dated 2006. Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. 
was charged for &#8220;multiple murder and multiple frustrated murder cases&#8221; with 72 other people, 
among whom there may have been human rights defenders. The legal team representing Atty. 
Remigio Saladero Jr. has requested documents relating to his arrest but has not yet been provided 
with any. Meanwhile, Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. continued to face judicial proceedings for a 
previous case. He was being investigated in relation to a complaint for &#8220;conspiracy to commit 
rebellion, arson and destruction of property&#8221; made by Globe Telecoms against 27 leaders and 
activists from Southern Tagalog region following the bombing of a Globe Telecoms Cell site in 
Lemery Batangas on 2 August 2008. He has not yet been officially charged in relation to this 
case. Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. has reportedly also been the victim of numerous attacks, 
supposedly in relation to his work as a human rights lawyer. Concern was expressed that the 
arrest and detention of Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. may be related to his work in the defense of 
human rights. Further concern was expressed that this may form part of an ongoing pattern of 
harassment against Atty. Remigio Saladero Jr. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>231. On 16 January 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 5 November 2008, 
stating that Atty Remingion Saladero&#8217;s arrest was by virtue of the arrest warrant issued by the 
Regional Trial Court of Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40, in the case entitled &#8220;People of the 
Philippines vs Rustom Simbulan a.k.a Ka Bobby/Ka Bayan/Ka Silang/Ka Arthur, et al.&#8221;, for </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>multiple murder and multiple frustrated murder, docketed as Criminal Case No. CR-06-8525, 
wherein he is one of the named accused. The above criminal case was based on the incident that 
transpired on 3 March 2006, wherein a New People&#8217;s Army (NPA) (troop composed of 
seventy-one accused in the case) ambushed clements of the Regional Mobile Group of the 
Philippine National Police (PNP) at Barangay San Isidro, Puerto Galeria, Oriental Mindoro; 
three police officers died, while three others were seriously wounded. Accused 
Rustom Simbulan was identified by one of the surviving police officers in the incident, and 
hence was charged accordingly. On 19 August 2008, Vincent Urieta Silva executed a sworn 
statement in the presence of operatives/officers of the Criminal Investigation and Detention 
Group (CIDG) in Oriental Mindoro wherein he alleged, that: He is a deep penetration agent 
(DPA) of the Provincial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau (PIIB) - Police Provincial Office 
of Occidental Mindoro and has been such for the past five years; As such DPA, he was among 
those who burned the Globe tower on 1 March 2006 at around 3:30 a.m. at Barangay San Isidro, 
Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro; He was also among those who ambushed the elements of the 
Regional Mobile Group (RMG) at the same barangay; With him on those two incidents were the 
accused who were members of the NPA. He was able to name all the seventy-one NPA 
members/accused because he has been working with them the past five years that he was DPA, 
and his principal mission was to know/verify their rcal names and addresses; The plans to burn 
the Global tower and ambush the police were discussed at a meeting on 29 January 2006, in 
Barangay Monteclaro, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro due to the refusal of the Global manager to 
give revolutionary tax to the NPA. The decision to ambush was reached in order to &#8220;hit two birds 
with one stone&#8221; as the police would surely augment security in the area; It took him this long 
(more than 2 years) to narrate his knowledge of and/or participation in the said incidents because 
he had the opportunity to confer with his handler just recently, after he accomplished his mission 
to know the real names and identities and the respective residences of the people/NPA members 
actively involved in propaganda/movements against the government; Atty Saladero has filed 
with the court a Motion to Quash the information and/or warrant for his arrest. The prosecution 
for its part has filed its opposition. The arrest of Atty. Saladero and his subsequent detention 
were by virtue of a warrant of arrest and commitment order issued by the Court. As such there is 
no ground to sustain the allegations of harassment and arbitrary detention against him. Following 
are facts in connection with his arrest: a. On 23 October 2008, at about 2:15 p.m., police 
operatives proceeded to the law office of Atty. Remigio Saladero, Jr., located along 
Circumferential Road, Barangay San Jose, Antipolo City to effect the Warrant of Arrest issued 
against Atty. Saladero for the crime of Multiple Murder and Multiple Frustrated Murder 
docketed under Criminal Case No. 06-8525. The Warrant of Arrest was issued by Hon. Tomas 
C. Leynes, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, 4th Judicial Region, Branch 40, Oriental 
Mindoro, Calapan City. b. After confirming the identity of the subject, the team arrested Atty. 
Saladero who was apprised of his constitutional rights. He was brought to the Rizal Police 
Provincial Office and then to the Regional Trial Court in Calapan City. c. Atty. Remigio 
Saladero, Jr. is currently detained at the Oriental Mindoro Provincial Jail in Calapan City by 
virtue of a Commitment Order issued by Executive Judge Manuel C. Luna, Jr. dated 
24 October 2008. d. In another case, Atty. Remigio Saladero, Jr. was named as one of the 
respondents in a criminal complaint filed by the Batangas Criminal Investigation and Detention 
Team (CIDT) against Nestor Samarita of Rosario, Batangas and seventeen others with the 
Batangas Provincial Prosecutor&#8217;s Office on 25 August 2008 for Violation of Article 324 of the 
Revised Penal Code (Arson), docketed under I.S. No. 08-1002. This is in connection with the </p>

<p>233. On 12 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Ms Larisa Dorogova and her 20 year-old son, Khadzimurat Dorogov. Ms Dorogova is a lawyer 
and advocate of the rights of the Muslim community in the Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria 
(KBR). According to information received, on 9 May 2008, between 4 and 5 pm, 
Khadzimurat Dorogov, was forced into an unmarked white car by two unidentified 
Russian-speaking men on his way to the doctor&#8217;s office. He was driven about in the vehicle for 
seven hours, during which time he was searched, had his mobile phone SIM card confiscated and 
was questioned about his mother&#8217;s contacts and work. Ms Dorogova has also received death 
threats via email and post, including on 26 March 2008, when a live machine-gun cartridge was 
attached to the threatening letter. Reports indicated that Larisa Dorogova and her son have been 
under surveillance by unidentified individuals since 2005. Previously, on 16 April 2008, the 
president of the Lawyers&#8217; Chamber of Karabdino-Balkaria initiated a disciplinary case against 
Dorogova, seeking to deprive her of her status as a lawyer. The case was based on a complaint 
received from the Federal Registration Service of Karabdino-Balkaria and from the Prosecutor of 
Karabdino-Balkaria. She was accused of unprofessional conduct because she allegedly had 
cursed and threatened to kill a worker of a pre-trial detention facility while trying to visit a client 
in detention. At the time, Ms Dorogova appeared to have been prohibited from entering the 
facility by order of the prosecutor&#8217;s office, thus denying her clients in detention her legal 
assistance. The allegation from the prosecutor reportedly also claims that she tried to enter the 
pre-trial detention facility without permission and without written order. Ms Dorogova 
represented defendants arrested in connection with a raid by Islamic militants on the premises of 
police and security forces in the city of Nalchik on 13 October 2005, who have allegedly been 
subjected to ill-treatment while in detention. She has also represented family-members of some 
of the 94 militants killed during the incident, assisting in the preparation of complaints to the 
European Court of Human Rights which alleged violation of the families&#8217; right to have the 
remains of those killed returned to them. Concern was expressed that the intimidation of Larisa 
Dorogova and the threats made against her, as well as the abduction of her son, may be directly 
related to her activities in defense of human rights, in particular the right to provide legal 
representation to her clients. In view of the events outlined, serious concern was expressed for 
the physical and psychological integrity of Ms Dorogova and her son, Khadzimurat Dorogov. 
</p>
<p>234. On 20 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, regarding the case of 
Mrs. Liudmila Grigorievna Moltshanova, a 61-year-old woman and second category invalid. 
According to the information received, on 29 May 2008, Mrs. Moltshanova was sentenced by </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 137 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Mrs. Valentina Khaydarovna Khruzina, a judge of the &#8220;Justice of the Peace&#8221; court no. 112 of the 
Preobrazhenskoe district of Moscow, to one year and two months of imprisonment under 
article 312 para. 1 of the Criminal Code. On 24 April 2008, when the first hearing of the case 
was scheduled, Mrs. Moltshanova was not able to appear before the court. Prior to that date, she 
fell seriously ill, was driven to hospital no. 59 in Moscow in an emergency and had to stay in that 
hospital. Her defense lawyer, Mrs. Malysheva, attended the court hearing on 24 April and 
informed the court that Mrs. Moltshanova was in hospital, unable to stand trial. Prior to this, on 
17 April 2008, Mrs. Malysheva&#8217;s defense lawyer handed a written motion to the above 
mentioned judge to make a request to the physicians treating Mrs. Moltshanova to certify 
whether she was able to stand trial. On 22 April, Mrs. Moltshanova herself wrote to the judge 
requesting to postpone the hearing. On 24 April 2008, judge Khruzina issued a decision that 
Mrs. Moltshanova had deliberately hidden from the court and therefore ordered her arrest. As a 
consequence, Mrs. Moltshanova was arrested on 28 April by officials of the criminal police in 
the hospital despite the fact that the physicians treating her confirmed her serious health 
condition and attested that she was unable to stand trial. Mrs. Moltshanova was taken to the 
specialized hospital of SIZO 77/1 where she remained. 
</p>
<p>235. On 5 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy, a human rights lawyer and Mr Valery Bychkov, chairperson of the 
Penza branch of the All-Russia Public Movement &#8220;For Human Rights. According to information 
received, on 22 July 2008, Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy was detained immediately after a court ruled 
in favor of releasing Mr Valery Bychkov on the condition that he does not leave Penza. 
Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy may face up to five years&#8217; imprisonment. He was charged with &#8220;use of 
violence against a representative of the authorities&#8221; under part 1 of Article 318 of the Russian 
Criminal Code. The charges came following an argument between Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy and 
a court officer about whether taking video footage of the legal proceedings was permitted. Video 
footage had been banned during the session and the trial was declared closed to the public 
without any court ruling. The video footage taken by Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy reportedly 
documented guards dragging the chronically-ill Mr Valery Bychkov down the stairs. It was later 
shown on the news by local broadcasters. Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy was taken to the prosecutor&#8217;s 
office in Penza Oktyabrsky district before being moved to the investigatory prison. Concern was 
expressed that the detention of Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy may be directly related to his activities 
in the defense of human rights, in particular his work to defend Mr Valery Bychkov. Further 
concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Sergey Cherepovskiy 
while in detention. 
</p>
<p>236. On 13 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Ilyas Timishev, a human rights lawyer currently working to defend the rights of Chechen 
police officers who have not been paid. According to information received, on 15 July 2008, 
Mr Ilyas Timishev and those who had appealed about salaries not being paid and court rulings 
not being implemented were summoned to the Chechen Prosecutor&#8217;s office. They did not reject 
the Prosecutor&#8217;s request for them to reach an agreement with the State on the matter in question, 
and they affirmed their need to assess damages and interest for the period of up to three years 
during which court rulings had not been implemented. That night, Mr Yunus Yakubovich 
Timishev and Mr Aslambek Khizirovich Timishev, Mr Ilyas Timishev&#8217;s brother and nephew 
respectively, were detained and their home was searched. A gun was allegedly found during the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 138 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>search. Mr Aslambek Khizirovich Timishev was reportedly beaten up while being interrogated 
and lost a tooth after being kicked by a police officer. On 16 July 2008, Mr Arbi Kharonovich 
Timishev, also a nephew of Mr Ilyas Timishev, was detained and was reportedly beaten up in 
detention while being interrogated by police who asked him about where Mr Ilyas Timishev was. 
All three members of Mr Ilyas Timishev&#8217;s family were released on 16 July 2008. However, 
Mr Aslambek Khizirovich Timishev and Mr Arbi Kharonovich Timishev were ordered to stay in 
the village where they live. No criminal case was opened against the members of 
Mr Ilyas Timishev&#8217;s family, but they were worried that they may be accused of having links to 
rebel groups. Concern was expressed that the detention of members of Mr Ilyas Timishev&#8217;s 
family and the restrictions on their movement may be directly related to his legitimate and 
peaceful work in the defense of human rights, in particular his work to ensure the payment of 
Chechen police officers. Concern was also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr Ilyas Timishev and his family. 
</p>
<p>237. On 29 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding the case of 
Mr. Anatoly Ataev, born in 1970 in Krasnodar. According to the information received, 
Mr. Anatoly Ataev was serving a criminal sentence of 4.5 years for fraud and money laundering 
pursuant to articles 159 and 174 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation at the pre-trial 
detention centre No. 1 of Krasnodar. Despite a decision of the district court of Oktyabrsky 
ordering his immediate conditional release on 5 August 2008, Mr. Anatoly Ataev remained in 
detention as the authorities at the pre-trial detention centre suspended the court decision and 
requested confirmation thereof. This confirmation was then provided by the deputy chairperson 
of the court, recalling that the release should be immediate. However, approximately three weeks 
later Mr. Anatoly Ataev was still being detained. Mr. Ataev&#8217;s lawyers addressed all competent 
instances including the Prosecutor&#8217;s Offices, the Investigation Committee under the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office of the Russian Federation, the State Administration of the Federal Penitentiary Service, 
the Human Rights Commissioner, and the President&#8217;s Administration, however, to no avail. 
Mr. Anatoly Ataev had started a hunger strike.  
</p>
<p>238. On 10 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, regarding the case of Mr. Vladimir Bogushevsky, born in 1984, 
currently held in remand prison 1 of Yekaterinburg. According to the information received, on 
30 August 2007, around 9 a.m., Mr. Boguchevski went to the Directorate of Internal Affairs in 
Yekaterinburg, located at Frunze Street 74. He was invited there by a phone call of the 
authorities to give evidence concerning Mr. Schneyder and Mr. Struyn, who had been arrested 
earlier in relation to the murder of Mrs. Irina Zlatina, which occurred on 10 April 2007 outside 
the Directorate of Internal Affairs of the Kirovsky district. Police officer Valery Zhernakov led 
Mr. Bogushevsky to office n&#176; 505 and tied him to a chair with handcuffs. He then punched 
Mr. Bogushevsky in the chest with his fists. Since Mr. Bogushevsky has suffered from a heart 
condition since 1996, this triggered a heart attack. Mr. Bogushevsky told Mr. Zhernakov that he 
was in need of immediate medical assistance. However, Mr. Zhernakov went on to strangle 
Mr. Bogushevsky, hit his throat and pressed him on his eyeballs with his thumbs. Several times 
Mr. Anatoly Smirnov, Chief of the unit, entered the office and asked how the &#8220;case was going&#8221;. 
Between 3 and 4 p.m., a third police officer entered office n&#176; 505, alarmed by </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 139 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Bogushevsky&#8217;s screaming. This officer told Mr. Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov to call the 
ambulance. Around 4 p.m., a physician entered office n&#176; 505 and examined Mr. Bogushevsky. 
This physician confirmed an anomaly in Mr. Bogushevky&#8217;s heart and also explained to 
Mr. Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov that Mr. Bogushevsky&#8217;s condition was life-threatening. 
Mr. Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov then pressured Mr. Bogushevsky to testify, among other issues, 
to having been involved in the murder of Mrs. Zlatina. They told him that, if he was to sign an 
agreement on his involvement, he would not be ill-treated any longer. They pointed out that 
Mr. Bogushevsky would need a lawyer in order to make such a statement. The two police 
officers then called a lawyer who presented himself as Mr. Kurnosov. When it became apparent 
to Mr. Bogushevsky that Mr. Kurnosov and Mr. Smirnov had close ties, Mr. Bogushevsky 
insisted on having a lawyer of his choice who would defend him. Later, in the night of 30 to 
31 August 2007, Mr. Smirnov called Mr. Denis Kolganov, an acquaintance of Mr. Bogushevsky, 
who has a law degree. Mr. Bogushevsky then told Mr. Kolganov what had happened. 
Mr. Kolganov advised Mr. Bogushevsky that he should not testify against himself. He told this 
to Mr. Kurnosov, too. Mr. Kolganov and Mr. Bogushevsky were assured that no more 
interrogations would take place and that Mr. Bogushevsky would be moved to a temporary 
detention facility. Subsequently Mr. Kulgonov left. Mr. Zhernakov and Mr. Smirnov were again 
alone in the room with Mr. Bogushevsky. Mr. Zhernakov held Mr. Bogushevsky to the table and 
Mr. Smirnov strangled and kicked him. After that, while Mr. Zhernakov was holding 
Mr. Bogushevsky, Mr. Smirnov took a gas mask and put it over Mr. Bogushevsky&#8217;s mouth. Then 
they beat him in the chest and the stomach. Mr. Bogushevsky then got nauseous. Mr. Zhernakov 
and Mr. Smirnov told Mr. Bogushevsky that they were disappointed with his refusal to testify 
and that - sooner or later - he would testify in any case. Mr. Bogushevsky was then taken to the 
temporary detention facility, where the first aid attendant was called immediately. 
Mr. Bogushevsky was taken to the hospital, where his condition was stabilized. Mr. Zhernakov 
and Mr. Smirnov accompanied Mr. Bogushevsky to the hospital, continuing to threaten him. 
Mr. Zhernakov pressured the physician in charge, who was writing the report, to note that 
Mr. Bogushevsky was &#8220;able to work&#8221;. On the way back to the Directorate of Internal Affairs at 
Frunze Street, Mr. Smirnov continued to threaten Mr. Bogushevsky, who was then placed back 
in the temporary detention facility. On 31 August 2007, defense lawyer Kirill Mikhailovich 
Skorobogaty, who was sent there by Mr. Kolganov, came to visit Mr. Bogushevsky in the 
temporary detention facility. Mr. Bogushevsky consulted the lawyer about the legality of his 
detention. On 1 September 2007, Mr. Bogushevsky was taken before the court of the Kirovsky 
district, which confirmed the legality of his arrest. On 3 September 2007, Mr. Bugoshevsky was 
again pressured to confess to having been involved in the murder. On 5 September 2007 
Mr. Bogushevsky eventually confessed guilty of involvement in the murder of M. Zlatina. 
During the trial, which lasted for more than two months, the three witnesses, who were friends of 
the murdered Mrs. Zlatina, confirmed that they had never seen Mr. Bugoshevsky with 
Mrs. Zlatina and that they were not aware of any fight that occurred between the two. No other 
evidence was produced against Mr. Bugoshevsky during the trial. To date, Mr. Bogushevsky 
remained in detention. Concern was expressed as regards Mr. Bogushevsky&#8217;s physical and 
mental integrity while in detention as well as with respect to his current state of health. 
</p>
<p>239. On 5 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal, regarding the case of 
Mr. Nabi N. Sultanov, citizen of Uzbekistan, 29 years of age. According to the information </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 140 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>received, by decision of the General-Prosecutor of 18 September 2008, Mr. Nabi N. Sultanov 
was scheduled to be extradited to his home country Uzbekistan where he has allegedly been 
persecuted on religions grounds. Mr. Sultanov obtained the decision of the Prosecutor-General 
on 25 September 2008 while in detention in the detention facility (SIZO) in Perm, where he has 
not been allowed to have access to legal counsel. As Mr. Sultanov cannot speak Russian, he was 
not in a position to read the decision nor appeal it. In the beginning of November 2008, 
Mr. Sultanov was brought to Moscow, from where his extradition should be undertaken. By that 
time, the 10-day deadline to appeal the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s decision to extradite him had 
already elapsed. Only upon arrival in the detention facility in Moscow did he learn from 
co-detainees that he had the right to apply for asylum in the Russian Federation. With the help of 
his co-detainees, he sent an application to the Federal Migration Service of the city of Moscow. 
On 7 November 2008, his lawyer was denied access to see him by the administration of SIZO-4 
of the city of Moscow, as sustained by a decision of the Office of the General-Prosecutor. At the 
same time, Mr. Sultanov&#8217;s lawyer sent a request to the Moscow city court for <i>restitutio in 
integrum</i>, i.e. an application for the time-limit for appeal against the decision of the 
Prosecutor-General to recommence. On 4 December 2008, the Moscow city court rejected this 
request. On 5 December 2008, Mr. Sultanov&#8217;s lawyer had seen his client for the first time in the 
detention facility only to facilitate Mr. Sultanov&#8217;s meeting with the Migration Service. He was, 
however, unable to speak to him in private regarding the specific case and provide him any legal 
counsel. 
</p>
<p>240. On 22 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Stanislav Markelov and Ms. Anastasia Baburova. Mr. Stanislav Markelov was a lawyer 
dealing with various human rights related cases and active in defending victims of enforced 
disappearances and other human rights violations committed in Chechnya. Mr. Markelov was the 
lawyer of the family of Ms. Elsa Kungaeva, a Chechen woman abducted and murdered by an 
officer of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the year 2000, Mr. Yuri Budanov, and 
was instrumental in the 2005 conviction of a police officer, Sergei Lapin, who was sentenced to 
11 years in prison for the torture and disappearance of a young Chechen man. Mr. Markelov 
previously also represented the journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Ms. Anastasia Baburova was a 
freelance investigative journalist working for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. 
Mr Stanislav Markelov was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the then Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 4 May 2004. No response had 
been received to that communication to date. According to the information recently received, on 
19 January 2009, Mr Stanislaw Markelov was shot dead by a masked gunman near the building 
where he had previously held a press conference. He was shot in the back of the head at close </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 141 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>range. Ms Anastasia Baburova, a journalist who also participated in the press conference and 
who tried to intervene when Mr Markelov was attacked, was also shot. She was taken to hospital 
in a critical condition where she died later of her injuries. The press conference held by 
Mr Markelov was entitled &#8220;Unlawful release of Budanov: neglect by the court and direct 
advantage for militants: who is next?&#8221; Mr. Budanov, who had been sentenced to 10 years in 
prison for the abduction and murder of Ms. Elsa Kungaeva, including time served, in 2003, had 
been granted an early release on 15 January 2009. Mr. Markelov stated at the press conference 
his intention to appeal the decision of the court of Dimitrovgrad to reject his appeal concerning 
Mr. Yuri Budanov&#8217;s early release from custody. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>241. The Government replied by letter of 17 October 2008 to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication of 5 August 2008, on 7 October to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 
13 August 2008, on 10 November 2008 to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 29 August 2008, on 
4 December 2008 to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 10 September 2008, on 
10 February 2009 to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 5 January 2008 and on 14 April 2009 to 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s communication of 22 January 2009. At the time this report was 
finalized, the Special Rapporteur was not provided with a translation of the content of these 
replies by the relevant services. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>242. On 29 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following statement, which includes 
his preliminary findings following his visit to the Russian Federation made public during a press 
conference held in Moscow.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur visited the Russian Federation from 19 to 29 May at the invitation 
of the Government. He expresses his sincere gratitude for the cooperation extended to him 
by the authorities of the country. During the mission, Mr. Despouy held meetings with 
high-ranking federal, regional, and local officials, as well as representatives of the 
judiciary, bar associations, national human rights institutions, academics, international and 
non-governmental organisations in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and 
Verkhnyaya Pyshma. 
</p>
<p>In his capacity as Special Rapporteur, Mr. Despouy will present a report on the mission to 
the Russian Federation to the Human Rights Council. Its conclusions and 
recommendations will be discussed in public session by the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly. According to the practice adhered to by the UN Special Procedures, 
before leaving the country, the Rapporteur informed the general public through the media 
about his preliminary findings and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur highlights the significant changes that have been taking place in 
the country over the past years and their enormous impact on all spheres of life. He notes 
that Government authorities at the highest level, including President Medvedev, have 
expressed concerns over deficiencies in the functioning of judicial institutions, including 
the question of their independence. The removal of these deficiencies is crucial for the 
future development of the country. Recent reform initiatives, such as the creation of a </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 142 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>special working group on the judicial reform and the establishment of a council to fight 
corruption, chaired by the President, demonstrate the political will to tackle the problems 
facing the justice system. 
The Special Rapporteur makes the following preliminary observations: 
</p>
<p>Institutional and legal framework: The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the important 
reforms implemented since 1993, particularly the adoption of new legislation governing 
judicial proceedings, and the significant improvement of working conditions of the 
judiciary. Important concerns remain about the lack of equal access to the courts and the 
fact that an important percentage of judicial decisions, including those against state 
officials, are not implemented. In addition, in spite of early reform initiatives, there is still 
no legal framework at the federal level for juvenile justice and for a system of 
administrative courts. 
</p>
<p>Judiciary: With the adoption of new procedural legislation judges have been assigned the 
guiding role in judicial proceedings. The Special Rapporteur notes that in some cases 
judges have not yet been able to assume this central function. Problems with the 
implementation of judicial decisions have contributed to the poor image of the judiciary in 
the eyes of the population. Furthermore, criticism has been expressed with regard to the 
transparency in the selection process of judges and the lack of objective criteria in the 
allocation of court cases by court presidents, as well as in the implementation of 
disciplinary measures. Political interference in these spheres has been brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur, as also confirmed by recent media reports.  
</p>
<p>The Prosecution: The reform of the office of the prosecutor has apparently led to a more 
specialized investigative procedure through the establishment of an investigation 
committee. However, various opinions were expressed as to whether this has actually 
resulted in a more effective and balanced system between different sides in judicial 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>The Bar: The 2002 Federal law governing the activities of defense lawyers constituted a 
crucial step towards establishing the Russian bar as an independent and self-regulatory 
body. However, lawyers have expressed concerns about current proposals to amend this 
law which may threaten their independence. These relate to procedures for withdrawing 
the professional status of lawyers and requirements for providing working files as part of 
potential inquiry which would compromise the privileged nature of lawyer-client relations. 
The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern with the tendency to identify defense 
lawyers with the interests, opinions and activities of their clients. Lawyers also drew 
attention to the practical obstacles they face in becoming judges; in fact, it appears that the 
majority of judges - before being appointed - have served as prosecutors, investigators or 
court staff.  
</p>
<p>Non-governmental organizations: NGOs play a crucial role in the protection of human 
rights, particularly through the justice system. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 143 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On this basis, and before the submission of his full report, the Special Rapporteur advances 
the following preliminary recommendations related to measures for improving the 
functioning of the judicial system: 
&#8226; Given the urgent nature of the need to resolve the problems identified above, full 
</p>
<p>support should be given to the new working group on judicial reform and the recently 
created anti-corruption council. All pertinent parties whose interests may be affected by 
the work of these bodies should be fully involved in their activities.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In tackling the problems facing the judiciary it is crucial to ensure transparency of legal 
proceedings and the functioning of the judicial system as a whole. In fact, this has been 
recognised by judicial authorities at different levels.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mechanisms for the rapid and comprehensive execution of judicial decisions should be 
established promptly.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The existing procedures for providing free qualified legal assistance should be reviewed 
and best practices should be implemented throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The draft law on the establishment of a juvenile justice system should be adopted 
without delay. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Renewed efforts should be taken to establish an administrative court system as this will 
strengthen the mechanisms to effectively fight corruption and to ensure the liability of 
state officials.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; As regards the prosecution, there is a need to analyse the results of the recently 
introduced reforms and their impact on the conduct of the investigation and judicial 
proceedings in general.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The recently proposed amendments to the 2002 Federal law governing the activities of 
defense lawyers would compromise the principles of self-government and independence 
of the bar and, therefore, must not be adopted since they will run against existing 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Efforts should be made to ensure that lawyers can exercise their profession without 
intimidation or any other obstacles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The legitimate activities of non-governmental organisations, including their 
participation in the process of judicial reform, should be encouraged and facilitated. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur wishes to underscore his belief that the implementation of these 
recommendations will strengthen and deepen the process of judicial reform, which, in turn, 
will further promote democracy and allow the entire population of the country to enjoy the 
benefits of economic growth. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur once again would like to express his gratitude to the authorities of 
the Russian Federation for making this visit possible. He strongly hopes that the on-going </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 144 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and envisaged reforms will be implemented in the shortest possible time. The Special 
Rapporteur trusts that his recommendations will assist the authorities in this process and he 
would like to be in a position to review the progress made in the country in two years 
time.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>243. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to reflect 
on the content of the replies from the Government of the Russian Federation dated 7 and 
17 October 2008, 10 November 2008, 4 December 2008, 10 February 2009 and 14 April 2009 as 
he had not received the translation from the relevant services. He wishes to thank the 
Government for these replies.  
</p>
<p>244. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the 
communications of 12 and 20 June 2008. He urges the Government of the Russian Federation to 
provide at the earliest possible date a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>245. On 20 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal,<b>7</b> together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding 
the case of Mr. Suliamon Olyfemi, a citizen of Nigeria, who was reportedly at imminent risk of 
execution. The case of Suliamon Olyfemi was previously brought to the attention of the 
Excellency&#8217;s Government (together with the cases of 12 other Nigerian migrant workers) by the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture in a communication dated 
30 November 2004. Regrettably, their communication had remained without reply. According to 
information received since 2004, Suliamon Olyfemi was sentenced to death at a closed trial in 
May 2005. The twelve other Nigerian men were sentenced to prison terms and corporal 
punishment. During the trial, Suliamon Olyfemi and his co-defendants neither had access to legal 
representation nor to consular assistance, nor did they benefit from adequate translation. During 
interrogation they had been told to put their fingerprints, which can act as a signature, on 
statements written in Arabic, which they do not read. It is possible that these statements were 
used as evidence against them during the trial proceedings. Staff from the Nigerian consulate in 
Jeddah attempted to visit the men in prison on 19 May 2005, but were not allowed to see them. 
The death sentence imposed on Suliamon Olyfemi had been upheld by the Court of Cassation 
and ratified by the Supreme Judicial Council.

<p> 
</p>
<p>246. On 1 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, regarding the case of 
Mahmoud Badr Hozbor, born in Al-Ghoutah al-Sharquia in Syria and resident of Sekaka 
(Al-Jouf). According to the allegations received, on 3 July 2003, he was arrested by the security 
services (Al-Mabahit al-Aama) when he was on his way to Syria together with his wife and four 
children. He was ordered to stop his car, forced to get out, was beaten and taken to an unknown 
place. He was held in solitary confinement for several months. During this period, Mr. Hozbor 
was repeatedly beaten on different parts of his body, suspended from his wrists, deprived of 
sleep and threatened with being killed. For six months after his arrest, in spite of many attempts 
to find out from the Saudi authorities, his family had no information about his whereabouts. 
They later learned that he was held at the prison of Al-Hayr, not far from Riyadh. Mr. Hozbor 
was taken out of his cell in the middle of the night and transferred to an office where several 
persons were present for what appeared to be a trial. One of them, to whom he mentioned that he 
had been ill-treated, told him to shut up and said that he would merit hanging. This person, 
presumably the judge, sentenced him to 18 months&#8217; imprisonment. After sentencing, he was 
transferred to the detention centre in Al-Jouf. No one has been able to visit Mr. Hozbor. He has 
not had access to any lawyer. Despite the fact that his prison term ended on 3 January 2005, 
Mr. Hozbor has not been released. It was reported that he was again transferred to another 
unknown location. Since Mr. Hozbor&#8217;s arrest, his four children have not been allowed to attend 
school, and the family has been deprived of access to certain basic services. 
</p>
<p>247. On 27 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, regarding the case Mr Matrouk al-Faleh, an academic and human rights defender in 
Saudi Arabia. Mr Matrouk al-Faleh was the subject of three previous communications sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
30 May 2005; by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 26 April 2004; and by the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on arbitrary detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human rights defenders on 19 March 2004. While the Special Rapporteurs 
acknowledged receipt of the replies of the Government dated 18 August 2005 and 
18 December 2004, the Special Rapporteurs seeked clarification on new information received. 
According to the new information received, on 19 May 2008, officers from the secret police 
arrested Mr Matrouk al-Faleh on the premises of King Saud University in Riyadh, where he 
teaches. Whereas his family was informed of his arrest later that same day, Mr Matrouk al-Faleh 
has not been given access to a lawyer or allowed any visit since then. Mr Matrouk al-Faleh&#8217;s 
family has not been informed of the reasons for his detention or what the charges were, and his 
whereabouts were unknown. Two days before his arrest, on 17 May 2008, Mr Matrouk al-Faleh 
had publicly criticized the harsh prison conditions in the overcrowded Buraida General Prison, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 146 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>where two other Saudi human rights defenders, Mr Abdullah al-Hamid and Mr &#8216;Isa al-Hamid, 
are serving prison sentences. Mr Abdullah al-Hamid and Mr &#8216;Isa al-Hamid were found guilty of 
&#8220;incitement to protest&#8221;, charges that were brought against them after they had supported and 
taken part in a reportedly peaceful demonstration outside the Buraida General Prison. The 
demonstrators called for their relatives&#8217; rights to being promptly informed about the charges 
brought against them and to a fair trial to be respected or, alternatively, to release them. 
Mr Al-Faleh&#8217;s statement criticized the restrictive procedures in relation to visits, the unhygienic 
conditions, the overcrowding, and the bad quality of medical services in the prison. His 
statement was later reproduced on http://www.menber-alhewar.info, a Saudi website. According 
to the information received, on 19 May 2008, this site was blocked for persons in Saudi Arabia. 
Mr Matrouk al-Faleh had previously been arrested in March 2004 after calling for political 
reform, and was sentenced to six years&#8217; imprisonment in May 2005 on charges that included 
&#8220;sowing dissent and disobeying the ruler.&#8221; He was released after having been granted a royal 
pardon by His Majesty King Abdullah on 8 August 2005. Since his release he has reportedly not 
been permitted to travel abroad. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr Matrouk al-Faleh might be solely connected to his reportedly peaceful activities in defending 
human rights and exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the 
alleged incommunicado detention of Mr Matrouk al-Faleh at an unknown place of detention, 
further concerns were expressed that he might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>248. On 5 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, regarding the cases of eight Bahraini teachers, all 
belonging to the Shi&#8217;a Muslims, namely Mr Majid Abdalrasol Salman Al-Ghasra, 
Mr Abbas Ahmed Ibrahim, Mr Sayed Ahmed Alawi Abdullah, Mr Issa A. Hasan Ahmed, 
Mr Mohammed Hassan Ali Marhoon, Mr Mohammad Abdullah Al-Moamen, 
Mr Ebaraim Marzam and Mr Mohamed Mahdi. According to the information received, the eight 
individuals named above were visiting Riyadh in early April 2008 during their holidays. It was 
believed that they had accidentally entered a restricted military area upon which they were 
arrested and detained at Hayr Prison in Riyadh. Despite intense efforts undertaken by their 
families in the Kingdoms of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia their detention was only disclosed by 
Saudi authorities four days after the arrests. The detainees were allowed to meet their parents 
only after 55 days of detention. Since their arrests they have been held in solitary confinement 
without charge or trial or access to legal counsel. The individuals were subjected to severe 
psychological pressure during interrogations on details of their lives, including their affiliations 
and beliefs. The investigators also accessed their email accounts. Concern was expressed that the 
arrest and detention of the eight above-mentioned individuals might be connected to the religious 
beliefs they hold as Shi&#8217;a Muslims. 
</p>
<p>249. On 13 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the case of 
Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem, a human rights lawyer who has been active in defending the rights 
of women. According to information received, since 2004, a travel banned has been imposed on 
Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem, banning him from foreign travel. Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem 
recently received the International Human Rights Lawyer Award from the American Bar 
Association, but due to the travel ban he was unable to collect the award in person. 
Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem has allegedly attempted to challenge the travel ban in an </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 147 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>administrative court, but the case was refused by the court. In November 2007, 
Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s license was revoked because he objected to the 
sentencing of a nineteen-year old female victim of rape. He has also previously been imprisoned 
for publicly speaking out against human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia as well as for defending 
three pro-democracy activists. Concern was expressed that the imposition of the travel ban on 
Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem may directly be related to his peaceful professional activities in 
defending human rights and in particular women&#8217;s rights. Concern was further expressed that the 
travel ban may be imposed to prevent the views of Mr Abdul Rahman Al Lahem from reaching a 
foreign audience. 
</p>
<p>250. On 22 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding the case of 
Mr. Saleh Awad Saleh Al Hweiti, aged 62, born in Riyad, where he studied and lived, stateless 
and therefore without any identity documents, a poet critical of the Government, who denounced 
poverty and the marginalisation of &#171; Bidune &#187;. His poems have been published and broadcast on 
several Saudi and international web-sites and radio programmes. According to the information 
received, Mr. Saleh Al Hweiti was arrested on 27 October 2004. For one month his whereabouts 
were unknown. Then it turned out that, following an allegedly unfair trial he had been sentenced 
to 21 months of imprisonment for defamation of Government officials and was held in Al Alicha 
prison not far from Riyad. During the interrogations leading to the verdict, he had repeatedly 
been beaten. Mr. Saleh Al Hweiti was then transferred to Al Hayr, where he should have been 
released on 27 September 2005. Although his family intervened on his behalf, he was released 
only 18 months later, on 5 April 2007 in Tabuk. Since he has no identity documents, the secret 
service ordered him to stay in the city and wait for clarification of his administrative situation. 
Six days later he was called in by the security services who arrested him again. He was then held 
secretly in different prisons until 20 January 2008, when he was allowed to make a phone call 
from Ta&#8217;ef prison. On 1 July 2008, he was again allowed to call from a prison in Jeddah. He had 
not been brought before a judicial authority and had routinely been subjected to beatings and 
other forms of ill-treatment during interrogations. As a result several of his face bones were 
fractured. 
</p>
<p>251. On 14 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of seven Filipino men found guilty of a 
triple murder. Three of them were sentenced to death and four to eight years imprisonment and 
one thousand lashes each. According to the information the Special Rapporteurs have received, 
Edison Gonzales, Rolando Manaloto Gonzales, Eduardo Arcilla, Victoriano Alfonso, Efren 
Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo and Joel Sinamban, seven Filipino migrant workers, were 
arrested in April 2006 on charges of having murdered three other Filipino nationals. The seven 
men were tried by a General Court in Jeddah and sentenced in July 2007. Eduardo Arcilla, 
Edison Gonzales and Rolando Manaloto Gonzales were sentenced to death. Victoriano Alfonso, 
Efren Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo, and Joel Sinamban were sentenced to eight years 
imprisonment and one thousand lashes each. The seven men were held incommunicado and were 
not given access to lawyers until April 2008, i.e. eight months after their conviction and </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sentencing in first instance. Allegedly, they were also tortured during interrogation in order to 
force them to confess to the murders, including by being beaten on the soles of their feet. The 
seven men were currently held at Briman Prison in Jeddah. It appeared that their appeals were 
still pending before the second instance court. 
</p>
<p>252. On 21 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the case of three foreign nationals, Mohamed Kohail, Mehanna Sa&#8217;d and Sultan Kohail. 
According to the information the Special Rapporteurs have received, Mohamed Kohail (now 
aged 23) and his brother Sultan Kohail (now aged 17) are citizens of Canada. Mehanna Sa&#8217;d 
(now aged 22) is a citizen of Jordan. The three were charged with the murder of a boy who died 
in a fight in January 2007. Following their arrest, they were held incommunicado for 
approximately one and a half months. They were allegedly beaten in an attempt to make them 
confess. In March 2008, the General Court in Jeddah sentenced Mohamed Kohail and 
Mehanna Sa&#8217;d to death. Their trial before the General Court in Jeddah had taken place over nine 
sessions, but their lawyer was allowed to attend only the last one or two, and was allegedly not 
allowed to challenge the evidence brought against his clients. The Court of Cassation 
subsequently reviewed the case and sent it back to the General Court with recommendations to 
review the sentence. On 9 August 2008, the Jeddah General Court rejected the recommendations 
of the Court of Cassation and/or sentenced the two men to death again. The case was again 
before the Court of Cassation. If upheld, the death sentences would be submitted to the Supreme 
Judicial Council for approval. Sultan Kohail was sentenced to 200 lashes and one year&#8217;s 
imprisonment by the Jeddah Summary Court in April 2008. In his case, the Court of Cassation 
recommended that the case be re-tried by a General Court, which has the power to pass the death 
sentence against him. His case was awaiting retrial at a General Court. 
</p>
<p>253. On 24 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, regarding the case of two 
foreign men reportedly sentenced to death on charges of apostasy or witchcraft following trials 
in which they did not, allegedly, enjoy the fundamental fair trial guarantees. One of the men, 
Sabri Bogday, might soon be at risk of execution, while the other, Mustafa Ibrahim, was 
executed in 2007. According to the information the Special Rapporteurs have received, 
Sabri Bogday, a Turkish citizen, owned a barber shop in Jeddah. He was arrested on 
11 March 2007 as he had been reported to the police to have insulted Islam and sworn at God in 
public. He was tried without the assistance of a lawyer or an interpreter, even though his 
knowledge of Arabic is apparently limited. On 31 March 2008 he was found guilty and 
sentenced to death on charges of apostasy. His case was reportedly currently at the review stage 
before the Court of Cassation. Sabri Bogday was detained in Briman Prison in Jeddah. 
Mustafa Ibrahim, a citizen of Egypt, was arrested in May 2007 in Arar, where he worked as a 
pharmacist, and accused of apostasy for having degraded a copy of the Qur&#8217;an. It was not known 
when his trial took place, whether he was assisted by a lawyer, whether he appealed against his 
first instance sentence. On 2 November 2007, Mustafa Ibrahim was executed in Riyadh. 
According to the announcement of the execution by the Ministry of the Interior, he was 
convicted of practicing sorcery and witchcraft. 
</p>
<p>254. On 11 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, regarding the case of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 149 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38 Syrian men allegedly at risk of execution. They were reportedly sentenced to death on 
charges of narcotics trafficking following trials in which they did not, allegedly, enjoy the 
fundamental fair trial guarantees. According to the information the Special Rapporteurs have 
received, thirty eight Syrian men, including one Mr. Bahjat Khalid Mas&#8217;ud, were sentenced to 
death on charges of drug trafficking in 2002. At no stage following their arrest were they given 
access to legal counsel. Their trial was secret and summary. The 38 Syrian prisoners appeared to 
have exhausted all available appeals and their cases were pending consideration by the King. The 
Syrian men were reportedly detained in al-Qurayyat Prison, in the province of al-Jawf, 
north-western Saudi Arabia. Recently some of them were moved to other, unknown places of 
detention, which raised fears among their relatives and friends in the Syrian Arab Republic that 
executions might be imminent.  
</p>
<p>255. On 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of Mr. Khaled 
Suleyman Al Omeir, aged 39, resident at Hai Badr in Riyad, and a human rights defender. 
According to the allegations received, Mr. Khaled Suleyman Al Omeir was arrested by the 
security service (Al Mabahit) in Riyad around noon on 1 January 2009, taken to Al Hayr prison, 
and has since then been detained incommunicado without any contact with the outside world. 
The arrest followed an attempted peaceful demonstration by a number of human rights defenders 
on 1 January 2009 to protest against the bombings of civilians in Gaza. Mr Al Omeir had been 
arrested previously, on 25 April 2005, following an interview with Al Jazeera television, during 
which he expressed his views about the political situation in the region. At that time, he 
remained in detention at Al Alicha prison for six months, during which he was ill-treated. He 
was subsequently released without any legal proceedings having taken place. With a view to the 
allegations that Mr Al Omeir was being held incommunicado, grave concern was expressed for 
his physical and mental integrity. 
</p>
<p>256. On 28 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of 16 Iraqi men 
allegedly at risk of execution in Saudi Arabia. They were reportedly sentenced to death 
following trials in which they did not enjoy the fundamental fair trial guarantees, such as access 
to a lawyer, and statements extorted under torture were allegedly used against them. Several of 
the men were reportedly sentenced to death on charges of drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 
According to the information the Special Rapporteurs have received, Mr. Mohammad Abdul 
Amir, aged 34, a citizen of Iraq, was arrested in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and charged with murder. 
He confessed to the crime after three months of interrogation during which he was allegedly 
beaten and suspended by his feet. He sustained a broken rib as a result of the treatment he was 
subjected to while being interrogated and was hospitalized for a month. A criminal court in Arar 
sentenced him to death after a trial closed to the public. He has not been allowed any access to 
lawyers or other legal assistance at any stage of the proceedings in his case. The death sentence 
has not yet been carried out as the children of the murder victim were too young to be consulted 
on whether Mohammad Abdul Amir was to be pardoned or executed. The children have now 
reached the age of majority and have informed the court that they want the execution. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar, aged 37, was arrested in November 2004 on charges related to 
drug trafficking. He was interrogated for three months during which he was allegedly tortured, 
including by being beaten on the soles of his feet and all over his body. He confessed to the 
charges as a consequence of the treatment. Ayadh Mana&#8217; Wanas Matar was sentenced to death in 
July 2008 by a criminal court in Rafha. He had no lawyer during his trial proceedings, which 
were not open to the public. At least 14 other Iraqi men were held in Rafha prison on death row 
and might be at risk of imminent execution. They include Mr. Hussein Baida Abud, aged 23, 
Mr. Adnan Jamil, aged 25, Mr. Mahmoud Shekar, aged 42, Khaled Mitan, aged 25. The charges 
on which they were convicted and sentenced to death include drug trafficking, connection with 
armed groups in Iraq and smuggling of weapons into Saudi Arabia. None of them has been 
allowed access to lawyers since their arrests. They were all beaten until they confessed. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>257. On 15 September 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 5 June 2008, 
stating that the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have indicated that the 
eight Bahraini teachers have been released few weeks ago and have returned to the Kingdom of 
Bahrain. 
</p>
<p>258. On 28 October 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 20 April 2007, on the 
requested information concerning the Nigerian prisoner Mr. Suliamon Alyfemi. In this 
connection, the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have indicated as follows: 
(1) The assistance of a lawyer during the investigatory stage was not requested by any of the 
accused or by their country&#8217;s embassy. (2) The accused were assisted by accredited translators 
during the stage of interrogation and subsequent signature by them of the record of the 
interrogation proceedings. (3) The Nigerian authorities did not request access to the accused at 
any stage of the investigation. However, the Director of Prisons in the Governorate of Jeddah 
indicated that the Consulate General of the Republic of Nigeria at Jeddah had requested 
permission for some persons to visit the Nigerian prisoners on Saturday 12/3/1428 AH 
(31 March 2007). (4) During the interrogation of the accused the competent authorities did not 
observe any signs of torture or other ill-treatment to which some of the accused claimed to have 
been subjected during their preliminary questioning. A physical examination conducted at the 
time by the investigating officer did not reveal any signs of assault and a report to this effect was 
duly drawn up. (5) The attack by the accused on the police officers is attributable to the 
implementation, on 8/9/1423 AH (13 November 2002), of the first phase of the Diya&#8217; 90 
campaign to arrest Nigerian national living in the Balad district of Jeddah in violation of the 
Kingdom&#8217;s residence regulations. When one of the Nigerians, Salswa al-Lami, nicknamed 
&#8220;al-Mutawwa&#8221;, was arrested, Suliamon and the other accused attacked the police officers, freed 
their friend, and then continued to pursue the officers, pelting them with empty bottles, sticks 
and skewers. When one of the police officers, senior patrolman Ali bin Tami Asiri, fell to the 
ground they assaulted him and beat him with the automatic weapon that he was carrying, thereby 
causing his death. Patrolman Essam bin Salim Al-Muwallad and private Fawaz bin Uweili 
Al-Muwallad were also injured during the assault and the window of a police patrol vehicle was 
broken so that one of the arrest persons could be taken out after the patrol commander was 
attacked. The accused person, Suliamon, confessed to taking the automatic weapon from the 
police officer&#8217;s hand when the latter fell to the ground, after which he struck him three times 
with the butt of the weapon; first on his right cheek, then on the right side of the back of his 
head, and finally on his shoulder, after which he threw the weapon on the victim&#8217;s body as he lay </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>on the ground. He observed blood flowing from the dying man&#8217;s mouth before they fled. The 
accused also affirmed and legally testified that he and his associates had conspired in advance to 
attack the police officers. The case was investigated by a district police committee and examined 
by the Makkah branch of the Public Investigation and Prosecution Department, after which the 
accused were questioned again by the Department. The indictment was drawn up and reviewed 
by the Department&#8217;s governing body (Review Decision no. 470/M of 1423 AH). 
</p>
<p>259. On 25 November 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 22 July 2008, 
stating that the said person was detained on 30 April 2003 on the basis of a security-related 
charge (relevant to terrorist activities) and subsequently released on 23 April 2007. New 
accusations made against him then necessitated his detention once again on 29 April 2007 for 
purposes of questioning. Since his detention he has been treated in accordance with the judicial 
regulations in the Kingdom, which respect human rights and comply with the International 
Covenants and other conventions. 
</p>
<p>260. On 27 November 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 21 August 2008, 
stating that: (1) Jeddah police has transmitted the suit of the above-mentioned persons to the 
Commission for Investigation and General Prosecution (Mecca Branch) regarding a mass quarrel 
resulted in the assassination of a man called Monzer Mo&#8217;in Al Haraki, a Syrian citizen. The 
inquiry and the interrogations made with these persons revealed the indictment of those involved 
in the incident namely Mohamed Kohail and Mehanna Sa&#8217;d of the assassination intentionally of 
Monzer Mo&#8217;in Al Haraki beating him fatal strokes. Afterwards, Monzer mo&#8217;in Al Haraki drops 
down dead. Likewise, a charge has been raised against Sultan Kohail for taking part with them in 
beating the man assassinated and making improper advanced to the girl called Raneem Al 
Haraki, and for his complicity and incitement in the quarrel according to the evidence and 
indication set forth in the bill of indictment. The lawsuit has been transmitted to the General 
Court in Jeddah in order to be examined with regard to the public and private rights. A legal 
judgement N. 13/300/7 was issued on 26/2/1429 (4 March 2008) comprising the sentence of 
death penalty against Mohamed Kohail and Mehana Sa&#8217;d. The case has been transmitted to the 
Court of Cassation. The legal documents of the juvenile Sultan Kohail have been forwarded to 
the penal court in Jeddah to be considered by the juvenile judge. A legal judgement has been 
issued comprising the imprisonment of the juvenile Sultan Kohail for one year and 200 lashes. 
(2) The above two persons accused were held incommunicado, without any violation of their 
rights to contact their lawyers, in the interest of the investigation, for a period not exceeding 
60 days according to article (119) of the law of criminal procedures. They were registered and 
checked up in the presence of their lawyers and were legally endorsed by the General Court in 
Jeddah. (3) The governing rules in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the Sharia which prohibits 
torture and the extraction of any confession under torture. The Sharia proscribes harming any 
person held in custody either hysically or morally, and forbids to be the subject to torture or 
degrading treatment for his dignity pursuant to article two of the law of criminal procedures 
which does not recognize any confession extracted under torture. (4) During the first hearing of 
investigation with each of the persons accused and before starting the interrogation, a reading of 
the guarantees has taken place regarding their rights to call upon the assistance of a lawyer. 
Subsequently, they have appointed a lawyer and he was present in the interrogation hearing and 
was apprised of the legal proceedings documents and has examined the entire procedure. 
</p>
<p>261. On 30 January 2009, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 1 April 2008, stating 
that the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have indicated that the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned person was detained on a security-related charge which necessitated his 
remand in custody for purposes of investigation in order to determine the legal action to be taken 
against him. Throughout the period of his detention he has been treated in accordance with the 
Kingdom&#8217;s judicial regulations and the international fair trial standards.  
<b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>262. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Saudi Arabia for its replies 
of 15 September, 28 October, 25 November, 27 November 2008 and 30 January 2009. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to his letters of 27 May 2008, 
13 June 2008, 14 August 2008, 24 October 2008, 11 December 2008, 21 January 2009 and 
28 January 2009. He urges the Government of Saudi Arabia to provide at the earliest possible 
date detailed substantive replies to the above allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Serbia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>263. On 5 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, regarding the Draft 
Law on Judges and the Draft High Court Act in conjunction with articles 142 to 155 of the 2006 
Constitution. At the outset, the Special Rapporteur commended on the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
reform the judicial system in order to live up to article 1 of the 2006 Constitution, enshrining, 
inter alia, the principles of the rule of law and democracy. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
drew the Government&#8217;s attention to two substantive areas that give rise to concern in relation to 
the above-mentioned provisions: 1) the requirement of re-election of sitting judges, and 2) 
procedures governing the membership of the High Court Council, including the establishment of 
its first composition. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, certain aspects of these draft 
provisions would require reconsideration in order to secure their compliance with international 
standards on the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>264. First, chapter 8 of the Draft Law on Judges prescribes that the mandates of judges elected 
under the present Law on Judges will cease on 31 July 2009 unless they are re-elected as judges 
by the National Assembly in accordance with article 147 of the Constitution. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the Basic Principles on the Independence 
of the Judiciary, adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 September 1985 and endorsed 
by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985, 
in particular principle 12 which stipulates &#8220;Judges, whether appointed or elected, shall have 
guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, where 
such exists.&#8221; Furthermore, I would like to refer to principle 1.3. of Recommendation (94) 12 of 
the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the independence, efficiency and role of 
judges. 
265. The irremovability of judges is one of the main pillars guaranteeing the independence of 
the judiciary. Article 101 para. 1 of the 1990 Constitution conferred life tenures upon judges. 
Furthermore, the principle of irremovablity was enshrined in Article 101 para. 3 of the 1990 
Constitution. Article 146 of the 2006 Constitution stipulates that &#8220;A judge shall have a 
permanent tenure. Exceptionally, a person who is elected a judge for the first time shall be </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 153 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>elected for the period of three years.&#8221; Consequently, current sitting judges who were appointed 
either pursuant to procedures under the 1990 Constitution and applicable legislation or according 
to the 2006 Constitution and related legislation enjoy life tenures, with exception of those elected 
for an initial period of three years.  
</p>
<p>266. The principle of irremovability must be comprehended as a means to achieve independence 
of the judiciary (so judges can act without fear of political retaliation of their decisions). It is 
understandable to have concerns about the independence and impartiality of judges who have 
aligned themselves with previous regimes. Nevertheless, as it has been stated by the Consultative 
Council of European Judges (CCJE), &#8220;The existence of exceptions to irremovability, particularly 
those deriving from disciplinary sanctions, leads immediately to consideration of the body and 
method by which, and basis upon which, judges may be disciplined. Recommendation 
No. R (94) 12, Principle VI (2) and (3), insists on the need for precise definition of offences for 
which a judge may be removed from office and for disciplinary procedures complying with the 
due process requirements of the Convention on Human Rights. Beyond that it says only that 
&#8216;States should consider setting up, by law, a special competent body which has as its task to 
apply any disciplinary sanctions and measures, where they are not dealt with by a court, and 
whose decisions shall be controlled by a superior judicial organ, or which is a superior judicial 
organ itself&#8217;&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>267. Thus, only in exceptional circumstances the principle of irremovability may be 
transgressed. For example, in situations of transition, the objective of limitations to this principle 
is to end impunity and the reoccurrence of grave human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>268. Thus, in accordance with the above-mentioned principle, it would be key to inquire 
objectively on a case-by-case basis whether a judge was appointed unlawfully or whether he/she 
derives judicial power from an act of allegiance so as to determine to relieve the person from 
his/her functions. However, such objective decision cannot be made by a procedure whereby the 
legislature re-elects judges. Thus, it would be essential that such case-by-case inquiry be made 
by an independent body which would have the final decisive power in the case at hand.  
</p>
<p>269. In addition to that, the following safeguards need to be established: 1) the procedure must 
be conducted by an independent and impartial body and respect the principle of due process, 
2) the review must be based on clear and transparent criteria, 3) the review must only address 
past behaviour incompatible with the role of an independent judge, and 4) there must be an 
opportunity to challenge the decision declining re-appointment in proceedings that meet the 
criteria of independence and impartiality. 
</p>
<p>270. Therefore, in view of the lack of provisions providing for a case-by-case review respecting 
the above-mentioned safeguards, in my opinion, the provisions relating to the re-election of all 
judges by the National Assembly are not in compliance with international standards on the 
independence of the judiciary.  
</p><p>271. Second, Article 20 of the Draft High Court Council Act stipulates that the members of the 
High Court Council are elected by the National Assembly at the nomination of the authorized 
nominators, i.e. the High Court Council, the Serbian Bar and the deans of accredited faculties of 
law of the Republic of Serbia. At the outset, the Special Rapporteur brought to the Government&#8217;s 
attention the general concern that the involvement of the legislature in judicial appointments, </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 154 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>such as enshrined in article 147 of the 2006 Constitution, risks to lead to their politicization. The 
benefit of such parliamentary procedure is specifically difficult to see for judges at the 
lower-level courts. Furthermore, in particular in times of transition, it is crucial that the 
population gain confidence in a court system administering justice in an independent and 
impartial manner free from political considerations. Therefore, specific efforts should be made 
that judicial appointments are made according to objective criteria having regard to 
qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiency.  
</p>
<p>272. In order to strengthen independence through the appointment of new judges, the 
composition of the High Court Council, as stated by the Constitution in Articles 153-155, should 
genuinely respect the proposals made by the authorized nominators. To ensure that such Council 
is apt to act in an objective and fair manner when selecting judges, its members must be 
appointed in such way so as to reflect the principle of independence in its composition. Only if 
composed in such a way, the Council will be able to guarantee the independence and autonomy 
of the courts and judges, as enshrined in article 153 of the 2006 Constitution. Thus, here again, 
election of the Council members by the legislature will put the Council in the center of politics, 
which is not likely not further its independence.  
</p>
<p>273. In this connection, it becomes obvious that the selection of the members of the first High 
Court Council is of utmost significance. Pursuant to article 50 para. 3 of the Draft High Court 
Council Act, the present High Judicial Council shall - in the transition period - perform the tasks 
related to the election of the members of the first composition of the High Court Council. 
According to the information available at the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s disposal, the present High 
Judicial Council was established in line with articles 2 to 4 of the Law on the High Judicial 
Council, comprising five permanent members (President of the Supreme Court, the Public 
Prosecutor and the Minister in charge of judiciary, all ex officio, one member from the Bar and 
one member elected by the National Assembly) and eight invited members, among them six 
judges (elected by the Supreme Court) and two prosecutors (one elected by the deputy Public 
Prosecutor and one elected by district public prosecutors at joint session). According to article 52 
para. 2 of the Draft High Court Council Act, candidates for the election of the members of the 
High Court Council should be proposed to the High Judicial Council by the sessions of all judges 
of the courts. According to article 52 para. 5 of the Draft High Court Council Act, it is then up to 
the High Judicial Council to propose the candidates for membership of the first composition of 
the High Court Council to the National Assembly. Therefore, the role of the present High 
Judicial Council is paramount in this context.  
</p>
<p>274. In order to conduct the judicial reform process in a proper and impartial manner, it is the 
Special Repporteur&#8217;s opinion that the judiciary and other parties directly linked with the 
administration of justice should have a say, a substantial one, with respect to selecting the 
candidates to the High Court Council. 
</p>
<p>275. In sum, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view the procedures for the appointment of the 
members of the High Court Council and specifically its first composition should be revisited. 
Furthermore, thorough reflection should be given to the procedures for nominating judges.  
</p><p>276. While the Special Rapporteur reaffirmed his appreciation of the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
reform the judicial system and acknowledge that such reform process is of complex and difficult 
nature, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the above mentioned reform proposals. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 155 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the Special Rapporteur encouraged the executive and legislative branches of 
government to consider the above mentioned concerns and to amend the relevant draft legislation 
accordingly in order to secure their compliance with international standards. In that context, 
transparent and inclusive deliberations with the main stake holders, particularly the judiciary, 
should be conducted prior to the adoption of the laws. The Special Rapporteur confirmed that he 
stands ready to provide the Government with support and assistance concerning the 
recommendations outlined in this letter and remain at your disposal with regard to any related 
question or request that your Government would wish to seek. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>277. On 22 January 2009, the Government replies to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter 
of 5 November 2008. The following is a summary of the extensive and detailed letter of the 
Government. The Government informs that the Ministry of Justice has commenced with core 
changes and reform endavours to revive the judicial system since the new Government was 
formed in May 2007. It is further noted that despite a number of legal changes implemented 
since 2000, the judicial system in the Republic of Serbia has not been functioning in line with 
European standards and the needs of the citizens of the country for a longer period of time. The 
need for reform has also arisen due to a number of complaints reaised by the citizens in respect 
of considerable duration of cases, lack of possibilities to enforce court judgmenets and 
corruption. Among the identified weaknesses of the judicial system are the following: overly 
complex and broad system of courts, unclear standards of election, dismissal, performance and 
promotion of judges. The government further informs that a comprehensive package of judicial 
laws was adopted by the National Assembly on 22 December 2008 which comprises, inter alia, 
Law on the High Judicial Council, Law on Judges and the Law on the Organisation of Courts. Of 
exceptional significance is the establishment of a new judicial architecture with the Supreme 
Court of Cassation, Appealates Courts and the Administrative Court. The new laws also provide 
for the establishment of an indendent judicial budget, the developments of clear and measurable 
criteria for election, promotion, disciplinary proceedings and the dismissal of judges. The 
judicial laws also provide for a complete reorganization of the judicial network that will facilitate 
access to justice. Under the new system, the High Judicial Council ensures and guarantees the 
autonomy of courts and judges. The High Judicial Council formulates criteria for election of 
judges, it elects and dismisses judges, decides on promotion, accountability, material position of 
judges, termination of judicial duty, proposes to the National Assembly candidates to be elected 
for the first time. Judges alone will elect the High Judicial Council members among themselves. 
In the first composition, this will be done by the High Judiciary Council (High Court Council) as 
the most relevant judicial body. The permanent composition of the High Judicial Council, in 
respect of elective members, will be elected by the entire judicialy at general elections within 
their own system according to rules stipulated by law. The laws regulating the status of judges 
will have two novelties: first, the evaluations of judge&#8217;s performance to be conducted by the 
judges alone, and, second, detailed provisions regulating disciplinary liability of judges. The 
above mentioned legislative solutions are in compliance with the Consitutiona and the 
Concstitutional Law on the Implementation of the Consitution. Consequentely, transitional and 
final provisions of this Law provide for a general election to judicial institutions. Having in mind 
the the current situation in Serbia, the general election is undoubtedly the only solution for the 
renewal of the judiciary in terms of human resources. Bearing in mind that the High Judicial 
Council will be exclusively competent for the general election, there is no fear of political 
influence by the Parliament. The general election will be based upon objective, professional </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>foundations and criteria in order to prevent the considerable influence excerted by political and 
executive power. The criteria will be based upon objective assessment of each judges&#8217;s output in 
the preceding period, whereas the High Judicial Council will, as an additional factor, take into 
account the merit of a judge in the performance of its judicial duties. In accordance with the 
Law, the High Court Council will draft precise criteria and send them to the Vencie Commission 
to obtain their opinion prior to adoption. The letters then informs about other reforms and reform 
efforts in the areas of judicial training and the system of the public prosectutor. The Government 
concludes by stating that it highly appreciates if the Special Rapporteur could provide support to 
implement the judicial reform in line with international and Europan standards.

<p>279. On 8 December 2006, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter<b>8</b> together with 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human 
rights defenders regarding the arrest of and charges brought against Fr. Jesuratnam Jude Bernard 
Omi, Director of the Centre for Peace and Reconciliation (CPR) in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. According 
to the information received, on 24 November 2006, Fr. Omi was arrested after he intervened in a 
matter concerning a young man, Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageethan, who had been 
detained for allegedly distributing leaflets issued by the Justice Peace Commission (JPC) 
concerning the humanitarian situation in Jaffna. It is reported that Mr. Mariyanayaham had been 
queuing for food at the 6 CLI army camp when his cousin, Ms. Alanday Dinosha, spoke with 
him and gave him one of the aforementioned leaflets to read. Members of the Sri Lankan Army 
(SLA) reportedly confiscated the leaflet and asked Mr. Mariyanayaham questions relating to its 
origin. When he referred to his cousin, troops allegedly went to her house in order to arrest her, 
but she had gone to seek the assistance of Fr. Omi, who immediately contacted and informed the 
JPC of the situation. A member of the JPC, Fr. Francis Xavier Jeyasegaram, accompanied 
Fr. Omi, Ms. Alanday and her mother to the army camp where Mr.Mariyanayaham was detained. 
They were allegedly photographed by SLA troops and threatened by Colonel Manjula who said, 
&#8220;If you all can organize a campaign against the forces we will also do things against you all. You 
all will face the consequences soon.&#8221; As they left the camp with Mr. Mariyanayaham, the 
colonel allegedly circled around them on a motorcycle. Later that day, it is reported that Fr. Omi 
went to the High Court where Brigade Commander Godipilli stated that Fr. Omi and 
Fr. Jeyasegaram had distributed the leaflets to people in the queue. Two soldiers were apparently

<p>called as witnesses but they never appeared before the court. It is further reported that Fr. Omi 
then went to the District Court to record a statement, but while there, army troops surrounded the 
office of the CPR and arrested Fr. Jeyasegaram. According to reports, Fr. Omi went to the 
Human Rights Commission and recorded a statement before going to the 6 CLI camp escorted 
by members of the Non-Violent Peaceforce. The sources indicate that the SLA transferred the 
two priests, along with Mr Mariyanayaham, Ms. Alanday and their parents, in an army vehicle to 
the police station, where they were handed over to the police. Reportedly they all made 
individual statements and Ms. Alanday was subjected to a full-body search. At approximately 
10.55 p.m. the two priests were allegedly taken to the acting magistrate in relation to a curfew 
pass and were released at 11.45 p.m. and taken to the bishop&#8217;s house. Mr. Mariyanayaham and 
Ms. Alanday were reportedly released on bail the next day. On 29 November 2006, the four 
individuals appeared before the Magistrate&#8217;s Court of Jaffna where they were allegedly charged 
under criminal law although they were not informed of the charges brought against them. They 
were told that their file would be sent to the Attorney General&#8217;s Department and the charges 
against them should be announced by 31 January 2007. They have all reportedly been ordered 
not to leave the country and they will not be permitted to leave Jaffna before the start of the trial. 
Concern was expressed that the arrest of Fr. Jesuratnam Jude Bernard Omi may be related to his 
defence of the right of Mr. Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageethan and 
Ms. Alanday Dinosha to exercise their freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed 
that the charges against him are fabricated and that he will not receive a fair or impartial trial.

<p>280. On 5 April 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal,<b>9</b> together with the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, 
regarding the case of Mr Dushyantha Basnayake, human rights defender and financial director of 
Standard Newspapers Private Limited (SNPL), which publishes the Sinhalese-language weekly 
Mawbima, in Colombo and Ms Parameswaree Munusamy, journalist with Mawbima. According 
to information received, on 26 February 2007, Mr Basnayake was arrested at his office in 
Colombo by officials from the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID). He was reportedly being 
detained incommunicado at the Terrorist Investigation Unit in Colombo where he had been 
denied access to a lawyer. Mr Basnayake was questioned by officials from the Criminal 
Investigations Division (CID) several months prior to his arrest. He was later released without 
charge and the authorities allegedly apologised for any inconvenience caused. On 
13 March 2007 Mr Basnayake&#8217;s bank accounts were frozen. Previously on 24 November 2006, 
Ms Munusamy was detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) at the Terrorist 
Investigation Unit in Colombo. She was reportedly held without charge by the police Terrorist 
Investigation Division (TID). On 21 March 2007, an order was issued by the Supreme Court to 
release Ms Munusamy on the basis that her arrest was illegal and that there was insufficient 
evidence in order to convict her. She was released on 22 March 2007. Ms Munusamy was the 
only Tamil speaking journalist working for Mawbima and her arrest was related to the 
publication of articles by Mawbima in Tamil, which highlighted human rights abuses in 
Sri Lanka. On 24 February 2006, President Rajapaksa reportedly criticised the management and 
journalists of Mawbima newspaper for their coverage of human rights violations in Sri Lanka

<p>during a press conference. Newspaper staff have been receiving death threats since February. 
Concern was expressed that arrest and detention of Mr Dushyantha Basnayake along with the 
arrest, detention and subsequent release of Ms Parameswaree Munusamy forms part of an 
ongoing campaign to silence human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, and in particular those who 
aim to highlight human rights violations in the country.  
</p>
<p>281. On 19 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, regarding the case of Mr. Gunasundaram 
Jayasundaram, a dual Sri Lankan-Irish citizen, usually residing in Singapore. According to the 
information received, on 4 September 2007, he was arrested by Terrorist Investigation Division 
(TID) officers at the airport upon arrival from Singapore. He was arrested without a warrant and 
on the orders of the Secretary of Defence. Mr. Jayasundaram was allowed access to his lawyers 
only twice, in October and December 2007, despite numerous written requests to the authorities 
for access to legal counsel. The Honorary Consul of the Republic of Ireland in Colombo was 
allowed to visit him only once, on 14 December 2007. On 29 October 2007, a writ of habeas 
corpus was filed by his lawyer and four court hearings have taken place since then: on 
23 January, 5 and 26 March, and 11 June 2008. No decision was taken by the court and 
Mr. Jayasundaram was not presented before the court in persona. The next hearing was 
scheduled for 27 June 2008. No charges have been brought against Mr. Jayasundaram and no 
trial date has been scheduled yet. Mr. Jayasundaram has recently been transferred from the 
detention facilities of TID to Boossa Prison, where he spent 16 days in solitary confinement. One 
of his relatives was allowed to visit him on 13 June. Mr. Jayasundaram suffered from high blood 
pressure and had run a fever for about four days, which had caused muscle spasms, making 
movements in his cell difficult. He had to sleep on the floor, was not provided with any reading 
material, and had not been allowed to buy any food in the canteen. In view of the reported 
deterioration of his health and conditions of detention, concerns were expressed for 
Mr. Jayasundaram&#8217;s state of health.

<p>282. On 6 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Chairman of the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, regarding the case of Mr. J.C. Weliamuna, 
lawyer and executive director of the Sri Lanka branch of the organisation Transparency 
International. According to the information received, on 27 September 2008, the premises of 
Mr. Weliamuna were attacked by two grenades. While the first grenade exploded, the second one 
was later found inside the house by the police. In the past, Mr. Weliamuna has dealt with 
important cases of bribery and corruption most of which involved state officials. He has also 
acted as a lawyer in bringing sensitive cases of alleged serious human rights violations to court, 
including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and torture. On the day of the attack, 
Mr. Weliamuna moved a motion at the Bar Council in relation to a lawyer who had received 
death threats as a consequence of his appearance in a case of alleged extra-judicial killing. 
Concern was expressed that the attack against Mr. Weliamuna may be related to his activities in 
the defense of human rights, including as a lawyer. 
</p>
<p>283. On 6 November 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding threats received by 
registrars of all courts and a number of human rights lawyers in Sri Lanka. According to the 
information received, on 21 October 2008, registrars of all courts in Sri Lanka and a number of 
human rights lawyers reportedly received a notice from a group that identifies itself as the </p>

referred to as &#8220;traitors&#8221;, and should &#8220;be subject to the same fate that the terrorists mete out to 
[their enemies]&#8221;. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental integrity of lawyers who 
offer legal assistance to suspected terrorists.

<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>284. On 2 September 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 8 December 2006 
concerning the alleged arrest of Fr. Jeruratnam Jude Bernard, Fr. Francis Xavier Jeyasegaram, 
Mr. Mariyanaham Godfrey Morris Gnanageetham and Ms. Alanday Dinosha and thereby 
allegedly violating their rights to the exercice of freedom of expression. The Government stated 
that upon receipt of the joint communication from the UN and upon consideration or the 
allegations contained therein, reports were called from the Police and the Army on the alleged 
arrest of Fr Jesuratnam Jude Bernard, Fr Francis Xaviel Jeyasegaram, Mr Mariyanaham Godfry 
Morris Gnanageetham and Ms Alanday Dinosha and thereby allegedly violating their right to the 
exercise of freedom of expression. The Security Forces Headquarters Jaffna has submitted a 
report having conducted a full scale inquiry into the alleged arrest of the above mentioned 
persons on 24 November 2006. On the day of the incident the troops belonging to 6th Battalion, 
Sri Lanka Light Infantry of 512 Brigade manning an Army Welfare Shop, established at 
Colombathurai for the purpose of distributing essential food items, had been distributing food 
items to a large gathering of people. Around 11.30 hours in the morning a person who 
approached the troops had informed that there was a person distributing leaflets containing anti 
government slogans at the tail of the queue. Troops had gone to the tail of the queue about 
100 meters away and found Mr. Mariyanayaham Godfry Morris Gnanageetham distributing the 
last few of the leaflets to the people in the queue. The troops had confiscated a copy of the 
leaflet. The leaflet contained anti governmental slogans in an obvious attempt to agitate the 
general public and disrupt the government&#8217;s effort to restore normalcy in the area. During an on 
the spot inquiry Mr. Gnanageetham had revealed that the leaflets were given to him by 
Ms. Alanday Dinosha that morning to be distributed among the public. A message had been 
passed requesting Ms. Alanday Dinosha to come to the location and she had come accompanied 
by her mother. On arrival Ms. Alanday Dinosha had revealed that the leaflets were given to her 
by Fr. Francis Xavier Jayasegaram. Meanwhile, even before troops summoned him, 
Fr. Jesuratnam Jude Bernard and had acknowledged that he gave the leaflets to Ms. Dinosha to 
be distributed among the public. The Troops had contacted the Commanding Officer of 
6th Battalion, Sri Lanka Light Infantry seeking instructions on further action. He had instructed 
troops to follow the normal procedure and hand over the suspects to the Police for further 
investigations. Troops had complied and hand over the suspects to the police for further 
investigations. Troops had complied and handed over the suspects to the Jaffna Police Station on 
the same afternoon. The Police had produced them before the Magistrate of Jaffna under 
M/C B 532/2006 who in turn had released them on bail. The case had been referred to 
Hon. Attorney General&#8217;s department under reference No. CN/17/2007 for instructions. 
Attorney General&#8217;s instructions on the case are still pending. Based on the reports received from 
the Brigade and the unit concerned the following observations are made with regards to the 
allegations made in the abovementioned joint communications: the contents of the leaflets were 
full of malice against the army, written with the aim of agitating the people and disrupting the 
government&#8217;s efforts at bringing normally to the area; the Commanding Officer who was not 
present at the scene could not have used any threatening language as alleged in the complaint; </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 160 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Fr. Jeyasegaram and Fr. Jude Bernard have publicly acknowledge that they used the young male 
and female in question to distribute these leaflets; the troops have not done anything in excess of 
their mandates and they have followed the correct procedure by officially handing over the 
suspects to police for onward legal actions; The Female in question had been accompanied by 
her mother and there had been no attempt to harass her as the complainant attempts to imply; 
None of the suspects had been detained in an Army Camp as alleged in the complaint. They had 
only been held near a wealfare shop run by the Army and located in a public place in 
Colombathurai until properly handed over to the police; there is no information of a complaint 
made by the alleged victims to the Police seeking redress of their grievances. It is brought to the 
attention that the Security Forces had acted bona fide in the lawful performance of their duties in 
taking into custody the personnel involved in anti Government/anti Security forces propaganda 
campaign in order to maintain law and order in the Jaffna Peninsula.  
</p>
<p>285. On 2 September 2008, the Government also replies to the urgent appeal of 5 April 2007, 
concerning the arrest and detention of Dushyantha Basnayake and Parameshwarce Munusamy. 
Basnayake Mudiyanselage Dushyantha Basnayake was taken into custody on 26 February 2007 
at 21.15hrs in his office at no: 99/6. Rosmead Place, Colombo 07 for alleged complicity in 
terrorist activities and was detained at the Terrorist investigation Division at No: 101, 
Chaithya Rd, Colombo 01 on a detention ordre issued by Secretaria/ Ministry of Defense in 
terms of regulation 19(1) of the Eergency Regulations. Reasons for his arrests &amp; detention were 
explained to him and also to his Attorney-at-Law i.e. suspected to have aided and abetted 
terrorist activities by way of providing financial assistance to a known LTTE activist named 
Luxmie Emi Kanthan who is absconding at present. Facts in this regard were reported to the 
Chief Magistrate, Colombo, under case no: 998/1/2007 periodically. In the course of this 
investigation, it was revealed that Dushyantha Basnayake is the Financial and Administration 
Director of the CEB Group of Companies at No: 99/6. Rosmead Place, Colombo 07. He is also 
the Financial Director of the &#8220;Standard Newspapers Private Limited&#8221; which publishes 
&#8220;Mawbima&#8221; Sinhala Newspaper. He is not a journalist, through he functions as the owner and 
the printer of &#8220;Mawbima&#8221; Newspaper. Financial transactions of the CBE Group of Companies 
are being investigated on an order given by the Colombo High Court. Inquiries also revealed that 
Dushyantha Basnayaka had sold nearly 12,000 &#8220;Dialog&#8221; mobile telephone connections through 
CEB Group of Companies to the North and East of Sri Lanka with the assistance of 
Luxmie Emil Katban. There is no documentation maintained concerning these transactions. It 
was also revealed during investigations that Dushyantha Basnayaka was instrumental in building 
a house at Pitakotte spending around RS. 13 Million for the mother of Luxmie Emil Kanthan. It 
also transpired that during the period of 1 April 2005 and 24 March 2006 Dushyantha Basnayaka 
had released about Rs. 57 million from the funds of CBE to Emil Kathan and to his nominees. 
Material elicited so far were forwarded to the Hon. Attorney General and he is of the view that 
Dushshyantha Basnayake and other Board of Directors of the CBE Group of Companies could 
be charged under section 3 of the Convention of the Supervision of Terrorist Financing 
act no: 25 of 2005. Accordingly Dushshyantha Basnayake was produced before the Colombo 
Chief Magistrate on the above charge and was enlarged on bail on 8 May 2007 pending legal 
proceedings. The Government also stated that consequent to information received by the Police 
to the effect that a suicide LTTE women cadre had come to Colombo, officers of the Special 
Task Force (STF) effected the arrest of one Tambirasa Sunsanthi of Batticaloa on 
213 November 2006 at 21.00 hrs. at Wallawatte. At the time of his arrest Munisamy 
Paramenshwary was responsible for providing accommodation to Tambirasa Susanthi at No: 28, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 161 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Ramakrishna Road, Wallawatte. On the basis of the evidence Parameswari too was arrested by 
the STF. Subsequently they were handed over to Special Task Force (TID) for further 
investigations. Munisamy Parameshwari was detained on a Detention Order issued by the 
Secretary /Ministry of the Defense in terms of Regulation 19(1) of the Emergency Regulations. 
Reasons for her arrest and detention were explained to her and to the Attorney at Law who 
represented her that she was alleged to have aided and abetted Thambiraso Susanthi for her 
intended terrorist activities in Colombo. Munisamy Parameswari was produced before the Chief 
Magistrate Court of Colombo in terms of Regulation 21(1) of the Emergency Regulations under 
case no: B 7875/1/6 on 22 December 2006 and detained at the TID for further investigation. Her 
relatives and attorneys had access to her during her detention and the International Committee of 
the Red Cross too visited her on several occasions. In depth investigations conducted by the TID 
revealed that Thambiasa Susanthi had ties with the LTTE leadership and was closely associated 
to a hardcore LTTE cadre in Colombo. It also revealed that Munisamy Parameswari had made 
arrangements to accommodate Thambirasa Susanthi in Colombo. It further revealed that 
Munisamy Parameswari is not a registered Journalist at the Department of Government 
Information. Even in the year 2005 she had been found loitering in the high security areas. 
Consequent to an application submitted to the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka by her attorneys 
against her arrest and detention, the Hon. Attorney General Advised that the material available is 
insufficient to institute legal proceedings against Munisamy Parameswari and accordingly she 
was released through he chief Magistrate Court of Colombo on 22 March 2007 under reference 
case No. B 8347/01/2206. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>286. On 9 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement, jointly 
with nine other special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten independent UN Experts expressed their deep concern at the deteriorating human 
rights situation in Sri Lanka, particularly the shrinking space for critical voices and the fear 
of reprisals against victims and witnesses which - together with a lack of effective 
investigations and prosecutions - has led to unabated impunity for human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>The UN Experts also unreservedly condemned this morning&#8217;s suicide attack, allegedly by a 
female Tamil Tiger, which reportedly killed 28 and injured about 90 civilians and soldiers 
in Mullaitivu district in north-east Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p>Speaking of the general human rights situation in the country, Ms. Margaret Sekaggya, the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, said &#8220;A climate of fear and 
intimidation reigns over those defending human rights, especially over journalists and 
lawyers.&#8221; The safety of defenders has worsened considerably over the past year, most 
significantly following denunciations of human rights abuses committed by parties to the 
conflict, of corruption by state officials and of impunity. Serious and fatal aggression 
against journalists and the media are now a common occurrence as witnessed in the killing 
of the journalist Lasantha Wickremetunga and recent attacks on major media outlets. 
The fighting in the North of the country has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilians 
being internally displaced and trapped. The UN Experts share the deep concern of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights over the rapidly deteriorating </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 162 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>conditions facing those civilians and the significant number of civilian casualties. They 
also deplore the restrictions on humanitarian access to conflict areas which exacerbate the 
ongoing serious violations of the most basic economic and social rights.  
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the severity of the abuses in areas of conflict, the Experts wish to 
highlight that the problem is deeper and more endemic. The conflict deflects attention from 
the impunity which has been allowed to go unabated throughout Sri Lanka. The fear of 
reprisals against victims and witnesses, together with a lack of effective investigations and 
prosecutions, has led to a circle of impunity that must be broken. The Experts continue to 
receive disturbing reports of torture, extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearances 
throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>The UN Experts strongly urge the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately take measures 
to ensure that effective remedial action can be pursued in support of the victims of human 
rights abuses and their families. They also highlight that thorough reforms of the general 
system of governance are needed to prevent the reoccurrence of further serious human 
rights violations. The Experts call for an immediate end to impunity and to refrain from 
any reprisals. To strengthen the rule of law and to help ensure the safety and protection of 
the human rights of all persons in Sri Lanka, they continue to extend their offer of 
assistance to the Government.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>287. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Sri Lanka for their replies 
of 5 September 2008. However, the Special Rapporteur notes the considerable delay in replying 
and is concerned at the absence of an official reply to his letters of 19 June 2008, 6 October 2008 
and 6 November 2008 and urges the Government of Sri Lanka to provide at the earliest possible 
date detailed substantive replies to the above allegations.

<p>been allowed to see a lawyer. Concern for the physical and mental integrity of the four men was 
expressed. Further concern was expressed that their arrest might be related to their alleged 
affiliation to the &#8220;Abdel Wahid&#8221; faction of the so-called &#8220;Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA)&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>289. On 27 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the 
Independent Expert on Minority Issues and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, 
regarding the case of more than 230 individuals of mainly Darfuri origin. According to the 
information received, in connection with an armed attack by fighters of the &#8220;Justice and Equality 
Movement&#8221;, an armed opposition group based in the Darfur provinces, on the outskirts of 
Khartoum on 10 May 2008, more than 200 people, including the above-mentioned civilians, 
have been arrested by the Sudanese Police and officers of the National Intelligence and Security 
Services (NISS) between 9 and 23 May. It appeared that the arrests in the vast majority target 
Darfuri individuals, specifically members of the Zaghawa ethnic tribe, dwelling mainly in the 
Umbadda district of Omdurman. While around 500 individuals, including Mr Amin Mahmoud 
Osman, member of the Fur ethnic tribe and brother of human rights defender and parliamentarian 
Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman, may, according to unconfirmed reports, be in the process of being 
released, more than 230 were still believed to be detained incommunicado at undisclosed places 
of detention without charge or access to lawyers and families. It was believed that some of them 
were detained at NISS detention facilities in Khartoum and at Kober Prison in the Sudanese 
capital. However, their exact whereabouts remain unknown. The above-mentioned members of 
the unregistered &#8220;Popular Congress Party&#8221; had also been arrested following the attacks. Their 
current whereabouts were unknown. The party&#8217;s leader, Mr Hassan Al Turabi, and 
Mr Al-Nagi Abdullah (also known as Al-Nagi Dahab), Mr Abubkr Abdalrazeg, Mr Albusairy, 
Mr Hassen Gubara, Mr Tageldien Banaga, Dr Bashir Adam Rahman, Mr Hassan Satti, and 
around ten other members were released. The majority of arrests were believed to have been 
carried out on the basis of the provisions of the National Security Forces Act (NSFA), which 
allows for detention without charge for up to nine months, during the first six the detainee was 
denied applications for review of the legality of detention. The NSFA reportedly did not provide 
legal safeguards to the detained individuals and effectively provides for immunity from 
prosecution for officials who resort to ill-treatment in detention. In view of the reported 
incommunicado detention at undisclosed places of the afore-mentioned individuals concerns for 
their physical and mental integrity were expressed. Further concern was expressed that the arrest 
and detention of the above-mentioned persons might be solely connected to their alleged ethnic 
origin from the Darfur region and carried out in a discriminatory manner.

<p>290. On 11 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the death sentences imposed against 30 men convicted on charges connected to the attack on 
Omdurman on 10 May 2008 led by the Justice and Equality Movement. According to the 
information the Special Rapporteurs received, Kamal Mohamed Sabun, Musa Hamid Osman

Mahmoud Adam, Adam Al Nour Abdelrahman Osman, Bashir Adam Mohamed Saleh, 
Abubaker Ibrahim Breima, Abdallah Adam Ibrahim Al Duma, Ibrahim Ali Rashid, Bashir Adam 
Sanusi Hashim and Mustafa Adam Sabun were arrested in the days following the Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008. Following their apprehension, 
they were held without access to the outside world for over one month and were not given access 
to lawyers until after the trial proceedings opened. As of 18 June 2008, these 30 men and other 
defendants were presented before newly created counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum. 
Five special courts were created in early June in response to the attack on Omdurman and these 
30 men and other defendants were brought before three of these special courts. Observers 
noticed that the defendants looked tired and appeared to be in pain. The defendants complained 
that they were subjected to torture or ill-treatment, but the court did not investigate these 
allegations and refused to grant requests by the defendants&#8217; lawyers for independent medical 
examinations. On 29 and 31 July 2008, the courts announced their verdicts. They sentenced the 
30 above named defendants to death, acquitted one, and ordered the transfer of four minors, to a 
detention facility where more than 90 children captured after the attacks were being held. One of 
those sentenced to death, Mahmood Adam Zariba, was reportedly a minor of 16 years of age, 
whose age was not determined by a medical examination. The 30 defendants were found guilty 
of a range of criminal charges defined in the 1991 Criminal Act, the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act 
and the 1986 Arms, Ammunitions and Explosives Act. The charges included terrorist acts, 
participation in a terrorist criminal organization (respectively sections 5 and 6 of the 
Counter-Terrorism Act), as well as criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state and 
sedition (respectively sections 24, 51 and 63 of the Criminal Act). In reaching their verdicts, the 
courts relied as evidence primarily on confessions by the defendants which the defendants said 
they were forced to make under torture and ill-treatment and which they retracted in court. The 
court made reference to the Sudanese Evidence Act which permits the admission to judicial 
proceedings of statements obtained by unlawful means. The court also relied on the testimonies 
by children who have been detained since the attacks and who stated in court that they 
recognized the defendants as having been among the attackers. The Special Rapporteurs 
understood that judgments in respect of 28 further defendants were expected to be announced 
shortly, and that charges may be brought against others currently held without charge or trial.  
</p>
<p>291. On 23 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, regarding information the Special Rapporteurs received regarding the death 
sentences imposed by counter-terrorism courts in greater Khartoum against 20 men on 17 and 
20 August 2008. The men were convicted on charges connected to the attack on Omdurman on 
10 May 2008 led by the Justice and Equality Movement. According to the information the 
Special Rapporteurs have received, on 17 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court in Khartoum 
found Abdelaziz Al Nour Aousher Fedail, Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam, 
Al-Taib Abdelkarim Idris Adam, Bashir Adam Aousher Fedail, Hamid Hassan Hamid Ahmed, 
Malik Adam Ahmed Mohamed, Mohamed Bahar Ali Hamadeen, and Tag Al Deen Mahmoud </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

<p> 
</p>
<p>Abdurahman Ali guilty on a range of offences under the 1991 Criminal Act, the 1986 Arms, 
Ammunitions and Explosives Act an and the 2001 Counter-Terrorism Act and sentenced them to 
death. On 20 August 2008, a counter-terrorism court sitting in Omdurman sentenced another 
twelve men to death on similar charges: Azrag Daldoum Adam, Yahia Fadel Abaker Adam, 
Musa Abdallah Ali Shugar, Mohamed Abaker Naser Hussein, Ibrahim Saleh Ali, Idriss Omar 
Mohamed Ahmed, Mahjoub Suleiman Adam, Naser Jibreel Adam, Abdallah Mursal Tour, 
Adam Ibrahim Nur Mohamed, James Bol Francis, and Adam Suleiman Abaker. The court also 
acquitted four defendants in this trial and referred four defendants to be tried by juvenile 
offender courts. The allegations the Special Rapporteurs received with regard to the detention 
and trial of the persons named above were very similar to those they brought to the 
Government&#8217;s attention on 11 August 2008 in relation to another 30 persons sentenced to death 
on 29 and 31 July 2008. They were arrested in the days following the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM) attack on Omdurman on 10 May 2008. Following their apprehension, they 
were held without access to the outside world by the National Intelligence and Security Service 
(NISS). It would appear that they were not given access to lawyers until after the trial 
proceedings opened. In reaching their verdicts, the Khartoum and Omdurman counter-terrorism 
courts appear to have relied primarily on confessions by the defendants as evidence. Most of the 
defendants said they were forced to make these confessions under torture and ill-treatment and 
retracted them in court. No investigations were opened to investigate these allegations. One of 
the defendants sentenced to death by the Khartoum counter-terrorism court on 17 August 2008 is 
a minor. Al Sadig Mohamed Jaber Al Dar Adam is 17 years old and the court accepted his birth 
certificate as valid documentation of his age. It found, however, that since Al Sadig Mohamed 
Jaber Al Dar Adam was found guilty of hiraba, or brigandage (Article 167 of the Criminal Act), 
a hudud offence, he could nevertheless be sentenced to death. Article 27(2) of the Sudanese 
Criminal Act allows the death penalty to be applied for hudud crimes regardless of age. 
</p>
<p>292. On 10 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding reports the Special Rapporteurs have 
received regarding the use of the death penalty in Southern Sudan. In this connection, the Special 
Rapporteurs recalled that, although the death penalty is not prohibited under international law, it 
has long been regarded as an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such 
be applied in the most restrictive manner. Based on the reports the Special Rapporteurs have 
received, they brought to the Government&#8217;s attention their concerns with regard to capital 
punishment in Southern Sudan in four regards: (1) the requirement that in capital punishment 
cases all fair trial guarantees are rigorously observed, including particularly the right to 
assistance by a lawyer, (2) the prohibition of the imposition of the death penalty against 
offenders aged under 18 at the time of the crime, (3) limitations on judicial discretion to apply 
prison sentences instead of the death penalty in murder cases, and (4) conditions of detention of 
prisoners sentenced to death.  
</p>
<p>293. Firstly, the Special Rapporteurs respectfully recalled to the Government that in capital 
punishment cases the obligation of States parties to observe rigorously all the guarantees for a 
fair trial set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), to which Sudan is a party, admits no exception. Relevant to the case at hand, these 
guarantees include the right of every person accused of a criminal offence &#8220;to defend himself in 
person or through legal assistance of his own choosing&#8221; (Article 14(3)(d) ICCPR). The Human </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 166 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee has observed that &#8220;[i]n cases involving capital punishment, it is axiomatic that 
the accused must be effectively assisted by a lawyer at all stages of the proceedings&#8221; (General 
Comment no. 32, CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 38). According to article 27(3) of the Interim National 
Constitution and article 13(3) of the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan (ICSS) these 
guarantees are &#8220;an integral part&#8221; of the constitutional Bill of Rights. Where a defendant does not 
have legal assistance, he must be informed of this right. Where the interests of justice so require, 
the Government must provide a defendant with legal counsel without payment by him if he does 
not have sufficient means to pay for it (Article 14(3)(d) ICCPR). These guarantees are further 
spelled out in the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. Principle 5 reads: 
&#8220;Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by the competent authority 
of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice upon arrest or detention or when 
charged with a criminal offence.&#8221; Principle 6 adds: &#8220;Any such persons who do not have a lawyer 
shall, in all cases in which the interests of justice so require, be entitled to have a lawyer of 
experience and competence commensurate with the nature of the offence assigned to them in 
order to provide effective legal assistance, without payment by them if they lack sufficient means 
to pay for such services.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs understood that the right to be assisted by 
legal counsel was reflected in Southern Sudanese law as well. The ICSS Bill of Rights 
(art. 23(6)), the 2003 New Sudan Code of Criminal Procedure and the 1991 Code of Criminal 
Procedure all provide, though in slightly different terms, that a person accused of an offence as 
serious as murder has the right to be assisted by an advocate. Where he does not have sufficient 
means to retain a lawyer, he has the right to have legal aid assigned to him by the government 
and at the government&#8217;s expenses. One important element that is clearly spelled out in the 
international standards cited above and might not be as clear in Southern Sudanese law is that, 
where a person accused of a crime carrying the death penalty is not assisted by a lawyer, the 
investigatory and judicial authorities are under an obligation to inform him of the availability of 
legal aid.<b> </b>In practice, however, the information the Special Rapporteurs have received suggests 
that most of the condemned prisoners do not have legal counsel, and even more did not have 
legal counsel during the trial in which they were sentenced to death. In Juba Central Prison, for 
instance, it would appear that the following prisoners sentenced to death are not assisted by legal 
counsel (and most probably were not assisted during their trial): Balla Kamal Tahir, 
Gabriel Nyara Pio, Moses Ohiti Lowa, Charles Lokudu Remeo, Mauro Ohisa Ogotow, 
Mario Oburau Okoloputa, Peter Jutti Budenga, Thiplious Tongun Wusang, Abdauraman Marino 
Lwarene, Sejeriwa Poni Tombe, Bol Makol Malual, Gabriel Sule Jada, Joseph Ladu Kamuka, 
Simplisio Ataka Adelio, Tadeo Lodu wani, Bulli Jelly Kewyi, Emanuel Gift Repent, 
Simon Mayuong Akoon, and Lojere Lorot Loseriko. It would also most regrettably appear that 
Joseph Jelly Morgo, who was reportedly executed in Juba Central Prison on 27 June 2008, did 
not have legal counsel. Wilson Elisa Basangi, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 
death by the Western Equatoria State High Court in Yambio on 30 November 2007, and was 
currently detained in Yambio Central Prison, was reportedly not assisted by legal counsel at his 
trial and was not informed on his constitutional right to obtain legal aid. He was, at the appeals 
stage, assisted <i>pro bono </i>by an advocate in private practice. In Upper Nile State, Nig Mashar, 
Khamis Joseph Lugi, Mohamed Adeng, Wier Quench Kwangang, Abiel Otuang, 
Mohamed Saleh Hassan and Tut Dol Rut were all, allegedly, not assisted by legal counsel at the 
time of the trial in which they were sentenced to death. Two of them were reported to now have 
retained advocates against a fee, while the other five have been able to secure assistance <i>pro 
bono </i>by an advocate in private practice for the appeals stage through the intervention of the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 167 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>UNMIS Human Rights Section. There were reportedly eight prisoners sentenced to death in 
Bentiu Central Prison in Unity State. Allegedly, none of them was represented by a lawyer at the 
time of trial. Two of them appeared to have secured the assistance of an advocate for the appeals 
proceedings. In Bor, Jonglei State, there was one condemned prisoner. He was not assisted by a 
lawyer at the time of his trial. In Wau, a prisoner named Jacob Makoi Majok was reportedly 
executed in Wau Central Prison on 24 July 2008. The nine remaining condemned prisoners 
include two women, Nyanthuoi Ater Matim and Akoi Bol Manding Lual and seven men: 
Guriguri Andrea Akot, James Nyon Koch (aged 72), Wol Akolino Akoi, Issaa Abdul Hamid, 
Alfred Share Guer, Lawrence Wol Mayen, and Marial Mol Kon. Issaa Abdul Hamid, who was 
sentenced to death in August 2007, was reportedly temporarily assisted by an advocate, but as he 
had no money to pay him, the advocate did not assist him throughout the trial. None of the other 
condemned prisoners was assisted by legal counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case. 
The Special Rapporteurs&#8217; information indicated that in Aweil Central Prison, three prisoners 
were sentenced to death: Malik Ayi, Dut Ahoey, and Makol Malong. Neither were they was 
assisted by legal counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case, nor were they informed or 
otherwise aware of their right to be assisted. In Rumbek Central Prison as well, there are three 
condemned prisoners: Chagao Mwopor Akech, Majur Manyur Mayom, and Chol Kor Dit Majok. 
None of them was assisted by legal counsel at any time of the proceedings in their case. The 
Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan provides in Article 138(3) that the Southern Sudan 
Ministry for Legal Affairs and Constitutional Development was mandated to &#8220;render legal aid&#8221;. 
According to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; information, although the majority of the accused charged 
with a capital offence and of the prisoners already sentenced to death neither had a lawyer nor 
the mean to retain one, not one of them had received legal aid from the Ministry for Legal 
Affairs and Constitutional Development. The Special Rapporteurs further note that in Judicial 
Circular No. 3 of 21 August 2007, the Supreme Court of Southern Sudan had acknowledged the 
problem of numerous persons being tried on murder charges without the assistance of an 
advocate. The Circular also observes that &#8220;[m]any accused persons who are not represented by 
advocates do not make appeals against the judicial decisions passed against them simply because 
they are ignorant of their right to appeal. This is their legal and constitutional right which they 
cannot lose because they are unaware of it.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs were very encouraged by 
this stance of the Supreme Court of Southern Sudan, which was in line with paragraph 5 of 
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, reading: &#8220;Everyone 
convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a 
higher tribunal according to law.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs highlighted two concerns they had in 
this respect. Both were based on the principle that the right to review of the sentence must not 
only be respected formally, but also be made effective. The first one, already amply discussed 
above, was that, in order for the right to seek review of a death sentence to be effective, the 
defendant must be assisted by legal counsel. As the Human Rights Committee stated in a case 
concerning a capital punishment case in Jamaica, &#8220;it is axiomatic that legal assistance must be 
made available to a convicted prisoner under sentence of death. This applies to the trial in the 
court of first instance as well as to appellate proceedings.&#8221; (Communication No. 250/1987, 
<i>Carlton Reid v. Jamaica</i>, para. 11.4). Secondly, it would appear that according to Articles 251 
and 255 of the 2003 New Sudan Code of Criminal Procedure, the defendant has only seven days 
from the date of the judgment to submit to the Court of Appeals (and thereafter, to the Supreme 
Court) a written statement setting forth reasons why the judgment should not be confirmed. This 
extremely short delay to submit the appeal could in many cases negate the effective exercise of 
the right to appeal against conviction. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs stressed that it was not </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 168 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>sufficient for a person sentenced to death to be represented by legal counsel at the appeals stage, 
as seems to be the case of the Malakal condemned prisoners. Where someone was sentenced to 
death after a first instance trial in which he was not assisted by legal counsel, a full retrial must 
be ordered (or the death sentence commuted). Otherwise, not only the right to a fair trial, but also 
the right to life will be violated. 
</p>
<p>294. Secondly, the Special Rapporteurs would also like to draw the Government attention to the 
fact that Article 37 (a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Sudan is a Party, 
expressly provides that capital punishment shall not be imposed for offences committed by 
persons below the age of 18. In addition, Article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights provides that the death penalty shall not be imposed for crimes committed by 
persons below eighteen years of age. The Special Rapporteurs understood that also the Interim 
Constitution of Southern Sudan provides in Article 25 (2) that &#8220;no death penalty shall be 
imposed on a person under the age of eighteen&#8221;.Notwithstanding these unambiguous provisions, 
it would appear that there were four prisoners awaiting execution detained in Juba Central Prison 
who had not reached the age of 18 at the time of the murder for which they have been sentenced. 
Their names are Joseph George Modi, Peter Stephen Wawi, Adil Osaman Gwagwe, and 
Peter Taban Angelo. The Special Rapporteurs have also received information that Wier Quench 
Kwangang, who was sentenced to death in Malakal where he remains detained awaiting his 
appeal, may have been under 18 at the time of the offence he was found guilty of. Malik Ayi, 
who was reportedly sentenced to death by the High Court in Aweil at the beginning of 2008 and 
was being held in Aweil Central Prison, was allegedly aged 16 at the time of the offence in June 
</p><p>2007. The Special Rapporteurs were moreover informed that at the time of their trial there were 
no juvenile courts in Southern Sudan.  
295. Thirdly, according to the information the Special Rapporteurs have received, many of the 
prisoners awaiting execution in Southern Sudan were found guilty of murder under Article 130 
of the 1991 Criminal Code. Under this provision, the death sentence is the only possible 
punishment for murder, unless the family of the victim forgoes retribution in kind and opts for 
the payment of compensation. This provision deprives the judge of the necessary discretion to 
tailor the sentence to the specific circumstances of the case and of the accused. Inevitably, some 
accused will be sentenced to death even though that sentence is disproportionate to the facts of 
their crimes. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to review all death sentences 
imposed under Article 130 also on this ground. They were aware that many other prisoners 
sentenced to death in Southern Sudan were found guilty and sentenced under Article 251 of the 
2003 New Sudan Criminal Law. This provision allows the judge to impose the death sentence or 
life imprisonment for murder. The Special Rapporteurs were, however, concerned about 
Article 244 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that &#8220;[i]f the accused is 
convicted of an offence punishable with death and the Court sentences him to any punishment 
other than death, the Court shall in its judgement state the reasons why sentence of death was not 
passed.&#8221; This provision seems to suggest that for murder the death penalty is the rule and life 
imprisonment the exception, and that a judge must provide special reasons why he does not 
impose the death penalty. Such a rule would be incompatible with the principle that, under 
international law, the death sentence is an extreme exception to the fundamental right to life, and 
must as such be applied in the most restrictive manner. 
</p>
<p>296. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs were very concerned about reports regarding the 
conditions of detention of prisoners sentenced to death. Reports they have received indicate that </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 169 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>because the Prisons Service considers that the walls, roofs and security at Juba Prison are 
insufficient to effectively prevent escapes, condemned prisoners are shackled at their feet day 
and night, every day of the week and year. In Malakal, Aweil and Wau as well, all death row 
prisoners are shackled above the ankle. It would appear that many of the prisoners have been 
detained in these conditions for years. To cite two extreme cases reported to them: 
Mohamed Adeng has been imprisoned in Malakal since 1999, as has Enoka Poli Jacob in Juba. 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteurs recalled that Article 10 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights provides that &#8220;[a]ll persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated 
with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.&#8221; The Special 
Rapporteurs also stressed that the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee 
have consistently found that conditions of detention can amount to inhuman and degrading 
treatment. They urged the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that these prisoners 
are prevented from escaping without recourse to inhumane measures. To conclude, only the full 
respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as still permissible 
under international law from a summary execution, which violates the most fundamental human 
right. The Special Rapporteurs therefore urged the Government to take all necessary steps to 
ensure that the rights of those sentenced to death in Southern Sudan and those facing charges for 
which the death penalty could be imposed were respected. Considering the irreversible nature of 
the death penalty, this can only mean that the death penalty was not carried out until all concerns 
they have raised are dispelled in their entirety. This would require, as a minimum, that: the death 
penalty is not carried out against anyone who has not been assisted by defence counsel during 
the first instance trial and all subsequent appeals proceedings; that every one charged with 
murder is informed of the &#8220;right to have legal assistance assigned to him or her, [...], and without 
payment by him or her in any such case if he or she does not have sufficient means to pay for it&#8221;, 
as provided in Article 14 (3) (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
Article 23 (6) of the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan; and that all death sentences 
imposed under Article 130 of the 1991 Criminal Code, and possibly also those imposed under 
Article 251 of the 2003 Criminal Code in conjunction with Article 244 of the 2003 Code of 
Criminal Procedure, are reviewed to establish whether, on the facts of the individual case, there 
are no circumstances militating in favour of a lesser sentence. Under international law, including 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sudan is a Party and which it 
has incorporated into the constitutional Bill of Rights, States deciding to retain capital 
punishment must provide a legal aid system meeting the highest standards. The Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; understanding was that the legal aid system in Southern Sudan was currently not in 
operation, inter alia as a consequence of the decades long armed conflict which has ravaged the 
country until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement entered into force. If that was correct, the 
Special Rapporteurs suggested that international law requires that all executions in Southern 
Sudan be suspended until there was a functioning system for legal aid in capital cases.

Rapporteur on the question of torture and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
situation of human rights defenders, regarding Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi, aged 48, and 
Ms. Kawthar Taifour, aged 50, both members of the Kurdish minority in the Syrian Arab

was arrested at 4 a.m. at her home in &#8216;Ein al-&#8217;Arab (Qoubani); the place and exact time of the 
arrest of Ms. Kawthar Taifour is not known. Both women are believed to be currently held in 
incommunicado detention at the women&#8217;s wing of al-Maslamieh Prison in Aleppo without 
charge or trial. Both do not have access to legal counsel or contact with their families. When the 
communication was sent, they were held together with convicted criminals and pretrial 
detainees. By the moment when the communication was sent, the authorities have not disclosed 
any reason for their arrest and detention. It is believed that these measures might be linked to 
non-violent demonstrations by members of the Kurdish minority on 2 November 2007 in the 
cities of Qamishli and &#8216;Ein al-&#8217;Arab (Qoubani). Ms. &#8216;Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Taifour are 
members of an organisation calling itself &#8220;Democratic Union Party (PYD)&#8221;. Ms. Aisha Afandi&#8217;s 
husband, Mr. Saleh Muslim, is a leading member of the &#8220;PYD&#8221;.

Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
and as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders pursuant, regarding the case of Mr. Mazen Darwish, head of the <i>Syrian Centre for 
Media Freedom and Freedom of Expression.</i> According to the information received, on 
12 January 2008, Mr. Darwish was detained for three days after publishing a report on riots that 
occurred in Damascus, criticizing the alleged failure of security agencies to protect civilians 
killed on that occasion. After his detention, Mr. Darwish was accused of &#8220;libelling and defaming 
the states&#8217; bodies&#8221;, following a complaint made by the police station in the Damascus suburb of 
Adra. He appeared before a military tribunal on 17 March, when it was decided that his trial 
before a military court would take place on 15 April. Concern was expressed that the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Darwish and the charges against him may be related to his non-violent activities 
in defence of human rights, in particular the exercise of his right to freedom of expression.

Vice-Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of Mohammed Badih al-Bab, a 
member of the National Organisation for Human Rights in Syria, a non-governmental 
organization which promotes human rights. According to the information received, on 
2 March 2008 Mohammed Badih al-Bab received a summons and was subsequently arrested by 
military security forces in Damascus. Mohammed Badih al-Bab was in detention, but his exact 
whereabouts were unknown. He was denied access to a lawyer and was not allowed any visitors. 
No charges had been brought against him. The reasons for his arrest remain unclear, but it 
appeared that he received the summons following articles he has recently written, in which he 
criticised the Minister for Information, Mr. Mohsen Bilal. In 2000, Mr. Mohammed Badih 
al-Bab was sentenced to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. He was released in 2005 following a 
presidential amnesty. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Mohammed Badih al-Bab might be solely connected to his peaceful activities in defending 
human rights and the exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the 
reported incommunicado detention of Mohammed Badih al-Bab at an unknown place of 
detention, further concerns were expressed that he might be at risk of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>301. On 16 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, regarding the situation of 
Mr. Ziad Ramadan, aged 32. According to information received, on 20 July 2005, 
Mr. Ziad Ramadan was summoned for questioning by military intelligence officers in Damascus, 
and arrested on the same day. He was allegedly detained at the Palestine Branch of Syrian 
Military Intelligence since this date. It was alleged that he was not informed of the reasons for 
the arrest, nor of any charges against him. On 21 May 2006, Mr. Ramadan was transferred to a 
prison in Homs. On 21 September 2007, he was returned to the Palestine Branch, where he 
remained in detention. Mr. Ramadan has reportedly been able to see a lawyer, however he was 
not allowed to appoint the lawyer of his choice. It was alleged that, until present, he has not been 
brought before a court to assess the legality of his detention. Reportedly, Mr. Ramadan has a 
heart condition, and it was alleged that he may not have adequate access to medical care. 
Furthermore, he had highly restricted access to family visits. It was alleged that Mr. Ramadan 
was detained as a result of having worked in the same software company as Mr. Ahmed Abu 
Adas, an individual who had reportedly made a televised confession of responsibility for the 
February 2005 assassination of former prime minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafiq al-Hariri. Concern 
was expressed regarding Mr. Ramadan&#8217;s physical and mental condition, and notably his reported 
heart condition and alleged lack of adequate access to medical care and attention. 
</p>
<p>302. On 21 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, regarding the travel 
ban imposed against Mr. Akhtam Naisse, a lawyer, a founding member of the <i>Committee for the 
Defense of Democratic Liberties and Human Rights in Syria (CDF)</i>, Director of the <i>Cham 
Centre for Democratic and Human Rights Studies</i> in Syria, and winner of the <i>Martin Ennals 
Award for Human Rights Defenders</i> in 2005. Communications were sent in relation to 
Mr. Akhtam Naisse by various mandate-holders on 15 November 2001, 16 February 2004, 
9 March 2004, 11 June 2004, and 6 August 2004. A response from the Government was received </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 172 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>on 20 September 2004. According to new information received, on 14 October 2008, 
Mr. Akhtam Naisse attempted to travel to the United Arab Emirates but was prevented from 
boarding the plane at Damascus Airport. He was detained for over two and a half hours by 
security forces at the airport. In the United Arab Emirates he was scheduled to participate in a 
regional human rights forum in conjunction with the fifth session of the Forum for the Future, an 
annual meeting which focuses on political reform and sustainable development and is organized 
by the Group of Eight (G8) nations as well as Middle East and North African nations. The 
authorities reportedly told Mr. Akhtam Naisse that the travel ban had been imposed against him 
because various security forces were looking for him. Earlier this year, travel bans were imposed 
against various human rights defenders in Syria. For instance, between 16 and 19 April 2008, 
Messrs. Rasim Al Atasy, Mahmoud Maree and Ahmed Manjonah were prevented from traveling 
and subsequently could not attend the general meeting of the Arab Organisation for Human 
Rights. Concern was expressed that the imposition of the travel ban against Mr. Akhtam Naisse 
may be directly related to his activities in the defense of human rights. Further concern was 
expressed that this may form part of an ongoing trend of harassment against human rights 
defenders in Syria. 
</p>
<p>303. On 18 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding 
the case of Mr. Hassam Hussein &#8216;Ali, aged 31, member of the unauthorized &#8220;Kurdish Azadi 
Party&#8221; and member of the board of directors of the Noubhar Cultural Society, which is related 
the &#8220;Kurdish Azadi Party&#8221;. According to the allegations received, on 3 December 2008, Military 
Intelligence agents arrested Mr. Hassam Hussein &#8216;Ali. Since then he has been in detention 
without charge or trial, possibly at the Palestine Branch of the Military Intelligence in Damascus. 
His whereabouts were not officially communicated to his family. He was not allowed to 
communicate with the outside world.  
</p>
<p><b>Communications received  
</b></p>
<p>304. On 3 April 2009, the Government replied to the letter of 25 February 2008 concerning, 
Ms. Aisha Afandi and Ms. Kawthar Tayfur. The Government informs that the two women were 
arrested for stirring up unrest in the town of Ayn al-Arab in the Aleppo governorate. They were 
detained in Aleppo Central Prison, in women&#8217;s ward 4, where women accused of the same class 
of offences are held. Contrary to the allegation transmitted, the women were not held in 
incommunicado detention and were neither of them subjected to ill-treatment; the law safeguards 
their rights and deals severely with persons who violate the rights of women, even if they are in 
prison and on trial for various offences. The two women appeared before an Aleppo court on 
20 August 2008 following an inquiry that was conducted in accordance with the due process 
norms laid down in the Constitution and Syrian law. The case and investigation files were 
deposited with the military prosecutor&#8217;s office, which is the legal authority with jurisdiction for 
the offences with which the women were charged, namely, stirring up sectarian strife and unrest. 
The two women were brought to the military prosecutor&#8217;s office on 21 August 2008 and were 
charged with the aforementioned offences. The case was filed with the chief judge of the lower 
military court in Aleppo before whom the two women appeared for examination on 
22 August 2008. At the end of the hearing, the judge decided to discharge the women and the 
decision was carried out that very day. The judge continues to review the rest of the case against 
the two women. If the proceedings had not been conducted fairly and transparently and the two </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 173 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>women had received no assistance, the judge would not have released them at the first hearing. 
Thus, there is no truth to any of the allegations transmitted to the Office of the High 
Commissioner, including those concerning arbitrary detention and denial of freedom of 
expression and the exercise of rights. The Syrian authorities, furthermore, verified the legality of 
the arrest procedures and found no evidence that the rights and freedoms of the two women had 
been infringed or that the women had been placed in arbitrary detention or subjected to mental or 
physical torture or any other serious violation. The two women are Syrian nationals, who were 
given a legal hearing consistent with the international standards and norms laid down in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. Neither the families nor the legal representatives of the two women filed any complaints 
with the Syrian authorities before or after the letter from the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights arrived. As for the health of the two women, we should point 
out that the laws on prisons in the Syrian Arab Republic stipulate that health and medical care 
must be provided for all persons in detention. All prisoners receive free medical attention as soon 
as they enter prison. When Ms. Afandi arrived at the prison, the doctor of the prisoners&#8217; welfare 
association diagnosed her as suffering from an inflamed right ear, and treated her regularly 
throughout her time in detention. This was treatment that she had not received beforehand. 
Ms. Tayfur was diagnosed as suffering from diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis pain and chest pains. 
She also had a condition known as &#8220;Aleppo boil&#8221; (leishmaniasis of the skin) and received free 
treatment for these conditions throughout the time that she spent in prison. Contrary to the 
information given to the Office of the High Commissioner, she did not complain of suffering 
from psychological trauma or epilepsy. The Govermnent also referred to the information at the 
beginning of the letter from the Office of the High Commissioner stating that Ms. Afandi and 
Ms. Tayfur are members of the Kurdish minority. There is no such designation in the 
Syrian Arab Republic; these two women are Syrian nationals and there is no reference in their 
identity cards or other papers, or those of any Syrian citizen, to membership of a minority or a 
majority. Everyone is equal before the law and no reference is ever made to a person&#8217;s race, 
religion or confessional group.  
</p>
<p>305. On 17 February 2009, the Government replied to the urgent appeal of 16 October 2008 
concerning the situation of Mr. Ziad Ramadan, a Syrian national. The Government informed that 
Mr. Ziad Muhammad Midhat Ramadan was born in Damascus in 1976. The letter further 
informed that the Government received a letter dated 23 May 2006 from the former 
Commissioner of the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission, 
Mr. Serge Brammertz, requesting assistance in corroborating information about Mr. Ramadan 
and arranging an interview with him. Mr. Ramadan was assigned a lawyer, Mr. Riad Tawuz, and 
was interviewed by the Commission. Considering that he had disappeared in September 2004, as 
confirmed in a fax dated 4 October 2004 that we received from the Belgrade office of the 
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), and that the interview with 
Mr. Ramadan suggested that his testimony was important for the investigations being conducted 
by the Commission into the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, 
Rafiq Al-Hariri, that Mr. Ramadan was wanted by many parties and that his life was at risk, he 
was lawfully placed in protective custody on 21 July 2005 in order to ensure that he could be 
presented to the Commission in a timely manner, should it request an interview with him. At that 
time, the Commission was continuing its investigation, with which the Government was bound 
to cooperate, and discussing the creation of an international tribunal to investigate the 
assassination of Mr. Al-Hariri, a case in which Mr. Ramadan is a material witness. Mr. Ramadan </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 174 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>is receiving constant medical care and he has recently been diagnosed with a congenital heart 
defect. He has undergone the necessary tests and a specialist has confirmed that his life is not in 
danger. Mr. Ramadan enjoys all his rights with regard to contact with his family and all his needs 
have been met. In addition to the reasons given above for the holding Mr. Ramadan in protective 
custody as an important witness in the international investigation into the assassination of 
Mr. Al-Hariri. The name of Mr. Ramadan emerged during investigations that we have been 
conducting showing that he has links with a terrorist organization that perpetrated acts of 
sabotage in the Syrian Arab Republic and Lebanon, killing a number of innocent civilians. 
Consequently, he must be brought before the Syrian courts once he has served as a witness in the 
current investigations being conducted by the Commission.  
</p>
<p>306. The Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letters of 16 and 21 October 2008 
on 17 February and 8 April 2009, respectively. However, at the time this report was finalized, 
the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to reflect the content of these replies from the 
Government as he had not received the translation of their contents from the relevant services. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>307. The Special Rapproteur wishes to thank the Government of the Syrian Arabic Republic for 
their replies of 17 February and 8 April 2009. However, he is concerned at the absence of an 
official reply to his communications of 3 and 23 April 2008 and urges the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic to provide at the earliest possible date detailed substantive replies to the 
above allegations. He is also looking forward to receiving a reply to his letter of 
18 February 2009 in the near future.

<p>310. Le 8 juillet 2008, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; au Gouvernement de la Tunisie, 
conjointement avec la Pr&#233;sidente-Rapporteur du Groupe de Travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire et 
le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, un appel urgent concernant la situation de M. Ziad Fakraoui. 
M. Ziad Fakraoui a &#233;t&#233; l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent envoy&#233; par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur

droits de l&#8217;homme, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression 
et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture le 13 novembre, le 27 juillet, le 4 mai 2007, le 
11 novembre, le 21 octobre, le 12 mai et le 25 janvier 2005. Selon les nouvelles informations 
re&#231;ues, le 2 ao&#251;t 2008, M Abderraouf Ayadi aurait &#233;t&#233; violemment agress&#233; par le directeur de la 
prison Mornagia, M. Ibrahim Mansour. M. Ayadi terminait une visite de son client, 
M. Mohamed H&#233;di Ben Said, quand le directeur de la prison a exig&#233; de passer &#224; la fouille sa 
serviette. M. Ayadi l&#8217;a refus&#233;. Le directeur de la prison se serait ensuite jet&#233; sur lui, aurait 
arrach&#233; de force sa serviette et  confisqu&#233; son t&#233;l&#233;phone portable, avec l&#8217;aide de trois de ses 
agents. M. Abderraouf Ayadi souffre d&#8217;une entorse au poignet droit, ainsi que d&#8217;h&#233;matomes sur 
le corps. Par la suite, M. Ayadi a port&#233; plainte et le barreau a publiquement d&#233;nonc&#233; cette 
agression. Des pr&#233;occupations furent exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les actes de harc&#232;lement 
r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;s contre M. Ayadi soient li&#233;s &#224; ses activit&#233;s non-violentes de promotion et protection des 
droits de l&#8217;homme, et s&#8217;inscrivent dans un contexte d&#8217;intimidation et de r&#233;pression syst&#233;matique 
&#224; l&#8217;encontre des avocats d&#233;fenseurs de droits de l&#8217;homme.

Amidi, instituteur; M. Fawzi Al Mas, technicien; M. Abdessalem Dhaouadi, enseignant; 
M. Kamel Ben Othmane, enseignant et M. Nizar Chebil, ouvrier. Mme Zakia Dhifaoui a fait 
l&#8217;objet d&#8217;un appel urgent envoy&#233; par l&#8217;ancien Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection 
du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture et l&#8217;ancienne

Mme Zakia Dhifaoui, MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, 
Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil auraient particip&#233; &#224; Redeyef &#224; une

condamn&#233;s pour les m&#234;mes charges &#224; six mois de prison ferme. Des accusations de harc&#232;lement

l&#8217;encontre du chef du district policier de Gafsa, mais celles-ci n&#8217;auraient pas &#233;t&#233; retenues. De 
m&#234;me, MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, 
Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebi auraient accus&#233; ce m&#234;me chef de leur avoir extorqu&#233;s des 
aveux sous la torture, ce qui n&#8217;aurait &#233;galement pas &#233;t&#233; pris en compte par le tribunal. Des

MM. Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben

Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur l&#8217;ind&#233;pendance des juges et des avocats, l&#8217;ancien Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur 
la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial

d&#233;tention arbitraire le 10 avril 2008. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 11 d&#233;cembre 2008, la 
Chambre criminelle du Tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa aurait retenu les charges de 
&#171;participation &#224; une entente criminelle en vue de commettre des attentats contre les personnes et 
les biens, r&#233;bellion arm&#233;e commise par plus de dix personnes et troubles &#224; l&#8217;ordre public&#187; contre 
les 33 personnes pr&#233;cit&#233;es et les aurait condamn&#233;es &#224; des peines allant de deux ans 
d&#8217;emprisonnement avec sursis &#224; dix ans et un mois de prison ferme. Cinq autres personnes 
auraient &#233;t&#233; relax&#233;es dans le cadre de ce proc&#232;s. Il fut all&#233;gu&#233; que ces 33 personnes n&#8217;auraient 
pas b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;un proc&#232;s juste et &#233;quitable dans la mesure o&#249; les droits de la d&#233;fense n&#8217;auraient 
pas &#233;t&#233; respect&#233;s. En effet, la d&#233;fense n&#8217;aurait pu pr&#233;senter sa plaidoirie et les pr&#233;venus 
n&#8217;auraient &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233;s. Par ailleurs, le verdict aurait ignor&#233; les &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;ordonnance de 
cl&#244;ture du juge d&#8217;instruction faisant mention des stigmates physiques (traces de coups, 
h&#233;matomes) qu&#8217;il aurait constat&#233;s sur 10 des 38 pr&#233;venus. Les 33 personnes condamn&#233;es dans le 
cadre de cette affaire auraient interjet&#233; appel et l&#8217;audience en appel se tiendrait devant la Cour 
d&#8217;appel de Gafsa le 13 janvier 2009. Des craintes furent exprim&#233;es quant au fait que la 
condamnation en premi&#232;re instance des 33 personnes pr&#233;cit&#233;es soit li&#233;e &#224; leurs activit&#233;s </p>

<p>non-violentes de promotion et protection des droits de l&#8217;homme. Des craintes furent &#233;galement 
exprim&#233;es que les dysfonctionnements pr&#233;cit&#233;s lors du proc&#232;s en premi&#232;re instance aient 
compromis le principe du droit &#224; un proc&#232;s &#233;quitable. Il fut &#224; craindre que des

<p><b>Communications re&#231;ues 
</b></p>
<p>314. Le 26 janvier 2009, le Gouvernement tunisien a r&#233;pondu &#224; la lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
du 27 ao&#251;t 2008, indiquant que selon les &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire diligent&#233;e par le 
procureur de la R&#233;publique de Gafsa, les pr&#233;venus Zakia Dhifaoui, Abdelaziz Ahmadi, 
Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil 
ont tent&#233;, sur fond de certains troubles enregistr&#233;s dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa, sud de la Tunisie, de 
transformer le mouvement de contestation pacifique en une v&#233;ritable r&#233;bellion comme l&#8217;indique 
les actes d&#8217;agression et de voies de fait contre les agents de l&#8217;ordre ainsi que l&#8217;installation de 
barricades sur les voies publiques. Il est &#233;tabli que les pr&#233;venus susvis&#233;s avaient pris, dans ce 
cadre, le 27 juillet 2008, la t&#234;te d&#8217;une manifestation au cours de laquelle ils ont proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; 
l&#8217;obstruction de la voie publique devant toute circulation en y dressant des barricades par 
l&#8217;utilisation de pneus, de vide-ordures et de grosses pierres. Les forces de l&#8217;ordre, intervenant 
pour rouvrir la voie publique &#224; la circulation et assurer la s&#233;curit&#233; des personnes et des biens, 
avaient essuy&#233; des jets de pierres et des coups de b&#226;tons. Une voiture de police a &#233;t&#233; gravement 
endommag&#233;e (vitres bris&#233;es et traces de coups de pierres sur la t&#244;le). La s&#233;curit&#233; publique s&#8217;&#233;tait 
trouv&#233;e, de ce fait, gravement menac&#233;e. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est all&#233;gu&#233;, les suspects, 
appr&#233;hend&#233;s en flagrant d&#233;lit, n&#8217;ont subi aucune forme de mauvais traitement lors de leur 
arrestation. Ils ont &#233;t&#233; conduits au si&#232;ge de la police judiciaire o&#249; ils ont &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233;s sur les 
faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Le procureur de la R&#233;publique a &#233;t&#233;, imm&#233;diatement, avis&#233; de 
l&#8217;enqu&#234;te ainsi que de la mise des pr&#233;venus en garde &#224; vue conform&#233;ment &#224; l&#8217;article 13 bis du 
code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. L&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par la police judiciaire s&#8217;&#233;tait, donc, 
efectu&#233;e en toute l&#233;galit&#233; et sous le contr&#244;le de la justice. Apr&#232;s cl&#244;ture de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire, 
les pr&#233;venus ont d&#233;f&#233;r&#233;s au parquet qui a d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;&#233;mettre des mandats de d&#233;p&#244;t &#224; leur encontre 
et de les renvoyer devant la chambre correctionnelle pour r&#233;pondre des chefs d&#8217;inculpation qui 
leur sont reproch&#233;s. Il est &#224; noter que les pr&#233;venus ont avou&#233; lors de leurs interrogatoires avoir 
proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;obstruction de la voie publique devant la circulation et jet&#233; des pierers sur une 
voiture des forces de l&#8217;ordre. Le proc&#232;s s&#8217;est tenu publiquement devant le tribunal de premi&#232;re 
instance de Gafsa. Il a &#233;t&#233; proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; l&#8217;interrogatoire d&#8217;usage des pr&#233;venus en pr&#233;sence de leurs 
avocats. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est all&#233;gu&#233;, le tribunal n&#8217;a nullement refus&#233; de consigner les 
all&#233;gations de mauvais traitement des pr&#233;venus dans les proc&#232;s-verbaux d&#8217;audience, ceux-ci font 
&#233;tat effectivement d&#8217;all&#233;gations se rapportant &#224; des avex extorqu&#233;s sous la contrainte, outre des 
soi-disant menaces de viol qui auraient &#233;t&#233; prof&#233;r&#233;es contre Zakia Dhifaoui. Le tribunal a ensuite 
recueilli les plaidoiries des avocats. Apr&#232;s d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;, le tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa a 
d&#233;clar&#233; les pr&#233;venus coupables des faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Zakia Dhifaoui a &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;e 
&#224; huit mois d&#8217;emprisonnement ; Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Mammar Amidi, Fawzi Al Mas, 
Abdessalem Dhaouadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil ont &#233;t&#233; condamn&#233;s quant &#224; eux &#224; 
six mois d&#8217;emprisonnement chacun. Sur exercice de leur droit d&#8217;appel, les pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; de 
nouveau jug&#233;s par la Court d&#8217;appel de Gafsa qui a d&#233;cid&#233; un non-lieu pour l&#8217;ensemble des 
pr&#233;venus des chefs d&#8217;inculpation de r&#233;bellion commise par plus de dix personnes non arm&#233;es, 
outrage &#224; fonctionnaire public &#224; l&#8217;occasion de l&#8217;exercice de ses fonctions et atteinte publique aux 
bonnes m&#339;urs. S&#8217;agissant des autres chefs d&#8217;inculpation, la Cour d&#8217;appel a d&#233;cid&#233; de ramener la 
peine de Zakia Dhifaoui de 8 mois &#224; 4 mois et demi d&#8217;enprisonnement. Quant aux autres </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>pr&#233;venus, ils ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de r&#233;duction de peines. Fawzi &#224; 3 mois d&#8217;emprisonnement; 
Abdelaziz Ahmadi, Kamel Ben Othmane et Nizar Chebil ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;un susis &#224; l&#8217;ex&#233;cution. 
Les pr&#233;venus ont attaqu&#233; par voie de cassation le jugement de condamnation rendu &#224; leur 
encontre. Le pourvoi a &#233;t&#233; rejet&#233; en la forme; les avocats des pr&#233;venus s&#8217;&#233;tant limit&#233;s &#224; pr&#233;senter 
leurs pouvoirs sans les accompagner des m&#233;moires indiquant les moyens du pourvoi et les griefs 
&#224; l&#8217;encontre de la d&#233;cision attaqu&#233;e comme l&#8217;exige l&#8217;article 263 bis du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. 
Le jugement de condamnation est ainsi pass&#233; en force de chose jug&#233;e. Le 5 novembre 2008, 
Zakia Dhifaoui a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d&#8217;une lib&#233;ration conditionnelle d&#233;cid&#233;e par le juge d&#8217;application des 
peines. Les autres pr&#233;venus ont, &#233;galement, &#233;t&#233; lib&#233;r&#233;s soit apr&#232;s avoir purg&#233; leurs peines soit en 
vertu du sursis &#224; l&#8217;ex&#233;cution accord&#233; &#224; certains d&#8217;entre eux. 
</p>
<p>315. Aucun des pr&#233;venus ou des membres de leurs familles ou de leurs avocats n&#8217;a d&#233;pos&#233; 
plainte pour mauvais traitement : aucune plainte pour menace de viol ou harc&#232;lement sexual n&#8217;a 
&#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e par Zakia Dhifaoui ou en son nom, aucune plainte pour mauvais traitements n&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; 
enregistr&#233;e au nom des autrse pr&#233;venus. Il y a lieu, toutefois, de souligner que les autorit&#233;s 
tunisiennes ne subordonnent pas l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te, pour mauvais traitement, au d&#233;p&#244;t 
d&#8217;une plainte par l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. En effet, le minist&#232;re public est habilit&#233; &#224; proc&#233;der d&#8217;office &#224; 
l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te chaque fois qu&#8217;il y aurait motifs raisonnables laissant croire que des 
actes de mauvais traitements aient &#233;t&#233; commis et ce, en application de l&#8217;article 9 de la 
Convention des Nations Unies contre la torture et d&#8217;autres peines ou traitements cruels, 
inhumains ou d&#233;gradants d&#251;ment ratifi&#233;e par la Tunisie en vertu de la loi du 11 juillet 1988. En 
l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes n&#8217;ont constat&#233; aucun &#171;motif raisonnable&#187; laissant croire qu&#8217;un 
mauvais traitement aurait &#233;t&#233; commis. Les proc&#232;s-verbaux de la garde &#224; vue font &#233;tat de 
l&#8217;information donn&#233;e aux pr&#233;venus de leur droit de demander d&#8217;&#234;tre soumis &#224; examen m&#233;dical, 
ceux-ci avaient d&#233;clar&#233; ne pas en avoir besoin. En outre, aucun des membres de leurs familles 
n&#8217;avait pr&#233;sent&#233; de demande dans ce sens. Cela dit, les pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; un examen 
m&#233;dical lors de leur premi&#232;re admission, sur mandat de d&#233;p&#244;t du Procureur de la R&#233;publique, au 
sein de l&#8217;unit&#233; p&#233;nitentiaire. Cet examen n&#8217;a fait que confirmer l&#8217;absence de toutes traces de 
violence, physique ou psychologique, en relation avec un soi-disant mauvais traitement qu&#8217;ils 
auraient subi. Comme sus-indiqu&#233;, le tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa a consign&#233; les 
all&#233;gations de mauvais traitement pr&#233;sent&#233;es par les pr&#233;venus dans les proc&#232;s verbaux 
d&#8217;audience. Apr&#232;s examen de ces all&#233;gations, le tribunal a estim&#233; qu&#8217;elles &#233;taient d&#233;nu&#233;es de tout 
fondement. De telles all&#233;gations &#233;taient manifestement dict&#233;es par la volont&#233; de certains 
pr&#233;venus de motiver leur r&#233;tractation quant &#224; leurs aveux consign&#233;s dans les proc&#232;s-verbaux 
&#233;tablis par les officiers de police judiciaire. Le syst&#232;me tunisien offre &#224; toute personne qui 
pr&#233;tend &#234;tre victime de mauvais traitements tout un arsenal juridique lui permettant de faire 
valoir ses droits. Il faut rappeler, &#224; cet &#233;gard, que la Tunisie a ratifi&#233; sans aucune r&#233;serve la 
Convention des Nations Unies contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains 
ou d&#233;gradants. Elle a ainsi reconnu la comp&#233;tence du Comit&#233; contre la torture pour recevoir et 
examiner les communications pr&#233;sent&#233;es par ou pour le compte des particuliers relevant de sa 
juridiction qui pr&#233;tendent &#234;tre victimes de violation des dispositions de la Convention. Les 
dispositions de ladite Convention ont &#233;t&#233; transpos&#233;es en droit interne. L&#8217;arrestation des pr&#233;venus 
est compatible avec les instruments internationaux de protection des droits de l&#8217;homme. Les 
donn&#233;es de l&#8217;affaire montrent que cette arrestation a &#233;t&#233; impos&#233;e par des atteintes de leur part &#224; la 
s&#233;curit&#233; des personnes et des biens et qu&#8217;elle ob&#233;it aux garanties internationales consacr&#233;es aux 
personnes, provisoirement, priv&#233;es de leur libert&#233;. En proc&#233;dant &#224; l&#8217;obstruction des voies 
publiques et en jetant des pierres sur les forces de l&#8217;ordre, les pr&#233;venus susvis&#233;s ont transgress&#233; le </p>

<p>droit de r&#233;union &#171;pacifique&#187; et se sont mis dans une situation d&#8217;infraction de la loi. Les 
poursuites d&#233;clanch&#233;es contre eux s&#8217;inscrivent dans le cadre et ne repr&#233;sentent, par cons&#233;qent, 
aucun rapport avec la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme. On ne peut nullement pr&#233;tendre qu&#8217;un 
pr&#233;venu, en jetant des pierres sur les forces de l&#8217;ordre et en proc&#233;dant &#224; l&#8217;obstruction des voies 
publiques et &#224; leur fermeture &#224; toute circulation d&#233;fend les droits de l&#8217;homme. Ces faits portent 
gravement atteinte &#224; l&#8217;ordre public et tombent sous le coup de la loi p&#233;nale. Il est donc imp&#233;ratif 
d&#8217;attirer l&#8217;attention sur la gravit&#233; de prendre la d&#233;fense des droits humains pour pr&#233;texte afin de 
s&#8217;adonner de mani&#232;re d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;e &#224; la violation des normes &#233;l&#233;mentaires visant &#224; garantir la libert&#233; 
de la circulation et l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique des personnes. Etant justifi&#233;e par la commission de faits 
d&#233;lictueux, l&#8217;arrestation des pr&#233;venus ne viole aucun des instruments  internationaux de 
protection des droits de l&#8217;homme. Cette arrestation a &#233;t&#233;, pouir le reste, entour&#233;e de toutes les 
garanties consacr&#233;es aux personnes, provisoirement priv&#233;es de leur libert&#233;. Finalement, la garde 
&#224; vue des pr&#233;venus lors de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par les officiers de police judiciaire est 
une mesure entoru&#233;e, en droit tunisien, par toutes les garanties consacr&#233;es par l&#8217;article 9 du Pacte 
international relatif aux droits civils et politiques. Toute irr&#233;gularit&#233; qui aurait entach&#233; 
l&#8217;arrestation des pr&#233;venus leur ouvre la possibilit&#233; de demander l&#8217;annulation de la proc&#233;dure sur 
la base de l&#8217;article 199 du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. En tout &#233;tat de cause, ledit article 199 &#233;tant 
texte d&#8217;ordre public, le tribunal saisi de l&#8217;affaire n&#8217;aura certainement pas manqu&#233; de contr&#244;ler 
automatiquement la r&#233;gularit&#233; de la proc&#233;dre et &#233;ventuellement de soulever d&#8217;office tout motif de 
nullit&#233; qui aurait pu &#234;tre d&#233;cel&#233;.

<p>316. Le 4 f&#233;vrier 2009, le Gouvernement de la  Tunisie a r&#233;pondu &#224; l&#8217;appel urgent 
du 10 avril 2008, indiquant qu&#8217;aucune personne portant l&#8217;identit&#233; de &#171;Foued Khenaissi&#187;, vis&#233;e 
dans la communication, ne fait l&#8217;objet de poursuites judiciaires. La consultation des actes de 
proc&#233;dure, dress&#233;s suite aux troubles enregistr&#233;s dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa, d&#233;montre que l&#8217;identit&#233; 
susvis&#233;e ne correspond  &#224; aucune des personnes impliqu&#233;es dans ladite proc&#233;dure. S&#8217;agissant des 
pr&#233;venus Adnane Haji, Taieb Ben Othmane et Boujhemaa Chra&#239;ti, il convient de pr&#233;ciser que 
selon les &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire diligent&#233;e par le Procureur de la R&#233;publique de 
Gafsa, une entente s&#8217;est constitu&#233;e entre lesdits pr&#233;venus et autres, sur fond de certains troubles 
enregistr&#233;s dans la r&#233;gion de Gafsa, sud de la Tunisie, afin d&#8217;appeler &#224; la d&#233;sob&#233;issance publique 
transformant ainsi le mouvement de contestation pacifique en une v&#233;ritable r&#233;bellion comme 
l&#8217;indique la diffusion de tracts d&#8217;incitation &#224; la commission d&#8217;acte d&#8217;agression et des voies de fait 
contre les agents de l&#8217;ordre, la fabrication et l&#8217;utilisation de cocktails Molotov, de barres de fer et 
de b&#226;tons ainsi que de l&#8217;installation de barricades sur les voies publiques aussi bien que routi&#232;res 
et ferroviaires. Les pr&#233;venus avaient effectivement mis leur plan &#224; ex&#233;cution se mettant &#224; la t&#234;te 
d&#8217;une manifestation de plusieurs dizaines de personnes au cours de laquelle les agentes de 
l&#8217;ordre public &#233;taient la cible de cocktails Molotov et de jets de pierre provoquant ainsi des 
l&#233;sions corporelles &#224; plusieurs d&#8217;entre eux. Les &#233;difices, aussi bien publics que priv&#233;s, les 
voitures et les vitrines de commerce n&#8217;ont pas &#233;t&#233; &#233;pargn&#233;s subissant &#233;galement des d&#233;g&#226;ts 
graves. Il s&#8217;en est suivi un &#233;tat de panique parmi les populations de la r&#233;gion de Gafsa dont la 
s&#233;curit&#233; &#233;tait bel et bien gravement menac&#233;e. Contrairement &#224; ce qui est all&#233;gu&#233;, les pr&#233;venus 
n&#8217;ont subi en aucune mani&#232;re de mauvais traitements aussi bien lors de leur arrestation que 
pendant leur interrogatoire, par la police judiciaire, sur les faits qui leur sont reproch&#233;s. Le 
Procureur de la R&#233;publique a &#233;t&#233;, imm&#233;diatement, avis&#233; de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire en cours et de 
la mesure de garde &#224; vue d&#233;cid&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;encontre des pr&#233;venus poru une premi&#232;re p&#233;riode de 3 jours 
et ce, conform&#233;ment aux articles 11 et 13 bis du code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale. Une prolongation de 
3 jours suppl&#233;mentairs a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;cid&#233;e par ordonnance &#233;crite et motiv&#233;e du Procureur de la </p>

<p>R&#233;publique, pour certains des pr&#233;venus, dict&#233;e par les besoins de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. L&#8217;enqu&#234;te 
pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par la police judiciaire s&#8217;est donc effectu&#233;e en toute l&#233;galit&#233; sous le contr&#244;le 
de la justice. La garde &#224; vue des pr&#233;venus lors de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire men&#233;e par les officiers 
de police judiciaire est une mesure entour&#233;e, en droit tunisien, par toutes les garanties consacr&#233;es

<p>317. D&#232;s cl&#244;ture de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire, le proc&#232;s verbal a &#233;t&#233; transmis au minist&#232;re public 
qui a d&#233;cid&#233; de la lib&#233;ration des pr&#233;venus gard&#233;s &#224; vue et ordonn&#233; un compl&#233;ment d&#8217;information. 
Une instruction pr&#233;paratoire, confi&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;un des juges d&#8217;instruction pr&#232;s le tribunal de premi&#232;re 
instance de Gafsa, a &#233;t&#233; par la suite ordonn&#233;e par le r&#233;quisitoire du Procureur de la R&#233;publique 
en date du 20 juin 2008 aux fins d&#8217;instruire sur les faits reproch&#233;s aux pr&#233;venus et proc&#233;der &#224; 
tous les actes n&#233;cessaires &#224; la manifestation de la v&#233;rit&#233;. L&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une information confi&#233;e &#224; 
un magistrat constitue une garantie suppl&#233;mentaire pour les pr&#233;venus, eu &#233;gard, d&#8217;une part, &#224; son 
caract&#232;re inquisitoire offrant au pr&#233;venu, outre la pr&#233;sence &#224; ses c&#244;t&#233; de son avocat, la possibilit&#233; 
de contester les preuves &#224; charge et par cons&#233;quent de se disculper, et par le fait, d&#8217;autre part, que 
toutes les ordonnances du juge d&#8217;instruction sont susceptibles d&#8217;appel devant la chambre 
d&#8217;accusation, agissant, selon les cas, en tant que second degr&#233; d&#8217;instruction ou chambre d&#8217;appel, 
ses ordonnances &#233;tant &#224; leur tour susceptibles de pourvoir en cassation. Le juge d&#8217;instruction en 
charge du dossier a d&#233;cid&#233;, apr&#232;s interogation des pr&#233;venus en pr&#233;sence de leurs avocats, en date 
du 23 juin 2008 de mettre en d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive Adnane Haji et Taieb Ben Othmane. Les 
d&#233;tenus Adnane Haji et _Taieb Ben Othmane jouissent, en prison, du droit de recevoir la visite 
de leurs avocats et des membres de leurs familles conform&#233;ment &#224; la r&#233;glementation en vigeur et 
sans restriction aucune. Dans le cadre de l&#8217;instruction pr&#233;paratoire, le juge d&#8217;instruction en 
charge du dossier a proc&#233;d&#233; notamment &#224;: l&#8217;audition du repr&#233;sentant de al municipalit&#233; de 
&#171;Redeyef&#187; qui a d&#233;clar&#233; que les manifestants ont gravement endommag&#233; les biens communaux 
notamment plusieurs poteaux d&#8217;&#233;clairage public, des horloges publiques, un grand nombre de 
plaques de signalisation routi&#232;re, presque tous les bancs publics, la barri&#232;re de protection d&#8217;un 
pont ainsi que les pav&#233;s sur de longues partie de la voie publique. Il a ajout&#233; que les premi&#232;res 
estimations des dommages s&#8217;&#233;l&#232;vent &#224; 160 000 dinars tunisiens; l&#8217;audition de 7 agents de l&#8217;ordre 
ayant pr&#233;sent&#233; chacun des expertises m&#233;dicales faisant &#233;tat de blessures et de traces de violence 
occasionn&#233;es par des jets de pierres et des coups de b&#226;ton ; le constat de dommages occasionn&#233;s 
&#224; 20 voitures des forces de l&#8217;ordre (vitres bris&#233;es et traces de coups de pierres sur la t&#244;le); 
l&#8217;interrogatoire des pr&#233;venus en pr&#233;sence de leurs avocats; la saisie d&#8217;un grand nombre de b&#226;tons 
de grande taille, de cocktails Molotov et de tracts d&#8217;incitations &#224; la violence. Plusieurs 
dommages &#224; des &#233;difices publics et priv&#233;s ont &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; observ&#233;s. Apr&#232;s accomplissement 
de tous les actes n&#233;cessaire &#224; la manifestation de la v&#233;rit&#233;, le juge d&#8217;instruction a proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; la 
cl&#244;ture de l&#8217;information et a ordonn&#233; le renvoi des pr&#233;venus devant la chambre d&#8217;accusation avec 
un expos&#233; d&#233;taill&#233; de la proc&#233;dure et une liste compl&#232;te des pi&#232;ces saisies. Le juge d&#8217;instruction a 
notifi&#233; l&#8217;ordonnance de renvoi devant la chambre d&#8217;accusation &#224; chacun des pr&#233;venus. La 
garantie du double degr&#233; de juridiction au stade de l&#8217;instruction &#233;tant consacr&#233;e en droit tunisien, 
les pr&#233;venus ont d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;interjeter appel, devant la chambre d&#8217;accusation, de l&#8217;ordonnance de 
renvoi rendue &#224; leur encontre par le juge d&#8217;instruction. Saisie du dossier, la chambre

<p>318. Le droit tunisien consacre une garantie suppl&#233;mentaire pour le pr&#233;venu en lui reconnaissant 
le droit de se pourvoir en cassation contre l&#8217;arr&#234;t de la chambre d&#8217;accusation rendu &#224; son 
encontre. Les pr&#233;venus ont exerc&#233; ce recours apr&#232;s que l&#8217;arr&#234;t de la chambre d&#8217;accusation leur a 
&#233;t&#233; notifi&#233;. L&#8217;affaire a &#233;t&#233; examin&#233;e par la Cour de Cassation qui n&#8217;a d&#233;cel&#233; dans la proc&#233;dure 
d&#8217;instruction aucune violation de la loi ou atteinte aux droits de la d&#233;fense et a, par cons&#233;quent, 
d&#233;cid&#233; le rejet du pourvoi. Le proc&#232;s des pr&#233;venus s&#8217;est tenu publiquement en premi&#232;re instance 
devant le tribunal de premi&#232;re instance de Gafsa. Lors de cette audience, le tribunal a recueilli la 
constitution des avocats des pr&#233;venus puis a donn&#233; suite &#224; la demande de lib&#233;ration de huit 
d&#8217;entre eux et au renvoi de l&#8217;affaire, sur demande des avocats, &#224; l&#8217;audience du 11 d&#233;cembre 2008 
pour leur permettre de pr&#233;parer leurs moyens de d&#233;fense et poursuivre l&#8217;examen de l&#8217;affaire. D&#232;s 
le d&#233;but de l&#8217;audience, certains avocats de la d&#233;fense ont affich&#233; leur hostilit&#233; au respect de la 
proc&#233;dure telle que pr&#233;vue par la loi s&#8217;opposant &#224; la poursuite normale de l&#8217;examen du dossier, 
appelant leurs clients &#224; refuser tout interrogatoire se limitant par la m&#234;me &#224; la pr&#233;sentation de 
demandes formelles relatives &#224; un nouveau report de l&#8217;affaire et &#224; la demande d&#8217;audition de 
t&#233;moins. Appel&#233;s par le tribunal &#224; pr&#233;senter leurs plaidoiries afin que leurs demandes formelles 
soient examin&#233;es en m&#234;me temps avec l&#8217;examen du dosier quant au fond, ces avocats s&#8217;y sotn 
refus&#233;s. Le tribunal a d&#251; alors renvoyer l&#8217;affaire en d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;. Apr&#232;s d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;, le tribunal a rendu 
tard son verdict d&#233;cidant de la relaxe de 5 des pr&#233;venus condamnant les autres pr&#233;venus &#224; des 
peines allant de deux ans d&#8217;emprisonnement avec sursis, &#224; 10 ans et un mois d&#8217;emprisonnement 
ferme du chef d&#8217;entente criminelle portant atteinte aux personnes et aux biens et r&#233;bellion arm&#233;e 
commise par plus de dix personnes au cours de laquelle des voies de faits ont &#233;t&#233; exerc&#233;es sur 
des fonctionnaires dans l&#8217;exercice de leur fonction, jet de pierres sur le propri&#233;t&#233;s d&#8217;autrui et 
bruit et tapage de nature &#224; troubler la tranquilit&#233; des habitants ; les autres chefs d&#8217;accusation 
ayant &#233;t&#233; par ailleurs consid&#233;r&#233;s comme faisant partie int&#233;grante desdits chefs d&#8217;inculpation dans 
le cadre du concours d&#8217;infractions. Le principe du double degr&#233; de juridiction en mati&#232;re 
criminelle &#233;tant garanti par le droit tunisien, les pr&#233;venus condamn&#233;s ont d&#233;cid&#233; d&#8217;exercer ce 
droit de recours en attaquant par la voie de l&#8217;appel les jugements rendus &#224; leur encontre. L&#8217;affaire 
est actuellement enr&#244;l&#233;e devant la Cour d&#8217;appel de Gafsa. Aucun des pr&#233;venus n&#8217;a jamais fait 
l&#8217;objet de torture ou de mauvais traitements. En effet, aucun des int&#233;ress&#233;s ou des membres de 
leures familles ou de leurs avocats n&#8217;a d&#233;pos&#233; une plainte pour mauvais traitements. D&#8217;ailleurs, 
Adnane Haji a d&#233;clar&#233; au juge d&#8217;instruction, en r&#233;ponse &#224; une question qui lui a &#233;t&#233; pos&#233;e par son 
avocat, n&#8217;avoir subi aucun mauvais traitement lors de son arrestation. Il y a lieu, toutefois, de 
souligner que les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes ne subordonnent pas l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te, pour 
mauvais traitements, au d&#233;p&#244;t d&#8217;une plainte par l&#8217;int&#233;ress&#233;. En effet, le minist&#232;re public est 
habilit&#233; &#224; proc&#233;der d&#8217;office &#224; l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une enqu&#234;te chaque fois qu&#8217;il y aurait motifs 
raisonnables laissant croire eque des actes de mauvais traitements ont &#233;t&#233; commis et ce, en 
application de l&#8217;article 9 de la Convention des Nations Unies contre la torture et autre peines ou 
traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants d&#251;ment ratifi&#233;e par la Tunisie en vertu de la loi du 
11 juillet 1988. En l&#8217;esp&#232;ce, les autorit&#233;s n&#8217;ont constat&#233; aucun &#171;motif raisonnable&#187; laissant croire </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>qu&#8217;un acte de mauvais traitement a &#233;t&#233; commis. Les proc&#232;s verbaux de la garde &#224; vue font &#233;tat de 
l&#8217;informatin donn&#233;e aux pr&#233;venus de leur droit de demander d&#8217;&#234;tre soumis &#224; examen m&#233;dical, 
ceux-ci avaient d&#233;clar&#233; ne pas en avoir besoin. En outre, aucun des membres de leurs familles 
n&#8217;avait pr&#233;sent&#233; de demande dans ce sens. Ce qui rev&#232;le le caract&#232;re infond&#233; des all&#233;gations de 
mauvais traitements formul&#233;s par les pr&#233;venus. Cela dit, les pr&#233;venus ont &#233;t&#233; soumis &#224; un 
examen m&#233;dical lors de leur premi&#232;re admission, sur mandat de d&#233;p&#244;t du Procureur de la 
R&#233;publique, au sein de l&#8217;unit&#233; p&#233;nitentiaire. Cet examen n&#8217;a fait que confirmer l&#8217;existence de 
toutes traces de violence, physique ou psychologique, en relation avec un soi-disant mauvais 
traitement qu&#8217;ils auraient subi. Par ailleurs, le syst&#232;me juridique tunisien offre &#224; toute personne 
qui pr&#233;tend &#234;tre victime de mauvais traitement tout un arsenal juridique lui permettant de faire 
valoir ses droits. Il a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;c&#233;demment d&#233;montr&#233; que les pr&#233;venus n&#8217;ont jamais &#233;t&#233; mis en cause 
pour des faits en rapport avec des activit&#233;s touchant de pr&#232;s ou de loin &#224; la d&#233;fense des droits de 
l&#8217;homme mais pour des faits &#233;rig&#233;s en infraction par la loi ayant trait au port d&#8217;armes, fabrication 
de cocktails Molotov, agression des agents de l&#8217;ordre et d&#233;t&#233;rioration des biens publics et priv&#233;s. 
Aucun des chefs de poursuite susvis&#233;s ne se rapprote &#224; des activit&#233;s en rapport avec une 
quelconque participation &#224; des contestations pacifiques ou d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme. On ne 
peut aucunement dire qu&#8217;un pr&#233;venu d&#233;tenant des armes, fabriquant des cocktails Molotov et 
agressant physiquement les agents de l&#8217;ordre d&#233;fend les droits de l&#8217;homme et exerce sa libert&#233; de 
manifester. La d&#233;fense des drois de l&#8217;homme ne se fait pas par jet de pierres et cocktails Molotov 
et voies de fait associ&#233;s &#224; l&#8217;usage de b&#226;tons et barres de fer outre les barricades et l&#8217;obstruction 
faite &#224; la libert&#233; de circulation des personnes sur les voies ouvertes &#224; la circulation publique.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>322. On 27 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of Abdullah Ocalan (subject of a 
previously transmitted communication, E/CN.4/2000/9, para. 1058-1059), detained in Imrali 
Island High Security Closed Prison, since 15 February 1999. According to the allegations 
received, the total isolation of Mr. &#214;calan-the sole inmate at Imrali Island-for almost ten years 
has resulted in severe deterioration of his mental health. Results of psychiatric examination have 
showed that this deterioration is linked with situations of chronic stress and prolonged social and 
emotional isolation, along with feelings of abandonment and disappointment. Mr. &#214;calan 
inhabits a 12 square meter cell with a table, chair, bed, wash basin, toilet and a shower cabin. He 
was confined to his cell for 23 hours per day under round-the-clock video surveillance. Except 
for consultations, he had no access to the adjoining room. The exercise yard, which he could 
used for one hour per day is 45 square meters, covered by wire netting, and was surrounded by 
a 4 m high wall. He had no access to basic fitness or sports equipment. There was no availability 
of other types of activities, nor access to a television. Contact with prison staff was minimal and 
perfunctory. Visits by his lawyers were restricted to Wednesdays only and are recorded. 
Although he was allowed two visits per month (one separating panel visit and one table visit, 
each of one hour&#8217;s duration on a Wednesday), it was reported that table visits were effectively 
denied because of the restricted class of visitors permitted. He did not have monitored access to a 
telephone. According to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, &#8220;there had been 
no favourable response from the Turkish authorities to the various recommendations made by the 
CPT as early as 1999, and subsequently expanded on, to alleviate the harmful effects of his 
detention&#8221; (Report to the Turkish Government on the visit to Turkey carried out by the European 
Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(CPT) from 19 to 22 May 2007, CPT/Inf (2008) 13)&#8221;. According to Special Rapporteurs, the 
weight of accumulated evidence to date points to the serious and adverse health effects of the use 
of solitary confinement. The key adverse factor was that socially and psychologically meaningful 
contact was reduced to the absolute minimum, to the point that it was insufficient for most 
detainees to remain mentally well-functioning. Regardless of the specific circumstances of its 
use, effort was required to raise the level of social contacts for prisoners: prisoner - prison staff 
contact, allowing access to social activities with other prisoners, allowing more visits, and 
providing access to mental health services.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>323. On 27 October 2008, the Government replies to the allegation letter of 27 August 2008, 
stating that the recent allegations constitute another attempt by the supporters of the terrorist 
organization PKK/KONGRA-GEL to bring this matter to the international agenda by exploiting 
the UN human rights mechanisms. The Government also included an information note to his 
reply, stating that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) is the competent 
and independent body of the Council of Europe which monitors the implementation of the 
provisions of the &#8220;European Convention for the Prevention of Torture or Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment of Punishment&#8221;. The CPT has been closely monitoring the imprisonment and health </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 185 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>conditions of convict &#214;calan. CPT reports on the detention conditions are all published with the 
consent of the Turkish Government. The European Court of Human Rights, in its judgment on 
12 May 2005, has already declared the imprisonment conditions of &#214;calan to be in conformity 
with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights and international law. The 
Grand Chamber of the Court has occurred with the fact that &#214;calan&#8217;s &#8220;detention poses 
exceptional difficulties for the Turkish authorities&#8221; and that &#8220;it is understandable that the Turkish 
authorities should have found it necessary to take extraordinary security measures to detain 
&#214;calan&#8221;. The Court further decided that &#8220;&#214;calan cannot be regarded as being kept in sensory 
isolation or cellular confinement&#8221;. &#214;calan enjoys the basic rights accorded to all inmates in high 
security closed prisons in Turkey. These include access to means of redress, health and 
psycho-social services, outdoor privileges, as well as books, newspapers, periodicals and radio. 
Receiving visits, consulting with legal representatives, establishing communication with the 
outside world through letter and telegram is also available. As to consultations with his 
representatives, between 11 March 1999 and 11 June 2008, &#214;calan received 326 visits from a 
total of 1055 visitors. Out of 326 visits, 324 were by his legal representatives including foreign 
lawyers, amounting to 1041 visitors. The remaining 14 visitors were 8 officials, visiting him 
twice and 6 interpreters who were accompanying foreign lawyers. Moreover, the convict met his 
sisters and brothers 135 times at 108 visits between 2 April 1999 and 30 April 2008. 
International law, guidelines and practices regarding the execution of penal sentences show that 
it is suitable and common to detain dangerous criminals in high security institutions. In countries 
such as Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, 
Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and Austria to name a few, dangerous criminals are also detained 
alone in maximal security cells where extraordinary security measures are applied. According to 
Recommentation R(82)17 and its explanatory memorandum concerning dangerous criminals 
adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, activities of such prisoners can 
be restricted for the security of the prison and they can be detained in single rooms separated 
from the prison community. Article 67, 68, and 69 of the United Nations Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provide that some convicts by reason of their criminal 
records or bad character may be separated from other convicts and this can be done within the 
same institution or in separate institutions. In light of the foregoing, the allegation that &#214;calan is 
kept in isolation remains baseless.

Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of 
Usaam &#8220;Auf&#8221; Mukwaya, Onziema Patience, Valentine Kalende, and Julian &#8220;Pepe&#8221; Onziema, all 
members of Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a local organization advocating on behalf of

<p>(TIT), an organization that supports the needs of transgender, transsexual, and intersex 
Ugandans. According to the allegations received, on 4 June 2008, police arrested 
Usaam Mukwaya, Onziema Patience, and Valentine Kalende in Kampala, after a protest at the 
2008 &#8220;HIV/AIDS Implementers Meeting.&#8221; The activists were protesting against statements made 
by Kihumuro Apuuli, director general of the Uganda AIDS Commission, who on 2 June declared 
that &#8220;gays are one of the drivers of HIV in Uganda, but because of meagre resources we cannot 
direct our programmes at them at this time.&#8221; Police took the three activists to the Jinja Road 
Police Station and detained them until 6 June. Authorities finally released the activists on bail 
after charging them with criminal trespass, under Section 302 of the Uganda Penal Code, despite 
the fact that sponsors of the Implementers Meeting had invited the activists to attend the 
conference. The defendants last appeared before a Kampala court on 25 July, where several 
witnesses of the State (mainly police officers) and the defendants were cross-examined. The 
judge adjourned the hearing until 1 August. At previous hearings held on July 9 and 10, the 
judge adjourned the case following the public prosecutor&#8217;s request to give police additional time 
to locate new witnesses. After the court hearing, a patrol car stopped the taxi Mukwaya was 
riding in and four men identifying themselves as police officers, three of them with uniforms and 
the fourth with plain clothes, detained him and put him in the police&#8217;s pickup truck. The police 
officers drove towards Jinja Road where a civilian car with tinted screens was waiting for them 
parked in front of Shoprite. Police officers forced Mukwaya into the other car with three other 
policemen; two wore suits and one wore a police uniform. The men drove around for about 30 
minutes and took Mukwaya to an undisclosed location. Two female and one male police officer 
were waiting. The police confiscated Mukwaya&#8217;s mobile phone, which contained contact names 
and numbers of members of SMUG and other LGBT rights organizations. The police asked 
Mukwaya if he was Nikki, when he said he was not they asked him his name. The three police 
officers then pushed him through a dark corridor into a room where they made him sit on a chair. 
Mukwaya, 26, saw four other men around his age in the room. One had a broken leg and the 
other three appeared to have been beaten. One of the women officers scraped his knuckles with a 
razor-like object. His abductors asked him questions in Luganda, a local language, about the 
activists&#8217; funders and supporters, and about his own role &#8220;among the homosexuals.&#8221; They also 
demanded information about Pepe and Nikki. They demanded the address of the SMUG office, 
as well as the residence and office of Mukwaya&#8217;s lawyer. Before dawn, they forced him to strip 
to his underwear, asked him if he was a man or a woman, and made him walk around the room 
in his underwear. In the room, there was a machine that suspended above a cushioned bench, and 
a prisoner&#8217;s arms are restrained by extensions alongside the device. As it is lowered by a switch, 
the extensions stretch the prisoner&#8217;s arms. Mukwaya was ordered by a policeman to lie on the 
bench face-up, and threatened that he should provide information on the organization&#8217;s source of 
funds. Mukawaya said nothing and his arms were stretched, leaving him with intense pain. After 
about 15 minutes, the machine was turned off and he was asked how much he was paid to be a 
homosexual. When he did not answer, they left him sleeping on the bench. The following day, 
26 July, the police dropped Mukwaya off at Mulago round-about in central Kampala. On 
28 July, activists accompanied Mukwaya to file an official complaint before the Uganda Human 
Rights Commission (UHRC). He also visited a doctor who documented the ill-treatment. On 
29 July he went to the African Centre for Torture Victims (ACTV) to receive psychological 
support. As of today, police have not detained the people responsible for Mukwaya&#8217;s torture. 
Concern was expressed that Usaam Mukwaya, Onziema Patience, Valentine Kalende, and 
Julian Onziema, and Nikki Mawanda may be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. 
Concern was also expressed in regard to the physical and psychological integrity of </p>

Usaam &#8220;Auf&#8221; Mukwaya, Onziema Patience, Valentine Kalende, Julian Onziema and 
Nikki Mawanda might be solely connected to the reportedly non-violent exercise of their right to

<p>327. On 20 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint allegation letter, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, regarding the case 
of Ms. Fatima Zahra Moussa, a Moroccan national, alleged victim of rape in Dubai in July 2007. 
According to the information received, Ms. Moussa started working in the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) in 2005, and in Dubai on 17 April 2007. A few days after moving to Dubai from 
Abu Dhabi, Ms Moussa got acquainted with two Moroccan men who were facing economic 
hardship and to whom she ended up providing shelter at her apartment. In July 2007, one of the 
two men, Mr Youssef Ahmada, raped her. Afterwards, the rapist called Ms. Moussa and 
threatened to kill her if she reported the rape to the police. Later on, two of his friends, 
Mr Salim Al Wazzani and Mr Rashid Haboush also threatened to harm Ms Moussa and her 
family in Morocco if she ever reported the rape incident to Dubai Police. Ms Moussa had her 
contract in Dubai terminated shortly after. As she received another job offer in Lebanon, she left 
Dubai on 26 August 2007 to begin her new work, without reporting the rape to the police out of 
fear. In November 2007, Ms Moussa returned to Dubai and filed a complaint for rape and threats 
at the Qusais police station. The three suspects were arrested on the same day and later referred 
to the Dubai Public Prosecutor. The Prosecutor interrogated the three men but eventually 
released them without interrogating the victim or the witnesses. In his non-suit decision on case 
19203/2007, the chief of the 1st Deira Prosecutor&#8217;s Office alleged that the complainant&#8217;s having 
allowed the perpetrator to live in her apartment and prior loss of virginity made the allegation of 
rape unlikely. In April 2008, Ms Moussa&#8217;s attorney filed a complaint with the Dubai Public 
Prosecutor to ask him to interrogate witnesses and to reconsider the decision not to prosecute the 
suspects. He also questioned the legal basis for considering the fact that Ms Moussa was no 
longer a virgin at the time of the rape as a ground for not prosecuting the man she identified as 
her rapist. Concern was expressed in relation to the way the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office has handled 
Ms Moussa&#8217;s case.

<p>or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of Mr. Khellil Abdurahmane 
Abdelkarim Al Junahi, born 1971 in Bahrain, citizen of the United Arab Emirates. According to 
the information received, Mr. Al Junahi was arrested by authorities of the United Arab Emirates 
some time on or after 24 November 2008. Two weeks after his arrest, upon insistence of his 
relatives residing in Bahrain, the authorities of the United Arab Emirates acknowledged that 
Mr. Al Junahi was held in detention &#8220;for questioning&#8221;. They maintained that his detention 
formed part of a &#8220;routine procedure&#8221; and that his release could be expected within the following 
two weeks. However, Mr. Al Junahi has been held at an undisclosed place of detention without 
access to lawyers or his family since his arrest. Mr. Al Juhani had allegedly been arrested by 
intelligence service officials of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the airport of Riyadh on 
26 April 2007 and detained without charge or trial until 24 November 2008. Mr. Al Juhani had 
regularly performed religious studies in Al Qassim in Saudi Arabia for several years. While he 
was in custody in Saudi Arabia, his family could visit him after three months in detention. The 
Saudi authorities maintained that keeping Mr. Al Juhani in custody was only a &#8220;preventive 
measure&#8221; and that his release could be expected soon. He was &#8220;released&#8221; on 24 November 2008. 
However, it appeared that he might have been transferred to the United Arab Emirates under 
circumstances not explained to his family. In view of Mr. Al Juhani&#8217;s reported detention at an 
undisclosed place of detention concerns were expressed with respect to his physical and mental 
integrity.

<p>331. On 1 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
countering terrorism. The Special Rapporteurse wished to inform the Government of the 
United States of America that they have received allegations relating to trials taking place in 
Afghanistan of detainees previously held in custody in the U.S. administered Bagram Theatre 
Internment Facility (BTIF), as well as detainees repatriated from Guant&#225;namo Bay Naval Base 
facilities to Afghanistan. The Special Rapporteurs informed the Government that they have 
addressed a similar letter to the Government of Afghanistan. According to the information 
received, some of the individuals formerly detained by the United States Government at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay and Bagram have been, and continue to be, transferred to the Afghan National 
Detention Facility (ANDF) where they await prosecution. This system of detention and transfer 
of detainees would seem to allow for prolonged detention in BTIF custody, and the prosecution </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 189 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>and conviction of detainees without due consideration to legal requirements. Based on the 
information received, in our opinion, the system of detention and transfer of detainees failed to 
comply with fair trial international standards including the right to court review over any form of 
detention, the presumption of innocence, the right to defence and access to legal counsel and the 
right to be tried without undue delay as laid down in Articles 9 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which provides, inter alia, that &#8220;anyone who is 
arrested shall be informed, at the time of the arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and should be 
promptly informed of any charges against him&#8221; and that &#8220;everyone shall be entitled to a fair and 
public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law&#8221;. 
According to the information received, many detainees, prior transfer to the ANDF were under 
United States custody without charge for several years. In addition, to date, trials of ANDF 
detainees lacked many basic due proccess of law guarantees, including access to a lawyer while 
under investigation and adequate time and facilities for the preparation of the defence. With 
respect to trials and the evidence before the prosecution, the information the Special Rapporteurs 
received suggests that the United States Government provides the Afghan prosecution that 
investigates national security cases, with supposedly general and declassified versions of the 
Detainee Assessment Branch Reports of Investigation (ROIs), which typically state the date of 
capture, the capturing force and the detainee&#8217;s alleged actions. These ROIs then form the basis of 
the Afghan Government&#8217;s prosecution charges. However, this was done without any examination 
of individual witnesses or statements in the court dossier - sworn or unsworn, often United States 
personnel or officials involved in the capture and/or interrogation of the detainee. To date an 
estimated number of 303 detainees have been transferred from United States custody to the 
Government of Afghanistan. The National Directorate for Security has investigated some 
201 cases. The situation of the other 102 detainees was not clear regarding the grounds for their 
detention, and concerning some of them having been detained for several months. Furthermore, 
it has been brought to our attention that the default status for these detainees transferred to the 
ANDF was that of pre-trial detention until a judicial decision regarding their cases are taken. The 
Special Rapporteurs were concerned over the potential negative effects of the prolonged pre 
charge detention in Guantanamo Bay and BITF that may compromise the ability of the 
Government of Afghanistan to ensure a fair trial for these persons. Moreover, the trials were 
conducted based on the in-court reading of investigative summaries prepared by United States 
and Afghan officials which do not respect the principle of equality of the parties before the court. 
The use of evidence in this way, and the fact that the convictions can be based on it, may violate 
international standards, including the prohibited use of evidence obtained under torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Afghan Constitution explicitly 
prohibits the introduction, as evidence, of statements obtained &#8220;by means of compulsion&#8221; and 
&#8220;recognizes a confession as voluntary only if taken before a judge.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs 
urged the Government to assure full compliance with the Afghan criminal procedure code and 
international fair trial standards included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 
and the ICCPR, including by requiring in-court witness testimony, and by allowing the defendant 
to challenge the evidence through cross-examination. They called on the Government to ensure 
that trials were conducted in accordance with international fair trial standards, as laid down in 
the UDHR and ICCPR.

<p>Mr. Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez Sehwerert.<b> </b>These five persons were arrested in September 1998 in Florida on 
charges of spying for the Government of Cuba. They were the subject of an allegation letter sent 
by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 31 August 2005. No 
answer to this communication had been received from the Government. The aforementioned 
individuals were tried between November 2000 and June 2001 in Miami Dade County. Lawyers 
for the defendants requested that the trial be conducted in another city, located in Broward 
County, because they considered that impartiality could not be guaranteed in Miami. The 
lawyers&#8217; request was however rejected. The trial court condemned the five persons as follows: 
Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 10 years. He was charged 
found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney 
general, conspiracy to do so, and conspiracy to gather and transmit national-defense information. 
Gerardo Hern&#225;ndez Nordele was sentenced to two life sentences plus 15 years on charges of 
conspiracy to gather and transmit national-defense information, acting as an agent of foreign 
government without notifying the attorney general, conspiracy to do so, fraud and misuse of 
documents, possession and intent to use five or more fraudulent identification documents, and 
conspiracy to murder. Ram&#243;n Labanino Salazar was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 
18 years on conspiracy charges. He was found guilty of acting as an agent of a foreign 
government without notifying the attorney general, conspiracy to do so, conspiracy to gather and 
transmit national-defense information, fraud and misuse of documents, possession and intent to 
use five or more fraudulent identification documents, and making a false statement in a passport 
application. Fernando Gonz&#225;lez Llort was sentenced to 19 years&#8217; imprisonment on charges of 
acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general, conspiracy to 
do so, fraud and misuse of documents, and possession and intent to use five or more fraudulent 
identification documents. Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez Sehwerert was sentenced to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment on 
charges of acting as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the attorney general and 
of conspiracy to do so. The appeal took place in March 2004, and a decision to order a retrial 
was announced on 9 August 2005 by the US Court of Appeals of the 11th Circuit. A three judge 
panel ruled that the original trial concerning these five defendants had been unfair due to the 
biased environment in which the trial was held and due to the large number of Cuban exiles who 
held prejudicial views regarding the Government of Cuba. On 27 May 2005, the UN Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention issued Legal Opinion No. 19/2005, in which is found that the 
detention of the five defendants was arbitrary and noted a number of due process violations. 
According to new information received, the Government requested the twelve judges of the US 
Court of Appeals of the 11th Circuit to review the ruling of 9 August 2005, through an <i>en banc</i> 
procedure. On 9 August 2006, the Court affirmed the denial of the defendants&#8217; motions for a 
change of venue and a new trial; and remanded the appeal to the three panel judge for 
consideration of the remaining issues. The Court considered that nothing in the trial suggested 
that twelve fair and impartial jurors could not been assembled by the trial judge to try the 
defendants fairly in Miami. On 4 June 2008, the three panel judge decided to affirm the 
convictions of each defendant and the sentences of Gerardo Hern&#225;ndez Nordele 
(Manuel Viramontes) and Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez Sehwerert. Concerning the sentences of 
Fernando Gonz&#225;lez Llort (Rub&#233;n Campa), Ram&#243;n Labanino Salazar (Luis Medina) and 
Antonio Guerrero Rodr&#237;guez, the panel considered that the trial judge erred in the application of 
several norms and requested to resentence the three defendants, in the light of its ruling. </p>

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>333. On 6 May 2009, the Government of United States of America replied to the allegation 
letter sent on 27 November 2008 related to Mr. Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, 
Mr. Fernando Gonz&#225;lez Llort (Rub&#233;n Campa), Mr. Gerardo Hern&#225;ndez Nordelo 
(Manuel Viramontes), Mr. Ram&#243;n Labanino Salazar (Luis Medina) and Mr. Ren&#233; Gonz&#225;lez 
Sehwerert. The Government affirms that during the trial the 5 men did not deny their covert 
service to the Cuban Directorate of Intelligence. On the contrary, they presented a defense which 
focused on their professed motives to protect Cuba. The five men were convicted following a 
seven-month jury trial at which they were afforded full due process, including unimpeded access 
to all evidence used against them, and to voluminous additional material provided by the 
United States in discovery.  
</p>
<p>334. The Government states further that facts, as described in the communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur, do not fully or accurately reflect the facts and procedural protections 
afforded the defendants in this case, which did accord with the United States&#8217; obligations under 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Government informs that all the 
judges that have presided over this case are fully independent federal judges who are appointed 
to the judiciary for life and subject to strict ethical rules with regard to any potential conflicts of 
interest. From initial arrests in 1998 through the trial and the eight years that the appeals have 
been under consideration, no defendant has raised in any of the judicial proceedings any claims 
or allegation of judicial partiality, improper influence, or lack of independence. Nor has any 
defendant raised any claim or complaint about the quality, competence or independence of their 
defense lawyers. Though many of the defense lawyers acted as free legal counsels, they served 
their clients independent of the government and with the benefit of confidentiality of 
communications and attorney-client privilege afforded all counsel.  
</p>
<p>335. Moreover, the Government states that the defendants received all guarantees of due 
process and a fair trial, and benefited from vast procedural protections and from provision of 
U.S. taxpayer-funded legal assistance, including counsel, investigators, surveys, experts and 
foreign travel. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, based in Atlanta, has 
considered their case on multiple occasions and has sustained all of their convictions, while 
remanding three defendants for resentencing. The defendants are now seeking further review in 
the United States Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p>336. The Government details the events in chronological order: The defendants were arrested 
on 12 September 1998. Upon arrest, each of the five was informed that he had the right to remain 
silent; that anything he said could be used against him in court; that he had the right to talk to a 
lawyer for advice before questioning; that he had the right to have a lawyer with him during 
questioning; that if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed for him before any 
questioning if he wished; that if he decided to answer questions without a lawyer present, he had 
the right to stop answering at any time. No defendant was denied access to counsel. The 
defendants were promptly brought before a judicial magistrate, and on 14 September 1998, the 
first day court was in session following their arrests, each defendant had his initial appearance in 
court. The magistrate judge again informed the defendants of their rights. The defendants stated 
they could not afford lawyers.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 192 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>337. The court arranged for free legal counsel to be appointed for each defendant. These 
lawyers were provided with numerous means to conduct a defense, including expert witnesses, 
community surveying investigators, and multiple trips to Cuba at which videotaped testimony 
was taken of defense witnesses unwilling to travel to the United States. These videos were used 
by the defense during the trial. The defendants did not complain about their lawyers, many of 
whom continued to represent the defendants during the appeals.  
</p>
<p>338. The jury selection process was subjected to exhaustive judicial review, including by the 
entire Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which found the process fair; indeed, this Court en 
banc opinion described it as &#8220;model&#8221; for a high profile case (<i>United States v. Campa</i>, 459 F.3d 
1121, 1147 (11th Cir. 2006). The jury was selected after a week-long examination process, with 
careful questioning by the court based in part of defense&#8217;s stated concerns, and posing follow-up 
questions suggested by the defense. The defense was allowed to challenge prospective jurors as 
legally unsuitable; no prospective juror the defense challenged was selected to sit on trial jury. 
The defense also was allotted peremptory challenges they could use to eliminate prospective 
jurors who, though legally eligible, they did not like. They were able to eliminate 
Cuban-Americans from the jury, and at the end of jury selection they tendered the panel of jurors 
picked for the trial without objection, and without having exhausted all the peremptory 
challenges allotted them. Defense counsel praised the ongoing jury selection process as 
extraordinary, later during the trial. Defense counsel stated that they had worked very hard to 
pick the jury, and that they had gotten a jury they were very happy with (Id. At 1137). 
339. The trial was open to the public, transparent and widely covered in the press. The trial 
lasted seven months, almost three months were devoted to the defense&#8217;s presentation of 
evidence. The trial was preceded by a lengthy period, sought by the defense for trial preparation 
and study of voluminous discovery material provided by the United States. Much of the 
discovery was classified, and the United States&#8217; Classified Information Procedures Act, Title 18, 
United States Code, Appendix three, was utilized to ensure due process in the use and production 
of classified material. Defense counsels were granted security clearances to review classified 
discovery. The defendants were also allowed to review the discovery, including the classified 
discovery. The defense counsels were able to review, copy, make notes and consult with their 
clients as to the classified discovery, within a secured space within the United States Courthouse. 
All evidence used at the trial was provided to the defense, including evidence sought by the 
defense to be used at the trial was declassified before being entered in evidence at the trial, 
ensuring transparency and access to all trial exhibits, many of which were examined and reported 
on by the press.  
</p>
<p>340. The United States sought and was granted ex parte, in camera hearing pursuant to the 
Classified Information Procedures Act Section four, which addresses discovery of classified 
information, and which provides for the court to authorize the U.S. to delete and substitute 
specified items of classified information from discovery production. On appeal, the defendants 
contended that only an ex parte written submission, not a hearing is permitted, the eleventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this contention (<i>United States v. Campa</i>, 459 F.3d., 994-996). 
341. Acting pursuant to longstanding criminal procedures established under law and applicable 
to all such criminal defendants, the jury convicted the five men of conspiracy to act as agents of 
a foreign government without notification to the attorney general and conspiracy to defraud the 
United States. Three of them were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage, related to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 193 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>efforts to acquire non-public U.S. National Defense information. Of those three, one also was 
convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in connection with lethal shoot down of two U.S. 
registered civilian aircraft in international space. This defendant, as well as the other two 
defendants convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage, was sentenced to life prison. The other 
two, were sentenced to 15 to 19 years of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>342. The Government also informs that all five men are held in U.S. civilian prison facilities, 
where they have the same rights and restrictions as other inmates, including access to their 
attorney and Cuban consular officials.  
</p>
<p>343. The defendants have made full use of their appellate rights under the United States judicial 
system. Shortly after sentencing, defense counsel filed notices of appeal, and vigorously pursued 
the right to test the propriety of the trial procedures and of the judgements against them. During 
the extensive appeals, they raised numerous claims. The Court of Appeals carefully considered 
all these claims, in three detailed judicial proceedings, and granted some, ordering resentencing 
of three defendants due to incorrect application of federal sentencing guidelines. All other claims 
were rejected by the Court of Appeals. They have filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the 
United States Supreme Court, which is currently pending. In sum, the defendants have benefited 
from the ample due process afforded under the U.S. criminal justice system, and they continue to 
seek additional review through the courts. 
</p>
<p><b>Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>344. On 22 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement, jointly 
with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while 
countering terrorism, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Four independent UN experts welcome the announcement by President-elect 
Barack Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and to strengthen the fight 
against torture. Following his election in November, Mr. Obama declared that both these 
undertakings are part of his efforts &#8220;to regain America&#8217;s moral stature in the world.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The experts state that &#8220;The regime applied at Guantanamo Bay neither allowed the guilty 
to be condemned nor secured that the innocent be released.&#8221; It also opened the door for 
serious human rights violations. In addition to being illegal, detention there was ineffective 
in criminal procedure terms. Similar severe abuses also occur at places of secret detention. 
Thus, with the same emphasis, the experts urge that all secret detention places be closed 
and that persons detained therein be given due process. 
</p>
<p>The experts further emphasize that &#8220;moving forward with closing Guantanamo is a strong 
symbol that will help to repair the image of the country after damage by what was widely 
perceived as attempts at legitimizing the practice of torture under certain circumstances. At 
the same time they urge that in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center and secret 
facilities, the U.S. government fully respect its international human rights obligations, 
notably the principle of non-refoulement that prohibits removing persons to countries 
where they would be at risk of torture, and not to transfer individuals to third countries for </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 194 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>continued detention at its behest (proxy detention). The experts also stressed that those 
detainees facing criminal charges must be provided fair trials before courts that afford all 
essential judicial guarantees. They emphatically reject any proposals that Guantanamo 
detainees could through new legislation be subjected to administrative detention, as this 
would only prolong their arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p>In this context, the experts call on third countries to facilitate the closure through their full 
cooperation in resettling those Guantanamo detainees that cannot be sent back to their 
countries of origin. The UN experts particularly welcome the recent announcement of 
Portugal to accept detainees and support its call to other States to follow.  
</p>
<p>The experts strongly support the commitment expressed by President-elect Obama which, 
in addition to restoring the moral stature of the United States in the world, will allow a dark 
chapter in the country&#8217;s history to be closed and to advance in the protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p><b>Background information 
</b></p>
<p>345. Following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, many countries adopted measures to 
combat terrorism. Several UN bodies, including the former Commission on Human Rights and 
the General Assembly, reiterated in multiple resolutions that this must be done in accordance 
with human rights.  
</p>
<p>346. In 2006, five UN Independent Experts issued a report on the Situation of detainees of 
Guant&#225;namo Bay. In this report, the experts concluded that the detentions were arbitrary due to 
the absence of independent tribunals and the denial of the right to adequate defense and other 
guarantees of due process, that interrogation practices were contrary to internationally accepted 
standards, above all the prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment and the prohibition 
of religious discrimination, that the indeterminate character of the length of detention amounted 
to inhuman treatment and that conditions of detention violated the right to health. The experts 
called upon the United States Government to cease these practices immediately, to provide fair 
trials to the detainees or release them, and to proceed to the urgent closure of the detention 
center.  
</p>
<p>347. In 2007, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism conducted a 
country mission to the United States, followed by a visit to Guantanamo Bay in order to observe 
military commission proceedings there. His report addresses a number of issues where the 2006 
Military Commissions Act and the treatment of Guantanamo detainees are incompatible with 
international law. It also reiterates that the detention facility be closed in compliance with 
international law and outlines proposals in this regard.  
</p>
<p>348. The United States Supreme Court has in a series of cases pronounced itself on the rights of 
detainees at Guantanamo Bay, thereby affirming the independence of the judiciary. In its most 
recent decision, the Court found the Military Commissions Act unconstitutional and granted the 
detainees access to the federal courts&#8217; jurisdiction, including the right to habeas corpus.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 195 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>349. Following his election in November, President-elect Obama publicly expressed his 
commitment to lead the Administration&#8217;s efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp as 
one of his priorities.  
</p>
<p>350. On 23 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur issued the following press statement, jointly 
with the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy, 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, Manfred Nowak, welcome the signing of executive orders by President 
Barack Obama yesterday, which set a timeline for closure of the Guantanamo Bay 
detention center and require the Central Intelligence Agency to shut its secret detention 
facilities. They also provide that all agencies should follow the same interrogation rules as 
the military and revoke orders and regulations adopted after 11 September 2001, which 
might contradict international and national minimum standards.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very important step that symbolizes a break with previous policies that were in 
violation of international human rights norms,&#8221; stressed Mr. Despouy. 
</p>
<p>Referring to a joint report issued by several UN independent experts in 2006, the two 
experts recalled that, in implementing these decisions, the United States Government 
should fully respect all human rights obligations, including the absolute prohibition of 
torture and the principle of non-refoulement that prohibits removing persons to countries 
where they would be at risk of torture. The experts further welcomed that proceedings 
before the Military Commissions have been halted, and expressed their hope that the 
persons accused would be prosecuted in accordance with fair trial norms. They also 
recalled that all persons found to have been detained arbitrarily or ill-treated have the right 
to reparation under international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Already in the 2006 report, we recommended that all persons found to have perpetrated, 
ordered, tolerated or condoned torture and ill-treatment, up to the highest level of military 
and political command, should be brought to justice - now the time has come to do so,&#8221; 
said Mr. Nowak.  
</p>
<p>Both experts emphasized that they stand ready to lend their full support in resolving the 
outstanding legal and practical issues, in particular in relation with the closure of the 
detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>351. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for its detailed reply which he 
associates with the change of policy of the new US administration. The Special Rapporteur notes 
that the response by the Government also answers allegations to his letter addressed to the US 
Government on 31 of August 2005, which had been pending for almost four years. The 
Government reply clarifies several issues of the judicial proceedings. The Special Rapporteur is 
particularly grateful for the detailed information provided in relation to access to defense lawyers 
and to legal aid provided to the five individuals. The Special Rapporteur also appreciates the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 196 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>information provided on the process of the selection of the jurors and the efforts made to make 
evidence available. However, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the record of the 
ex parte in camera hearing between the prosecution and the trial court was not unsealed. While 
the Special Rapporteur is aware that the Classified Information Procedures Act allows the 
Government, with the authorization of the court, to delete or substitute specified items of 
classified information from discovery production, he believes that this could have affected the 
right to defense of the defendants. In this connection, he would like to refer again to article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 3(b) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights and General Comment 32 of the Human Rights Committee 
(CCPR/C/CAN/CO/5 (2005), para. 13). Finally, the Special Rapporteur would like to clarify that 
according to the mandate granted to him by the Human Rights Council (Resolution 8/6) he 
inquires into any substantial allegation transmitted to him and reports his conclusions and 
recommendations thereon; even if the domestic remedies have not yet been exhausted in the 
case. 
</p>
<p>352. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the 
communications dated 1 July 2008. He urges the Government of the United States of America to 
provide at the earliest possible date detailed substantive replies to the above allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>353. On 31 March 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the cases of 
Mr. Yusuf Juma, a prominent writer and pro-democracy activist, his two sons, Mr. Bobur and 
Mr. Mashrab Juma, and Mr. Ruhiddin Kamilov, their lawyer. Mr Yusuf Juma was the subject of 
a communication sent on 19 February 2008 by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
According to allegations received, Yusuf, Bobur and Mashrab Juma were detained in Otbozor 
Prison in the Bukhara region. They have been subject to verbal abuse and beatings on a daily 
basis by prison authorities since their arrest in mid-December 2007. Yusuf Juma was examined 
at Bukhara&#8217;s Medical Law Centre after he had fainted from the torture he was subjected to. He 
was found to be suffering from heart and respiratory problems and had injuries from the 
beatings. Yusuf and Bobur Juma were being denied access to food and prevented from writing 
letters and meeting with their lawyer, Mr. Kamilov. Mashrab Juma was detained on allegedly 
fabricated charges in the run-up to the re-election of President Karimov, and was sentenced to 
three years&#8217; imprisonment. Yusuf and Bobur Juma have been charged under two articles of the 
Criminal Code with &#8220;insulting&#8221; and &#8220;resisting representatives of power&#8221;. Yusuf Juma has been 
openly critical of President Islam Karimov in his writings. Mr. Kamilov was threatened by the 
prison governor, whose name was known to the mandate-holders, that he would soon be killed 
because he and Yusuf Juma were serving the interests of US imperialism. Concern was </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>expressed for the physical and mental integrity of Yusuf, Bobur and Mashrab Juma, and in 
relation to acts of intimidation against their lawyer, Mr. Kamilov. Further concern was expressed 
that the arrest and detention of the three men may be directly related to the activities of 
Yusuf Juma for the promotion of democracy and freedom of expression in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>354. On 23 September 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding the case of 
Mr. Akzam Turgunov and Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov. Mr. Akzam Turgunov is the executive 
director of <i>Mazlum</i>, a non-governmental organization dedicated to the defense of human rights 
and has worked as a public defender in cases involving human rights violations. 
Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov is a founding member and leading journalist with <i>Uznews.net</i>, a 
member of the <i>Real Union of Journalists of Uzbekistan</i>, and a member of the <i>Committee to 
Protect Individuals&#8217; Rights</i> in Karakalpakstan. He has also worked for <i>Radio Liberty </i>and the 
<i>Institute for War and Peace Reporting</i>, and has spoken out against human rights violations in 
Uzbekistan. Mr. Abdurahmanov was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General on human rights defenders on 22 January 2007, and an 
urgent appeal regarding his recent arrest sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression on 24 June 2008. Responses from the Government were 
received on 6 February 2007 and on 19 July 2008. According to new information received, on 
11 July 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov was arrested in Manget, Karakalpakstan, on charges of 
extortion. While being held at a police detention centre in Nukus, he was taken to an 
investigator&#8217;s office on 14 July 2008, where boiling water was poured on his back. On 
4 September 2008, Mr. Akzam Turgunov&#8217;s trial began at the Amudarya District Court in Nukus. 
It was resumed on 16 September 2008. Mr. Akzam Turgunov may face up to 15 years 
imprisonment on charges of extortion under Article 165, Part 3 of the Criminal Code of 
Uzbekistan. The next hearing was to be scheduled once a medical report on the alleged 
ill-treatment of Mr. Akzam Turgunov would be available. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov was 
arrested on 7 June 2008, after drugs had reportedly been planted in his car. His trial before the 
Tahtakupir District Court commenced on 12 September 2008. The hearing was not open to the 
public. The police officers and the sniffer-dog specialist who had reported finding illegal drugs 
in Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov&#8217;s car were not present at the trial. Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov has 
now been charged with &#8220;selling drugs in large consignment&#8221; under Article 25-273 (5) of the 
Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The new charges against Mr. Salijon Abdurahmanov could result 
in a sentence of up to 20 years imprisonment. According to the Government&#8217;s response to 
Special Procedures mandate holders, received on 19 July 2008: &#8220;on 9 June 2008, 
Mr Abdurakhmonov was indicted [&#8230;] under article 276, paragraph 2 (a) (Unlawful production, 
storage, purchase, carriage or transmission of narcotic or psychotropic substances in large 
quantities, <i>without the purpose of sale</i>) [italics added] of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan&#8221;. In 
view of the above allegations of ill-treatment of Mr. Akzam Turgunov, concern was expressed 
for his physical and psychological integrity. Further concern was expressed that the above 
described arrests, detention and trials may be related to their activities in the defense of human 
rights. It was feared that the above incidents may form part of an ongoing pattern to restrict the 
work of members of Mazlum and other human rights defenders in Karakalpakstan. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>355. On 29 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter, regarding the 
Presidential Decree of 1 May 2008 on &#8220;Measures for the further reform of the legal profession 
(&#8216;advocatura&#8217;) in the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8221; (henceforth Presidential Decree) and the 
Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan no. 112 of 27 May 2008 on 
the &#8220;Organisation of the activities of the Chamber of Lawyers of the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8221; 
(henceforth Governmental Resolution) and other related legal provisions. The Presidential 
Decree provides for the creation of a Chamber of Lawyers with compulsory membership of all 
lawyers on the basis of the pre-existing Association of Lawyers. The Governmental Resolution is 
meant to be the implementing mechanism for the Presidential Decree. First, the Special 
Rapporteur commended the State on the Government&#8217;s intention to introduce reforms to, inter 
alia, improving the mechanisms of self-government of the legal profession which aim at 
strengthening the independence of lawyers, thereby reinforcing the right of every citizen to 
professional legal assistance at any stage of judicial proceedings, as enshrined in articles 26 
and 116 of the Constitution, articles 46 and 50 of the Criminal Procedure Code and reiterated in 
the preamble of the Presidential Decree. In this context, the Special Rapporteur drew the 
Government attention to two substantive areas that give rise to concern and one issue of 
particular interest in relation to the above-mentioned provisions: 1) appointment procedures of 
the chairperson and the deputy chairpersons of the Chamber of Lawyers and the chairpersons of 
the regional Chambers, 2) the current licensing regime under the Ministry of Justice, and 3) the 
equality of arms in criminal proceedings. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view certain aspects of 
these provisions require profound reconsideration in order to secure their compliance with 
international standards on the independence of lawyers.  
</p>
<p>356. Firstly, according to section 1 paragraph 2 of the Governmental Resolution, the 
chairperson and his/her deputies are elected by the Conference of the Chamber of Lawyers 
among the members of the Chamber&#8217;s Executive Board, following nomination by the Ministry of 
Justice. Pursuant to paragraph 3 of the same section, chairpersons of the regional branches of the 
Chamber of Lawyers are appointed and dismissed by the chairperson of the Chamber of 
Lawyers. Two of the main safeguards of an independent legal profession are self-governance and 
self-regulation. According to principle 24 of the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, 
adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, Havana, Cuba, from 27 August to 7 September 1990, &#8220;Lawyers shall be entitled to 
form and join self-governing professional associations to represent their interests, promote their 
continuing education and training and protect their professional integrity. The executive body of 
the professional associations shall be elected by its members and shall exercise its functions 
without external interference.&#8221; While principle 25 of these Basic Principles stipulates that 
&#8220;Professional associations of lawyers shall cooperate with Governments to ensure that everyone 
has effective and equal access to legal services and that lawyers are able, without improper 
interference, to counsel and assist their clients in accordance with the law and recognized 
professional standards and ethics&#8221;, it should be noted that the central role in the establishment 
and the work of the legal profession should remain with the lawyers. Therefore, the Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that the competency of the Ministry of Justice to nominate the 
chairperson, who in turn designates the chairpersons of the regional chamber branches, and the 
deputy chairpersons of the Chamber of Lawyer was not in compliance with the above mentioned 
principles. This was even more disquieting, as the Presidential Decree and the Governmental 
Resolution do not detail the procedures applicable on the designation of the members of the 
Chamber&#8217;s Executive Board, among whom the Chamber&#8217;s chairperson is elected. The </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned concern was even aggravated in light of section 2 of the Governmental 
Resolution. Pursuant to this provision, the constituent conference of the of the Chamber of 
Advocates should have been conducted by the Ministry of Justice together with the Lawyer&#8217;s 
Association of Uzbekistan within two months. During this constituent conference, the Statute of 
the Chambers should be adopted, the Chamber&#8217;s Executive Board established and the 
chairperson and the deputy chairpersons of the Chamber elected. Sections 1 and 2 of the 
Governmental Resolution together with section 6, which stipulates that the implementation of the 
Governmental Resolution be monitored by the First Deputy Prime Minister, indicate an 
overarching role of the executive branch in the establishment and functioning of the legal 
profession which violate the above-mentioned provisions of the Basic Principles of Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>357. Secondly, according to article 3 of the 1996 Law &#8220;On the legal profession (&#8216;advocatura&#8217;)&#8221;, 
lawyers are required to pass a qualification exam so as to obtain a license from the Ministry of 
Justice. According to this provision, the license will be issued by the Ministry of Justice on the 
basis of a decision made by the respective Qualification Commission. Qualification 
Commissions are established by order of the Ministry of Justice and are composed of an equal 
number of lawyers and of civil servants of the executive organs of justice (article 13 of the Law 
&#8220;On the legal profession&#8221;). While the Presidential Decree states that the improvement of the 
licensing regime is one of the main objectives for the further reform, no provisions have been 
included in the Governmental Resolution in this regard. According to the information received, 
no amendments have thus far been made to the relevant legislation, including the Law &#8220;On the 
legal profession&#8221;. A key to ensuring the independence of lawyers is to allow them to work freely 
without being obliged to obtain clearance or permission from the executive branch to carry out 
their work. This also entails the procedures governing access to the legal profession. The Human 
Rights Committee, in its concluding observations on Belarus (see CCPR/C/79/Add.86, para. 14) 
raised its concern that a presidential decree, which gives competence to the Ministry of Justice 
for licensing lawyers and obliges them to be able to practise, to be members of a centralized 
State controlled body, is undermining the independence of lawyers. Likewise, the Committee 
against Torture, in its concluding observations on Belarus (see A/56/44(SUPP), Belarus, 
para. 45 g), expressed concern at the subordination of lawyers to the control of the Ministry of 
Justice and an obligatory membership in a State-controlled Collegium of Advocates. In this vein, 
it was the Special Rapporteur view that in order to ensure the independence and self-governance 
of the legal profession, access to the profession must be governed by independent bodies 
established by the legal profession itself. In this connection, it is important to grant the new 
Chamber of Lawyers the right to establish independent bodies regulating access to the legal 
profession, i.e. to the Chamber of Lawyers. Access to the legal profession should be granted on 
merit only, based on an objective qualification examination. Therefore, provisions related to the 
current licensing scheme under the Ministry of Justice taken together with the compulsory 
membership of the newly established Chamber of Lawyers require urgent reconsideration so at 
to secure compliance with international standards. 
</p>
<p>358. Thirdly, the Special Rapporteur noted with interest the intention of the Government to take 
further reform steps in order to ensure the equality of arms of both parties in criminal 
proceedings, as stipulated in section one of the Presidential Decree. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed his interest in receiving substantive detailed information on the 
amendments to relevant pieces of legislation, including the Criminal Procedure Code and the 
Law &#8220;On the guarantees of lawyers&#8217; activities and the social protection of lawyers&#8221;, that the 
Govermnent envisages to introduce to Parliament in the foreseeable future. In summary, while </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 200 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur wished to reaffirm his appreciation of the Government&#8217;s intention to 
conduct a reform of the regulations governing the legal profession, he was seriously concerned 
that the above-mentioned provisions were not in accordance with international standards on the 
independence of lawyers. The Special Rapporteur urged the executive and legislative branches of 
government in Uzbekistan to consider the above mentioned concerns and to amend the relevant 
legislation and other related norms on the legal profession in order to secure their compliance 
with international standards. In that context, transparent and inclusive deliberations with the 
main stake holders, particularly the legal profession, should be conducted prior to the adoption of 
the necessary amendments. The Special Rapporteur express his readiness to provide the 
Government with support and assistance concerning the recommendations outlined in this letter 
and remain at their disposal with regard to any related question or request that the Government 
would wish to seek.

<p>359. On 22 April 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 31 March 2008, stating 
that on 10 December 2007, the procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara 
Province, initiated criminal proceedings under articles 219, part 2, and 140, part 3, of the Uzbek 
Criminal Code against Mr. Y. Zhumaev and his son, B. Zhumaev. The basis for prosecution was 
that they had publicly insulted, resisted the authority of and inflicted bodily harm on a law 
enforcement officer of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara Province, Mr. T. Itokov, who was 
attempting to stop illegal actions of Mr. Y. Zhumaev and his son, Mr. B. Zhumaev, which took 
the form of an unauthorized march with placards containing anti-constitutional material. 
According to the information available to the law enforcement agencies: Yusufzhon 
Ollokulovich Zhumaev (Yusuf Juma), born 1958 in Karakul municipal district, Bukhara 
Province, citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, two previous convictions, was taken into 
custody on 17 December 2007 by the procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, 
Bukhara Province, on charges of having committed offences listed in articles 140, part 3, 
paragraph (a) (&#8220;Insults&#8221;) and 219, part 2 (&#8220;Resistance to authority or a person fulfilling a civic 
duty&#8221;) of the Uzbek Criminal Code. He entered Bukhara municipal correctional institution 
UYa-64/IZ-3 on 22 December 2007. A medical examination showed him to be free of bodily 
harm; he did not visit the Bukhara forensic medical institute for an examination. His state of 
health is satisfactory. During his time at the correctional institution, he did not make any 
complaints to the medical service. During the time he was held in custody, he made no 
complaints or representations about unlawful acts by the institution&#8217;s administration. 
</p>
<p>360. Yusufzhon ugli Bobur (Bobur Juma), born 1983 in Karakul municipal district, Bukhara 
Province, citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, no previous convictions, was taken into custody 
on 17 December 2007 by the procurator&#8217;s office of the Karakul municipal district, Bukhara 
Province, on charges of having committed offences listed in articles 140, part 3, paragraph 
(a) (&#8220;Insults&#8221;) and 219, part 2 (&#8220;Resistance to authority or a person fulfilling a civic duty&#8221;) of the 
Uzbek Criminal Code. He entered Bukhara municipal correctional institution UYa-64/IZ-3 on 
22 December 2007. A medical examination showed him to be free of bodily harm. During his 
time at the correctional institution, he did not make any complaints to the medical service. His 
state of health is satisfactory. During the time he was held in custody, he made no complaints or 
representations about unlawful acts by the institution&#8217;s administration. The detention conditions 
of Mr. Zhumaev and Mr. Yusufzhon ugli are entirely in accordance with the standards 
established by the Penal Enforcement Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Since their arrest, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Zhumaev and Mr. Yusufzhon ugli have had one meeting with their counsel, Mr. R. Kamilov, 
who visited them once on 2 February 2008. On 7 March 2008, Mr. Zhumaev and 
Mr. Yusufzhon ugli submitted a written dismissal of their counsel Mr. Kamilov to the 
procurator&#8217;s office of Karakul municipal district. During Mr. Kamilov&#8217;s meeting with his client 
Mr. Zhumaev, the prison administration uncovered a breach of security, i.e. counsel Kamilov 
gave the prisoner some papers, which the latter attempted to conceal surreptitiously on his 
person. In response to this, the prison staff stopped their meeting and invited Mr. Zhumaev to 
present the hidden papers for inspection. When Mr. Zhumaev was searched, photographs of a 
group of people picketing near the headquarters of the Office of the Procurator-General of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan were found upon him and confiscated, together with telephone numbers 
on a slip of paper, including some of telephone service subscribers in the Russian Federation. 
Counsel Kamilov was then asked to explain his actions, to which he cynically responded that 
&#8220;the prison administration is acting unlawfully&#8221;. Counsel Kamilov was invited into the office of 
the prison governor, Lieutenant-Colonel S.U. Shukurov, for an explanation of the incident and in 
observance of legal standards. The latter explained to him the need to ensure respect for the rules 
in pretrial detention and remand facilities, in order to prevent collusion by persons in custody, 
and also explained that the papers and items confiscated from the prisoner could have been used 
for agitation and provoked unpredictable reactions among the prison population.  
</p>
<p>361. In addition, he was told that in fulfilling their duties in accordance with their professional 
responsibilities, the prison staff had the task of imposing security measures and, in the specific 
case of remand facilities, preventing remand prisoners from having outside contacts. At the end 
of the discussion counsel Kamilov, in an inappropriate response to the administration&#8217;s demands 
and having failed to draw the appropriate conclusions, left the premises of the institution, 
warning the administrator that he would complain about him and his staff. On the basis of the 
complaint by counsel Kamilov concerning unlawful actions by the staff of Bukhara municipal 
correctional institution UYa-64/IZ-3, an official investigation was carried out by the Bukhara 
procurator&#8217;s office and an internal investigation was conducted by the Central Penal Correction 
Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which established that the information about the 
use of physical force and psychological pressure against the detainees Y.O. Zhumaev and 
B. Yusufzhon ugli and threats to counsel Kamilov by the prison governor, 
Lieutenant-olonel Z. Shukurov, was groundless and had been invented by counsel Kamilov 
himself.  
</p>
<p>362. Yusufzhon ugli Mashrab (Mashrab Juma), born 1985 in Karakul municipal district, 
Bukhara Province, citizen of the Republic of Uzbekistan, no prior convictions, was taken into 
custody on 5 December 2007 by the procurator&#8217;s office of Karakul municipal district, Bukhara 
Province, on charges of having committed offences listed in article 104, part 1 (&#8220;Intentional 
infliction of serious bodily injury&#8221;) of the Uzbek Criminal Code. On 11 March 2008, he was 
sentenced under article 104, part 1 (&#8220;Intentional infliction of serious bodily injury&#8221;) of the Uzbek 
Criminal Code by Jondor municipal court, Bukhara Province, to four years&#8217; deprivation of 
liberty in a prison colony. He is currently serving his sentence in correctional institution 
UYa-64/70, Qashqadaryo Province. 
</p>
<p>363. On 10 November, the Government of Uzbekistan replied to the urgent appeal 
of 23 September 2008, stating that, regarding the case of Mr A. Turgunov, on 11 July 2008, the 
Office of the Procurator in the Republic of Karakalpakstan opened a criminal investigation into 
citizen Akzam Olimovich Turgunov and citizen Khamza Nurullaevich Salaev on the basis of </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
page 202 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>indications of an offence under article 165, paragraph 2 (a) and (b), of the Criminal Code of the 
Republic of Uzbekistan. The investigation was prompted by a statement made on 10 July 2008 
by citizen Oybek Sadullaevich Khuzhaboev, and by evidence gathered during an initial inquiry. 
According to this statement, in late May 2008, Turgunov, who already had a criminal record, 
together with Khamza Salaev, the brother of his ex-wife, Ms. M. Salaeva, from whom he had 
been officially divorced in 2007, knew that Mr. Khuzhaboev had earned money working in the 
Republic of South Korea. They invited Mr. Khuzhaboev to the home of Mr. S. Eshzhanov 
where, threatening him with violence, they demanded that he acquire a house for Salaev&#8217;s 
younger sister or give her 20 million som. Should he not comply, they threatened to drown him, 
burn down his house and reduce his younger brothers to penury. Based on Mr. Khuzhaboev&#8217;s 
statement, officers of the Karakalpakstan Ministry of the Interior and Office of the Procurator 
mounted a joint operation at about 8 p.m. on 11 July 2008. Salaev and Turgunov were detained 
at a tea shop in Mangit, Amudarya district, as they extorted from Khuzhaboev the sum of 
500,000 som and the maintenance logbook to a Neksiya car. Turgunov and Salaev were arrested 
under article 221 of the Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure on 12 July 2008; they were informed 
of their rights and obligations under article 48 of the Code. Since their detention, Turgunov&#8217;s and 
Salaev&#8217;s constitutional rights have been fully respected, they have been provided with a State 
defence and, in conformity with article 217 of the Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure, their 
families were given timely notice of their arrest. On 13 July 2008 the case was referred for 
investigation from the Office of the Procurator-General to the Investigation Division of the 
Ministry of the Interior of Karakalpakstan. On 14 July 2008, Turgunov and Salaev were named 
as suspects in the case and charged, in the presence of counsel, under article 165, paragraph 3 (a) 
and (b), of the Uzbek Criminal Code. The Nukus criminal court ordered them to be remanded in 
custody as a preventive measure. On 28 October 2008, the Investigation Division of the Republic 
of Karakalpakstan Ministry of the Interior conducted an official inquiry into the scalds that 
Turgunov suffered. This established that at around noon on 14 July 2008, while Turgunov was 
being interrogated as an accused person at the Nukus remand centre, senior investigator A. 
Kutybaev gave the accused, at his own request, a cup of hot tea. To escape criminal liability by 
spreading rumours about being tortured by Ministry of the Interior staff, Turgunov deliberately 
poured the hot tea down his back, scalding himself. He was given first aid then and there. That 
Turgunov had deliberately done himself harm was fully corroborated at the official inquiry by 
the testimony of senior investigator A. Kutybaev, investigator S. Ismailov and other Nukus 
remand centre staff. Claims by defence counsel R. Tulyaganov that [Turgunov] was 
tortured - alded - by investigator S. Ismailov are fictitious, since investigator Ismailov was not 
present at Turgunov&#8217;s interrogation. Senior Investigator A. Kutybaev put no pressure of any kind 
upon [Turgunov] throughout the preliminary investigation. That Turgunov was guilty of 
extortion was thoroughly established by the evidence gathered in the preliminary investigation. 
The official inquiry also established that in giving hot tea to the accused Turgunov, senior 
investigator A. Kutybaev breached departmental instructions on the guarding and escorting of 
suspects, accused persons and prisoners in custody by internal affairs bodies. In view of the fact 
that Kutybaev has been relieved of his post, however, it was decided to limit disciplinary action 
to a stern warning. It was decided on 31 July 2008 to press the charges in the case, which was 
referred to the Amudarya district criminal court. The court found Turgunov and Salaev guilty 
on 3 October 2008 and sentenced them each to ten years&#8217; deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>364. Concerning the case of Mr. S. Abdurahmanov the Government informs that, on June 2008, 
the investigative department of the internal affairs office in the town of Nukus, Republic of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1 
  page 203 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Karakalpakstan, instituted criminal proceedings against Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich 
Abdurahmanov on the basis of evidence of an offence contrary to article 276, part 2, 
paragraph (a), of the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. The grounds were as follows: on 
7 June 2008, at approximately 7 p.m., on Dosnazarov Street in Nukus, a Zhiguli VAZ-2106 car 
with licence plate number 30 Y 3346 was stopped for a document check by officers of the traffic 
police and canine patrol squad of the Republic&#8217;s Ministry of Internal Affairs, who were carrying 
out an operation to prevent and suppress illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic 
substances, known as Black Poppy 2008. During the check, it was ascertained that the car in 
question was being driven by Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov, who was unable to 
produce a driver&#8217;s licence. In addition, Mr. Abdurahmanov was not the owner of the car. With 
his permission, a canine patrol officer and a police dog inspected the vehicle. As a result, 
substances with a specific odour were discovered hidden in the boot of the car, wrapped in a 
paper and cellophane package. In the presence of witnesses, these substances were confiscated 
for forensic analysis and sealed, and the appropriate documentation was completed. The results 
of the chemical analysis performed on 7 June 2008 showed that the substances found and 
confiscated from Mr. Abdurahmanov&#8217;s car included 114.18 grams of marijuana and 5.98 grams 
of opium, which was wrapped in paper. On 9 June 2008, Mr. Abdurahmanov, defended by 
Mr. B. Abdurahmanov, was charged under article 276, part 2, paragraph (a), of the Criminal 
Code and remanded in custody by a criminal judge. On the basis of all the evidence gathered, it 
was decided that Mr. Abdurahmanov had intended to attempt the sale of a large quantity of 
narcotics. Accordingly, on 5 August 2008, pursuant to article 362 of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, the charges previously brought against Mr. Abdurahmanov were amended, and he 
was charged under articles 25 and 273, part 5, of the Criminal Code. On 6 August 2008, the 
pretrial investigation was completed, and the criminal case was referred for trial, in accordance 
with the established procedure, to the Takhtakupyr District Criminal Court of the Republic of 
Karakalpakstan. The Takhtakupyr District Criminal Court found the accused, 
Mr. Abdurahmanov, guilty and sentenced him to 10 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty. It should also 
be noted that the Crminal charges brought against Mr. Akzam Olimovich Turgunov and 
Mr. Salijon Abduraimovich Abdurahmanov are in no way related to their human rights work. No 
complaints or statements from Mr. Turgunov regarding the use of unlawful investigation 
methods have been received by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Uzbekistan.

atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno de Venezuela la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con una 
sentencia de fecha 18 de diciembre de 2008 del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia - Sala 
Constitucional de la Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de Venezuela. En dicha sentencia declara 
&#8220;inejecutable&#8221; la sentencia de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos de fecha 5 de 
agosto de 2008, en la que se orden&#243; la reincorporaci&#243;n en los cargos de los ex jueces de la Corte 
Primera de lo Contencioso Administrativo Anna Mar&#237;a Ruggeri Cova, Perkins Rocha Contreras 
y Juan Carlos Apitz B.; se conden&#243; a la Rep&#250;blica Bolivariana de Venezuela al pago de

publicaci&#243;n de la sentencia, al pronunciamiento de disculpas p&#250;blicas y al pago de costas y 
gastos en los que las personas arriba mencionadas incurrieron. El Tribunal Supremo de Justicia 
estim&#243; que la sentencia de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos se pronunci&#243; sobre 
asuntos que son competencia exclusiva y excluyente del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia y que 
estableci&#243; directrices para el poder legislativo en materia de carrera judicial y responsabilidad de 
los jueces, &#8220;violentando la soberan&#237;a del Estado venezolano en la organizaci&#243;n de los poderes 
p&#250;blicos y en la selecci&#243;n de sus funcionarios, lo cual resulta inadmisible&#8221;. Para el Tribunal, la 
ejecuci&#243;n de la sentencia de la Corte Interamericana adem&#225;s afectar&#237;a los principios y valores del 
orden constitucional y podr&#237;a conllevar  aun caos institucional del sistema de justicia, al 
pretender modificar la autonom&#237;a del Poder Judicial previsto en la Constituci&#243;n y el r&#233;gimen 
disciplinario instaurado por la ley. Asimismo, estima el Tribunal que el fallo de la Corte 
Interamericana de Derechos Humanos equipara de forma absoluta los derechos de los jueces 
titulares y los provisorios, lo cual es &#8220;absolutamente inaceptable y contrario a derecho&#8221;. 
El Tribunal, citando un fallo de la Sala Pol&#237;tico-Administrativa (No. 0673-2008), consider&#243; que 
la Comisi&#243;n de Funcionamiento y Reestructuraci&#243;n del Sistema Judicial ejerce la funci&#243;n </p>

</p>
<p>disciplinaria plena respecto de los jueces titulares que han alcanzado la estabilidad en su cargo, 
la cual encuentra su base en la aprobaci&#243;n  del concurso de oposici&#243;n respectivo. Sin embargo, 
respecto de los jueces provisorios, dicha atribuci&#243;n se encuentra a cargo de la Comisi&#243;n Judicial 
del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, la cual tiene la potestad para dejar sus nombramientos sin 
efecto de manera discrecional. En efecto, sostiene el Tribunal, que el acto administrativo que 
pronuncia la remoci&#243;n de un juez provisional no requiere de ning&#250;n procedimiento 
administrativo, puesto que  los jueces provisiorios no gozan de la garant&#237;a de estabilidad. 
El Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos ratificado por Venezuela establece la 
obligaci&#243;n internacional del Estado de garantizar el acceso a jueces y tribunales independientes e 
imparciales 8art. 14.1). El Relator Especial record&#243; al Gobierno de su Excelencia que los 
principios de estabilidad e inamovilidad del juez son una garant&#237;a fundamental para proteger la 
independencia del poder judicial. Dichos principios deben aplicarse a todas aquellas personas 
que ejercen funciones jurisdiccionales, incluso a los jueces provisorios, quienes deben gozar de 
ciertas garant&#237;as m&#237;nimas que aseguren que act&#250;an de manera independiente, dada la importancia 
de la funci&#243;n a ellos encomendada, la cual es administrar justicia. La &#250;nica excepci&#243;n a estos 
principios aceptada por los est&#225;ndares internacionales son las sanciones que se imponen en el 
marco de un proceso disciplinario que cumple con las garant&#237;as de un juicio justo. Tal como lo 
ha expresado el Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos, los jueces s&#243;lo podr&#225;n ser destituidos por razones 
graves de mala conducta o incompetencia, de conformidad con procedimientos equitativos que 
garanticen la objetividad y la imparcialidad. El Comit&#233; se ha pronunciado en varias 
oportunidades en este sentido. Asimismo, los Principios b&#225;sicos relativos a la independencia de 
la judicatura adoptados por el S&#233;ptimo Congreso de las Naciones Unidas sobre Prevenci&#243;n del 
Delito y Tratamiento del Delincuente, celebrado en Mil&#225;n del 26 de agosto al 6 de septiembre 
de 1985, y confirmados por la Asamblea General en sus resoluciones 40/32 de 29 de noviembre 
de 1985 y 40/146 de 13 de diciembre de 1985, establecen que toda acusaci&#243;n contra un juez debe 
ser tramitada de manera pronta e imparcial con arreglo a un procedimiento que respete el 
derecho a un proceso justo (Principio 17). Principio que ha sido recogido  por diversas 
normatividades internacionales en diferentes regiones del mundo. Adem&#225;s, el Relator Especial 
llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Venezuela respecto de lo establecido por el Principio 11 de los 
Principios arriba mencionados, seg&#250;n el cual, la ley garantizar&#225; la permanencia en el cargo de los 
jueces por los per&#237;odos establecidos, su independencia y su seguridad. A este respecto el Comit&#233; 
de Derechos Humanos ha considerado que la destituci&#243;n de jueces sin que se les d&#233; ninguna 
raz&#243;n concreta y sin que dispongan de una protecci&#243;n judicial efectiva para impugnar la 
destituci&#243;n, es incompatible con la independencia del poder judicial. Asimismo, el Principio 12 
establece que se garantizar&#225; la inamovilidad de los jueces, tanto de los nombrados mediante 
decisi&#243;n administrativa como de los elegidos, hasta que cumplan la edad para la jubilaci&#243;n 
forzosa o expire el per&#237;odo para el que hayan sido nombrados o elegidos. El Comit&#233; de Derechos 
Humanos ha manifestado en m&#250;ltiples ocasiones su preocupaci&#243;n por la existencia de periodos 
cortos de servicio, los cuales ponen en entredicho la independencia del poder judicial. Dicha 
preocupaci&#243;n se acent&#250;a en los casos en que ni siquiera existe un t&#233;rmino corto de servicios, sino 
que el juez est&#225; en situaci&#243;n de provisionalidad, la cual puede ser terminada en cualquier 
momento por una decisi&#243;n de naturaleza discrecional. La Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica 
Bolivariana de Venezuela ha recogido los principios de estabilidad e inamovilidad, en especial 
en su art&#237;culo 267, el cual establece: &#8220;La jurisdicci&#243;n disciplinaria judicial estar&#225; a cargo de los 
tribunales disciplinarios que determine la ley. El r&#233;gimen disciplinario de los magistrados o 
magistradas y jueces o juezas estar&#225; fundamentado en el C&#243;digo de &#201;tica del Juez Venezolano o 
Jueza Venezolana, que dictar&#225; la Asamblea Nacional. El procedimiento disciplinario ser&#225; </p>

</p>
<p>p&#250;blico, oral y breve, conforme al debido proceso, en los t&#233;rminos y condiciones que establezca 
la ley. Para el ejercicio de estas atribuciones, el Tribunal Supremo en pleno crear&#225; una Direcci&#243;n 
Ejecutiva de la Magistratura, con sus oficinas regionales.&#8221; Sin embargo, hasta la fecha la 
Asamblea Nacional no ha adoptado el C&#243;digo de &#201;tica del Juez y la Jueza Venezolanos, lo que 
tiene como resultado que el r&#233;gimen disciplinario no est&#233; regulado de manera clara  y que tenga 
su base en disposiciones  que no tienen rango legal, lo que es contrario a los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales en la materia. Esto ha sido a su vez constatado por la propia Sala Constitucional 
del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, la cual ya en una sentencia del a&#241;o 2006 hab&#237;a declarado que 
exist&#237;a una inconstitucionalidad por omisi&#243;n legislativa de la Asamblea Nacional, con motivo de 
la no promulgaci&#243;n de la normatividad en cuesti&#243;n. Es por este mismo motivo que en su 
sentencia de 18 de Diciembre de 2008 una vez m&#225;s inst&#243; a la Asamblea Nacional a que dicte el 
C&#243;digo de &#201;tica del Juez y Jueza venezolanos. El Relator Especial not&#243; con preocupaci&#243;n que 
los llamados jueces provisorios sean susceptibles de ser removidos &#8220;dejando sin efecto&#8221; su 
nombramiento,  sin que medie ning&#250;n tipo de procedimiento ni causa legal, ya que, tal como lo 
afirma el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia en su sentencia de 18 de Diciembre de 2008, &#233;stos son de 
libre remoci&#243;n y su destituci&#243;n es discrecional. Como ya ha sido anotado anteriormente, dicha 
inestabilidad genera un grave peligro para su independencia, presupuesto fundamental para el 
buen funcionamiento de cualquier sistema judicial, el cual adem&#225;s de hacer parte de los 
est&#225;ndares internacionales en la materia, est&#225; consagrado en la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica 
Bolivariana de Venezuela. De otra parte, el Tribunal Supremo de Justicia afirma que su decisi&#243;n 
no busca interpretar el sentido y el alcance de la sentencia de la Corte Interamericana de 
Derechos Humanos, ni de desconocer la Convenci&#243;n Americana de Derechos Humanos, ni de 
eludir el compromiso de ejecutar las decisiones de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos 
Humanos, sino aplicar un est&#225;ndar m&#237;nimo de adecuaci&#243;n del fallo al orden constitucional 
interno. Sin embargo, a su vez solicita al poder Ejecutivo que con fundamento en el art&#237;culo 78 
de la Convenci&#243;n Americana de Protecci&#243;n de los Derechos Humanos, proceda a la denuncia de 
dicho tratado. El Relator Especial llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno de Su Excelencia sobre el 
principio de derecho internacional que obliga a los Estados a cumplir de buena fe con las 
obligaciones internacionales que se derivan de los tratados internacionales que suscribe de 
manera libre y voluntaria. Dicho principio, conocido como Pacta Sunt Servanda, ha sido 
reconocido en m&#250;ltiples ocasiones por la jurisprudencia internacional como un principio del 
derecho de gentes. Seg&#250;n el mismo, los Estados  no pueden invocar normas de su ordenamiento 
jur&#237;dico interno como un obst&#225;culo para sustraerse del cumplimiento de una obligaci&#243;n 
internacional. La Convenci&#243;n de Viena sobre el Derechos de los Tratados consagr&#243; este 
principio en sus art&#237;culos 26 y 27. Asimismo, el Comit&#233; de Derechos Humanos  y los organismos 
jurisdiccionales de los sistemas regionales de protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos han 
reafirmado este principio, incluso afirmando que el mismo, al ser considerado un principio 
general del derecho, es de aplicaci&#243;n a&#250;n cuando se invoquen normas de car&#225;cter constitucional 
como obst&#225;culo de derecho interno para incumplir una obligaci&#243;n internacional. En este orden de 
ideas, los Estados no pueden invocar disposiciones de orden interno con el fin de incumplir una 
obligaci&#243;n internacional, en este caso la ejecuci&#243;n de una sentencia dictada por un organismo 
internacional, estando vigente la Convenci&#243;n, y cuya competencia ha sido reconocida de manera 
voluntaria por el Estado en cuesti&#243;n. En efecto, el art&#237;culo 68.1 de la Convenci&#243;n Americana de 
Derechos Humanos establece que las sentencias de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos 
Humanos son de obligatorio cumplimiento. Por lo tanto, no existe ninguna  hip&#243;tesis jur&#237;dica que 
autorice su incumplimiento. La Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos ha reiterado en 
varias ocasiones que en virtud del car&#225;cter definitivo e inapelable de las sentencias de la Corte, </p>

<p>seg&#250;n lo establecido en el art&#237;culo 67 de la Convenci&#243;n Americana, &#233;stas deben ser prontamente 
cumplidas por el Estado en forma &#237;ntegra. En consecuencia, las obligaciones convencionales de 
los Estados Partes vinculan a todos los poderes y &#243;rganos del Estado. Finalmente, el Relator 
expres&#243; su preocupaci&#243;n por la solicitud del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia al poder Ejecutivo en 
el sentido de denunciar la Convenci&#243;n Americana de Protecci&#243;n de Derechos Humanos. Como 
es de p&#250;blico conocimiento el Sistema Interamericano de protecci&#243;n de los Derechos Humanos 
ha contribuido de manera invaluable a la protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos en las Am&#233;ricas. A 
lo largo de su existencia ha construido una jurisprudencia s&#243;lida en materia de Derecho 
Internacional de los Derechos Humanos, la cual goza de reconocimiento, tanto de parte de los 
dem&#225;s sistemas regionales de protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, como del sistema de 
Naciones Unidas. El Relator Especial ha hecho referencia a la jurisprudencia interamericana en 
m&#250;ltiples ocasiones. Denunciar la Convenci&#243;n Americana de Derechos Humanos, adem&#225;s de 
poner en peligro la integridad del Sistema Interamericano, constituir&#237;a un retroceso en materia de 
protecci&#243;n internacional de los derechos humanos.

<p>369. El Relator Especial manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n por la ausencia de respuesta oficial a la 
carta de alegaci&#243;n enviada el 14 de agosto de 2008 y urge al Gobierno de Venezuela a que env&#237;e

Preocupa al Relator Especial la situaci&#243;n descrita previamente y llama la atenci&#243;n sobre los 
Principios B&#225;sicos sobre la Funci&#243;n de los Abogados, aprobados por el Octavo Congreso de las 
Naciones Unidas sobre la Prevenci&#243;n del Delito y el Tratamiento del Delincuente, celebrado en 
La Habana (Cuba) del 27 de agosto al 7 de septiembre de 1990, en particular el Principio 24 que 
establece que los abogados estar&#225;n facultados a constituir asociaciones profesionales aut&#243;nomas

las asociaciones profesionales ser&#225; elegido por sus miembros y ejercer&#225; sus funciones sin

Relator expresa su profunda preocupaci&#243;n por el fallo del Tribunal Superior de Justicia (TSJ) 
que establece que los jueces provisorios no gozan de la garant&#237;a de estabilidad., ya que, tal como 
lo afirma el Alto Tribunal, &#233;stos son de libre remoci&#243;n y su destituci&#243;n es discrecional. Cabe 
recordar, que los principios de estabilidad e inamovilidad del juez son una garant&#237;a fundamental

<p><b>Yemen

<p><b>Communications sent 
</b></p>
<p>370. On 26 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal, regarding the case of 
Mr. Abdeladhim Ali Abdeljalil Al-Hattar<b> </b>(hereafter Mr. Al-Hattar), a citizen of Yemen, born 
in 1982, resident in Sanaa, who is an Imam at the Al-Haramayn mosque, in Al-Asbahi in Sanaa. 
According to the information received, Mr. Al-Hattar was arrested on 14 December 2007 at the 
mosque by agents of the Political Security Organisation, and taken to an undisclosed location. 
No arrest warrant was shown to him, nor was he informed of the reasons and legal basis for his 
arrest. Mr. Al-Hattar was held in incommunicado detention in police facilities for the first three 
(3) months since his arrest. He remained in detention without having been formally charged with 
an offence, without having received any information on the proceedings initiated against him or 
on the legal basis of his detention, without access to a lawyer, and without having had the 
possibility to challenge the legality of his detention before a judicial or other authority. 
Mr. Al-Hattar&#8217;s parents have appealed to the authorities for their son&#8217;s release but have not 
received any reply. The Constitution of Yemen stipulates that any person accused of a penal 
offence must be brought before a judge within 24 hours of his arrest. Article 73 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code of Yemen (Law no. 31 of 1994) establishes that everyone who is arrested must 
be immediately informed of the reasons for his arrest, must be shown the arrest warrant, must be 
allowed to contact any person he wishes to inform of the arrest and must be allowed to contact a 
lawyer. According to the source, none of these guarantees has been respected in Mr. Al-Hattar&#8217;s 
case, his detention thus being devoid of any justification in Yemeni law. The Special Rapporteur 
requested the Government to provide him with detailed information about the current situation of 
the above-mentioned person and clarify the legal provisions justifying his continued detention. 
371. On 14 August 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of 
Mr Mohamed al-Saqaf, a lawyer and university lecturer. Mr al-Saqaf supported and defended 
peaceful protesters from Southern Yemen, and expressed criticism about the repression of these 
protests. According to the new information received, on 11 August 2008 Mr Mohamed al-Saqaf 
was arrested by security agents on charges of &#8220;undermining national unity&#8221;. He had been 
arrested at Sana&#8217;a airport, and was currently being held at the Criminal investigation prison in 
Sana&#8217;a. Mr al-Saqaf was the lawyer of Mr Hassan Ba&#8217;oom, who participated in demonstrations 
organized by retired South Yemeni soldiers, and was arrested on 2 August 2007. Mr Ba&#8217;oom was 
among those participating in the sit-in protest in Liberty Square in central Aden, about 
discrimination against South Yemeni soldiers in the spheres of employment, salaries and 
pensions. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr Mohamed al-Saqaf may be 
solely connected with his activities of defending Mr Hassan Ba&#8217;oom in court proceedings, and 
for peacefully exercising his freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed regarding the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr al-Saqaf, who may be at the risk of torture and 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>372. On 17 October 2008, the Government replies to the urgent appeal of 14 August 2008, 
stating that Mr. Mohamed Al-Saqaf is not detained at their custody.  </p>

<p>373. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to the 
communication dated 26 May 2008 and urges the Government of Uganda to provide at the 
earliest possible date, and preferably before the end of the 12th session of the Human Rights 
Council, a detailed substantive answer to the above allegations.

<p>374. On 30 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, regarding the case of Frank Chikowore, freelance journalist accredited with the 
Media and Information Commission and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, on behalf of 
whom an urgent appeal was sent on 16 April 2008 by the Vice-Chairperson of the Working 
Group on arbitrary detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression. On 15 April 2008, Mr. Chikowore was arrested by 
police officers. His lawyer tried to obtain information about his whereabouts with the Harare 
police headquarters, which at first denied that Mr. Chikowore was being held. According to 
additional information received, Mr. Chikowore has been detained from the time of his arrest on 
15 April to 21 April at the Harare Central Police Station, and then transferred to a remand prison 
in Harare. It was reported that although the police made numerous accusations against 
Mr. Chikowore, no charges have yet been brought against him. It was further reported that on 
17 April, Mr. Chikowore&#8217;s lawyer filed an urgent High Court application requesting that his 
client be hospitalized for abdominal and chest pains, but that to date, Mr. Chikowore had not 
received any medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>375. On 8 May 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr Dzimbabwe Chimbga, lawyer and member of the non-governmental organization 
Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). Mr Chimbga was the subject of an urgent appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 
28 March 2007. According to the information received, on 2 May 2008, on his way to Swaziland 
to attend the 43rd Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, 
Mr Dzimbabwe Chimbga was approached by security agents before the immigration desk at 
Harare International Airport. A total of nine confidential sets of documents were reportedly 
seized. These documents were case files of communications and complaints set to be argued by a 
ZLHR legal team against the Government of Zimbabwe. Also taken were copies of pre- and 
post-elections reports. The security agents recorded the personal and professional details of 
Mr Chimbga, and warned him that they were going to &#8220;deal with [him] when [he] return[s] to 
Zimbabwe&#8221;. Concern was expressed that these acts of intimidation against Mr Chimbga and the 
seizure of the aforementioned documents may be solely related to his non-violent activities in 
defense of human rights. </p>

</p>
<p>376. On 23 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the case of Mr. Eric Matinega, 
a registered lawyer and Advocate of the High Court of Zimbabwe. Mr. Matinega is also an 
elected Member of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe for Buhera West Constituency. 
According to the information received, on 31 May 2008, Mr. Matinenga travelled to Buhera to 
investigate the alleged arrest, assault and detention of his clients and to enforce a court order he 
had obtained against Zimbabwe&#8217;s Defence Forces in Buhera West Constituency over persecution 
of supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change. Upon arrival at Buhera police station, 
Mr. Matinenga requested to visit his clients and produced his Law Society of Zimbabwe identity. 
However, he was denied access to his clients and instead he was subjected to questioning by an 
Assistant Inspector. Mr. Matinega was advised by the said inspector that he would not be 
allowed to see the persons in question, but was free to leave. When Mr. Matinenga re-claimed 
his right to see his clients, Major Svosve arrived at the scene and consulted privately with the 
Assistant Inspector. At 00:30 hours, following this consultation, the Assistant Inspector advised 
Mr. Matinega that he had been instructed to arrest and detained him on unspecified charges of 
&#8220;public violence&#8221;. Furthermore, Mr. Matinega&#8217;s car was searched and confiscated, although 
nothing incriminating could be found. On 1 June, Mr. Matinega&#8217;s legal counsel came to the 
police station and was allowed to see Mr. Matinega. When the legal counsel asked the 
representatives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to specify the charges, they said 
that they did not know the reasons for his arrest. The CID representatives  promised to return 
early on 2 June in order to take Mr. Matinega to court. On 2 June, the alleged investigating 
officer, Chief Superintendent Makone, decided to transfer Mr. Matinenga to Mutare, where he 
was detained overnight at Mutare Central police station. On 3 June, Mr. Matinega was charged 
with &#8220;contravening section 187 (1) (a) as read with section 26 (1) (a) of the Criminal Law Act 
for incitement to public violence&#8221;. Mr. Matinega denied the allegations orally and in writing. On 
the same day, when Mr. Matinega&#8217;s lawyers approached the Area of the Public Prosecutor to see 
whether Mr. Matinega could be brought before the court, they were told that the Area of the 
Public Prosecutor was busy and hence this was not possible. On 5 June, Regional Magistrate, 
Mrs. Mwayera, ordered Mr. Matinega&#8217;s immediate release as Mr. Matinega had spent four days 
in custody, which was beyond the legally provided period of detention. After one day of 
freedom, in the morning of 7 June, Mr. Matinega was once again arrested by the police at his 
Harare home. He was driven by the police to Buhera and detained at Murambinda police station. 
His lawyers urgently petitioned the High Court, presided over by Justice Chitakunye, who 
ordered in form of a provisional court order to produce Mr. Matinenga at 10:00 on 8 June 2008 
before the court. The order also stated that the reasons for detaining Mr. Matinega should be 
produced in the absence of which Mr. Matinenga should be immediately released. As 
Mr. Matinega was not produced before the court as requested by Justice Chitakunye, the 
provisional court order was confirmed as the final order of the court. However, Chief 
Superintendent Makone, declared to Mr. Matinega&#8217;s legal counsels that he would not comply 
with the order. Police officers tried to compel Mr. Matinega to sign new statements which he 
refused to do. Mr. Matinega was then detained at Buhera police station in spite of the court order 
for his immediate release. Mr. Matinega&#8217;s lawyers subsequently filed a contempt of court 
application which was then pending before the High Court. On 10 June, Mr. Matinega was 
transferred from Buhera police station to Rusape police station. On 11 June, none of the 
magistrates in Rusape were prepared to preside over the matter as they were reportedly aware of 
the existing court orders as well as the pending application for contempt of court. Mr. Matinenga </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/41/Add.1

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>was locked up at the Rusape police station. On 13 June, Chief Magistrate, Herbert Mandeya, 
heard the case and decided on 14 June to place Mr. Matinenga on remand, following a fresh 
application by the Attorney General&#8217;s office, for the same charges dismissed by the previous 
magistrate on 4 June 2008 and despite the High Court order for his release dated 8 June 2008. An 
application for bail was made, which was granted by the court. However, a representative of the 
Attorney-General&#8217;s office invoked section 121 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act to 
keep Mr. Matinenga in custody pending appeal of the decision to grant bail. Mr. Matinenga was 
then remanded in custody at Rusape Remand Prison until 26 June where he was still being 
detained.  
</p>
<p>377. On 30 June 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, regarding the 
case of Mr. Mawadza, Bindura Provincial Magistrate; Ernest Jena, lawyer; and 
Mr. Trust Maanda, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights Regional Project Manager. According 
to the information received, on 23 June, Magistrate Mawadza was attacked and assaulted by 
Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) youths as he left a supermarket 
in Bindura. He had previously granted bail to detained Movement for Democratic Change 
(MDC) activists. Mr. Mawadza continues to live in fear as no protection has been provided by 
the state. On 24 June 2008, around 9:00 am, Mr. Ernest Jena was abducted from his office by 
ZANU-PF youths who forced him into a green car. Some of the youths came back to his office 
looking for his assistant, Mr. Mashayamombe. They told Mr. Mashayamombe that Mr. Jena was 
at a base in Bindura. There are three ZANU-PF bases in Bindura, i.e. in Chiwaridzo, Chipadza 
and another. Mr. Jena was scheduled to appear before Magistrate Mr. Mawadza to argue matters 
of other detained activists. Reports from Mashonaland Central province suggest that Mr. Jena 
had being taken around to ZANU-PF militia bases across the province and being &#8216;taught a 
lesson&#8217;. It was reported that he was last seen or heard of at a base in Chiweshe. However, his 
concrete whereabouts continue to remain unknown. On 23 June 2008, between 10.00 p.m. and 
12.00 a.m., the police attempted to search the house of Mr. Trust Maanda without a warrant. 
When Mr. Maanda refused to open the door, they forced the gardener to open the gate. The 
police then searched the gardener&#8217;s lodgings, but could not find anything of interest. They 
interrogated and threatened the gardener and then requested him to appear at the police station at 
9:00 a.m. the following day. On 24 June 2008, just before midnight, Mr. Trust Maanda returned 
home after working late when his way was blocked by several ZANU-PF militias waving 
placards. When he stopped the car, three or four of the militia forced him to turn the car and 
drive back to town. He called Mr. Tinoziva Bere, Law Society of Zimbabwe Counselor, who 
drove to meet him. The two met and had to wait at a roadblock at Mutare Teachers college gate 
where they asked the police officers for help. However, they refused to assist and referred the 
two to Mutare Central Police. They were required to wait at that police station until they received 
reports that the militias had moved away from Mr. Maanda&#8217;s house. Mr. Bere then escorted 
Mr. Maanda to his house around 1.15 a.m. and left only after Mr. Maanda had entered his house.

<p>378. On 27 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together with the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, regarding information the Special Rapporteurs 
have received in relation to demonstrations organised by the <i>Zimbabwe National Students Union </i></p>

</p>
<p><i>(ZINASU)</i> and <i>Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA)</i>. Previous communications were sent to the 
Government by several mandate-holders regarding ZINASU on 15 May 2006, 19 February 2007, 
20 March 2007 and 20 July 2007. Responses from the Government were received on 
21 May 2004, 5 August 2004, and 12 October 2007. Several communications have been sent 
regarding WOZA. On 8 July 2008, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders sent a communication regarding Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magadonga Mahlangu of 
WOZA. No response was received from the Zimbabwe Government. According to information 
received, on 14 October 2008, at approximately 2.15 p.m., over 500 demonstrators gathered 
outside August House to present a petition to the Government of Zimbabwe in defense of their 
right to education. The petition reportedly addressed sanitation problems in colleges, 
uninhabitable student residences, educational materials, access to education and quality of 
education, academic freedom and institutional autonomy, and the closure of schools in 
Zimbabwe. The demonstrations included a reportedly peaceful march which was disrupted four 
times by armed riot police from the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP). The President of the 
ZINASU, Mr. Clever Bere; the Secretary General, Mr. Lovemore Chinoputsa; the Legal and 
Social Affairs Secretary, Mr. Courage Ngwarai; a General Councillor, Ms. Edwina Burira; and a 
Youth Forum member, Mr. Tawanda Mutema, were all arrested. Some demonstrators were also 
hospitalized because of police violence. The Gender and Human Rights Secretary, 
Ms. Priviledge Mutanga was assaulted, sustaining head injuries and a swollen arm. 
Mr. Obert Masaraura, a General Councillor from Midlands State University, sustained serious 
head injuries. On 16 October 2008, another peaceful demonstration was organized by WOZA to 
call for food to be provided for all Zimbabweans. Police reportedly used force against 
demonstrators, including the Co-leader of WOZA, Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, breaking one 
woman&#8217;s finger with batons and causing bruises to another two women. Nine arrests were made 
in total. Seven protesters, who had been arrested before the demonstrations began, were released 
on the same day without charge after the intervention of a lawyer. However, Ms. Jenni Williams, 
the National Coordinator of WOZA, and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu were detained in Bulawayo 
Central police station overnight and were moved to a remand prison on 17 October 2008. They 
were remanded in custody until their bail hearing on 21 October 2008. Neither of the women was 
present for the bail hearing because, according to the State, there was no transport available to 
take them there. They were charged with &#8220;disturbing the peace, security or order of the public&#8221; 
under Section 371(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. They were reportedly 
being held at Bulawayo Remand Prison. It was unclear whether they have had access to a 
lawyer. Serious concern was expressed that the action taken against the demonstrators mentioned 
above may be directly related to their legitimate activities in the defense of human rights, in 
particular the right to education. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Jenni Williams and Ms. Magodonga Mahlangu, as well as both 
groups of demonstrators. It was feared that the described incidents form part of an ongoing 
pattern of harassments against demonstrators petitioning to defend human rights in Zimbabwe.

<p><b>Special Rapporteur&#8217;s comments and observations 
</b></p>
<p>379. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the absence of an official reply to communications 
dated 30 April 2008, 8 May 2008, 23 and 30 June 2008 and 27 October 2008. He urges the 
Government of Zimbabwe to provide at the earliest possible date detailed substantive replies to 
the above allegations. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the situation of defense 
lawyers and the violation of basic fair trial guarantees, particularly in the cases of human rights 
defenders. In view of this and the total absence of any Government&#8217;s reply to communications, 
the Special Rapporteur reiterates his request to carry out an in situ visit to Zimbabwe, which his 
predecessor made in 2001 and which he repeated several times.
