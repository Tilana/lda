<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 12 October 2011, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, convened an expert group meeting in New York on 
gender-motivated killings of women to inform her thematic report on this topic to the 
Human Rights Council in June 2012. The present report is submitted in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/24 and General Assembly resolution 65/281. 
</p>
<p>2. The meeting brought together 25 experts from academia, civil society organizations 
and United Nations agencies and bodies with technical and practical expertise on and 
experience in working on violence against women.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p>3. In the exercise of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has observed that gender-
motivated killings of women have taken on disturbing proportions in the last few years. The 
Special Rapporteur has looked at this phenomenon from the perspective of the continuum 
of violence, and the multiple forms of discrimination and oppression which women around 
the world continue to face. The Special Rapporteur and her predecessors have expressed 
particular concern at the extremely violent murders of women and girls, including when 
reporting on country visits to Latin America. A worrisome failure of States to effectively 
comply with their due diligence obligations to prevent, investigate, punish and provide 
reparation for all acts of violence against women has also been noted. 
</p>
<p>4. In response, the Special Rapporteur intends to focus her report to the Human Rights 
Council in 2012 on gender-motivated killings of women &#8211; also known as femicide1 &#8211; with 
the aim of providing a global perspective on the prevalence, manifestations and causes of 
such killings. The report will also provide recommendations to States and other 
stakeholders to assist them in their efforts to prevent and eradicate gender-motivated 
killings of women.  
</p>
<p>5. To this aim, experts from a range of professional backgrounds and geographic 
locations were invited to share their expertise, views and experiences. A background paper 
was circulated in advance of the meeting to the participants to provide an overview of the 
manifestations, causes and consequences of gender-motivated killings from a global 
perspective. The background paper outlined the three main objectives of the meeting, 
namely: (a) to build upon national, regional and international expertise on the 
manifestations, root causes and consequences of gender-motivated killings of women; (b) 
to discuss policy, legal and institutional challenges at national, regional and international 
levels to address such killings; and (c) to identify good practices and lessons learnt in 
different regions.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Overview of discussions 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur provided opening remarks on the meeting&#8217;s objectives and 
outlined the background and modalities of the meeting, which was structured around three 
main sessions: (a) the conceptual clarification, evolution and current debate of the terms 
femicide and feminicide; (b) current trends and regional perspectives on manifestations and

<p>causes of gender-motivated killings of women; and (c) practice and jurisprudence on 
gender-motivated killings of women from regional and international human rights bodies.   
</p>
<p><b> A. </b>Presentation on &#8220;<b>f</b>emicide&#8221; and &#8220;feminicide&#8221;: <b>conceptual clarification, 
evolution and current debate on the terms   
</b></p>
<p>7. This introductory presentation explored the origins and evolution of the concepts of 
&#8220;femicide&#8221; and &#8220;feminicide&#8221; and their contemporary application in law and practice from a 
</p>
<p>Latin American perspective, where the terms have had particular resonance at the political 
and societal levels. To this end, a framework with four levels examining the theoretical, 
political, operative and legislative dimensions was applied.  
</p>
<p>8. In outlining the historical trajectory of the concept of femicide at the theoretical 
level, it was noted that the concept gained modern relevance in the feminist movement of 
the 1970s, when &#8220;femicide&#8221; was proposed as an alternative to the gender-neutral term of 
homicide in order to recognize the discriminative, oppressive, unequal and systematic 
violence against women, which at its extreme end culminated in death. Diana Russell and 
Jane Caputi in 1990 defined the term as &#8220;the killing of women by men motivated by hate, 
</p>
<p>contempt, pleasure or the assumption of ownership of women&#8221;.2 It was expanded by Diane 
Russell and Jill Radford in 1992 as &#8220;the misogynist killing of women by men&#8221;3 and later 
broadened by Diane Russell and Roberta Harnes in 2001 to &#8220;the killing of females by males 
because they are female&#8221; in order to include &#8220;all forms of sexist killings&#8221; with a view to 
capturing the socially constructed and perceived right to do so.4  
</p>
<p>9. It was explained that femicide could be intentional or indirect and hence included 
unintentional killings of women, as exemplified by some instances of domestic violence 
which could result in the death of women. The presentation referred to female infanticide, 
preadolescent mortality, dowry-deaths, clandestine abortions, honour killings, maternal 
mortality and deaths arising from harmful practices or neglect (such as starvation or ill-
treatment) of women and girls. The term femicide (&#8220;<i>femicidio</i>&#8221;) was particularly embraced 
</p>
<p>in Latin America in the 1990s as a useful tool in response to an alarming escalation of very 
violent murders of women and girls. In parallel, the word &#8220;<i>feminicidio</i>&#8221; was introduced as 
the direct Spanish translation from the Latin origins of femicide, adding the element of 
impunity and institutional violence owing to the lack of accountability and adequate 
response of the State to such killings. The presentation underscored that femicide involved 
killings perpetrated or tolerated by both private and public actors by action or omission and 
that adopting feminicide in English could prove useful when State accountability was at 
stake.  
</p>
<p>10. At the political level, it was noted that the use of the term remains a political choice 
and a rather specialist notion yet to reach mainstream political discourse. At the operative 
level, the importance of clear definitions of what constituted femicide in order to carry out 
effective investigation and prosecution was emphasized. That was particularly pertinent 
with respect to disaggregated data collection efforts: significant discrepancies in available 
data in Latin America owing to definitional inconsistencies remained a clear challenge and 
must be addressed in order to improve criminal investigation, analysis and response to acts 
of femicide. Lastly, referring to the judicial level, the presentation recalled the due 
diligence obligation of States to prevent, investigate and prosecute all forms of violence

</b></p>
<p>against women and to protect women and provide reparation. The importance of 
recognizing the conceptual evolution was emphasized and illustrated in the political 
frameworks that had lead to action and investigation of the phenomenon in Latin America. 
</p>
<p>11. In conclusion, the presentation underlined that the very different contexts of 
femicide, set against the multiple forms of discrimination and violence against women, 
required multisectoral responses. The ensuing discussion touched on the challenges of how 
to determine when the killing of women is gender-motivated. The importance of accurate 
statistics and analysis and the need to address the dichotomy of State accountability and 
individual responsibility were emphasized in that respect. One participant underscored the 
value of femicide as a gender-specific crime and the current absence of gender-sensitive 
data collection. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Manifestations and causes of gender-motivated killings of women: 
</b></p>
<p><b>current trends and regional perspectives (session 1) 
</b></p>
<p>12. In this session, presenters discussed the prevalence, manifestations and causes of 
gender-motivated killings of women in different parts of the world, drawing upon specific 
national or regional trends, particularities and recent developments. This included 
information on the physical manifestations of killings, their legal, political, socioeconomic 
and cultural contexts and how killings are situated in the continuum of violence against 
women. Presentations also examined legislative measures to prevent killings and good 
practices and challenges in preventing, investigating and prosecuting gender-motivated 
killings of women as well as strategies to encourage data collection and reporting. States&#8217; 
compliance with their due diligence obligation and measures undertaken by States to 
combat impunity of perpetrators and ensuring accountability was given particular emphasis. 
</p>
<p>13. Dowry-related killings of women, suicides and self-immolation (South Asia), 
killings of women as a result of intimate partner violence (Europe), killings of women 
accused of sorcery and witchcraft (Africa and the Pacific), honour-related killings of 
women (Middle East and North Africa) and extreme forms of gender-motivated killings of 
women (femicides) in Latin America were among the different manifestations discussed in 
this session. Participants also examined gender-motivated killings of women on the basis of 
sexual orientation and identity and ethnic or racial origins and in the context of armed 
conflict, underscoring the emphasis of the mandate on the multiple forms and 
intersectionality of discrimination and violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Manifestations and causes of gender-motivated killings: regional contexts 
</b></p>
<p>14. The presentation on South Asia noted that, despite progress in criminal law reform, 
the failure to comprehensively address strong patriarchal values, the high premium on 
women&#8217;s chastity and the subordination of women remains a key factor in the prevalence of 
</p>
<p>gender-motivated killings of women in the region. As an example, despite the prohibition 
of dowry in the Penal Code of India, the reported number of dowry-related deaths of 
women had significantly increased from 4,836 (1990) to 8,383 (2009). The limited impact 
of criminalization in efforts to eradicate killings was also noted in the very low conviction 
rate (10 per cent). Suicides by women were reported to have become a &#8220;pan-South Asian 
trend&#8221;, with suicide due to domestic abuse, forced marriages, the casting out of widows and 
lack of inheritance rights emerging as the leading cause of death among Nepalese women in 
the prime reproductive age group (in 2008/2009). In the region, honour killings, acid 
burning attacks, witch-hunting, foeticide, gender-based violence during caste and 
communal conflict were also discussed in the context of a lack of acceptance of girls in 
society and the absence of adequate family support. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>15. As regarded Europe, the presenter referred to the widespread prevalence of domestic 
violence in many member States of the European Union. According to statistics, one in four 
women had experienced domestic violence during their lives and only 7 per cent had 
reported violence to the police. It was noted that 70 per cent of women killed had been 
victims of intimate partner violence. The highest rates had been recorded in the Baltic 
States. Lengthy separation procedures (Spain) were identified as increasing the risk for 
tension between couples where the risk for re-victimization was particularly high. In Italy, 
it was highlighted that killings of women were perpetrated primarily by family members, 
while killings by former partners were reported to be on the increase, from 11 (2006) to 29 
cases (2011). The importance of using femicide as a criminological category in Europe and 
collecting data on femicide specifically to show that killing of women is a gender&#8211;related 
crime was emphasized. In the region, a key challenge to engender structural change at 
institutional and social levels concerned the need to move from a family-based approach to 
a gender one in addressing killings of women. Common indicators of violence against 
women, sensitization among women of their rights, combating gender stereotypes among 
members of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies were required for better 
implementation of due diligence obligations.  
</p>
<p>16. During the presentation on gender-motivated killings of women accused of sorcery 
and witchcraft, it was stated that such killings are based on beliefs in extra-natural causes of 
unexplainable deaths. Such killings are reportedly common in the case of Papua New 
Guinea and other Melanesian countries. In some parts of Papua New Guinea, they were 
reportedly on the increase. The gender-motivated aspects of such killings could be seen in 
the fact that women are six times more likely than men to be targeted. The particular 
vulnerability of certain groups of women (women marrying into another clan, widows or 
elderly women without family members to protect them, women born out of wedlock) was 
highlighted. Underlying socioeconomic factors were also referred to, with accusations 
made as a means to take over land, or based on other personal motivations. While these 
killings have been prosecuted under the Penal Code, legislation specifically criminalizing 
not only attacks on people accused of sorcery but also those practising sorcery (Sorcery Act 
of 1971) was regarded as problematic &#8211; as the focus was on the sorcerer as perpetrator and 
not on the alleged victims. Strengthening prosecution under the Penal Code was 
recommended, coupled with an urgent need to strengthen the capacity of the law 
enforcement agencies to respond to and investigate sorcery-related attacks.       
</p>
<p>17. The presentation on the phenomenon of the killing of girls and women accused of 
witchcraft in Africa was based on findings from Cameroon, the Central African Republic, 
Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon. While it was noted that such 
killings did not target women and girls disproportionately compared to men and boys, the 
underreporting of cases &#8211; most of which occur in remote and inaccessible areas &#8211; 
highlighted the need to analyse available data critically. To prevent and eliminate violence 
and killings perpetrated against women and girls accused of witchcraft, three areas were 
noted as particularly important: (a) regulating the role of and belief in traditional doctors 
and medicine; (b) addressing the practice of local Christian churches; and (c) enhancing the 
capacity of States to implement and enforce existing constitutional orders and legislation.  
</p>
<p>18. The significance of the evolving economic status of women and the sociopolitical 
context when examining gender-motivated killings of women was accentuated in the 
presentation on the killing of women in the name of honour. Using Lebanon as a case 
study, it was noted that the geographical location of judges had been an important factor in 
the prosecution of honour-based killings of women, with courts in urban areas being more 
prone to refuse notions related to honour. The importance of a comprehensive law on 
violence against women was becoming increasingly critical as &#8220;family femicide&#8221; or 
economically motivated killings of women were becoming more common than honour-
related killings. In that context, the presenter referred to the refusal, or difficulty, of men to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>adapt to the changing role of women in society and to &#8220;compromised manhood&#8221; in 
</p>
<p>situations of unemployment or infidelity, where the killing becomes a means to restore the 
&#8220;decorum&#8221; of that manhood. In a situation of weak State institutions due to civil war and 
political separatism along confessional lines, it was noted that women&#8217;s rights advocates 
</p>
<p>feared current attempts of religious groups to dilute the draft law on protection of women 
from family violence. 
</p>
<p>19. In examining extreme forms of gender-motivated killings in Latin America (using 
Central America and Mexico as case studies), the heightened vulnerability of women to 
violence and compounded discrimination, in contexts of poverty, fragile States and 
institutions, organized crime, narcotraffic, and a militarized post-conflict situation was 
emphasized. In several Central American countries, the prevalence of killing of women and 
girls had increased at an alarming rate compared to men, with the majority of victims 
representing young women from vulnerable and marginalized backgrounds. It was noted 
that most perpetrators were known to the victim with a corresponding negligent and passive 
social and judicial response. Killings were often perceived as &#8220;crimes of passion&#8221; or &#8220;gang-
related crimes&#8221;. The presentation also highlighted the systematic killings of women who 
</p>
<p>were abducted and disappeared for few days, tortured, sexually assaulted, murdered, 
mutilated and their corpses (or parts of them) dumped in the outskirts or empty wastelands 
of the city. In that regard, the presentation underlined the need to contextualize the 
intersection of acts of femicide with discrimination based on race, ethnicity, class, age, 
occupation, migration status and gender identity. As a positive development, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
against Women had prompted several States to pass legislation specifically criminalizing 
acts of femicide. Although laws penalizing femicide as a crime had been successfully 
passed in several Latin American countries, they reflected the lack of a common definition, 
with some penal codes referring to killings as intimate partner violence solely, while others 
included killings in the context of both private and public spheres. Application of laws 
remained weak, with impunity and lack of due diligence by the State to prevent femicide, 
protect women, investigate and punish perpetrators, and provide reparations to victims and 
their families prevailing. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Manifestations and causes of gender-motivated killings: specific contexts 
</b></p>
<p>20. The difficulty of gathering information on the prevalence and manifestations of 
gender-motivated killings of women was highlighted in the examination of gender-
motivated killings on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Reluctance to 
report such crimes due to stigma was particularly challenging. It was noted that this 
problem was compounded by the fact that many of such killings were concealed behind the 
shame that the perceived transgression of sexual identity was considered to bring about. 
While gender-motivated killings were a global phenomenon, the presentation underlined 
the importance of recognizing the different causes thereof, depending on the specific local, 
national or regional context. In that respect, in order for States to respond effectively, the 
importance of assessing prevailing stereotypes and addressing the social or cultural or 
economic factors and belief systems that underpinned such attitudes and values (including 
&#8220;honour&#8221;) was emphasized. The often aggravated nature of these killings, the prevalence of 
</p>
<p>violence and killings of that group of women in the family sphere and the social intolerance 
and harassment that might lead to suicides among lesbian, transgender and bisexual women 
were highlighted. Good practices and studies of the Council of Europe and the Organization 
of American States were referred to. 
</p>
<p>21. The intersectionality between discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity and 
violence against women, including killing and disappearances, was examined in the 
presentation on gender-motivated killings of indigenous women. Using Canada as a case </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>study, the weak law enforcement and judicial response to reported cases of disappearances 
and killings of Aboriginal women were explained in relation to the historical exclusion and 
social marginalization of the indigenous community. The importance of addressing the 
stereotyping of the lifestyle of Aboriginal women, among police and members of the 
judiciary in particular, and the discrepancies in, and the lack of, disaggregated data was 
identified as a critical factor in effectively responding to the phenomenon. The 
socioeconomic element was equally emphasized. It was noted that urban migration was 
forcing aboriginal women into homelessness and prostitution, thereby increasing their 
exposure to violence, abuse and harassment. In that vein, improving social programming 
was indicated as important as enhancing the capacity of the police to investigate and 
protect.  
</p>
<p>22. Another aspect noted at the expert meeting was the challenges in combating 
impunity for gender-motivated killings of women due to poor investigation and lack of 
prosecution in situations of armed conflict. The example of Afghanistan was referred to, 
where the impact of a recent law on elimination of violence against women was reportedly 
constrained by the lack of training on the law among judges and prosecutors. Further, the 
parallel application of customary and statutory judicial systems, and a general breakdown 
of the rule of law due to the conflict, jeopardized efforts to implement gender-sensitive and 
human-rights-friendly legislation. Participants also pointed to the need to ensure that 
protection of civilians was at the core of the rules of engagement of international troops in 
the light of the disproportionate killings of women and children by NATO forces during 
airstrikes and joint operations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Practice and jurisprudence on gender-motivated killings of women 
</b></p>
<p><b>from regional and international human rights bodies (session 2) 
</b></p>
<p>23. In examining the importance and challenges in the international human rights system 
of responding to gender-motivated killings of women, the meeting recalled the contribution 
of international human rights law in entrenching the principle of State responsibility for acts 
of violence against women. An important contribution in that regard was the recognition of 
all forms of violence against women as a form of discrimination, whether committed by 
private or public actors, and the obligation of States under the framework of the due 
diligence obligation. Ground-breaking case law from the Inter-American and European 
Court of Human Rights respectively and findings of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women that link violence and killings of women to patterns of 
institutional violence and structural discrimination were referred to in identifying the 
specific elements of States&#8217; due diligence obligation. The presentations underlined the 
importance of transformative reparations which provided the possibility of modifying the 
status quo of discrimination and oppression of women. It was noted that transformative 
reparations required a holistic approach by States which responded to violence against 
women perpetrated in the different spheres &#8211; from the family to the transnational area. 
Translating that approach to local and national settings through the effective 
implementation of recommendations from international and regional human rights bodies 
remained a challenge. 
</p>
<p>24. Approaches and recommendations of the United Nations treaty bodies on gender-
motivated killings of women was presented based on an analysis of concluding 
observations of the Committee against Torture, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights since 
</p><p>2000. It was noted that treaty bodies had addressed the issue of gender-motivated killings of 
women in the context of honour crimes, femicide, violent murders, ritual killings and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>killings of women accused of witchcraft, lynching and extrajudicial killings. The 
presentation highlighted that recommendations of the Committee against Torture and the 
Human Rights Committee tended to focus on legalistic and judicial aspects of States 
parties&#8217; due diligence obligation whereas the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child emphasized 
educational and awareness-raising measures, including the role of the media. Remaining 
gaps and challenges referred to included visibility of gender-motivated killings of women 
in the work of the treaty bodies, the absence of a definition of what constituted an effective 
investigation and the lack of an enforcement mechanism to ensure the implementation of 
treaty body recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. The overview of the work of United Nations special procedures &#8211; referring to the 
findings of the mandate holders on violence against women, torture and extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions &#8211; confirmed the main findings discussed in the expert 
meeting in terms of manifestations, prevalence, causes and challenges in response to 
gender-motivated killings. The main recommendations of the meeting concerned: (a) 
enhanced access to justice of women; (b) ending impunity of perpetrators; (c) disaggregated 
data collection; and (d) supporting national capacity and assistance. Remaining challenges 
in implementing the recommendations included the importance of follow-up to 
recommendations by the wider United Nations system, finding partners at the national level 
for effective implementation, reaching out to concerned populations in accessible language 
and format, and concerted and coordinated action among United Nations entities to end 
violence against women.  
</p>
<p>26. In examining the role of regional human rights mechanisms in combating gender-
motivated killings of women, it was noted that the Inter-American Court and Commission 
on Human Rights &#8211; while offering some of the most elaborate judgements clarifying States&#8217; 
obligations in regard to violence against women &#8211; had pronounced on human rights of 
women only recently. The presentation examined recent cases from the Inter-American 
system to shed light on the development of legal standards relating to violence against 
women, discrimination, due diligence and access to justice which, it noted, represented key 
areas related to gender-motivated killings of women. Three judgements of the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights which were considered to have set groundbreaking 
standards in the fields of due diligence, access to justice, and reparations for victims and 
their family members in cases of violence and discrimination against women were 
presented: <i>Gonz&#225;lez et al. </i>(&#8220;Cotton Field&#8221;) v. <i>Mexico</i> (2009), <i>Rosendo-Cant&#250; et al. v. 
Mexico</i> (2010), and <i>Fern&#225;ndez-Ortega et al. v. Mexico </i>(2010). The presenter also referred 
to the <i>Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales) et al </i>v. <i>United States of America</i> (2011) case in which 
the Inter-American Commission for the first time pronounced the issue of discrimination 
against women under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (1948) 
and its close link to violence against women. Echoing discussions pursued at the meeting, it 
was noted that positive change at national level through compliance with judgements 
required political will of States, engaging civil society in advocacy and compliance 
strategies, the need to start implementation immediately and the provision of technical 
support to States.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>Participants of the expert group meeting identified a number of concerns, 
challenges and recommendations relating to gender-motivated killings of women and 
</b></p>
<p>States&#8217; responsibility to prevent, respond to and provide remedies for these human 
</p>
<p><b>rights violations. These will be explored and developed in depth in the report of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council at its twentieth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/HRC/20/16).   
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>The killing of women because they are women is a global phenomenon. In some 
parts of the world, gender-motivated killings of women are on the increase. They are 
</b></p>
<p><b>often located at the end of a continuum of violence against women, set against general 
</b></p>
<p><b>patterns of discrimination against women and tolerated impunity of perpetrators. 
</b></p>
<p><b>While manifestations, prevalence and causes differ between regions in response to 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific local contexts, many similarities exist. Notably, the meeting accentuated the 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular vulnerability of certain groups of women to gender-motivated killings due 
</b></p>
<p><b>to the intersectionality between discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity, race, 
</b></p>
<p><b>beliefs, sexual orientation, social status, migration or other status, on the one hand, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and violence against women, on the other. The meeting confirmed that the violent 
</b></p>
<p><b>nature of killings often included sexual violence.  
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>Presentations indicated that the majority of gender-motivated killings of 
women were perpetrated by intimate partners or close family members. That points to 
</b></p>
<p><b>an urgent need to reinforce the obligations of States obligations under international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law to prevent and respond to violations occurring in the private sphere.    
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>Furthermore, changing social norms, value systems and perceptions is as 
important as developing and enforcing comprehensive legislation on gender equality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the status of women in society and violence against women. To combat gender-
</b></p>
<p><b>motivated killings both processes must follow in parallel, and start without delay. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>meeting highlighted the limited impact of legislative reform unless accompanied by 
</b></p>
<p><b>transformative policies which addressed both the socioeconomic disempowerment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and discriminatory stereotyping and attitudes vis-&#224;-vis women, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>among members of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies. As an illustration, 
</b></p>
<p>legislation criminalizing &#8220;femicide&#8221; as a specific offence will prove toothless as long as 
</p>
<p><b>killings of women by intimate partners are regarded as crimes provoked by jealousy 
</b></p>
<p>or by &#8220;sexually aggressive&#8221; women. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>The expert meeting noted the need for further regional debates and a common 
understanding and streamlined definition of key concepts, such as femicide and 
</b></p>
<p><b>feminicide. While seen as positive steps, different approaches in domestic legislation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>some Latin American countries were noted, including where some referred to 
</b></p>
<p><b>femicide as killings as a result of intimate partner violence in the private sphere, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>others encompassed the public sphere </b>&#8211;<b> killer(s) unknown to the victim and with 
</b></p>
<p>evidence of extreme violence in women&#8217;s bodies. Participants concurred on the 
</p>
<p><b>importance of legislation that distinguished gender-based and gender-motivated 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings of women from other gender-neutral homicides of women. Clear and 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforceable provisions in this regard are critical in order to establish patterns and 
</b></p>
<p><b>design appropriate and effective responses to eliminate violence and gender-motivated 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings of women.  
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>All interventions concurred on the paucity of data and/or lack of sex and race-
disaggregated data on gender-motivated killings of women as a key challenge. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>meeting acknowledged the problem of gross underreporting of violence against and 
</b></p>
<p><b>killings of women. Linked to social stigma and fear among victims, and also poor 
</b></p>
<p><b>criminal investigations, underreporting highlights the need for a multifaceted and 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive approach to eliminating gender-motivated killings of women. This 
</b></p>
<p>includes the need to enhance women&#8217;s knowle<b>dge and awareness of their rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>recourse to protection mechanisms and remedies and the importance of strengthening 
</b></p>
<p>States&#8217; technical capacity to effectively investigate, prosecute and punish all acts of 
</p>
<p><b>violence against women, as well as to provide reparations to victims and their families 
</b></p>
<p><b>in line with their due diligence obligation.   </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/16/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>33. Strengthening States&#8217; capacity to end violence and killings of women engages 
<b>the responsibility of many actors. This includes the promotion and change of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>mindset of society, the media, public authorities and prosecutors in order to stop the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recurrence of blaming the victim and/or their families for these crimes. The meeting 
</b></p>
<p><b>noted the importance of responsible media reporting, engagement of civil society and 
</b></p>
<p><b>partnerships across international, regional, national and local bodies. Effective follow-
</b></p>
<p><b>up and implementation of recommendations of international and regional human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights bodies depend on such alliances.  
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>Ultimately, however, ending gender-motivated killings of women will be 
successful only to the extent that States exercise political will and responsive 
</b></p>
<p>leadership. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s proposed holistic framework to ending violence 
</p>
<p><b>against women (set forth in A/66/215) should be a point of departure in this regard. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires a comprehensive approach based on full implementation of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights standards, without discrimination.  </b></p>
