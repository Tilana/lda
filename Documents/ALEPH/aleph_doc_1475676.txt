Management’s Discussion and Analysis
As used in this quarterly report: (i) the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and the “Company” mean Ruby Creek Resources 
Inc.;  (ii)  “SEC”  refers  to  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission;  (iii)  “Exchange Act”  refers  to the  Securities 
Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended;  and  (iv)  all  dollar  amounts  refer  to  United  States  dollars  unless  otherwise

The following discussion of our plan of operations, results of operations and financial condition as at and for the 
comparative three month period ended November 30, 2008 should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim 
financial statements and related notes for the comparative three month periods ended November 30, 2008 included 
in this quarterly report.
Overview
We were incorporated on May 3, 2006 under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada.  On July 15, 
2006 we acquired an option to acquire a group of eight mining exploration claims located in north western British 
Columbia.    The  property  is  also  known  as  the  More  Creek  property.    To  date,  we  have  not  discovered  an 
economically  viable  mineral  deposit  on  the  optioned  mineral  properties,  and  there  is  no  assurance  that  we  will 
discover one.
We  are  considered  an  exploration  or  exploratory  stage  company  as  we  are  involved  in  the  examination  and 
investigation of land that we believe may contain valuable minerals, for the purpose of discovering the presence of 
ore, if any, and its extent.  There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our 
optioned mining properties, and a great deal of further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the 
economic and legal feasibility for our future exploration is determined. We have no known reserves of any type of 
mineral.
Our  office  is  located  at  Suite  400,  409  Granville  Street,  Vancouver,  British  Columbia,  Canada,  V6C  1T2;  our 
telephone number is (604) 633-9768.
We  have  no  revenues,  have  achieved  losses  since  inception  and  rely  upon  the  sale  of  our  securities  to  fund  our 
operations.  Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We will 
not generate revenues even if our exploration program indicates that a mineral deposit may exist on our optioned 
mineral  claims.    Accordingly,  we  will  be  dependent  on  future  additional  financing  in  order  to  maintain  our 
operations and continue our exploration activities.
We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties.  We acquired 
the  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in eight  mineral  claims  (the  “More  Creek  properties”)  located  in  the  Iskut 
River region of northern British Columbia, Canada, covering an area of approximately 2,919 hectares pursuant to an 
option  agreement  dated  July  15,  2006  and  amended  on  August  15,  2006  and  further  amended  on  July  9,  2008.  
Pursuant to this option agreement, we have the exclusive option to earn a 100% interest in and to these eight mineral 
claims, subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty payable to the optionor, in exchange for making cash payments 
totalling CDN$100,000 (US$85,682 based on the exchange rate of CDN$1.1671 : US$1.00 on January 6, 2009) to 
the optionor over a four-year period as follows:  CDN$2,500 paid on October 15, 2006; CDN$2,000 paid on April 
15, 2008; CDN$1,500 paid on September 30, 2008; CDN$6,500 payable on or before March 1, 2009, CDN$3,000 
payable on or before June 30, 2009; CDN$12,000 payable on or before July 31, 2009; CDN$20,000 payable on or 
before November 30, 2009; and a final payment of CDN$52,500 payable on or before November 30, 2010.
Each of our optioned mineral claims is in good standing with the Province of British Columbia until July 10, 2009.  
The formal property owner, Mr. von Einsiedel’s ownership in these mineral claims will expire on July 10, 2009.  
Mineral claims of this type may be extended either by completing sufficient work and filing a report on the work 
completed on the mineral property with the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines, or by paying a filing 
fee in lieu of performing the exploration work.
2904654.1

In order to maintain the mineral claims in good standing after July 10, 2009, the Company (on behalf of the claim 
owner)  must  complete  annual  labour  or  exploration  expenditures  on  the  mineral  claims  and  file  confirmation  of 
work with the applicable mining recording office of the Province of British Columbia. Currently, exploration work 
with a minimum value of CDN$11,676 for the property is required before the 10th of every July.  If the Company 
does not complete this minimum amount of exploration work by July 10, 2009, the Company (on behalf of the claim 
owner)  will  be  required  to  pay  a  fee  in  lieu  of  exploration  work  in  the  amount  of  CDN$4.00  per  hectare,  or 
approximately CDN$11,676 in total, to the Province of British Columbia.  If the Company fails to make and file the 
work expenditures or, alternatively, make the appropriate payments to the Province of British Columbia in lieu of 
exploration  expenditures,  Mr.  von  Einsiedel  will  lose  all  interest  the  mineral  claims  that  are  the  subject  of  our 
option.
Our optioned mineral claims presently do not have any proven mineral reserves.  The property that is the subject of 
our mineral claim is undeveloped and does not contain any open-pit or underground mines.  There is no plant or 
equipment located on the property that is the subject of the mineral claim.
Between July 15 and September 30, 2006, we retained Mr. von Einsiedel, a consulting geologist, to complete the 
initial stages of a work program consisting of Landsat 7 alteration imaging, compilation of all available geological 
data,  preparation  of  detailed  base  topographic  maps  and  a  site  examination  to  confirm  the  published  technical 
information.    The  total  cost  of  the  work  completed  was  CDN$10,290  (US$8,816  based  on  the  exchange  rate  of 
US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009).
We obtained a geological report on our optioned mineral claims prepared by Mr. von Einsiedel, dated October 15, 
2006.  This report was based on information on the mineral claims included in the public domain, geologic maps, 
geological survey data and from Mr. von Einsiedel’s geological experience in the area.  Mr. von Einsiedel’s report 
outlined  a  recommended  phased  exploration  program  on  our  optioned  mineral  claims,  including  a  phase  one 
exploration work program consisting of geochemical surveys to determine if there are overburden covered zones of 
porphyry style copper gold mineralization present within the claim area.
We retained Mr. von Einsiedel to conduct the first phase of the recommended exploration program between June 
and October 2007.  The cost of this exploration program was CDN$17,000 (US$14,566 based on the exchange rate 
of US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009).The phase one work that was carried out involved several helicopter-
supported, recon sampling traverses that were made to the More Creek property with the objective of identifying 
porphyry style copper - gold mineralization.  Approximately 60% of the claim area now has at least widely spaced 
sample coverage.  Considering the large size of porphyry type copper gold systems, the recon program completed at 
More Creek was designed to provide an indication as to whether or not a porphyry system exists on the subject 
property.
In addition to this phase one work, subsequent to the Company’s filing of an Assessment Report with the British 
Columbia government in early 2008, new historic data was found (by way of an additional literature search) that 
covered the More Creek property.  This data was from a large survey performed in 1990.  The reason that it had not 
been previously found was that the assessment report for this survey was plotted in MapBC, a long distance from the 
More Creek property.  The program was extensive and was covered in two separate assessment reports.  The work 
covered  all  drainages  and  included  several  transects  throughout  the  property.    Soil,  silt  and  float  samples  were 
collected.    This  data  showed  only  several  weak  widespread  anomalies  which  did  not  indicate  the  presence  of  a 
significant porphyry body.  Of note  is that this 1990 survey showed two float samples in the eastern drainage that 
graded 1900 and 530 ppb gold.  These float samples were of quartz carbonate vein within grey sediments.
Mr. von Einsiedel provided the Company with a report on this phase one property work on July 2, 2008.  This report 
concluded that the available data, which includes both the 2007 data and  historical sampling data, identified several 
weakly anomalous sites but did not identify any strongly anomalous sites.  Although much of the property is heavily 
overburden covered, the recon program should have been able to identify any large, near surface mineralized zones 
present within the areas sampled.  The weakly anomalous sample results that were identified, although interesting, 
are too low to be indicative of “in situ” mineralization.  In this report, Mr. von Einsiedel indicated that the origin of 
the  gold  bearing  float  samples  within  the  eastern  portion  of  the  property  will  be  a  key  aspect  of  any  future 
exploration program.  While any exploration team is on the property, it is recommended that the source of the three 
main areas with gold, copper and/or arsenic anomalies that were identified within the western portion of the property 
be investigated.  An advantage for the next program is that there is now road access to near the southern boundary of
2904654.1
9
the  property  as  the  Teck  Cominco-Novagold  road  has  been  completed  to  within  1  kilometer  of  the  property 
(therefore there will be no – or minimal – helicopter usage).
Although  no  specific  definitive  results  were  identified  during  the  2007  work  program,  the  work  itself  was  not 
detailed  in  terms  of  the  entire  property.    We  believe  that  the  historical  data  that  Mr.  von  Einsiedel  discovered 
indicates  a  number  of  interesting  and  promising  mineralization  indications.  As  a  result,  our  board  of  directors 
decided  to  retain  our  option  agreement  with  respect  to  the  More  Creek  property  and  continue  with  a  phase  two 
program as recommended by Mr. von Einsiedel.
On July 10, 2008 we requested that Mr. von Einsiedel prepare a proposal to carry out the planned phase two work.  
We  received  the  proposal  from  Mr.  von  Einsiedel  on  September  4,  2008,  which  recommended  a  program  to 
concentrate on specific high-opportunity areas.  To evaluate these areas, Mr. Von Einsiedel recommended that we 
complete a minimum 10-day field program with at least one geologist and an experienced prospector.  He quoted a 
cost estimate of $21,800 (US$18,678 based on the exchange rate of US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009), as 
follows: 
 
Crew mobilization: Vancouver to Bob Quin   
 
Helicopter usage (allow minimum 4 hours) 
Crew wages 
 
 
Crew accommodation (on site fly camp) 
 
Assays (allow 100 samples) 
 
 
Report preparation 
Total:
CDN$    2,000.00 
                   CDN      4,800.00 
 
     CDN      9,000.00 
                   CDN      2,500.00 
     CDN      2,500.00 
 
     CDN      1,000.00 
 
 
    CDN   $21,800.00
In the event that Mr. Von Einsiedel’s personnel are allowed to use the new access road, the costs of the program 
could be reduced by as much as 25% as this would eliminate the requirement to utilize any helicopter time.  If this is 
the  case  the  estimated  cost  of  the  program,  including  the  required  cash  in  lieu  payment  would  be  CDN$18,500 
(US$15,851 based on the exchange rate of US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009).
Mr. von Einsiedel concluded that in the event that the phase two program is able to delineate a target area or areas 
that  exhibit  a  co-incident  geochemical  and  geophysical  response,  a  next  phase  program  consisting  of  detailed 
geochemical surveys and ground geophysical surveys would be warranted in a phase three program.  He estimated 
the cost of this program to be approximately CDN$115,000 (US$98,534 based on the exchange rate of US$1.00 : 
CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009), but he did not provide a specific break-down of these costs.
In order to fulfill certain disclosure requirements in Canada, we requested George A. Nicholson, P. Geo., to prepare 
a technical report with respect to our optioned mineral properties in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 of 
the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators,  Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects  (“NI  43-101”).    Mr. 
Nicholson’s report, dated November 27, 2008, concludes that the geological setting of the More Creek property is 
prospective for the occurrence of alkalic, porphyry style copper-gold mineralization.  He reported that the results of 
the exploration work and geochemical sampling conducted by Ruby Creek and a previous operator have identified 
several  areas  which  exhibit  elevated  copper,  gold  and/or  arsenic  levels  in  soil  and/or  rock  samples  that  warrant 
additional exploration.  Mr. Nicholson’s technical report identifies the highest priority areas as “Copper Anomaly 
No. 2” located in the south central part of the More Creek property and “Gold Anomaly No. 2” located in the east 
central part of the More Creek property.   
 
Mr. Nicholson’s technical report recommends the same initial follow-up (phase two) exploration work program as 
set forth in Mr. Einsiedel’s report as described above at the same estimated cost of CDN$21,800.   
 
Contingent  on  the  results  of  such  initial  follow-up  exploration  work,  the  Mr.  Nicholson’s  technical  report 
recommends follow-up exploration work (phase three) at an estimated cost of CDN$87,000 (US$74,543 based on 
the exchange rate of US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009), which is less than Mr. Einsiedel’s estimated cost 
for  phase  three  follow-up  exploration  work  of  CDN$115,000.    Mr.  Nicholson’s  report  provides  the  following 
estimated cost break down for such follow-up work:

                       CDN$12,500 
                       CDN$12,500 
  CDN$10,000 
CDN$87,000
Because of early winter weather in the More Creek area, the phase two program will not be able to be carried out 
until the second quarter of 2009.  We intend to raise additional financing with which to carry out this program.
Plan of Operations
Our plan of operations for the next twelve months is to complete the following objectives within the time periods 
specified,  subject  to  our  obtaining  the  funding  necessary  for  the  continued  exploration  of  our  optioned  mineral 
claims:
1.   We intend to proceed with phase two of a recommended exploration program.  At present we estimate that 
a phase two program would cost approximately CDN$18,500 to CDN$21,800 (US$15,851 to US$18,678 
based on the exchange rate of US$1.00 : CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009).  We plan to complete phase 
two in May 2009.
2.  Upon completion of phase two, our Board of Directors will make a determination whether to proceed with 
the  third  phase  of  the  recommended  work  program,  which  is  currently  estimated  to  cost  approximately 
CDN$87,000  to  CDN$115,000  (US$74,543  to  US$98,534  based  on  the  exchange  rate  of  US$1.00  : 
CDN$1.1671 on January 6, 2009).
3.   We  anticipate  spending  approximately  $20,000  for  management  and  consulting  services  and  $60,000  in 
ongoing general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months. Our general and administrative 
expenses for the year will consist primarily of professional fees for the audit and legal work relating to our 
regulatory  filings  throughout  the  year,  as  well  as  transfer  agent  fees,  annual  prospect  lease  fees, 
management fees and general office expenses.
As  such,  we  estimate  that  our  total  expenditures  over  the  next  twelve  months  will  be  approximately  $95,851  to 
$98,678.    This  estimate  does  not  take  into  account  estimated  expenditures  with  respect  to  phase  three  of  our 
exploration  program,  as  this  phase  is  contingent  on  the  results  of  phase  two  and  on  our  receipt  of  sufficient 
financing.    If  we  were  to  complete  phase  two  and  three  during  the  next  twelve  months,  our  total  estimated 
expenditures for that period would be approximately $170,394 to $197,212.
Based on the nature of our business, we anticipate incurring operating losses in the foreseeable future. We base this 
expectation,  in  part,  on  the  fact  that  very  few  mineral  claims  in  the  exploration  stage  ultimately  develop  into 
producing,  profitable  mines.    Our future financial  results  are  also uncertain  due  to  a number of factors, some  of 
which are outside our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
our ability to raise additional funding;
the market price for copper and gold;
the results of our proposed exploration programs on the mineral property; and
our ability to find joint venture partners for the development of our property interests.
2904654.1
11
Due  to our  lack  of operating  history  and  present  inability  to  generate  revenues,  our  auditors have  stated  in  their 
report for our most recent fiscal year end that there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going 
concern.  Even if we complete our current exploration program and it is successful in identifying a mineral deposit, 
we will have to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we will know if we have a 
commercially viable mineral deposit or reserve.
Form S-4 filing
We are currently incorporated under the corporate laws of British Columbia, Canada.  In August 2008, we filed a 
Form S-4 with the SEC in which we proposed changing our jurisdiction of incorporation from British Columbia to 
Nevada through a process known as a conversion under Nevada corporate law, and known as a continuation under 
Canadian corporate law (the “Continuation” or the “Conversion”).  A continuation or conversion is a process by 
which a corporation which is not incorporated under the laws of Nevada may change its jurisdiction of incorporation 
to Nevada.  Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, if the laws of its home jurisdiction allow for it, a company may be 
“converted” to a Nevada corporation by filing Articles of Conversion with the Nevada Secretary of State under the 
Nevada Revised Statutes.  In order to give effect to the Continuation, our board of directors has adopted a plan of 
conversion  (the  “Plan  of  Conversion”)  and  has  recommended  that  stockholders  approve  and  adopt  this  Plan  of 
Conversion. After the completion of the Continuation, Ruby Creek will be a Nevada corporation governed by the 
Nevada  Revised  Statutes.    We  will  continue  to  conduct  the  business  in  which  we  are  currently  engaged.    The 
Continuation will not result in any material effect on our operations.  The business and operations of Ruby Creek 
following the Continuation will be identical in most respects to our current business, except that we will no longer 
be  subject  to  the  corporate  laws  of  British  Columbia  but  will  be  subject  to  the  Nevada  Revised  Statutes.    Upon 
effectiveness  of  the  Continuation,  Ruby  Creek  (Nevada)  will  be  liable  for  all  the  debts  and  obligations  of  Ruby 
Creek (BC), and the officers and directors of Ruby Creek (BC) will become the officers and directors of Ruby Creek 
(Nevada).  The differences between the laws will not materially affect our business but will affect certain of rights of 
stockholders.  The differences between the applicable laws of the two jurisdictions are discussed in greater detail 
under the section of our Form S-4 proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparative Rights of Stockholders”.
In addition, we are proposing to change our authorized share capital from unlimited common shares without par 
value  to  500,000,000  common  shares  with  a  par  value  of  $0.001  per  share  (the  “Change  in  Authorized  Share 
Capital”).  The purpose of this proposed Change in Authorized Share Capital is to comply with Nevada corporate 
law and practice, which we believe does not provide for unlimited authorized share capital.  In response to SEC 
comments, we filed with the SEC an amended Form S-4 on October 9, 2008 and a further amended Form S-4 on 
December 3, 2008.
The SEC declared our Form S-4 registration statement effective on December 18, 2008.  Proxy documentation was 
sent to all shareholders of our Company as of the record date of December 17, 2008 and the shareholder meeting 
which  will  consider  the  motion  to  continue  our  Company  from  British  Columbia  to  Nevada  and  change  our 
authorized share capital to 500,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share, is scheduled for 10:00 
a.m. on January 13, 2009 at our legal representative’s offices at Suite #1500, 1055 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, 
BC, Canada.
Financial Condition
At November 30, 2008, we had cash of $17,641 and a negative working capital position of $32,469.
Accordingly, we have insufficient funds to enable us to complete the second phase of our exploration program (at an 
estimated cost of $15,851 to $18,678 ) and have insufficient funds to satisfy our on-going general and administrative 
expenses over the next twelve months (estimated at $80,000).  During the twelve-month period following the date of 
this report, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenues.  As such, we will be required to obtain additional 
financing in order to complete our planned operations over the next twelve months plus the costs of phase three of 
our exploration program of $74,543 to $98,534 and any additional exploration of our optioned mineral claims to 
determine whether any mineral deposit exists on these claims.
2904654.1
12
We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration as we do not 
have tangible assets to secure any debt financing.  We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity 
financing from the sale of our common stock.  We are in the process of raising funds through a private placement 
offering of our shares of common stock.  However, there can be no assurance that we will complete the private 
placement or that the funds raised will be sufficient for us to pay our expenses beyond the next twelve months.  In 
the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue exploration of any future mineral claims and our 
business plan will fail.  Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund an exploration program, there 
is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced exploration of any mineral claims 
we  may  acquire.   If  we  do not  continue  to obtain  additional financing,  we will  be forced  to  abandon  any future 
mineral claims that we may acquire and our plan of operations.
We may consider entering into a joint venture partnership by linking with a major resource company to provide the 
required funding  to  complete  further  exploration programs.  We have not undertaken  any  efforts  to  locate  a joint 
venture partner; however, if we enter into a joint venture arrangement, we will assign a percentage of our interest in 
our mineral claims to the joint venture partner.
Results of Operations for the Three Month period ended November 30, 2008
Revenues
Other  than  minimal  interest  revenues  earned  from  term  deposits,  we  have  had  no  operating  revenues  since  our 
inception on May 3, 2006 to November 30, 2008.  We anticipate that we will not generate any revenues for so long 
as we are an exploration stage company.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses for the three month periods ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, as well as 
the total of these expenses since our inception on May 3, 2006, are summarized below:

Expenses for the three month period ended November 30, 2008 totalled $65,111 and were primarily comprised of 
professional  fees  (audit  and  legal  costs)  which  totalled  $49,991.  These  costs  included  year  end  Form  10-K 
preparation  and  filing  as  well  as  filing  expenses  related  to  the  Form  S-4  filing  with  the  SEC.  The  expenses  for 
professional fees for the comparable period in 2007 were $3,807.  Management services costs were $1,938 in the 
current  three  month  period  and  $9,280  in  the  2007  comparable  period.  Office  and  general  expenses  (consisting 
primarily  of  office  rent  and  telecommunication  costs)  were  $9,685  during  the  current  three  month  period  as 
compared to $1,708 in the prior year period.
2904654.1

Net Loss
We had a net loss of $65,111 in the three months ended November 30, 2008 as compared to a net loss of $16,450 in 
the comparable 2007 three month period. Losses increased primarily as a result of an increase in professional fees 
between the two periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We had cash of $17,641 and a negative working capital position of $32,469 at November 30, 2008.
We estimate that our total expenditures over the next twelve months will be approximately $95,851 to $98,678, as 
outlined  above  under  the  heading  “Plan  of  Operations”.  This  estimate  does  not  take  into  account  estimated 
expenditures with respect to phase three of our exploration program, as this phase is contingent on the results of 
phase two and on our receipt of sufficient financing.  If we were to complete phase two and three during the next 
twelve months, our total estimated expenditures for that period would be approximately $170,394 to $197, 212. At 
the present time, we have insufficient cash to proceed with phase two of our recommended work program, and we 
will be required to obtain additional financing to proceed with phase two and phase three of the recommended work 
program, as these expenditures will exceed our current cash reserves.
Cash from Operating Activities
Cash  used  in  operating  activities  was  $56,823  during  the  three  month  period  ended  November  30,  2008,  as 
compared to $18,756 during the three month period ended November 30, 2007.  Cash used in operating activities 
from our inception on May 3, 2006 to November 30, 2008 was $255,722.
Cash from Financing Activities
We have funded our business to date primarily from sales of our common stock.  From our inception on May 3, 
2006 to November 30, 2008, we raised a total of approximately $280,200 from private offerings of our securities.  
During the three months ended November 30, 2008, no net cash was provided by financing activities from sale of 
our  securities.  We  had  expenditures  of  $1,728  for  purchase  of  office  equipment  and  a  payment  for  our  mineral 
property interest.
There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of 
additional financing.  If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we 
will not be able to continue our exploration of the prospect lease and our venture will fail.
Going Concern 
 
We are in the exploration stage and have not generated revenues since inception. We have incurred significant losses to 
date and further losses are anticipated raising substantial doubt about the ability of our Company to continue operating 
as  a  going  concern.  The  continuation  of  our  Company  as  a  going  concern  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  obtain 
necessary  equity  financing  to  continue  operations  and  to  determine  the  existence,  discovery  and  successful 
exploitation of economically recoverable reserves on its resource properties and ultimately on the attainment of future 
profitable  operations.    We  are  currently  negotiating  with  three  shareholders  and  new  investors  on  private  equity 
and/or convertible debt financing which would provide sufficient working capital to finance our operations for the 
next  twelve  months.  As  at  November  30,  2008,  we  had  accumulated  losses  of  $309,278  since  inception.    These 
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts 
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.
Future Financings
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business 
operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance
2904654.1
14
that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our 
planned exploration activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future 
effect  on  our  financial  condition,  changes  in  financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations, 
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States 
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis.  The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and 
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the 
reporting periods.
We  regularly  evaluate  the  accounting  policies  and  estimates  that  we  use  to  prepare  our  consolidated  financial 
statements.  In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party 
professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.  
Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  requires 
management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and 
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of 
revenues and expenses during the period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Mineral Property Costs 
Pursuant  to  EITF  04-2,  we  classified  our  mineral  rights  as  tangible  assets  and  accordingly  acquisition  costs  are 
capitalized  as  mineral  property  costs.    Generally  accepted  accounting  principles  require  that  long-lived  assets  be 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset 
may  not  be  recoverable.    In  performing  the  review  for  recoverability,  we  are  to  estimate  the  future  cash  flows 
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected 
future  cash  flows  is  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized.    Mineral 
exploration costs are expensed as incurred until commercially mineable deposits are determined to exist within a 
particular property.  Accordingly, we have expensed all mineral exploration costs. 
To date we have not established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties.  
 
We have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” which establishes 
standards  for  the  initial  measurement  and  subsequent  accounting  for  obligations  associated  with  the  sale, 
abandonment,  or  other  disposal  of  long-term  tangible  assets  arising  from  the  acquisition,  construction  or 
development and for normal operations of such assets. As of November 30, 2008, any potential costs related to the 
retirement of our mineral property interests have not yet been determined.
Foreign Currency Translation 
The  financial  statements  are  presented  in  United  States  dollars.    In  accordance  with  Statement  of  Financial 
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”, foreign denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities are translated to their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the 
balance sheet date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the transaction date.  Revenue and expenses 
are  translated  at  average  rates  of  exchange  during  the  year.    Related  translation  adjustments  are  reported  as  a
2904654.1
15
separate component of stockholders’ equity, whereas gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are 
included in results of operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
In  December  2007,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  141  (Revised)  “Business  Combinations”.  SFAS  141  (Revised) 
establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial 
statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. 
The  statement  also  provides  guidance  for  recognizing  and  measuring  the  goodwill  acquired  in  the  business 
combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the 
nature  and  financial  effects  of  the  business  combination.  The  guidance  will  become  effective  for  the  fiscal  year 
beginning  after  December  15,  2008.  Management  is  in  the  process  of  evaluating  the  impact,  if  any,  SFAS  141 
(Revised) will have on our financial statements upon adoption.
In  January  2008,  Staff  Accounting  Bulletin  (“SAB”)  110,  “Share-Based  Payment”  was  issued.   Registrants  may 
continue, under certain circumstances, to use the simplified method in developing estimates of the expected term of 
share options as initially allowed by SAB 107, “Share-Based Payment”. The adoption of SAB 110 should have no 
effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
("SFAS  161").  SFAS  161  is  intended  to  improve  financial  reporting  about  derivative  instruments  and  hedging 
activities  by  requiring  enhanced  disclosures  to  enable  investors  to  better  understand  their  effects  on  an  entity's 
financial  position,  financial  performance,  and  cash  flows.  SFAS  161  achieves  these  improvements  by  requiring 
disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. It also provides 
more information about an entity's liquidity by requiring disclosure of derivative features that are credit risk-related. 
Finally,  it  requires  cross-referencing  within  footnotes  to  enable  financial  statement  users  to  locate  important 
information about derivative instruments. SFAS 161 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years 
and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008, and will be adopted by our Company beginning in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect there to be any significant impact of adopting SFAS 161 on its financial 
position, cash flows and results of operations.
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“SFAS 
No.  162”).  SFAS  No.  162  is  intended  to  improve  financial  reporting  by  identifying  a  consistent  framework,  or 
hierarchy,  for  selecting  accounting  principles  to  be  used  in  preparing  financial  statements  that  are  presented  in 
conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  nongovernmental  entities.  SFAS  No.  162  is 
effective  60  days  following  the  SEC's  approval  of  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  Auditing 
amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles.  We do not expect there to be any significant impact of adopting SFAS 162 on its financial position, cash 
flows and results of operations. 
 
Item 3.  
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and 
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph 
(b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, due to certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.  
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Controls and Procedures.
As  previously  disclosed  in  our  annual  report  on  Form  10-K  for  our  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  2008,  our 
management  conducted  an  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting as of August 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by 
the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (“COSO”).    As  a  result  of  this
2904654.1
16
assessment, our management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of August 
31, 2008, specifically:
•  Lack of Appropriate Independent Oversight.  The Board of Directors has not provided an appropriate level 
of  oversight  of  the  Company’s  financial  reporting  and  procedures  for  internal  control  over  financial 
reporting, including appropriate authorization of transactions.  Throughout the fiscal year ended August 31, 
2008,  the  Company  engaged  in  a  number  of  related  party  transactions  in  which  the  individual  who 
authorized the transactions for either party was common to both parties.   As of August 31, 2008, and as at 
November  30,  2008,  there  were  no  independent  Directors  who  could  provide  an  appropriate  level  of 
oversight, including challenging management’s accounting for and reporting of the transactions.
•  Lack  of  Segregation  of  Duties.    Our  management  determined  that,  as  of  August  31,  2008,  we  lacked 
segregation  of  duties  in  the  period-end  financial  reporting  process.   The  Company  has  historically  had 
limited  accounting  and  minimal  operating  revenue  and,  as  such,  all  accounting  and  financial  reporting 
operations have been performed by one individual who works for the Company on a consulting basis.  As 
of August 31, 2008, the consultant was the only individual with any significant knowledge of generally 
accepted accounting principles.  The consultant was also the only individual in charge of the general ledger 
(including  the  preparation  of  routine  and  non-routine  journal  entries),  the  preparation  of  accounting 
reconciliations, the selection of accounting principles, and the preparation of interim and annual financial 
statements (including footnote disclosures) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  In 
addition, management determined that as of August 31, 2008, the lack of additional staff with significant 
knowledge of generally accepted accounting principles resulted in ineffective oversight and monitoring of 
the work performed by the Company’s financial consultant.
At the time of filing of this quarterly report, we are actively negotiating with a number of third parties regarding 
consenting to act as independent directors for our Company in order to mitigate lack of independent oversight.  It is 
our objective to add a minimum of two additional directors to our Board of Directors prior to the end of the third 
quarter of our 2009 fiscal year.  We believe that the likely costs related to the addition of new directors will not be 
material.
During  the  quarter  ended  November  30,  2008,  we  hired,  on  a  fee  basis,   an  independent  Certified  General 
Accountant  to  prepare  our  general  ledger  and  other  financial  records  for  reporting  periods.    This  individual  was 
previously  retained  to  assist  in  the  preparation  of  our  2008  year  end  internal  control  analysis  on  an  independent 
basis.  The fee costs for the financial record completion are estimated to be $1,500 per quarter.  The recruitment of 
an  independent  Certified  General  Accountant  to  prepare  our  financial  reporting  records  has  now  segregated  the 
duties  of  actual  cash  control  from  the  financial  statement  preparation.   As  a  result,  the  consultant  (who  was 
previously  the  only  individual  with  any  significant  knowledge  of  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as 
discussed above), is no longer the only individual with any significant knowledge of generally accepted accounting 
principles and is also no longer the only  individual in charge of activities with the general ledger (including the 
preparation of routine and non-routine journal entries), the preparation of accounting reconciliations, the selection of 
accounting  principles,  and  the  preparation  of  interim  and  annual  financial  statements  (including  footnote 
disclosures) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   
 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
As discussed above, during the quarter ended November 30, 2008, we recruited an independent Certified General 
Accountant to offset concerns regarding lack of Segregation of Duties.  Otherwise, there have been no other changes 
in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  during  the  fiscal  quarter  ended  November  30,  2008  that  have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
