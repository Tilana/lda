<p>in this regard the initiative to convene a world congress on juvenile justice in Geneva from

</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
profession and the integrity of the judicial system are essential prerequisites for the 
protection of human rights and for ensuring that there is no discrimination in the 
administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that the right to access to justice for all forms an important basis for 
strengthening the rule of law through the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that every State should provide an effective framework in which to pursue 
remedies to redress human rights violations or grievances, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that the social rehabilitation of prisoners<b> </b>shall be among the essential 
aims of the criminal justice system, ensuring, as far as possible, that offenders are willing 
and able to lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life upon their return to society, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the importance of the principle that, except for those lawful limitations 
that are demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, persons deprived of their 
liberty shall retain their non-derogable human rights and all other human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Aware </i>of the need for special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of 
children, juveniles and women in the administration of justice, in particular while deprived 
of their liberty, and their vulnerability to violence, abuse, injustice and humiliation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all 
decisions concerning deprivation of liberty and, in particular, that depriving children and 
juveniles of their liberty should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time, in particular before trial, and the need to ensure that, if they are 
arrested, detained or imprisoned, children should be separated from adults, to the greatest 
extent feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to do so, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that the best interests of the child shall be an important 
consideration in all matters concerning the child related to sentencing of his or her parents 
or, where applicable, legal guardians or primary caregivers,

universal periodic review procedure; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites </i>Governments to include in their national development plans the 
administration of justice as an integral part of the development process, and to allocate

protection of human rights, and invites the international community to provide an increased 
level of both technical and financial assistance to States and<b> </b>to respond favourably to their 
requests for the enhancement and strengthening of institutions concerned with the 
administration of justice;

</b></p>
<p>10. <i>Also calls upon </i>States to ensure that anyone who is deprived of his or her 
liberty has prompt access to a competent court with the effective power to determine the

determined not to be lawful as well as prompt access to legal counsel, in accordance with 
their international obligations and commitments;<b> </b></p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages </i>States to address overcrowding in detention facilities by taking

<p>12. <i>Urges </i>States to endeavour to reduce pretrial detention by, inter alia, adopting 
legislative and administrative measures and policies on its preconditions, limitations,

</b></p>
<p>16. <i>Notes </i>the work of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on the 
revision of the United Nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners 
reiterating that any changes should not lower any existing standards but should reflect 
recent advances in correctional science and best practices as well as human rights 
standards, and, in this regard, invites the expert group to continue to benefit from the </p>


<p>expertise of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and of the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other relevant stakeholders;<b> </b></p>
<p>17. <i>Recognizes </i>that every child and juvenile in conflict with the law must be

Child to abide strictly by its principles and provisions; 
</p>

overall rule of law efforts to do so, and to develop and implement a comprehensive juvenile 
justice policy to prevent and address juvenile delinquency as well as with a view to 
promoting, inter alia, the use of alternative measures, such as diversion and restorative 
justice, and ensuring compliance with the principle that deprivation of liberty of children

view to their assuming a constructive role in society; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Encourages</i> States not to set the minimum age of criminal responsibility at 
too low an age level, bearing in mind the emotional, mental and intellectual maturity of the 
child, and, in this respect, refers to the recommendation of the Committee of the Rights of

</p>
<p>23. <i>Calls upon</i> States to enact or review legislation to ensure that any conduct not

</p>
<p>24. <i>Urges </i>States to take all appropriate measures so that children who are victims
