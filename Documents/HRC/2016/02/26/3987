</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health is a human right as reflected in, inter alia, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as, with respect 
to non-discrimination, in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and that 
such a right derives from the inherent dignity of the human person, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 15/22 of 30 September 2010 and all 
resolutions and decisions on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health adopted by the Council, the General Assembly and 
the Commission on Human Rights, and Council resolution 12/24 of 2 October 2009 on 
access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance of the promotion and protection of all human rights for 
all and their interrelationship with global public health, development, poverty eradication, 
education, gender equality and the empowerment of women, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Declaration on the Right to Development, which, inter alia, establishes 
that States should take, at the national level, all measures necessary for the realization of the 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>General Assembly

<p>right to development and should ensure, inter alia, equality of opportunity for all in their 
access to basic resources, such as health services, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> the ministerial declaration on implementing the internationally agreed 
goals and commitments with regard to global public health of the 2009 high-level segment 
of the Economic and Social Council, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that, for millions of people throughout the world, the full realization of 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, including through access to medicines that are affordable, safe, effective and 
of good quality, in particular essential medicines, vaccines and other medical products, and 
to health-care facilities and services, still remains a distant goal and that, in many cases, 
especially for those living in poverty, this goal remains remote, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that access to medicine is one of the fundamental elements in achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that it is the responsibility of States 
to ensure access for all, without discrimination, to medicines, in particular essential 
medicines, that are affordable, safe, effective and of good quality, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and 
civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create 
favourable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and 
effective enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical 
and mental health, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the Doha Ministerial Declaration on the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and Public Health confirms that the Agreement does 
not and should not prevent members of the World Trade Organization from taking 
measures to protect public health and that the Declaration, accordingly, while reiterating the 
commitment to the Agreement, affirms that it can and should be interpreted and 
implemented in a manner supportive of the rights of members of the Organization to protect 
public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all, and further 
recognizes, in this connection, the right of members of the Organization to use, to the full, 
the provisions of the above-mentioned Agreement, which provide flexibility for this 
purpose, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, in particular the fact that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of 
poverty, 
</p>
<p><i> Concerned also</i> that the increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases 
constitutes a heavy burden on society, with serious social and economic consequences, and 
aware that there is a need to respond to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and 
chronic respiratory diseases, which represent a leading threat to human health and 
development,
