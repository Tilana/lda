NATURE OF BUSINESS
Questar  Market  Resources,  Inc.  (Market  Resources  or  the  Company)  is  a  wholly  owned
subsidiary  of  Questar  Corporation  (Questar)  and  is  Questar’s  primary  growth  driver.  Market
Resources  has  four  principal  subsidiaries:  Questar  Exploration  and  Production  Company
(Questar  E&P)  explores  for,  acquires,  develops  and  produces  natural  gas  and  oil;  Wexpro
Company (Wexpro) develops and produces cost-of-service reserves for an affiliated company,
Questar Gas Company (Questar Gas); Questar Gas Management Company (Gas Management)
provides  gas-gathering  and  processing  services  for  affiliates  and  third  parties;  and  Questar
Energy Trading Company (Energy Trading) markets equity and third-party natural gas and oil,
provides risk-management services and, through Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC, owns and
operates an underground gas-storage reservoir.
Market Resources operates in the Rocky Mountain and Midcontinent regions of the United States
of America and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS
This  report  includes  “forward-looking  statements”  within  the  meaning  of  Section  27(a)  of  the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
amended.  All  statements  other  than  statements  of  historical  facts  included  or  incorporated  by
reference in this report, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company’s future
financial  position,  business  strategy,  budgets,  projected  costs  and  plans  and  objectives  of
management  for  future  operations,  are  forward-looking  statements.  In  addition  forward-looking
statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,”
“will,”  “could,”  “expect,”  “intend,”  “project,”  “estimate,”  “anticipate,”  “believe,”  “forecast,”  or
“continue”  or  the  negative  thereof  or  variations  thereon  or  similar  terminology.  Although  these
statements  are  made  in  good  faith  and  are  reasonable  representations  of  Market  Resources’
expected  performance  at  the  time,  actual  results  may  vary  from  management’s  stated
expectations and projections due to a variety of factors.
Important  assumptions  and  other  significant  factors  that  could  cause  actual  results  to  differ
materially  from  those  expressed  or  implied  in  forward-looking  statements  include,  but  are  not
limited to, the following:
Market  Resources’  subsidiaries  find,  produce  and  sell  natural  gas,  oil  and  natural  gas  liquids
(NGL)
Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are volatile and, therefore, Market Resources’ revenues, cash
flow and earnings can be volatile. The Company cannot predict future natural gas, oil and NGL
price movements, which are subject to forces beyond its control such as:
•
Domestic and foreign supply of and demand for natural gas and oil;
•
Regional basis differential due to pipeline-capacity constraints;
•
Domestic and global economic conditions;
•
Weather;
•
Domestic and foreign government regulations;
•
The price and availability of alternative fuels; and
•
The costs and availability of drilling rigs and other materials and services.
The Company uses financial contracts to hedge its exposure to volatile natural gas, oil and NGL
prices and to protect cash flow, returns on capital, net income and credit ratings from downward
commodity-price movements. While hedging reduces the impact of declining prices, it may also
limit  future  revenues  from  favorable  price  movements.  Market  Resources  believes  its  Wexpro
subsidiary  generates  revenues  that  are  not  significantly  sensitive  to  short-term  fluctuations  in
natural gas, oil and NGL prices.
Market  Resources’  profitability  depends  not  only  on  prevailing  prices  for  natural  gas,  oil  and
NGL, but also the Company’s ability to find, develop and acquire gas and oil reserves that are
economically  recoverable.  Substantial  capital  expenditures  are  required  to  find,  develop  and
acquire gas and oil reserves to replace those depleted by production.
Estimating gas and oil reserves, production and future net cash flow is difficult
Questar  E&P’s  proved  natural  gas  and  oil  reserve  estimates  are  prepared  annually  by
independent  reservoir-engineering  consultants.  Gas  and  oil  reserve  estimates  are  subject  to
numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating  quantities  of  proved  reserves,  projecting  future
rates  of  production  and  timing  of  development  expenditures.  The  accuracy  of  these  estimates
depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and
judgment. Reserve estimates are imprecise and will change as additional information becomes
available. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net cash flows prepared by
different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times may vary significantly. Results of
subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward or downward revisions of
previous estimates. In addition the estimates of future net revenues from proved reserves and the
present  value  of  those  reserves  are  based  upon  certain  assumptions  about  production  levels,
prices and costs, which may change. The volumes considered to be commercially recoverable
fluctuate  with  changes  in  prices  and  operating  costs.  The  meaningfulness  of  such  estimates
depends on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Actual results may
differ materially from the estimated results.
Drilling is a high-risk activity
Operating  risks  include:  blow-outs;  fire;  unexpected  drilling  conditions  such  as  uncontrollable
flows of gas, oil, formation water or drilling fluids; abandonment costs; explosions; pipe, cement
or  casing  failures;  oil  spills;  natural  gas  leaks;  and  discharges  of  toxic  gases.  The  Company
could  incur  substantial  losses  as  a  result  of  injury  or  loss  of  life;  environmental  damage;
destruction  of  property;  fines;  or  curtailment  of  operations.  The  Company  maintains  insurance
against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses.
Market Resources must comply with numerous regulations from the federal, state and local level
Market Resources is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations.  Environmental  laws  and  regulations  are  complex,  change  frequently  and  have
become more onerous over time. In addition to the costs of compliance, the Company may incur
substantial  costs  to  take  corrective  actions  at  both  owned  and  previously  owned  facilities.
Accidental spills and leaks requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. As
standards  change  the  Company  may  incur  significant  costs  in  cases  where  past  operations
followed  practices  that  were  considered  acceptable  at  the  time  but  that  now  require  remedial
work to meet current standards. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in
fines, significant costs for remedial activities, or injunctions.
Market Resources must comply with numerous and complex regulations governing activities on
federal and state lands in the Rocky Mountain region, notably the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Federal and state
agencies  frequently  impose  conditions  on  the  Company’s  activities.  These  restrictions  tend  to
become  more  stringent  over  time,  and  can  limit  or  prevent  the  Company  from  exploring  for,
finding and producing natural gas, oil and NGL on its Rockies leaseholds. Certain environmental
groups oppose drilling on some of the Company’s federal and state leases.
Various  federal  agencies  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  the  Interior,  particularly  the  Minerals
Management Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with each Native American tribe,
promulgate  and  enforce  regulations  pertaining  to  gas  and  oil  operations  on  Native  American
tribal lands. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production
requirements,  environmental  standards  and  royalty  considerations.  In  addition  each  Native
American  tribe  is  a  sovereign  nation  having  the  right  to  enforce  laws  and  regulations
independent  from  federal,  state  and  local  statutes  and  regulations.  These  tribal  laws  and
regulations include various taxes, fees, requirements to employ Native American tribal members
and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on
Native  American  tribal  lands.  Finally,  lessees  and  operators  conducting  operations  on  tribal
lands  are  generally  subject  to  the  Native  American  tribal  court  system.  One  or  more  of  these
factors may increase Market Resources’ costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands
and have an impact on the viability of its gas and oil operations on such lands.
Other factors may affect Market Resources results
Other  factors  may  affect  Market  Resources  results  such  as:  changes  in  general  economic
conditions; changes in regulation; availability and economic viability of gas and oil properties for
sale  or  exploration;  creditworthiness  of  counterparties;  rate  of  inflation  and  interest  rates;
assumptions  used  in  business  combinations;  weather  and  natural  disasters;  changes  in
customers’ credit ratings; competition from other forms of energy; effects of accounting policies
issued  periodically  by  accounting  standard-setting  bodies;  terrorist  attacks  or  acts  of  war;
changes in the business or financial condition of the Company; changes in credit ratings; and
availability of financing.
The Company cannot predict these factors nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such factors on
its financial position or its results of operations. Accordingly forward-looking statements should
not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. Market Resources undertakes no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement provided in this report.

NOTES ACCOMPANYING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 – Basis of Presentation of Interim Consolidated Financial Statements
The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Market Resources have
not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, with the exception
of the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, which was derived
from  the  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  at  that  date.  The  unaudited
consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  for  interim  financial  information  and  with  the
SEC’s instructions for Form 10-Q. The interim consolidated financial statements reflect all
normal,  recurring  adjustments  and  accruals  that  are,  in  the  opinion  of  management,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the
interim periods presented. The preparation of consolidated financial statements and notes
in conformity with GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities. Actual results could differ from estimates. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions were eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications were made to
the 2004 financial statements to conform with the 2005 presentation.
The  results  of  operations  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2005,  are  not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31,  2005,  due  to  a  variety  of  factors  discussed  in  the  Forward-Looking  Statements  and
Risk  Factors  section  of  this  report.  Interim  consolidated  financial  statements  do  not
include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for audited annual consolidated
financial  statements.  For  further  information  please  refer  to  the  consolidated  financial
statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2004.
Note 2 – Asset-Retirement Obligations (ARO)
Market Resources recognizes ARO in accordance with SFAS 143 “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” SFAS 143 addresses the financial accounting and reporting of
the  fair  value  of  legal  obligations  associated  with  the  retirement  of  tangible  long-lived
assets.  The  Company’s  ARO  applies  primarily  to  plugging  and  abandonment  costs
associated  with  gas  and  oil  wells  and  certain  other  properties.  The  fair  value  of
abandonment costs are estimated and depreciated over the life of the related assets. The
ARO  liability  is  adjusted  to  present  value  each  period  through  an  accretion  calculation
using  a  credit-adjusted  risk-free  interest  rate.  Changes  in  asset-retirement  obligations
were as follows:
Balance at January 1,

Additions
Revisions
Retirements and properties sold

Wexpro activities are governed by a long-standing agreement with the states of Utah and
Wyoming  (the  Wexpro  Agreement).  The  accounting  treatment  of  reclamation  activities
associated with ARO for properties administered under the Wexpro Agreement is spelled
out in a guideline letter between Wexpro and the Utah Division of Public Utilities and the
staff of the Public Service Commission of Wyoming. Pursuant to the stipulation, Wexpro
collects and deposits in trust certain funds related to estimated ARO costs. The funds are
used to satisfy retirement obligations as the properties are abandoned. At September 30,
2005, approximately $3.6 million was held in this trust invested in a short-term bond index
fund.
Note 3 – Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates
Market Resources uses the equity method to account for investments in unconsolidated
affiliates  where  the  Company  does  not  have  control.  These  entities  are  engaged  in
gathering  and  compressing  natural  gas,  and  have  no  debt  obligations  with  third-party
lenders.  The  principal  affiliates  and  Market  Resources’  ownership  percentage  as  of
September 30, 2005, were: Rendezvous Gas Services, LLC (Rendezvous), a limited liability
corporation,  (50%)  and  Canyon  Creek  Compression  Co.,  a  general  partnership  (15%).
Operating results representing 100% of these businesses are listed below.

In July 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an exposure draft
of a Proposed Interpretation “Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions,” an Interpretation
of FASB Statement 109. The exposure draft seeks to reduce perceived diversity in practice
associated  with  recognition  and  measurement  in  the  accounting  for  income  taxes.  The
exposure draft would apply to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS
109 “Accounting for Income Taxes.” The exposure draft requires that a tax position meet a
“probable  recognition  threshold”  for  the  benefit  of  the  uncertain  tax  position  to  be
recognized in the financial statements. This threshold is to be met assuming that the tax
authorities will examine the uncertain tax position. The exposure draft contains guidance
with  respect  to  the  measurement  of  the  benefit  that  is  recognized  for  an  uncertain  tax
position, when that benefit should be derecognized, and other matters. This interpretation
will be effective for Market Resources beginning January 1, 2006, under the timeframe in
the  proposed  statement.  The  Company  has  not  evaluated  the  potential  effect  of  this
proposed change in accounting principle.
Questar  has  granted  and  may  continue  to  grant  stock-based  compensation  to  certain
Market Resources employees. In December 2004 the FASB issued Statement 123 (revised
2004), (SFAS 123R), “Share Based Payment,” which replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes
APB Opinion 25. SFAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use APB Opinion 25’s intrinsic
value method of accounting that was provided in SFAS 123 as originally issued. After a
phase-in  period  for  SFAS  123R,  pro  forma  disclosure  will  no  longer  be  allowed.  The
effective date for implementation of SFAS 123R is January 1, 2006. Alternative phase-in
methods are allowed under SFAS 123R. Questar currently anticipates using the modified
prospective phase-in method that requires recognition of compensation costs for all share
based payments granted, modified or settled after the date of implementation as well as for
any  awards  that  were  granted  prior  to  the  implementation  date  for  which  the  required
service has not yet been performed. The Company believes none of the alternative phase-
in methods will have a material effect on operating results or financial position.
ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
(Unaudited)
SUMMARY
Market Resources net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $65.3 million compared with
$37.2  million  for  the  year  earlier  period,  a  75%  increase.  Net  income  for  the  first  nine
months of 2005 totaled $176.7 million versus $115.6 million for the same period in 2004, a
53% increase. Operating income increased $42.0 million, or 65%, in the quarter to quarter
comparison,  and  $92.5  million,  or  46%,  in  the  nine  month  comparison  due  primarily  to
higher  commodity  prices  and  increased  natural  gas  production  at  Questar  E&P,  an
increased  investment  base  at  Wexpro,  and  increased  NGL  volumes  coupled  with
improved  gas  gathering  and  processing  margins  at  Gas  Management.  Following  is  a
comparison of net income (loss) by line of business:

For  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  Questar  E&P  net  income  increased  81%  to  $44.8  million
compared  with  $24.8  million  for  the  same  period  in  2004.  Net  income  for  the  first  nine
months of 2005 was $115.4 million versus $75.4 million for the same period in 2004, a 53%
increase. The increases were driven by a combination of higher realized natural gas, oil
and NGL prices and increased gas, oil and NGL production volumes.
Questar  E&P’s  production  increased  to  29.2  bcfe  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  a  16%
increase compared to the year-earlier period. Production for the first nine months of 2005
was 82.5 bcfe versus 75.8 bcfe for the 2004 period, a 9% increase. Current year production
was  negatively  impacted  by  weather-related  completion  and  workover  delays  on  Uinta
Basin  and  western  Midcontinent  properties  during  the  first  quarter,  construction  and
maintenance-related curtailments on an interstate pipeline serving the Uinta Basin during
the third quarter, and delays caused by seasonal access restrictions on Rockies Legacy
properties.  Seasonal  access  restrictions  exist  over  much  of  Market  Resources’  federal
leasehold acreage in the Rockies. Delays in obtaining rigs to drill planned development
wells in the western Midcontinent also impacted first nine months 2005 production growth.
Natural gas is Questar E&P’s primary focus. On an energy-equivalent basis, natural gas
comprised approximately 87% of Questar E&P’s production for the first nine months of
2005. A comparison of energy equivalent production by region is shown in the following
table:

Questar E&P’s first nine months 2005 production from the Pinedale Anticline in western
Wyoming increased 42% to 22.8 bcfe versus 16.0 bcfe in the first nine months of 2004.
Production at Pinedale typically declines during the first through third quarters of each
year  due  to  mid-November  to  early  May  seasonal  access  restrictions  imposed  by  the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that restrict the company’s ability to drill and complete
wells during the period.
In the Uinta Basin of eastern Utah, Questar E&P production increased 2% to 19.2 bcfe in
the  first  nine  months  of  2005  compared  to  18.8  bcfe  a  year  ago.  Third  quarter  2005
production was reduced by construction and maintenance on an interstate pipeline that
serves the area.
Production from Questar E&P’s Rockies Legacy properties in the first nine months of 2005
was  12.3  bcfe  compared  to  13.5  bcfe  during  the  2004  period,  an  8%  decrease.  Legacy
properties include all of Questar E&P’s Rocky Mountain producing properties other than
Pinedale and the Uinta Basin. Legacy properties production during the 2005 period was
negatively  impacted  by  normal  field  decline,  seasonal  restrictions  that  limit  access  to
leases and wells during the winter months, payout of a high-volume well that reduced the
company’s working interest and mechanical problems that delayed completion of a new
well in the Vermillion Basin.
Midcontinent production was 28.2 bcfe in the first nine months of 2005 compared to 27.5
bcfe  for  the  same  period  of  2004,  a  2%  increase.  The  company  continued  one-rig-
development programs in both the Hartshorne coalbed-methane development project in
the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and the ongoing infill-development drilling on the
Elm Grove properties in northwest Louisiana.
Questar E&P also benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas, oil and NGL. For
the first nine months of 2005, the weighted average realized natural gas price for Questar
E&P (including the effects of hedging) was $4.91 per Mcf compared to $4.10 per Mcf for the
same period in 2004, a 20% increase. Realized oil and NGL prices for the first nine months
of  2005  averaged  $40.61  per  bbl,  compared  with  $30.28  per  bbl  during  the  prior  year
period,  a  34%  increase.  A  comparison  of  average  realized  prices  by  region,  including
hedges, is shown in the following table:

Approximately  81%  of  Questar  E&P’s  gas  production  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005  was
hedged or pre-sold. For the first nine months of 2005, approximately 84% was hedged or
pre-sold. Hedging reduced gas revenues $39.6 million and $70.7 million during the third
quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively. For the current quarter, Questar E&P
also  hedged  approximately  73%  of  its  oil  production.  For  the  first  nine  months  2005,
approximately 67% was hedged or pre-sold. Oil hedges reduced revenues $8.7 million and
$17.6 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, respectively.
Market Resources may hedge up to 100 percent of its forecasted production from proved
developed reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash
flow and earnings from a decline in commodity prices. Questar E&P has continued to take
advantage of high natural gas and oil prices to add to its hedge positions through 2008.
Natural gas and oil hedges as of September 30, 2005, are summarized in Part I, Item 3 of
this report.
Questar  E&P’s  pre-income  tax  cost  structure  per  unit  of  production  (the  sum  of
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, lifting costs, general and administrative
expense  and  allocated-interest  expense)  increased  11%  to  $2.82  per  Mcfe  in  the  third
quarter of 2005 versus $2.53 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2004. For the first nine months
of 2005, pre-income tax cost structure rose 12% to $2.77 per Mcfe compared to $2.48 per
Mcfe in the first nine months of 2004.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense rose 12% in the third quarter to $1.19
per Mcfe and 14% to $1.17 per Mcfe for the first nine months of 2005 due to normal decline
in production from older, lower cost successful-efforts pools, negative reserve revisions
over  the  past  12  months  at  the  company’s  Uinta  Basin  properties  and  higher  reserve
replacement (finding and development) costs. Higher day rates for rigs and other services
in core operating areas, along with sharply higher steel prices, resulted in higher drilling
and completion costs.
Increased production taxes and lease operating expenses drove a $0.17 per Mcfe increase
in lifting costs during the current quarter and $0.14 per Mcfe in the first nine months of
2005 versus the comparable year-earlier periods. Increased production taxes were driven
by  higher  gas,  oil  and  NGL  sales  prices.  Most  production  taxes  are  based  on  a  fixed
percentage of commodity sales prices. Higher lease operating expenses reflect a general
increase  in  well  service  costs,  including  costs  of  contracted  services  and  production-
related  supplies, 
increased  workover  and  production  enhancement  projects  and
additional production-related costs.
For the third quarter of 2005, general and administrative expenses remained flat at $0.29
per Mcfe compared to the same period in 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, general
and  administrative  expenses  increased  $0.01  per  Mcfe,  or  3%  to  $0.31  per  Mcfe.  The
company  continues  to  adjust  employee  compensation 
industry
competition  for  skilled  professionals.  Higher  allocated  corporate  overhead  (primarily
employee benefits and compliance costs) also contributed to the increase. Questar E&P’s
pre-income tax cost structure is summarized in the following table:

Exploration expense increased $1.2 million in the third quarter and $5.4 million in the first
nine months of 2005 compared to the 2004 periods. The increase in expense was due to
$2.7  million  of  exploratory  dry  hole  expense  in  the  second  quarter  and  increased
exploratory  seismic  acquisition  expenditures  in  the  Midcontinent  and  Uinta  Basin.
Abandonment  and  impairment  expense  declined  $1.1  million  for  the  quarter  and  $4.9
million for the first nine months of 2005. The year to date decrease was primarily due to an
impairment expense in the first quarter of 2004 resulting from a well with collapsed casing.
Pinedale Anticline
As of October 31, 2005, Market Resources (both Questar E&P and Wexpro) operated 136
producing wells on the Pinedale Anticline compared to 88 at the end of the third quarter of
2004,  and  104  at  year-end  2004.  Of  the  136  producing  wells,  Questar  E&P  has  working
interests in 120 wells, overriding royalty interests only in an additional 15 Wexpro-operated
wells and no interest in one well operated by Wexpro. Wexpro has working interests in 54
of the 136 producing wells. Market Resources expects to complete about 35 Lance Pool
wells (combined Lance and Mesaverde formations) on its Pinedale acreage during 2005.
On  August  9,  2005,  the  Wyoming  Oil  and  Gas  Conservation  Commission  approved  10-
acre-density  drilling  for  Lance  Pool  wells  on  about  12,700  acres  of  Market  Resources’
18,208  acre  (gross)  Pinedale  leasehold.  The  area  approved  for  increased  density
corresponds  to  the  currently  estimated  productive  limits  of  Market  Resources’  core
acreage in the field. With 10-acre-density drilling, the company currently believes that up to
932 wells will be required to fully develop the Lance Pool on its acreage.
On August 19, 2005, Questar E&P reached a total depth of 19,520 feet in the Hilliard Shale
at  the  Stewart  Point  15-29  exploratory  well.  Based  on  log  information  and  gas  shows,
Questar  E&P  identified  multiple  zones  of  interest  below  the  Lance  Pool  at  depths  from
about 16,000 to 19,500 feet, ran casing to total depth and in mid-September commenced
hydraulic-stimulation  and  testing.  Starting  in  the  lower  part  of  the  well,  the  company
pumped three frac stages over a 900 foot interval from 18,541 to 19,434 feet and began
flowing the well back to sales on an 18/64 inch choke. During initial flowback, the company
measured  extrapolated  flow  rates  as  high  as  10.7  MMcf  per  day  of  dry,  sweet  gas  with
10,000  to  12,000  psig  flowing  casing  pressure  and  an  extrapolated  rate  of  about  2,400
barrels  per  day  of  frac  water.  As  the  flowback  continued,  the  well  exhibited  steadily
declining  rates  and  pressures  and,  on  several  occasions,  had  to  be  shut  in  to  remove
debris plugging the choke. Eventually a combination of very small pieces of shale from the
formation, proppant used in the fracs, and chunks of the flow-through frac plugs used to
isolate individual stages partially filled the wellbore, blocking the flow of gas to the surface.
The vertical extent of the obstruction is currently unknown. Given the very high formation
pressures, specialized equipment (a high-pressure snubbing unit) and very experienced
personnel are required to attempt to circulate out the rubble inside the wellbore and either
re-establish production from the initial test interval, or isolate that interval and move up-
hole to test additional zones. The company was not able to secure the right snubbing unit
and  crew  for  this  operation  before  cold  winter  weather  would  make  this  operation
technically and operationally risky. The resumption of testing of the well will be delayed
until the spring of 2006.
Uinta Basin
During the first nine months of 2005, the company drilled or participated in six horizontal
Green  River  formation  oil  wells,  44  Wasatch  and  Upper  Mesaverde  gas  wells,  and  four
deeper Blackhawk and Mancos formation gas wells on its core acreage block. In addition
the company completed its first well in the Flat Rock area approximately 40 miles south of
the core acreage block.
Questar E&P recently reached total depth on the Wolf Flat 1P-1-15-19 well, the first well
drilled under an Exploration and Development Agreement (EDA) with the Ute Indian Tribe
covering 12,557 acres of tribal minerals in the southern Uinta Basin. Logs indicate pay in
multiple horizons. Completion operations should begin during the fourth quarter of 2005.
Questar E&P has a 50% working interest in the Wolf Flat well. The company also recently
completed  acquisition  of  a  2-D  seismic  survey  covering  a  portion  of  the  EDA  lands.
Pursuant to the EDA Questar E&P has exercised its option to acquire leases on all of the
EDA lands. The Ute Indian Tribe has the option to participate in the first well drilled in each
section with up to a 50% working interest.
Rockies Legacy
In  the  Vermillion  Basin  on  the  southwest  Wyoming-northwest  Colorado  border,  Market
Resources continues to evaluate the potential of several formations at depths of 10,000 to
15,000  feet  under  the  company’s  approximately  143,000  net  leasehold  acres.  As  of
October  31,  2005,  the  company  had  recompleted  two  older  wells,  drilled  and  completed
two new wells, had one well waiting on completion and was drilling one well. The first new
well, Alkali Gulch Unit Well No 1, was completed in June 2005 and produced an average of
1.93  MMcf  per  day  from  the  Baxter,  Frontier  and  Dakota  formations  during  the  first  141
days. On October 31 the well was producing about 1.6 MMcf per day. The second new well,
Canyon  Creek  41,  went  to  sales  on  September  21,  2005.  During  the  first  30  days  of
production, the well averaged 2.95 MMcf per day from the Baxter and Frontier formations.
The  well  was  producing  1.9  MMcf  per  day  on  October  31,  2005.  After  delays  related  to
mechanical problems, the third new well, Hiawatha Deep Unit No. 5 should be completed
and turned to sales in mid-November 2005. The company currently plans to drill about 12
new wells in the Vermillion Basin in 2006.
Midcontinent
During the third quarter the company continued one-rig development programs at both
the Hartshorne coalbed-methane project in the Arkoma Basin of eastern Oklahoma and
the  infill-development  drilling  project  in  the  Elm  Grove  properties  in  northwestern
Louisiana. The company drilled or participated in 26 new Hartshorne wells in the first nine
months of 2005 and anticipates participating in an additional 11 wells in the fourth quarter
of 2005. In the Elm Grove area, the company drilled or participated in 19 new wells through
the first nine months of 2005 and eight additional wells are planned in the fourth quarter.
Wexpro
For the third quarter of 2005 Wexpro’s net income was $11.3 million, compared with $8.7
million  for  the  same  period  in  2004,  a  29%  increase.  For  the  first  nine  months  of  2005
Wexpro’s net income was $31.9 million, compared with $26.6 million for the same period in
2004, a 20% increase. Wexpro develops and produces gas reserves on behalf of affiliate
Questar Gas. Pursuant to the Wexpro Agreement, Wexpro recovers its costs and receives
an unlevered after-tax return of approximately 19% on its investment in commercial wells
and related facilities – adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes
and depreciation (investment base). Wexpro’s investment base increased to $197.6 million
at September 30, 2005, up $32.6 million over the year earlier period. Wexpro’s net income
also benefited from higher oil and NGL prices in 2005.
Gas Management
Gas  Management  net  income  increased  53%  to  $7.3  million  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005
from $4.8 million in the 2004 period. Net income for the first nine months of 2005 was $25.1
million versus $14.2 million for the same period in 2004, a 76% increase. Gross keep-whole
processing margins (revenue from the sale of extracted NGL’s less the cost of natural gas
to replace the Btu-equivalent of extracted NGL volumes and operating costs), grew 33%
from $9.8 million in the first nine months of 2004 to $13.0 million in 2005. The first quarter
2005  acquisition  of  a  gas  plant  in  western  Wyoming  drove  a  62%  increase  in  extracted
NGL volumes in the third quarter and 55% for the first nine months of 2005 versus the year
earlier periods. Gathering volumes increased 14.6 million MMBtu to 182.6 million MMBtu in
the  first  nine  months  of  2005  due  primarily  to  expanding  Pinedale  production  and  new
projects serving third parties in the Uinta Basin.
To  reduce  processing  margin  risk,  Gas  Management  has  restructured  a  number  of  its
processing  agreements  with  producers  from  “keep-whole”  contracts  to  “fee-based”
contracts.  (A  keep-whole  contract  protects  producers  from  frac  spread  risk  while  fee-
based  contracts  eliminate  commodity-price  risk  for  the  plant  owner.)  To  further  reduce
margin volatility associated with keep-whole contracts, Gas Management began managing
NGL price risk in 2004 by using forward-sales contracts. In the first nine months of 2005
keep-whole contracts benefited from a 16% increase in NGL sales prices versus the prior-
year period. Fee-based contracts benefited from a $0.03 increase in the rate charged per
MMBtu  processed  in  the  nine  month  comparable  periods.  Forward  sales  contracts
decreased NGL revenues by $0.7 million in 2005.
Earnings before tax from Gas Management’s 50% interest in Rendezvous Gas Services,
LLC, (Rendezvous) increased to $5.0 million for the first nine months of 2005 versus $3.5
million for 2004, a 40% increase. Earnings growth in Rendezvous was driven by increased
gathering  volumes.  Rendezvous  provides  gas  gathering  services  for  the  Pinedale  and
Jonah producing areas. Gas Management continues to invest in additional gas gathering
and  processing  and  liquids-handling  facilities  to  serve  growing  equity  and  third-party
production in its core areas of the Pinedale and Jonah fields in western Wyoming and the
Uinta Basin in eastern Utah.
During  the  first  quarter  2005  Gas  Management  acquired  a  cryogenic  gas  processing
facility  located  approximately  13  miles  south  of  Gas  Management’s  Blacks  Fork  plant,
adding approximately 60 MMcf per day of raw gas processing and NGL extraction capacity
at its western Wyoming hub. The plant has been connected to the Blacks Fork/Granger
complex to significantly enhance processing and blending capacity for Pinedale, Jonah
and other western Wyoming producers served by Gas Management and Rendezvous.
Gas Management remains on schedule to complete and commission its condensate and
produced-water  gathering  and  transportation  facilities  on  Market  Resources’  Pinedale
Anticline  leasehold  by  mid-November,  in  time  to  satisfy  BLM  conditions  for  expanded
winter access. These new facilities will eliminate over 25,500 tanker-truck trips per year at
peak production from Market Resources’ operated acreage and the related air emissions,
dust, noise, visual and traffic impacts.
Gas  Management  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  third  party  producer  to  gather,
compress and process gas in the Uinta Basin. Under terms of the fee-based agreement,
the company constructed gas compression facilities and expanded its existing Red Wash
gas plant to process an additional 70 MMcf per day of raw gas. The processed gas and
liquids are redelivered to the producer. The new facilities were in-service at the end of the
third  quarter  2005.  Gas  Management  has  also  signed  a  letter  of  intent  to  form  a  joint
venture with the Ute Indian Tribe and another industry participant to build a gas gathering
system for the Flat Rock area in southern Uinta Basin.
Energy Trading
Energy Trading’s net income for the third quarter of 2005 was $2.0 million compared to a
loss of $1.1 million in 2004. For the first nine months of 2005, net income was $4.2 million
compared to a loss of $0.6 million in 2004. Gross margins for gas and oil marketing (gross
revenues less costs for gas and oil purchases, transportation and gas storage), increased
to  $9.8  million  for  the  first  nine  months  of  2005  versus  $3.0  million  a  year  ago,  a  231%
increase. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a 178% higher unit margin and
a 21% increase in volumes over the same period last year.
Consolidated Results After Operating Income
Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates
Gas  Management  has  a  50%  interest  in  Rendezvous,  which  provides  gas-gathering
services  for  the  Pinedale  and  Jonah  producing  areas  of  western  Wyoming.  Gas
Management’s share of Rendezvous’ earnings before tax increased to $1.9 million in the
2005 quarter versus $1.0 million in 2004 and $5.0 million in the first nine months of 2005
compared  to  $3.5  million  for  the  same  period  last  year.  Rendezvous  gathering  volumes
increased 80% in the third quarter and 48% in the first nine months of 2005 compared to
the year earlier periods.
Debt expense
Debt  expense  rose  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005  because  the  Company  increased
borrowings to meet hedging collateral calls precipitated by increases in natural gas and oil
prices.
Interest and Other Income
Interest and other income was higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2005
compared  to  the  same  periods  of  2004.  The  income  in  the  2005  periods  also  reflects
interest received on hedging collateral deposits. Gains from asset sales added $1.1 million
before tax in the third quarter of 2005.
Income taxes
The  effective  combined  federal  and  state  income  tax  rate  for  the  first  nine  months  was
36.9% in 2005 and 37.1% in 2004.
ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Market Resources’ primary market risk exposures arise from commodity-price changes for
natural gas, oil and NGL, estimation of gas and oil reserves and volatility in interest rates.
Energy  Trading  has  long-term  contracts  for  pipeline  capacity  and  is  obligated  for
transportation  services  with  no  guarantee  that  it  will  be  able  to  recover  the  full  cost  of
these transportation commitments.
Commodity-Price Risk Management
Market Resources bears the risk associated with commodity-price changes and uses gas-
and oil-price-hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of
adverse price movements. However these same arrangements typically limit future gains
from  favorable  price  movements.  Hedging  contracts  are  used  for  a  significant  share  of
Questar  E&P-owned  gas  and  oil  production  and  for  a  portion  of  gas-  and  oil-marketing
transactions and for some of Gas Management’s NGL.
Market  Resources  has  established  policies  and  procedures  for  managing  commodity-
price  risks  through  the  use  of  derivatives.  Natural  gas-  and  oil-price  hedging  supports
Market  Resources’  rate  of  return  and  cash-flow  targets  and  protects  earnings  from
downward movements in commodity prices. The volume of hedged production and the
mix  of  derivative  instruments  are  regularly  evaluated  and  adjusted  by  management  in
response  to  changing  market  conditions  and  reviewed  periodically  by  the  Finance  and
Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Market Resources may hedge up
to  100%  of  forecast  production  from  proved  developed  reserves  when  prices  meet
earnings and cash-flow objectives. Proved developed production represents production
from  existing  wells.  Market  Resources  does  not  enter  into  derivative  arrangements  for
speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or equity NGL.
Hedges are matched to equity gas and oil production, thus qualifying as cash-flow hedges
under the accounting provisions of SFAS 133 as amended and interpreted. Gas hedges
are typically structured as fixed-price swaps into regional pipelines, locking in basis and
hedge  effectiveness.  Any  ineffective  portion  of  hedges  is  immediately  recognized  in
income. The ineffective portion of hedges was not significant in 2005 and 2004.
As  of  September  30,  2005,  approximately  22.6  bcf  of  forecast  gas  production  for  the
remainder of 2005 was hedged at an estimated average price of $5.15 per Mcf, net to the
well  (which  reflects  assumed  adjustments  for  regional  basis,  gathering  and  processing
costs and gas quality).
Market Resources enters into commodity-price-hedging arrangements with several banks
and  energy-trading  firms  with  a  variety  of  credit  requirements.  Some  contracts  do  not
require  collateral  deposits,  while  others  allow  some  amount  of  credit  before  Market
Resources is required to deposit collateral for out-of-the-money hedges. The amount of
credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to Market Resources’
debt. In addition to the counterparty arrangements, Market Resources has a $200 million
long-term revolving-credit facility with banks that was fully utilized at September 30, 2005.
A summary of Market Resources hedging positions for equity production as of September
30, 2005, is shown below. Prices are net to the well. Currently all hedges are fixed-price
swaps with creditworthy counterparties, allowing Market Resources to achieve a known
price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point. The swap
price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the
net-to-the-well price.

Market Resources held gas-price hedging contracts covering the price exposure for about
182.3  million  MMBtu  of  gas,  2.6  MMbbl  of  oil  and  14.1  million  gallons  of  NGL  as  of
September  30,  2005.  A  year  earlier  Market  Resources’  hedging  contracts  covered  148.3
million MMBtu of natural gas and 1.5 MMbbl of oil.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
The  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  have  evaluated  the
effectiveness  of  the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as  such  term  is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by the report (the Evaluation Date).
Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date,
the  Company’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  effective  in  alerting  them  on  a
timely  basis  to  material  information  relating  to  the  Company,  including  its  consolidated
subsidiaries, required to be included in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also
concluded  that  the  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  in  ensuring  that  information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange  Act  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  the  Company’s  management
including  its  principal  executive  and  financial  officers  or  persons  performing  similar
functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Controls.
Since the Evaluation Date, there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal
controls or other factors during the most recent fiscal quarter that could materially affect
such controls.
PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

“Section 2.14.  Extension of Maturity Date.
(a)
Not earlier than 60 days prior to, nor later than 45 days prior to August 9, 2006 and August
9 2007, the Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
notify  the  Lenders),  request  a  one-year  extension  of  the  Maturity  Date  then  in  effect.
  Within  30  days  of  delivery  of  such  notice,  each  Lender  shall  notify  the  Administrative
Agent  whether  or  not  it  consents  to  such  extension  (which  consent  may  be  given  or
withheld  in  such  Lender’s  sole  and  absolute  discretion).    Any  Lender  not  responding
within the above time period shall be deemed not to have consented to such extension.
  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  the  Borrower  and  the  Lenders  of  the
Lenders’ responses.
(b)
The Maturity Date shall be extended only if Lenders holding at least 50% of the Aggregate
Commitments (calculated excluding Defaulting Lenders and prior to giving effect to any
replacements of Lenders permitted herein) (the “Consenting Lenders”)  have  consented
thereto.  If so extended, the Maturity Date, as to the Consenting Lenders, shall be extended
to the date which is one year after the Maturity Date then in effect, effective as of the date
the  Administrative  Agent  notifies  the  Consenting  Lenders  that  the  conditions  of  this
Section  2.14  have  been  satisfied  (the  “Extension  Effective  Date”).    The  Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall promptly confirm to the Lenders such extension and the
Extension Effective Date.
(c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section
shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless:
(i)
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
extension and no Default or Event of Default shall occur as a result of such extension;
(ii)
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement are true and correct on
and as of the date of such extension and after the extension is effective, as though made
on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is expressly stated to
have been made as of a specific date, as of such specific date);
(iii)
the  Borrower  shall  pay  any  Loans  outstanding  on  the  Maturity  Date  as  to  any  non-
extending Lenders (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05) to
the  extent  necessary  to  keep  outstanding  Loans  ratable  with  any  revised  and  new  Pro
Rata Shares of all the Lenders effective as of the Extension Effective Date;
(iv)
the  Borrower  shall  deliver  to  the  Administrative  Agent  a  certificate  signed  by  a
Responsible Officer of the Borrower (A) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted
by such Loan Party authorizing such extension and (B) certifying that, (1) before and after
giving effect to such extension, the representations and warranties contained in  Article V
and the other Loan Documents made by it are true and correct in all material respects on
and as of the Extension Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties  specifically  refer  to  an  earlier  date,  (2)  before  and  after  giving  effect  to  such
extension no Default exists or will exist, and (3) no event has occurred since the date of
the  most  recent  audited  financial  statements  of  the  Borrower  delivered  pursuant  to
Section 6.02(a) and (b) that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect; and
(v)
the  Borrower  shall  deliver  to  Administrative  Agent  an  opinion  addressing  such  matters
relating to such extension as Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
(d)
If any Lender does not consent to the extension of the Maturity Date as provided in this
Section 2.14, the Borrower shall have the right to replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.16.
(e)
This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.06 or 10.01 to the contrary.”
Section 2.3
Fees.
Clause (b) of Section 2.08 of the Original Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to
read as follows:
(b)
Utilization Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a utilization fee equal to the Applicable
Rate times the Total Outstandings on each day that the Total Outstandings exceed 50% of
the actual daily amount of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, if terminated, in
effect immediately prior to such termination).  The utilization fee shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Maturity Date.  The utilization fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any
change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount shall be computed and
multiplied by the Applicable Rate for each period during which such Applicable Rate was
in effect.  The utilization fee shall accrue at all times, including at any time during which
one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met.”
Section 2.4.
Conditions to all Credit Extensions.  Section 4.02 (a) of the Original Agreement is hereby
amended in its entirety to read as follows:
“(a)
The  representations  and  warranties  of  the  Borrower  contained  in Article V  or  any  other
Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in
connection herewith or therewith (excluding the representation and warranty set forth in
Section 5.06(c) of this Agreement), shall be true and correct on and as of the date of such
Credit  Extension,  except  to  the  extent  that  such  representations  and  warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 4.02 (a) the representations and
warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.06 shall be deemed to refer to
the  most  recent  statements  furnished  pursuant  to  clauses  (a)  and  (b),  respectively,  of
Section 6.02.”

execution  and  delivery  by  Borrower  of  this  Amendment  or  to  consummate  the
transactions contemplated hereby.
(d)
When duly executed and delivered, each of this Amendment and the Credit Agreement will
be a legal and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws of general application relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights and by equitable principles of general application.
(e)
The audited annual consolidated financial statements of Borrower dated as of December
31, 2004 and the unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements of Borrower dated
as of June 30, 2005 fairly present the consolidated financial position at such dates and the
consolidated results of operations and the changes in consolidated financial position for
the periods ending on such dates for Borrower.  Copies of such consolidated financial
statements have heretofore been delivered to each Lender.  Since such dates no material
adverse  change  has  occurred  in  the  consolidated  financial  condition  or  businesses  of
Borrower.
