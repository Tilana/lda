<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011.  The review of Zimbabwe was held at the 12th meeting, 
on 10 October 2011. The delegation of Zimbabwe was headed by Hon. Minister Patrick 
Chinamasa, Minister for Justice and Legal Affairs. At its 16th meeting, held on 12 October 
2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Zimbabwe.  
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Zimbabwe: China, Spain and Senegal. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Zimbabwe: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/ZWE/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, 
Norway, Sweden and Slovenia was transmitted to Zimbabwe through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Zimbabwe reported that its national report was the result of an extensive multi-
sectoral consultative process which included national consultative workshops involving all 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>6. Zimbabwe indicated that it had in place various independent institutions, legislation 
and policy frameworks aimed at protecting and promoting the human rights of its people.  It 
has embarked on an all-inclusive national programme to write a new Constitution by, of 
and for Zimbabweans. The current Constitution provided for the Zimbabwe Human Rights 
Commission, and had a justiciable Bill of Rights. The country also had legislation to 
advance and protect human rights in the areas of education, labour and health. 
</p>
<p>7. In order to take the direct benefits under these and other laws to the people, the 
Government had formulated and launched a number of policies and strategies which, 
despite the illegal economic sanctions, had registered a measure of success. For example, 
Zimbabwe adopted the National Programme of Action for Children and the National Action 
Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children. In addition, Victim-Friendly Units at police 
stations, hospitals and courts have been established. The Zimbabwe Republic Police had a 
Police Complaints Desk at every station to deal with cases of ill-treatment and mishandling 
of cases by police. The Constitution established the Electoral and Media Commissions.  </p>


<p>8. The National Gender Policy advanced the cause of women&#8217;s rights. The massive 
investment in education since independence and the land reform programme embarked 
upon by Government in 2000 have contributed immensely to the empowerment of the 
previously disadvantaged indigenous Zimbabweans. The Indigenisation and Economic 
Empowerment Policy facilitated and enhanced the greater participation of the people in 
mainstream economic activity and access to the means of production and self-sustenance.  
</p>
<p>9. Regarding criticisms levelled, particularly against the Public Order and Security Act 
(POSA) and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, Zimbabwe remained 
convinced that the two laws, among other legislation, were fair and constitutional 
mechanisms to regulate the conduct of meetings in a democratic State. It rejected the views 
that these pieces of legislation unjustifiably interfered with some liberties of the individual 
and noted that there was strikingly similar legislation in the jurisdictions of some Member 
States.  
</p>
<p>10. Zimbabwe had an independent judiciary tasked with the impartial interpretation of 
human rights law and continuous development of human rights jurisprudence. The 
Constitution guaranteed the independence of the judiciary and the newly promulgated 
Judicial Service Act provided for its budgetary autonomy.  
</p>
<p>11. Zimbabwe was run by a Government of National Unity (GNU), comprising the three 
main political parties which were signatories to the Southern Africa Development 
Community (SADC)-facilitated Global Political Agreement (GPA).   
</p>
<p>12. Zimbabwe responded to advance questions<b> </b>asked by some Member States.  The 
delegation reported that the three political parties had negotiated a legal framework that 
would ensure free and fair elections. The framework was captured in the Electoral 
Amendment Bill which was before Parliament. 
</p>
<p>13. Regarding POSA, the delegation affirmed that it was in its present form adequate to 
regulate meetings, gatherings and demonstrations.  POSA was amended in 2007 as a result 
of negotiations among the major political parties and was modelled along the provisions of 
the South African legislation. 
</p>
<p>14. GPA further provided for the need to train security-sector personnel in subjects such 
as human rights.  The security services were appointed to uphold and defend the 
Constitution of Zimbabwe and their conduct was regulated by Acts of Parliament, 
Regulations and Standing Orders. The concerns of Western countries regarding the 
politicization of the police and military authorities, were misplaced, subjective and 
grounded in error. The Security Sector Reform that is demanding the dismissal of former 
liberation combatants from the uniformed forces was unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>15. As for the death penalty, the issue was being considered in the Constitution-making 
process. The ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights would be considered once a position had been reached on 
whether or not to abolish the death penalty. Zimbabwe reported that the ratification of the 
Convention against Torture was under active consideration by the Government which 
would review the legislation and identify gaps before ratifying and domesticating the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation informed the Working Group that legislation which governed the 
detention of offenders was in line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners. Furthermore, the Government had set up an Inter-Ministerial Task 
Force to look into the conditions of detention facilities and make recommendations on their 
improvement.   
</p>
<p>17. Zimbabwe stated that it passed the Domestic Violence Act in 2007. In line with the 
Act, an Anti-Domestic Violence Council was established in 2009 with the overall mandate </p>


<p>of overseeing the implementation of the Act.  Victim-Friendly Units have been established 
at every police station and were manned by police officers who have been specially trained 
on how to handle cases of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>18. On alleged ongoing land seizures, the delegation reported that all agricultural land 
was gazetted and nationalized in terms of Constitutional Amendment No. 17 and therefore, 
the question of land seizures could not arise. The Land Reform and Distribution 
Programme (LRDP) was almost complete. The act of nationalization could not be 
challenged in the courts but the issues of compensation for improvements could be litigated 
upon. Farm workers were among the beneficiaries under the LRDP. Regarding provisions 
of the Gazetted Land (Consequential Provisions) Act, the position was that once land had 
been gazetted it became State land.  
</p>
<p>19. Zimbabwe upholds the principle of non-discrimination and as such the law does not 
discriminate against any person, including human rights defenders. Like any other person, 
they were liable to arrest and prosecution when they committed offences.  
</p>
<p>20. The issue of moving cases through courts more quickly was adversely affected by 
inadequate human and material resources. The Judicial Service Commission was 
empowered through legislation to employ judicial officers and staff who were previously 
under the Public Service Commission.  
</p>
<p>21. Regarding independent civilian oversight over the Police Force, the delegation 
reported that section 13 of the Police Act required the Commissioner General of the Police 
to submit an annual report to the Minister of Home Affairs on the activities of the Police 
Force and the report was required to be placed before Parliament. The Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs exercises an oversight role over the activities of the 
Police Force. 
</p>
<p>22. As to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, the delegation underlined that the 
Bill to operationalize the activities of the Commission was before Parliament. The 
Commission made its contributions to the Bill to ensure its independence in accordance 
with the Paris Principles. However, funding would remain a major constraint. So far, the 
Government had managed to secure office accommodation, which has been handed over to 
the Commission.  
</p>
<p>23. In its quest to deal with complaints of human rights abuses that took place before 
February 2009, Zimbabwe set up the Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation and 
Integration. The Organ was tasked with the responsibility of achieving national healing, 
cohesion and unity in respect of victims of pre and post-independence conflict with a view 
to reconciling the population which was then polarised. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding the implementation of the 2005 recommendations of the United Nations 
Special Envoy on human settlement issues, Zimbabwe has town-planning laws and 
regulations which should be complied with. Those evicted in 2005 were people who had 
not complied with the regulations. Government and local authorities had schemes in place 
to ensure adequate housing for all. 
</p>
<p>25. There had been several amendments to the Access to Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act and the Broadcasting Services Act between 2002 and 2008 after the Supreme 
Court struck down provisions which were ruled to be unconstitutional. There were no 
provisions that were still unconstitutional.   
</p>
<p>26. The delegation reiterated Zimbabwe&#8217;s commitment in the area of human rights and 
hoped that the Council would extend assistance to its Government to strengthen 
advancement in the promotion and protection of the rights of its people. </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>54. On efforts made in the area of gender equality and the empowerment of women, 
Zimbabwe was party to key instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
other regional instruments. An implementation framework for the 2004 National Gender 
Policy has been developed to guide the activities of various stakeholders in mainstreaming </p>


<p>gender in their sectors. This has been complemented by the appointment of Gender Focal 
Persons at Director Level in all Ministries and Departments. The Government also 
introduced gender budgeting to ensure the operationalization of the National Gender Policy. 
In order to assist women to access finances for their income-generating projects, the 
Government had put in place a Women&#8217;s Development Fund in addition to other specific 
</p>
<p>loans.  
</p>
<p>55. In terms of women&#8217;s participation in politics and decision-making, the Government 
has made some strides. For the first time in the history of the country, women held key 
governmental positions. However, more still needed to be done and women were lobbying 
the Government for the adoption of constitutional quotas to bring more women in politics 
and decision-making. 
</p>
<p>56. Zimbabwe stressed that sanctions imposed illegally on the country have had 
negative effects and prevented it from achieving some of the Millennium Development 
Goals, as they prevented it from accessing the soft and development loans from the World 
Bank and International Monetary Fund. Zimbabwe had enjoyed various achievements in 
education following the implementation of the Early Childhood Development Policy in 
</p><p>2005.  
</p>
<p>57. Zimbabwe has achieved a literacy rate of 92 per cent, the highest literacy rate in 
Africa according to the United Nations Development Programme assessment of 2010. 
Access to higher education has also increased, with nine State and four private universities. 
Zimbabwe has achieved gender parity at primary-school level and a 51/49 proportion at the 
secondary-school level. Through affirmative measures, universities had a nearly 40 per cent 
female enrolment. 
</p>
<p>58. Zimbabwe indicated that the GPA was an internal arrangement among political 
parties. Its evolution and its implementation were the responsibility of political parties 
alone. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Democratic Republic of the Congo<b> </b>welcomed the efforts undertaken to set up an 
institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights and noted with 
appreciation that Zimbabwe was party to several international and regional human rights 
instruments.  It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. Burkina Faso<b> </b>highlighted the actions carried out in the framework of the National 
Plan of Action in favour of children. It also noted that political and economic instability had 
weakened the capacity of the country to provide the social services essential to the 
promotion of human rights. Burkina Faso made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Singapore<b> </b>noted that Zimbabwe had achieved impressive results in several important 
areas. However, it underlined that the country continued to face significant challenges from 
the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Singapore made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Viet Nam<b> </b>asked the delegation whether it could share the measures applied or to be 
applied to assure the right to food for the population, especially for those who lived in 
remote and rural areas. Viet Nam made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Austria<b> </b>asked how Zimbabwe had addressed the problem of impunity and had 
ensured an independent work by prosecutorial authorities and how it had investigated the 
cases of alleged summary executions, torture and sexual violence in June and July 2008. 
Austria wanted also to know how Zimbabwe would reduce pretrial detention. Finally, it 
asked whether corporal punishment was used as a disciplinary measure in penal institutions. 
Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. The Czech Republic<b> </b>made recommendations. </p>


<p>65. Zambia<b> </b>noted that Zimbabwe was party to several human rights instruments. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Norway<b> </b>reiterated its support for the GNU and the ongoing constitutional process 
and hoped that it would lead to free and fair elections. However, it expressed its concerns 
over the cases of arbitrary arrests, detention and harassment of civil society activists, NGOs 
and human rights defenders. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Chad<b> </b>noted that despite efforts made on human rights and humanitarian law, much 
remained to be done, especially following sanctions against Zimbabwe. It also requested 
information on substantive contents of specific Acts. Chad made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. India noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s promotion of women&#8217;s participation in politics and 
decision-making and the lack of specific provisions on quotas, hoping that the 
Constitutional review would pay attention to women and children. India commended 
Zimbabwe for its literacy rate. India noted food insecurity, asking how it would be 
confronted. India noted the Human Rights Commission, urging its compliance with the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>69. Mexico acknowledged Zimbabwe&#8217;s human rights achievements, particularly the 
Human Rights, Media, Anti-Corruption and Elections commissions, and the inclusion of 
MDGs in its social protection, agricultural development, health and gender equality 
policies. Mexico hoped that the legislative framework and administrative measures of those 
commissions fulfilled international standards and that the Human Rights Commission is in 
full compliance with the Paris principles. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. The Republic of Korea acknowledged Zimbabwe&#8217;s human rights protection and 
promotion measures: the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission; its high literacy rate; the 
HIV/AIDS rate&#8217;s decrease; and GPA. It encouraged an inclusive Constitution drafting 
</p>
<p>process. It noted the State&#8217;s lack of cooperation with some human rights mechanisms. 
Despite Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts to promote gender mainstreaming and women&#8217;s participation 
in politics, it expressed concern over the primacy of customary law regarding marriage and 
inheritance. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Brazil acknowledged Zimbabwe&#8217;s measures to promote food security but despite the 
increase in food production, it noted that food security remained an issue of concern. Brazil 
noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s high levels of primary-school enrolment and its literacy rate but 
remained concerned at the impact of poor nutrition on drop-out rates. It recognized the &#8220;de 
facto moratorium&#8221; in the death penalty and the constitutional debate about possibly 
abolishing  it. Brazil made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Germany was concerned about torture, ill-treatment and inhuman prison conditions, 
the militias and youth brigades&#8217; widespread violence. It asked about measures taken against 
impunity. It referred to censorship and governmental control of media and asked how the 
new Constitution would safeguard press freedom. Germany commended the Human Rights 
Commission. It noted the Public Order and Security Act which restricted the right to 
assembly. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Poland welcomed Zimbabwe&#8217;s participation in the UPR process. Poland made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Malaysia noted Zimbabwe&#8217;s human rights challenges, mainly the economic 
sanctions and financial instability, the impact of HIV/AIDS, the continued drought, 
governance issues and corruption. Malaysia noted the GPA and its formalization into 
legislation as a measure of political and economic stability. Malaysia made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>75. Portugal asked about the amendment on death-penalty legal provisions. Portugal 
was concerned about torture, ill-treatment and prison conditions, human rights defenders&#8217; 
harassment, children&#8217;s sexual abuse, and child labour and trafficking despite the Children&#8217;s 
National Action Programme. Portugal acknowledged the Domestic Water Supply and 
Sanitation Policy but noted the inaccessibility to safe water and basic sanitation by 
vulnerable populations. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Ireland noted the GPA and the electoral process reforms, and the legal provisions 
against the rights of assembly and association.  It urged Zimbabwe to revise the public 
order legislation in that respect, to safeguard the rights to protection and safety and to 
administer in an impartial manner the revised legislation. Ireland was concerned by the use 
of torture and cruel and degrading treatment by State actors. Ireland made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>77. Slovakia<b> </b>took positive note of the establishment of the Public Protector to protect 
citizens against administrative malpractice, as well as the criminalization of human 
trafficking. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Thailand<b> </b>urged the Government to ensure the effective functioning of human rights 
mechanisms already established and to strengthen the rule of law and the justice system. It 
also noted that certain customary law restricted women&#8217;s rights. Thailand made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Bangladesh<b> </b>commended Zimbabwe for the progress made in many socio-economic 
and political areas. It also underlined the challenges faced by the country in terms of food 
insecurity and women&#8217;s representation in elective bodies and HIV/AIDS. Bangladesh made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Belgium<b> </b>regretted that the death penalty was still included in the penal code despite 
a de facto moratorium. Belgium mentioned abuses carried out by the army and the police, 
especially in the Marange region. It wanted to know how the Government would prohibit 
these violations and which sanctions were taken towards perpetrators. Belgium made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Slovenia<b> </b>welcomed the signing of the Zimbabwe United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework. It expressed concern about the number of working children and 
over the health risk to vulnerable populations presented by the lack of access to safe water 
and sanitation. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. The Syrian Arab Republic commended Zimbabwe&#8217;s efforts in the protection of 
public freedoms and the promotion of democracy. It stated that Zimbabwe had suffered and 
continued to suffer from foreign intervention, unilateral economic and political sanctions 
imposed by countries seeking to abolish Zimbabwe&#8217;s independent decision-making and 
seize its resources. It encouraged Zimbabwe to pursue its efforts for economic and social 
promotion. 
</p>
<p>83. Denmark<b> </b>noted positive developments within the fields of human rights since the 
establishment of the GPA and the introduction of an inclusive Government, but it also 
pointed out the recent rise in human rights abuses. It underlined limitations to freedoms of 
assembly and association, the extensive control over the media and unlawful arrests of civil 
leaders. Denmark made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>84. Indonesia<b> </b>noted with appreciation the progress achieved since 2009 when the GNU 
had been established as well as the process of amending the Constitution to include clear-
cut provisions on the promotion and protection of human rights. Indonesia made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>85. Romania<b> </b>noticed elements of progress in the overall human rights situation in the 
country but pointed out that challenges in the human rights protection system remained. It 
noted that, despite an invitation, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture was 
denied the right to visit in 2009. Romania made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. Switzerland<b> </b>noted with appreciation that the Government had adopted national 
policies aimed at promoting the democratic process. However, it mentioned that the 
perpetrators of the serious violations of human rights carried out during the last presidential 
elections had not been yet brought to justice. It also indicated that, despite an official 
invitation, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture was denied access to the 
country in 2009. Switzerland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>87. Spain hoped that the new Constitution&#8217;s development would allow progress in 
recognizing and protecting human rights in Zimbabwe. Spain acknowledged the high level 
of literacy and the results of fight against AIDS. Spain noted the resettlement of thousands 
of people from Marange region and the operations to re-establish order, which have left 
thousands of people homeless. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. With respect to the problem of care for orphans arising from the internal conflict in 
the Anglican Church, Zimbabwe indicated that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare 
would continue monitoring the situation to ensure that no orphan would go unattended.  
</p>
<p>89. Zimbabwe recalled that POSA, as an act of Parliament, did not discriminate on the 
grounds of political affiliation, race, gender, etc. The rationale of POSA was to ensure a 
delicate balance between the rights of demonstrators and others who wanted to proceed 
with their daily business without hindrance. Zimbabwe indicated that its police participated 
in many United Nations peacekeeping missions. 
</p>
<p>90. Regarding conditions of detention, in 2000 the Government established the &#8220;open 
prison&#8221; system which sought to promote rehabilitation and reintegration by allowing 
inmates to leave and work under minimal supervision. The system was meant to decongest 
the country&#8217;s prisons while enhancing the programme of rehabilitation and reintegration of 
inmates back into their societies. There was one open prison for male inmates. However, 
preparations for opening an open prison for female inmates were under way and there were 
plans to hold all female inmates under the open prison system as they were usually 
convicted of offences which did not require custodial sentences. 
</p>
<p>91. The Government of Zimbabwe has extended invitations to all special-procedures 
mandate holders, but the problem had been failure to reach agreement on the timing of the 
visits.  
</p>
<p>92. Zimbabwe raised the issue of interdependence between civil and political rights and 
the economic, social and cultural rights. It underlined that Member States seemed to play 
with a double standard over their commitments under the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights. It reaffirmed that the two set of rights were interdependent and the violations of one 
set affected the other. Zimbabwe stressed it was under economic sanctions imposed 
illegally by the European Union, the United Kingdom, some Commonwealth countries and 
the United States of America and that those countries had the obligation under the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights not to damage the rights of 
peoples in developing countries. On the subject of the Marange diamonds, the delegation 
stressed that allegations of human rights violations were false; Zimbabwe invited countries 
to visit the Marange area without prior notice and assess the situation on the ground, but no 
country had responded to that invitation. </p>
