<p><b>  Mission to the Gambia: comments of the 
Government of Sri Lanka on the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The following document represents the views and comments of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of of Sri Lanka in respect of the Report of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, drafted following a 
</b></p>
<p><b>country visit to of Sri Lanka from 19 to 26 May 2014. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para 07 
</b></p>
<p>With a view to mitigate the issues of migrant workers abroad, the Sri Lanka 
</p>
<p>Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has introduced a training system for 
</p>
<p>migrant workers, i.e Level 3 qualification of &#8216;National Vocational Qualification&#8217; 
</p>
<p>(NVQ). The introduction of this training system has reduced the number of 
</p>
<p>complaints of migrant workers from 52% to 33%.  
</p>
<p>Any migrant worker, who has Level 3 NVQ, is considered as a  &#8220;house- keeping 
</p>
<p>assistant&#8221;. House-keeping assistants are eligible to claim better benefits, such as 
</p>
<p>insurance etc., during their employment in the receiving country.   
</p>
<p><b>  Para 09 
</b></p>
<p>Percentage of Sri Lankan migrant men should read as 59.7% (2013 statistics) <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para 10 
</b></p>
<p>A considerable number of persons of Tamil ethnicity have migrated to Western countries 
</p>
<p>and not to Middle Eastern countries. Therefore, migration to non-Middle Eastern countries 
</p>
<p>does not come under the purview of the subject matter. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>The lack of economic opportunities and livelihood continue to be determining factors 
</p>
<p>which compel people to go abroad in search of better economic benefits. This is common to 
</p>
<p>all communities in Sri Lanka and is not confined to any specific ethnic group.  
</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, domestic workers choose overseas employment for two main reasons i.e. (a) 
</p>
<p>to be able to build a house (b) to be able to avail of better education facilities for their 
</p>
<p>children. Both are long-term objectives. Usually, when migrant workers are unable to 
</p>
<p>achieve these objectives, they tend seek repeated employment abroad. Such repeated 
</p>
<p>employment abroad by a father or mother of a family leads to complex social issues that 
</p>
<p>have a detrimental effect on the family. Having taken into consideration this phenomenon, 
</p>
<p>the SLBFE is working with the Ministry of Economic Development to help the families of 
</p>
<p>migrant workers build houses. Under this programme, low-interest-rate loans are provided 
</p>
<p>to the migrant workers before they leave Sri Lanka for foreign employment. They are 
</p>
<p>encouraged to complete building their houses within the first six months of their work 
</p>
<p>abroad. This scheme helps migrant workers achieve their dream of building a house by the 
</p>
<p>time they complete their tenure of employment abroad. It also helps migrant workers to 
</p>
<p>refrain from seeking repeated foreign employment enabling them to focus on their families&#8217; 
</p>
<p>welfare upon their return and seek employment locally thereafter.  
</p>
<p>SLBFE is also providing scholarships for the children of migrant workers to facilitate 
</p>
<p>educational needs. During 2013, the Bureau has mobilized 2500 scholarships. This number 
</p>
<p>is expected to increase up to 3000 by 2015. SLBFE also conducts some talent events and 
</p>
<p>reality shows among migrant workers and their family members as a means of recognizing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>their work, and their contribution to the economy. This is also aimed at providing 
</p>
<p>opportunities to them to discover and showcase their talents and skills.  
</p>
<p><b>  Para 12 
</b></p>
<p>Sri Lanka signed the International Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>(CRPD) in March 2007. Following the election of the new President, Mr. Maithripala 
</p>
<p>Sirisena on 8
th
</p>
<p> January 2015 and the formation of the new Government, a consultation 
</p>
<p>process was initiated in May 2015, to take steps towards early ratification of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Para 14 
</b></p>
<p>The ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children was completed on 15 May 2015. The Instrument of 
</p>
<p>Ratification has lodged with the UN Secretary General in the first week of June 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>  Para 26 
</b></p>
<p>The Department of Immigration and Emigration which was previously under the purview 
</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Defence was placed under the purview of the Ministry of Policy Planning 
</p>
<p>and Economic Affairs, under the new Government formed following the January 8th 2015 
</p>
<p>Presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>The travel document is issued by the Department of Immigration and Emigration of Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka based on the National Identity Card (NIC) and the Birth Certificate. These two 
</p>
<p>documents are generated by two different government institutions i.e Department of 
</p>
<p>Registration of Persons and Registrar General&#8217;s Department. Therefore, eventually, issuing 
</p>
<p>of a travel document involves three different government institutions; the Department of 
</p>
<p>Immigration and Emigration, the Department of Registration of Persons and the 
</p>
<p>Department of Registrar General.  
</p>
<p>The issuing of a NIC is also not handled by a single institution. For example, the <i>Grama 
</i></p>
<p><i>Niladari </i>(Village Officer), Divisional Secretariat and the Department of Registration of 
</p>
<p>Persons are involved in issuing a NIC.  
</p>
<p>Under these processes, changing the date on a birth certificate or issuing a forged birth 
</p>
<p>certificate or a travel document is not an easy task. 
</p>
<p>While, the issuance of forged travel documents or issuance of genuine travel 
</p>
<p>documents based on false documents (unknowingly) or issuing visa based 
</p>
<p>on using forged documents is a global issue and is not only confined to Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka, all possible steps are being taken continuously by remaining alert to 
</p>
<p>ensure that such incidents do not occur. 
</p>
<p><b>  Para 28 
</b></p>
<p>In terms of Section 15 of the Human Rights Commission (HRC) of Sri Lanka Act No.21 of 
</p>
<p>1996, any authority or person to whom a recommendation has been made is required to 
</p>
<p>report to the HRC of the action or proposed action taken to give effect to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the HRC. If any authority or person fails to report to the Commission 
</p>
<p>of the action or proposed action to give effect to the recommendation or it is the view of the 
</p>
<p>HRC that the action taken is inadequate, the HRC is required to submit a full report of the 
</p>
<p>facts to His Excellency the President who shall cause such report to be placed before 
</p>
<p>Parliament. Further to the above statutory requirement, the Ministry of Public 
</p>
<p>Administration issued Circular 17/2005 to all public institutions directing them that they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 </b> 
</p>
<p>should take necessary action to implement the recommendations of the HRC. In the event 
</p>
<p>they are unable for good reason to implement any recommendations they are obliged to 
</p>
<p>inform the Human Rights Commission of such reason/s. 
</p>
<p>The change of Government following the Presidential election held in Sri Lanka on 8 
</p>
<p>January 2015, has ushered in an atmosphere necessary for greater focus on <i>inter alia</i> 
</p>
<p>independence of institutions including the Human Rights Commission. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka Parliament adopted the 19
th
</p>
<p> Amendment to the Constitution on 28
th
</p>
<p> April 2015, 
</p>
<p>which will set up an independent Human Rights Commission among other independent 
</p>
<p>commissions. 
</p>
<p>The Government hopes that setting up of an Independent Human Rights Commission, 
</p>
<p>following the constitutional amendment, would enable the Human Rights Commission to 
</p>
<p>obtain &#8216;A&#8217; status accreditation in compliance with the Paris Principles relating to the status 
</p>
<p>of national institutions.         
</p>
<p><b>  Para 35 
</b></p>
<p>The SLBFE has established a special Investigation Division to address the issues of 
exploitation of migrant workers at the recruitment process. This Division is empowered to 
</p>
<p>take legal action against wrong doers. Annually, SLBFE entertains more than 3000 cases in 
</p>
<p>connection with the exploitation of migrant workers. Cases are generally attended within 1- 
</p>
<p>2 months. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para 36 
</b></p>
<p>Many of the issues/problems that migrant workers face/come across in receiving countries 
</p>
<p>are as a result of the actions or inaction of the sponsors or employers and not as a result of 
</p>
<p>issues in connection with recruitment practices prevailing in the country. The migrant 
</p>
<p>workers are always encouraged by the SLBFE to follow the guidelines introduced by the 
SLBFE to ensure transparent recruitment practices in Sri Lanka. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para 43 
</b></p>
<p>SLBFE welcomes complaints against it and ideas and recommendations. The SLBFE does 
</p>
<p>not refuse to accept complaints and instead, welcomes them as such complaints will enable 
</p>
<p>the SLBFE to identify problems, deliberate on them and take steps to address them. 
</p>
<p>Usually, the migrant workers who are not covered by insurance schemes are provided 
</p>
<p>relief/compensation through the Workers Welfare Fund (WWF).  
</p>
<p><b>  Para 62 
</b></p>
<p>Sri Lanka has complied with Article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and does not discriminate against women by 
</p>
<p>any form of distinction, exclusion or restriction either by law or administrative practice. 
</p>
<p>Article 12 (1) of the Constitution has clearly laid down the principle that all persons are 
</p>
<p>equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Further Article 12 
</p>
<p>(4) of the Constitution states that nothing in Article 12 would prevent special provisions 
</p>
<p>being made by law for the advancement of women, children and disabled persons. Article 
</p>
<p>12(2) of the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sex.  
</p>
<p>For over 60 years, women in Sri Lanka have benefited from the universal health care 
</p>
<p>system and the universal free education system from primary to the point of completion of 
</p>
<p>the first degree at University (tertiary levels). These policies which continue to be in force 
</p>
<p>have contributed significantly to women&#8217;s empowerment, near equal participation in the 
</p>
<p>labour force as well as increased engagement in decision-making processes. Attitudinal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>changes that favour the position of women in society have been possible largely due to high 
</p>
<p>levels of educational attainment and women being thereby recognized as equal partners and 
</p>
<p>valuable contributors to the development process. Women continue to enjoy rights equal 
</p>
<p>with men, both in political and public life. However, the number of women participating in 
</p>
<p>active leadership roles in party politics remains low when compared to the percentage of 
</p>
<p>women in the workforce. Women&#8217;s participation in standing for election has been low 
</p>
<p>although participation in political activity is high. This issue is receiving attention of the 
</p>
<p>relevant political parties at present. Despite the low number of women political 
</p>
<p>representatives, women&#8217;s participation in the formulation of government policy, holding 
</p>
<p>public office and performing public functions at all levels of the Government has increased. 
</p>
<p>Today, women in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service number 1070 out of a total cadre of 
</p>
<p>2269 (which is 47.15 %), an increase from 17.1% in 1993. In the Sri Lanka Planning 
</p>
<p>Service, the percentage of women is 47.63%, an increase from 28.8% in 1993. In the Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka Foreign Service, the percentage of women is 47.5%, an increase from 29.7% in 
</p>
<p>1993. It is to be noted that when it comes to professional services, participation of women 
</p>
<p>is increasing, but is purely based on merit and not on quotas on the basis of gender. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>Both male &amp; female migrant workers maintain a close relationship with the SLBFE 
especially because of the pre-departure arrangements made by the SLBFE.  
</p>
<p><b>  Para 71 
</b></p>
<p>Prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur to the Mirihana Detention Centre for migrants, 
</p>
<p>he met with the Controller-General of the Department of Immigration &amp; Emigration (CG-I 
</p>
<p>&amp; E) who explained in detail, the administrative process in place with regard to persons 
</p>
<p>who have violated Sri Lankan Immigration &amp; Emigration laws. In this context, the 
</p>
<p>(authorities) wishes to provide the following details with regard to procedures on this 
</p>
<p>matter. 
</p>
<p>(a) Any person who has violated the Immigration and Emigration Laws of Sri 
</p>
<p>Lanka may be detained until such time as arrangements are made for his/her 
</p>
<p>departure. Any person who has violated the Immigrants and Emigrants Act, may be 
</p>
<p>ordered to be removed from the country as soon as possible as per Sec. 28 (1) (a), 
</p>
<p>(b), (c) of the amended Immigrants and Emigrants Act. No. 20 of 1948.  For 
</p>
<p>removing a person from Sri Lanka Sec. 28, Sec. 45 and Sec. 48 should be read 
</p>
<p>together. 
</p>
<p>(b) All such cases of detention are individually assessed to establish nationality, 
</p>
<p>reasons for violating immigration regulations etc, in order to liaise with foreign 
</p>
<p>missions, IOM, families of the detainees to facilitate early departure. Foreigners who 
</p>
<p>are found violating Immigration regulations are immediately removed from the 
</p>
<p>country if there is a valid passport and a return air ticket in their possession.  In the 
</p>
<p>event the persons concerned do not have the required 
</p>
<p>documentation/tickets/finances, authorities are compelled to house them in the 
</p>
<p>Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre, until suitable arrangements for deportation 
</p>
<p>are made.  During this period, authorities make every possible effort to obtain valid 
</p>
<p>travel documents for these persons by liaising with the respective embassies 
</p>
<p>expeditiously.  
</p>
<p>(c) Those in detention at the Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre  are free to 
</p>
<p>move in and out of the facility. They have access to mobile phones and internet and 
</p>
<p>are provided free medical care. 
</p>
<p>(d) With regard to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meeting with four children who have 
</p>
<p>stayed in the Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre with their families for a long 
</p>
<p>duration: these 4 children were released by the Department of Immigration and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 </b> 
</p>
<p>Emigration in the end of September 2014, as it is not the Department&#8217;s intention to 
</p>
<p>restrict the personal liberty of any person without fair reason. The family which 
</p>
<p>theses children belonged to are considered as stateless persons and irregular 
</p>
<p>immigrants. It is these circumstances pertaining to the family that compelled the 
</p>
<p>concerned authorities to house them in the Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre. 
</p>
<p>They did not have any valid documents or traces to prove their origin or nationality. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities referred them to UNHCR to take determine the status of 
</p>
<p>the family consisting of four children while they were being housed in the Mirihana 
</p>
<p>Immigration Detention Centre. The authorities released them from immigration 
</p>
<p>custody based on humanitarian grounds and mutual understanding, with the 
</p>
<p>assurance of UNHCR that they will be moved to a third country for resettlement as 
</p>
<p>early as possible. 
</p>
<p>(e) With regard to the 11 migrant detainees at Boossa Detention Centre: they 
</p>
<p>were kept there as a temporary measure and have since been released. 
</p>
<p>(f) The authorities wishes to emphasize that detention of irregular migrants is a 
</p>
<p>step taken only as a measure of last resort and always for a very short time period in 
</p>
<p>order to make necessary arrangements for their departure. It is not the intention of 
</p>
<p>the authorities to detain families and children at any point, but under certain 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances, authorities are compelled to keep them in approved 
</p>
<p>places to ensure their security and safety until their repatriation.  All possible 
</p>
<p>alternatives have been explored prior to such steps being taken.  
</p>
<p><b>  Para 106 
</b></p>
<p>Repeal of circular requiring the Family Background Report to be furnished by female 
</p>
<p>domestic workers, based on which mothers with children below 5 years will be prevented 
</p>
<p>from leaving for employment until the younger child reaches the age of 5 years: This is 
</p>
<p>considered Government Policy taken by the Cabinet of Ministers to ensure the safeguarding 
</p>
<p>of the rights of children.
