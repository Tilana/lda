<p>18 December 2014, concerning the proclamation of, preparations for, observance and 
</p>
<p>commemoration of the International Year of the Family and its tenth and twentieth 
</p>
<p>anniversaries , 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the preparations for and observance of the twentieth anniversary of 
</p>
<p>the International Year of the Family provide a unique opportunity to draw further attention 
</p>
<p>to the objectives of the International Year for increasing cooperation at all levels on family 
</p>
<p>issues and for undertaking concerted actions to strengthen family-centred policies and 
</p>
<p>programmes as part of an integrated comprehensive approach to the advancement of human 
</p>
<p>rights and development, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States have the primary responsibility to promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and 
</p>
<p>protection of children and that children, for the full and harmonious development of their 
</p>
<p>personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, 
</p>
<p>love and understanding, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural 
</p>
<p>environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, 
</p>
<p>should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its 
</p>
<p>responsibilities within the community, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and 
</p>
<p>is entitled to protection by society and the State, 
</p>
<p><i>Notes with concern </i>that the contribution of the family in society and in the 
</p>
<p>achievement of development goals continues to be largely overlooked and 
</p>
<p>underemphasized, and recognizing the potential of the family to contribute to national 
</p>
<p>development and to the achievement of major objectives of every society and of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, including the eradication of poverty and the creation of just, stable and secure 
</p>
<p>societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Conscious </i>that the majority of the internationally agreed development goals, 
</p>
<p>especially those relating to the reduction of poverty, education of children and the reduction 
</p>
<p>of maternal mortality, would be difficult to attain unless the strategies to achieve them 
</p>
<p>focus on the family, which can contribute positively to, inter alia, eradicating poverty and 
</p>
<p>hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering 
</p>
<p>women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating HIV/AIDS, 
</p>
<p>malaria and other diseases, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes </i>the holding of the panel discussion on the protection of the family 
</p>
<p>and its members by the Human Rights Council on 15 September 2014, during its twenty-
</p>
<p>seventh session, and takes note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the summary of the panel discussion;1 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also welcomes </i>the holding of a plenary meeting during the sixty-ninth 
</p>
<p>session of the General Assembly, in December 2014, on the observance of the twentieth 
</p>
<p>anniversary of the International Year of the Family, in order to discuss the role of family-
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>oriented policies in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledges all other international and regional initiatives in the context of celebrating 
</p>
<p>that anniversary; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Acknowledges </i>the efforts made by Governments, the United Nations system 
</p>
<p>and civil society to fulfil the objectives guiding the preparations for the twentieth 
</p>
<p>anniversary of the International Year at the national, regional and international levels, and 
</p>
<p>urges States to continue to make every possible effort to realize the objectives of the 
</p>
<p>International Year and its follow-up processes, and to develop strategies and programmes 
</p>
<p>aimed at strengthening national capacities to address national priorities relating to family 
</p>
<p>issues; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society 
</p>
<p>and is entitled to protection by society and the State; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>reaffirms </i>that States have the primary responsibility to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings, and stresses the 
</p>
<p>fundamental importance of full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of all 
</p>
<p>family members<b>;</b> 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Recognizes </i>that the family, while respect for the rights of its members is 
</p>
<p>ensured, is a strong force for social cohesion and integration, intergenerational solidarity 
</p>
<p>and social development, and that the family plays a crucial role in the preservation of 
</p>
<p>cultural identity, traditions, morals, heritage and the values system of society; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Conscious </i>that families are sensitive to strain caused by social and economic 
</p>
<p>changes, and expresses deep concern that conditions have worsened for many families 
</p>
<p>owing to economic and financial crises, lack of job security, temporary employment and 
</p>
<p>lack of regular income and gainful employment, as well as measures taken by Governments 
</p>
<p>seeking to balance their budget by reducing social expenditure; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recognizes</i> that the family unit is facing increasing vulnerabilities; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> Member States to create a conducive environment to strengthen and 
</p>
<p>support all families, recognizing that equality between women and men and respect for all 
</p>
<p>the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all family members are essential to family 
</p>
<p>well-being and to society at large, noting the importance of reconciliation of work and 
</p>
<p>family life and recognizing the principle of shared parental responsibility for the upbringing 
</p>
<p>and development of the child; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underlines </i>that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing 
</p>
<p>and protection of children from infancy to adolescence, that the introduction of children to 
</p>
<p>the culture, values and norms of their society begins in the family, and that in order to better 
</p>
<p>ensure the full and harmonious development of their personality, children should grow up 
</p>
<p>in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, and, 
</p>
<p>accordingly, all institutions of society should respect and support the efforts of parents and 
</p>
<p>other caregivers to nurture and care for children in a family environment; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Urges</i> States to take appropriate measures to ensure that a child is not 
</p>
<p>separated from his or her parents against his or her will, except when competent authorities 
</p>
<p>subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that 
</p>
<p>such a separation is necessary for the best interests of the child, and also to ensure that in no 
</p>
<p>case shall a child be separated from his or her parents on the basis of a disability of either 
</p>
<p>the child or one or both of the parents; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right of the child to education and that education should be 
</p>
<p>directed to the development of the child&#8217;s personality, talents and mental and physical 
</p>
<p>abilities to their fullest potential, the development of respect for human rights and </p>


<p>fundamental freedoms, the development of respect for the child&#8217;s parents, his or her own 
</p>
<p>cultural identity, language and values; the preparation of the child for responsible life in a 
</p>
<p>free society, in the spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes, and 
</p>
<p>friendship among all peoples, ethnic, national and religious groups and persons of 
</p>
<p>indigenous origin;, and also reaffirms that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of 
</p>
<p>education to be given to their children and have the primary responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>upbringing and development of the child,  while also bearing in mind that the best interests 
</p>
<p>of the child should be the guiding principle of those responsible for the child&#8217;s education 
</p>
<p>and guidance;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Highlights </i>the role of family members, especially parents and other legal 
</p>
<p>guardians, in strengthening the self-image, self-esteem and status of girls and in protecting 
</p>
<p>their health and well-being; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Stresses </i>that equality between women and men, women&#8217;s equal participation 
</p>
<p>in employment and shared parental responsibility are essential elements of a policy on the 
</p>
<p>family  ; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Regrets </i>that women&#8217;s social and economic contributions to the welfare of the 
</p>
<p>family and the social significance of maternity and paternity continue to be inadequately 
</p>
<p>addressed and that women continue on many occasions to bear a disproportionate share of 
</p>
<p>household responsibilities and the care of children, the sick and elderly, and in this regard 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the need to consistently address such imbalances and to ensure that maternity, 
</p>
<p>motherhood, parenting and the role of women in procreation is not a basis for 
</p>
<p>discrimination nor for restricting the full participation of women in society; </p>
<p>16. <i>Notes</i> that single-headed households, child-headed households and 
</p>
<p>intergenerational households are particularly vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion; </p>
<p>17<i>. Resolves </i>to pay particular attention to family units headed by women and 
</p>
<p>children, while bearing in mind that a considerable proportion of households worldwide are 
</p>
<p>headed by women and many other households are dependent on female income, and that 
</p>
<p>female-maintained households are very often among the poorest because of wage 
</p>
<p>discrimination, occupational segregation patterns in the labour market and other gender-
</p>
<p>based barriers; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Emphasizes </i>that States should ensure that children with disabilities have 
</p>
<p>equal rights with respect to family life with a view to realizing these rights, and to prevent 
</p>
<p>concealment, abandonment, neglect and segregation of children with disabilities, and that 
</p>
<p>States should take measures to provide early and comprehensive information, services and 
</p>
<p>support to children with disabilities and their families; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Stresses </i>that persons with disabilities and their family members should 
</p>
<p>receive the necessary protection and assistance to enable families to contribute towards the 
</p>
<p>full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities, and that States should, 
</p>
<p>where the immediate family is unable to care for a child with disabilities, make every effort 
</p>
<p>to provide alternative care within the wider family, and failing that, within the community 
</p>
<p>in a family setting; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Recognizes </i>the positive impact that policies and measures to protect the 
</p>
<p>family can have on protecting and promoting the human rights of its members and can 
</p>
<p>contribute to, inter alia, decreasing drop-out rates from educational institutions, achieving 
</p>
<p>equality between women and men and girls and boys, empowering women and girls and 
</p>
<p>enhancing the protection against violence, abuses, sexual exploitation, harmful practices 
</p>
<p>and the worst forms of child labour, while bearing in mind that violations and abuses of the 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms of family members adversely affect families and 
</p>
<p>have a negative impact on efforts aimed at protecting the family; </p>


<p>21. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of strengthening intergenerational partnerships 
</p>
<p>and solidarity among generations, and calls upon States in this regard to promote 
</p>
<p>opportunities for voluntary, constructive and regular interaction between young people and 
</p>
<p>older generations in the family, in the workplace and in society at large; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Recognizes</i> that stable, supportive and nurturing family relationships, 
</p>
<p>supported by communities and, where available, professional services, can provide a vital 
</p>
<p>shield against substance abuse, particularly among minors; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Urges</i> States, in accordance with their respective obligations under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, to provide the family, as the natural and fundamental group 
</p>
<p>unit of the society, with effective protection and assistance, and encourages States in this 
</p>
<p>regard to take, as appropriate and to the maximum of their available resources, measures 
</p>
<p>including: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Creating family-friendly policies to support the family, and assessing such 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes for their impact on family well-being; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Designing, implementing and promoting family-sensitive policies in the field 
</p>
<p>of housing, work, health, social security and education in order to create an environment 
</p>
<p>supportive of the family, including affordable, accessible and quality care services for 
</p>
<p>children and other dependants, parental and other leave schemes, campaigns to sensitize 
</p>
<p>public opinion and other relevant actors on equal sharing of employment and family 
</p>
<p>responsibilities between women and men; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Analysing policies and programmes, including those relating to 
</p>
<p>macroeconomic stability, structural adjustment programmes, taxation, investments, 
</p>
<p>employment, markets and all relevant sectors of the economy with respect to their impact 
</p>
<p>on family well-being and conditions; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Supporting research and developing comprehensive strategies to enhance the 
</p>
<p>ability of families and communities to care for older family members  and to reinforce the 
</p>
<p>role of grandparents in raising grandchildren; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Addressing the causes and mitigating the consequences of family 
</p>
<p>disintegration; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Facilitating, as appropriate, the integration of families into society, and their 
</p>
<p>reunification, preservation and protection, including by providing adequate shelter, access 
</p>
<p>to basic services and a sustainable livelihood; 
</p>
<p>(g) Working towards reducing poverty by, inter alia, granting assistance to 
</p>
<p>families in difficult life situations and increasing the earning power of all adult members of 
</p>
<p>economically deprived families; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) Providing and promoting means to facilitate compatibility between labour 
</p>
<p>force participation and parental responsibilities, especially for single-parent households 
</p>
<p>with young children, and paying special attention to the needs of widows and orphans 
</p>
<p>through means including health insurance and social security, cash and in-kind transfer 
</p>
<p>programmes, day-care centres and facilities for breastfeeding mothers within the work 
</p>
<p>premises, kindergartens, part-time jobs, paid parental leave, paid maternity leave, flexible 
</p>
<p>work schedules and reproductive and child health-care services; 
</p>
<p>(<i>i</i>) Strengthening or, if necessary, establishing relevant national agencies or 
</p>
<p>governmental bodies responsible for the implementation and monitoring of family policies; 
</p>
<p>24. <i>Calls upon</i> States and encourages non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>community organizations concerned to develop innovative ways to provide more effective 
</p>
<p>assistance to families and the individuals within them who may be affected by specific </p>


<p>problems, such as extreme poverty, chronic unemployment, illness, domestic and sexual 
</p>
<p>violence, dowry payments, drug or alcohol dependence, incest, child abuse, neglect or 
</p>
<p>abandonment; 
</p>
<p>25. <i>Recognizes </i>the important role of civil society, including research institutes 
</p>
<p>and academia, in advocacy, promotion, research and policymaking and, as appropriate, 
</p>
<p>evaluation of family policy development and capacity-building; 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Also</i> <i>recognizes </i>that the family plays a key role in social development, and as 
</p>
<p>such should be strengthened and attention paid to the rights, capabilities and responsibilities 
</p>
<p>of its members, and invites States, the organizations of the United Nations system and all 
</p>
<p>other relevant stakeholders to take into account the role of the family, as a contributor to 
</p>
<p>sustainable development, and the need to strengthen family policy development in their 
</p>
<p>ongoing efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals; </p>
<p>27. <i>Encourages </i>States to give due consideration to the role and status of the 
</p>
<p>family in the context of the ongoing negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>and invites States to consider mainstreaming the promotion of family-oriented policies as a 
</p>
<p>cross-cutting issue in the proposed goals and targets of the post-2015 agenda; 
</p>
<p>28. <i>Invites</i> States to consider mainstreaming the promotion of family-oriented 
</p>
<p>policies as a cross-cutting issue in national development plans and programmes; 
</p>
<p>29. <i>Highlights</i> the need for continued inter-agency and regional cooperation on 
</p>
