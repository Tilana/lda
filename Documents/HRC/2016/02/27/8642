<p><b> I.   Introduction 
</b> 
</p>
<p>1.  Annual meetings of special rapporteurs/representatives, independent experts and 
chairs of working groups of the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights 
and the Human Rights Council have been held since 1994. The Vienna Declaration and 
Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 
underlined the importance of preserving and strengthening the system of special procedures 
and specified that the procedures and mechanisms should be enabled to harmonize and 
rationalize their work through periodic meetings (A/CONF.157/24 (part I), para. 95). 
</p>
<p>2. During the meeting, mandate holders held exchanges of views with the United 
Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the Human Rights 
Council and members of the Bureau, the former President of the Council, and with States. 
Participants met with participants in the eleventh Inter-Committee Meeting of treaty bodies, 
representatives of United Nations entities, field presences of the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and with representatives of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and national human rights institutions (NHRIs). 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>3. The meeting was opened by Mr. Santiago Corcuera, Chair of the sixteenth annual 
meeting and Chair of the Coordination Committee (Committee) of special procedures. 
</p>
<p>4. On 28 June 2010, Ms. Najat Maalla M&#8217;jid, Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, was elected Chair of the seventeenth 
annual meeting and of the Committee, and Mr. Shamsul Bari, independent expert on the 
situation of human rights in Somalia, was elected Rapporteur of the meeting and a member 
of the Committee. On 1 July, Ms. Catarina de Albuquerque, independent expert on the issue 
of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation; Mr. 
Githu Muigai, Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; Ms. Mirjana Najcevska, Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent; and Ms. Raquel Rolnik, Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, were endorsed as the four 
other members of the Committee selected by the Chair. 
</p>
<p>5. On 28 June 2010, the meeting adopted the agenda and the programme of work. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Activities of the Coordination Committee 
</b></p>
<p>6. The former Chair of the Coordination Committee briefed participants on the 
activities of the Committee in 2009/2010 and made suggestions on how to strengthen the 
special procedures system. He thanked all mandate holders for their valuable contributions, 
as well as for their encouragement and confidence throughout the year.  
</p>
<p>7. The former Chair recalled that there had been numerous developments in relation to 
the mandate, role and functions of the Committee since 2005, and that the Committee had 
taken a more proactive role to facilitate the interaction between special procedures, States 
and the Council, and to increase collaboration and information-sharing between mandates 
to reinforce the system of special procedures. The Manual of Operations of the Special 
Procedures of the Human Rights Council had been revised; a more systematic approach to 
situations, especially in the context of crises, where collective responses by special 
procedures could be justified and desirable had been developed, and an increasing number 
</p>
<p><b>4</b>  </p>


<p>of joint activities were being implemented. The Code of Conduct had been addressed 
through the Internal Advisory Procedure on practices and working methods, which allows 
any stakeholder, including States and mandate holders, to bring issues to the attention of the 
Committee for advice and guidance.  
</p>
<p>8. The former Chair informed participants that during 2009/2010 action had been taken 
in relation to the following issues: the selection procedure of new mandate holders; 
orientation sessions for new mandate holders; participation of special procedures in special 
sessions of the Council; facilitation of dialogue among mandate holders and States; 
guidance on working methods, including implementation of the Code of Conduct and the 
Internal Advisory Procedure; coordination of joint statements, including press releases; 
interaction with the President of the Human Rights Council, the members of the 
Consultative Group, other stakeholders and OHCHR in relation to a number of other 
thematic and country-related issues; and preparation of the annual meeting of mandate 
holders. It was noted that between 2009 and 2010 the Internal Advisory Procedure had been 
activated on two occasions by mandate holders. The outcome of the process had been 
communicated to those mandate holders, as well as to the President of the Council. 
</p>
<p>9. Participants expressed deep appreciation for the work of the former Chair and other 
members of the Coordination Committee and wished the new Committee well. They agreed 
that when the next  Committee would be constituted, there would be a call for expressions 
of interest. They noted the need for regular and strengthened engagement by the Committee 
with the Council over the next year and referred to the upcoming Council review as an 
opportunity for the Committee. They stressed the importance of strengthening the special 
procedures system through the forthcoming review, and discussed concerns regarding the 
application of the Code of Conduct, in particular allegations of violations considered 
unjustified or unsubstantiated. The linkages between the special procedures system and the 
universal periodic review were also highlighted, in particular the positive impact of the 
universal periodic review in cases where mandates had been given access to countries for 
official visits. Participants encouraged the new Committee to explore substantive 
involvement and participation by special procedures in the second cycle of the universal 
periodic review. 
</p>
<p>10. The former Chair thanked the Special Procedures Branch of OHCHR for its support 
to the Committee and for keeping mandate holders informed about developments at the 
Council throughout the year. 
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Exchange of views with the Deputy High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p>11.  Participants held an exchange of views with Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, United Nations 
Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ms. Kang emphasized the importance of 
the work of special procedures and reiterated the commitment of OHCHR to provide the 
system of special procedures with substantive and administrative support necessary for the 
effective discharge of the mandates. She indicated that the Office was available to assist 
special procedures to expand their scope of action with regard to early warning, which 
would enhance the capabilities of the Human Rights Council in that area. She noted that 
OHCHR would continue to support special procedures in their interaction with States in 
relation to follow-up to their recommendations, including through its field presences. She 
acknowledged the challenges that the special procedures faced in promoting follow-up to 
their recommendations and fulfilling additional mandates or carrying out additional 
activities within existing resources. She also suggested that consideration be given to the 
need to address lack of cooperation by some States, and situations of unjustified or 
unsubstantiated criticism. 
</p>
<p> <b>5 </b></p>


<p>12. Ms. Kang made clear that the Council review in 2011 was an opportunity for special 
procedures to suggest ways to strengthen that body. She suggested constructive engagement 
through concrete and practical proposals in relation to issues such as the role of special 
procedures in early warning, and in rapid response to urgent situations and cases of grave 
human rights violations, and emphasized the enhancement of interactive dialogues and 
follow-up by the Council to the work of the special procedures. She highlighted the 
synergies between the universal periodic review and the special procedures, with the 
outcome of the universal periodic review being an additional entry point for mandates to 
engage in dialogue at the national level. Special procedures could also suggest ways of 
enhancing the universal periodic review. As regards linkages with the human rights treaty 
bodies, the Deputy High Commissioner mentioned opportunities for further systematization 
of cooperation with, and the need to effectively follow up on the results of all the 
mechanisms through, other United Nations entities, OHCHR field offices and stakeholders. 
Ms. Kang commended the Coordination Committee for its work, including with regard to 
harmonized working methods and the challenges experienced by special procedures 
mandate holders. She also noted that she looked forward to the proposals of mandate 
holders relating to enhancing cooperation, dialogue and effectiveness in working methods 
and relations of mandate holders and the Office. OHCHR would work with the 
Coordination Committee on required follow-up. 
</p>
<p>13. Mandate holders expressed appreciation for the support that the Office provided to 
the special procedures and emphasized the importance of action with OHCHR on issues 
relating to the independence of mandate holders, cooperation by States, and follow-up on 
their work. The limited resources available negatively impacted on the capacity of 
mandates to enhance follow-up, conduct country visits and undertake other activities, 
including in relation to individual communications. The need to ensure adequate resources 
and their allocation in a transparent and equitable manner, and to involve mandate holders 
in that process, was underlined. Participants indicated the need to further enhance the 
transfer of knowledge to new mandate holders. A working group guided by the 
Coordination Committee Chair was established to identify issues of concern and suggested 
actions, including in respect of the relationship of mandate holders and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> V.  The Human Rights Council and the special procedures 
system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.   Exchange of views with the former President of the Human Rights 
Council 
</b></p>
<p>14. Mr. Alex van Meeuwen, Permanent Representative of Belgium to the United 
Nations Office at Geneva and former President of the Human Rights Council, highlighted 
the increased participation of special procedures in the work of the Council in panel 
discussions and special sessions, but suggested that it could be further enhanced through a 
more active contribution to the universal periodic review. He also stressed the importance 
of the proactive participation of mandate holders in the review of the Human Rights 
Council. The review provided an opportunity for mandate holders and others to reflect on 
the forms of cooperation of the Council with the special procedures, as well as the tools that 
needed to be strengthened or created to better communicate with States. He mentioned the 
need to continue engaging in a constructive dialogue with States, while safeguarding 
mandates and their independence.  
</p>
<p>15. Participants thanked Mr. Van Meeuwen for the support he gave to the special 
procedures during his presidency. They raised concerns with regard to States&#8217; allegations of 
</p>
<p><b>6</b>  </p>


<p>breaches of the Code of Conduct by mandate holders. Participants also raised issues 
regarding cooperation on country visits, and the selection and appointment of new mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Exchange of views with the President of the Human Rights Council and 
members of the Bureau 
</b></p>
<p>16. Participants had an exchange with the President of the Human Rights Council, Mr. 
Sihasak Phuangketkeow (Permanent Representative of Thailand to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva), and members of the Bureau, Ms. Bente Angell-Hansen (Permanent 
Representative of Norway), Mr. Arcanjo Maria Do Nascimento (Permanent Representative 
of Angola), Mr. Fedor Rosocha (Permanent Representative of Slovakia), and Mr. Juan 
Quintanilla, representing Mr. Rodolfo Reyes Rodr&#237;guez (Permanent Representative of 
Cuba). 
</p>
<p>17. The President indicated that his presidency would focus on nurturing a constructive, 
inclusive and transparent dialogue among all stakeholders, including States, civil society 
and mandate holders. The challenge of the upcoming Human Rights Council review 
provided opportunities and challenges, and he indicated that he was considering the 
proposal of his predecessor on the modalities of the review, including the meetings of the 
working group. 
</p>
<p>18. The President emphasized that the special procedures were a vital component of the 
United Nations human rights system. He would therefore strive to work with mandate 
holders to ensure a more productive and enhanced constructive dialogue between them and 
the Council. The President and Bureau members noted the need for an environment of 
mutual respect and assured special procedures of their support. Mandate holders called for 
support for their independence and cooperation by States, as well as for greater follow-up to 
their work. They proposed the enhancement of interactive dialogues and suggested their 
work should be more integrated into the Council, especially with regard to the universal 
periodic review.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Exchange of views with States 
</b></p>
<p>19. Mandate holders thanked States for the opportunity to engage in an open dialogue, 
and assured States of their intention to contribute to the improvement of the work and 
functioning of the Council, in particular with regard to enhancing the interaction and 
cooperation between special procedures and the Council. Mandate holders emphasized the 
importance of according them the possibility of participating in the Council review process 
as equal partners.  
</p>
<p>20. States stressed the importance of having direct exchanges with mandate holders in 
addition to interactive dialogues during Council sessions, and expressed support for the 
work of special procedures. Participants stressed the importance of preserving the 
independence, objectivity and impartiality of special procedures. Strategies to enhance 
cooperation between States and mandate holders were discussed, including: standing 
invitations; country visits; responses to communications, which should be both timely and 
substantive; follow-up to recommendations contained in thematic and country reports; and 
interactive dialogues between mandate holders and States. It was acknowledged that 
mandate holders faced a challenging task in fulfilling their mandates given available 
resources and capacity, and that continued and increased support was required from all 
stakeholders to achieve the promotion and protection of human rights on the ground for all.  
</p>
<p> <b>7 </b></p>


<p>21. State representatives and mandate holders agreed that the Human Rights Council 
review process afforded an opportunity for greater cooperation and collaboration among 
special procedures and States, and the creation of a working group of special procedures to 
interact with the Council in the review process was suggested. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Review of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>22. Participants discussed the role and approach of special procedures to the review of 
the Council. In its resolution 60/251 on the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly 
decided to review the status of the Council within five years, and that the Council would 
review its work and functioning five years after its establishment and report to the General 
Assembly. 
</p>
<p>23. Participants were briefed on the developments relating to ongoing formal and 
informal discussions on the review. They were informed that the General Assembly had 
appointed Mr. Christian Wenaweser, Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein, and Mr. 
Mohammed Loulichki, Permanent Representative of Morocco, to serve as co-facilitators for 
the consultations on the Council&#8217;s status review in New York. In its resolution 12/1, the 
Human Rights Council had created an open-ended intergovernmental working group on the 
review of the work and functioning of the Council to facilitate the process in the Council. It 
was noted that the modalities and schedule for the review were being discussed by States; 
the first session of the open-ended working group was scheduled for October 2010. Issues 
which had been raised in relation to special procedures included cooperation by States, 
enhancement of working methods, ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct, and 
financial and other support for special procedures. 
</p>
<p>24. Mandate holders were informed that the former President of the Human Rights 
Council had initiated consultations with States and presented a proposal for a road map and 
schedule for the review of the Council. The development of the road map was now in the 
hands of the incoming President. Some States had suggested the review follow the logic 
and order of resolution 5/1 of the Human Rights Council, including all mechanisms of the 
Council; others had suggested that the review consider and evaluate the scope of protection 
of human rights accorded to the Council at present under General Assembly resolution 
60/251. 
</p>
<p>25. Participants discussed the need for States and special procedures to take a more 
active role on the follow-up to recommendations. They stressed that the review of the 
Council relate to the work and functioning of the Council itself and that discussions should 
focus on how the Council could strengthen the system and enhance its most flexible and 
independent tools. The Council review should unequivocally support the independence of 
the special procedures, including by ensuring mandates&#8217; independent determination of 
workplans and activities. In particular, participants called for enhanced use by the Council 
of the work of the special procedures, in particular in relation to early warning about 
emerging or particularly serious situations. The need for greater independence and 
transparency of the appointment procedure was stressed. A better distribution of work 
during Council sessions, enhanced interactive dialogues and space for special procedures in 
the universal periodic review were also recommended. Greater cooperation of States with 
special procedures was encouraged, with emphasis placed on the Coordination Committee 
and steps that could be taken to strengthen it. It was also suggested that the Council and 
States should prevent reprisals against individuals or groups that cooperated with special 
procedures. Participants agreed that discussions on the review of the Council would be 
proactively contributed to by the special procedures, and a position paper would be 
prepared, guided by the Coordination Committee, and in consultation with all mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p><b>8</b>  </p>


<p><b> VI.  Thematic issues and working methods 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Strengthening the effectiveness of the special procedures: a joint report 
on communications 
</b></p>
<p>26. OHCHR briefed participants on the preparation of a joint communications report 
under the guidelines suggested by the Secretariat, pursuant to the decision of the sixteenth 
annual meeting of special procedures.<b>1</b> The first report, to be submitted to the Council in 
2011, would contain summaries of communications, and statistical information would be 
disaggregated according to country, mandate, number of communications sent and 
responses received. The joint report would aim to harmonize working methods, to ensure 
consistency in reporting of communications to the Council, and to avoid duplication of 
work.  
</p>
<p>27. Participants highlighted the value added of the joint report. It was stressed that 
information contained in communications could be used for early warning and fed into the 
universal periodic review process more efficiently. Challenges in receiving substantive 
State responses in good time were highlighted. Participants stressed the need to build on 
good practices, and to keep sources and victims informed about developments, including 
State responses. While supporting the joint report, several participants noted that they might 
continue making observations on communications in their annual reports. It was suggested 
that an evaluation of State responses could be included in the report. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Integration of gender perspectives in the work of special procedures: 
recent and forthcoming thematic institutional developments 
</b></p>
<p>28. Participants were briefed on developments relating to the establishment of the 
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), 
and attention was drawn to the follow-up to the 15-year review and appraisal of the 
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the implementation of 
Security Council resolution 1888, and the forthcoming tenth anniversary of Security 
Council resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, with special procedures being 
encouraged to contribute to these processes.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  The role of special procedures in early warning, including  
the responsibility to protect; and the protection of human rights in  
the context of natural disasters 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally 
displaced persons and the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti, 
presented information on developments relating to human rights in the context of natural 
disasters. They noted that allegations of human rights violations, such as sexual abuse and 
discrimination of minority groups, tended to be reported immediately after the occurrence 
of natural disasters and in the recovery process. In the aftermath of the January 2010 
earthquake in Haiti, allegations of sexual violence and trafficking in human beings were 
reported.  
</p>
<p>  
 1  See the report of the sixteenth meeting of special rapporteurs/representatives, independent experts and 
</p>
<p>chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/12/47), para. 26. 
</p>
<p> <b>9 </b></p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>30. A protection gap was noted by the mandate holders in terms of policy, legal and 
implementation frameworks. It was observed that pre-existing patterns of discrimination 
exacerbated, not intentionally but as a result of bad planning, the limited focus on 
vulnerable groups, and the inadequacy of national laws to address natural disasters. 
Preparedness and recovery mechanisms were often not rights-based and accordingly the 
promotion and protection of all human rights for all without discrimination were frequently 
not prioritized. The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons had submitted a report to the Council setting out 
recommendations for a legal framework to address human rights in natural disasters and 
rebuilding exercises (A/HRC/10/13/Add.1). Guidelines on incorporating the human rights-
based approach into recovery and rebuilding processes after natural disasters were being 
drafted.  
</p>
<p>31. It was proposed that a paradigm shift in responses to natural disasters was required 
to move from a needs-based approach to a rights-based approach. It was agreed that 
rebuilding and recovery processes should be transformative. Strategies should include 
provision in the legal system to address natural disasters when they occur, and the 
avoidance of implementing strategies that might lead to or perpetuate human rights 
violations. Consideration should be given to historical dimensions that perpetuated 
discrimination against vulnerable persons, such as persons of African descent in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>32. Special procedures needed to demonstrate the value added of the rights-based 
approach and they also should provide conceptual guidance, from a practical perspective, 
on ways of addressing immediate needs such as food, water and housing, and on the 
incorporation of rights-based considerations into short- and long-term planning. 
Humanitarian agencies mostly employ a needs-based approach, and collaboration and 
coordination could be enhanced on how to implement the rights-based approach, with due 
regard being given to addressing immediate needs and the lack of resources in the aftermath 
of a natural disaster. Issues of addressing sexual violence and the provision of security by 
multinational private military and security companies remain problematic.  
</p>
<p>33. Participants emphasized the importance of finding innovative ways of promoting 
and protecting human rights in the context of natural disasters that went beyond the current 
methods of work, such as requesting a visit to the country. Coordination among mandates 
should be enhanced. Expertise and information on the promotion and protection of human 
rights during pre- and post-recovery, and on coordination with humanitarian agencies, 
should be collected and made available to all. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Coordinated follow-up to the work of human rights mechanisms: 
discussion with OHCHR field presences and headquarters staff on good 
practices and strategies 
</b></p>
<p>34. Representatives of the OHCHR Regional Offices for South-East Asia (Bangkok), 
Central Africa (Yaound&#233;), the Middle East and Northern Africa (Beirut) and for Europe 
(Brussels) and from the OHCHR Office in Colombia briefed participants on their 
interaction with mandate holders, including assistance provided during country visits, and 
on their efforts to follow up on recommendations. It was noted how the engagement of 
mandates could generate synergies with national Governments and create opportunities for 
local/regional offices, including in the lead-up to and after visits. It was also noted that 
recommendations of special procedures, treaty bodies and the universal periodic review are 
valuable for field presences as they allow them to reinforce and advocate for policy change 
to address human rights issues.  
</p>
<p><b>10</b>  </p>


<p>35. OHCHR field presences informed participants about initiatives to give greater 
visibility to United Nations human rights mechanisms recommendations, such as through 
publications and databases to track the implementation of those recommendations. Two 
databases were presented: that of the OHCHR Regional Office in Bangkok, which 
systematically registered information relating to the implementation of recommendations 
and follow-up activities; and that of the OHCHR-Colombia country office, developed 
jointly with the Government to assist authorities to respond better to special procedures 
communications. Mandate holders were briefed on the role of the recently established 
Regional Office for Europe in assisting mandate holders to engage with European 
institutions on issues relating to their mandates. 
</p>
<p>36. Mandate holders welcomed the valuable political guidance and substantive and 
logistical support received before, during and after missions to countries where OHCHR 
had a field presence. OHCHR field presences staff noted that different levels of support 
could be expected by OHCHR field presences or United Nations country teams depending, 
inter alia, on the size and type of the United Nations field presence. The preparations and 
conduct of missions to countries that had few or very limited United Nations presences 
were noted as challenges.  
</p>
<p>37. The need to cooperate with regional and subregional human rights mechanisms was 
stressed, and joint missions with special rapporteurs of the Inter-American and African 
human rights protection systems were encouraged. The participation of mandate holders in 
promotional human rights events organized by OHCHR field presences was suggested. It 
was noted that these events allowed for informal contacts with States. The need to develop 
joint strategies for the dissemination of information, such as end-of visit statements and 
mission reports, as well as their translation into the national language was emphasized. 
Mandate holders were also encouraged to make greater use of the increased interest of 
regional media networks on human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>38. Mandate holders encouraged OHCHR field presences to provide them with more 
information about human rights issues that might require their attention or that should be 
assessed in more detail by fact-finding missions. OHCHR field representatives also called 
on mandate holders to stand ready to provide advice on draft legislation or engage in other 
types of technical cooperation, including that organized by OHCHR field presences, and by 
other parts of the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Consultation with stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.   United Nations entities 
</b></p>
<p>39. Mandate holders held an exchange of views with United Nations entities (Joint 
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, United Nations Population Fund, Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and 
World Food Programme) and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Participants 
welcomed the cooperation of United Nations entities in the preparation of or during country 
visits. Their institutional knowledge of the different regions was acknowledged. However, 
it was noted that there was often insufficient human rights mainstreaming and lack of 
special procedures and human rights protection systems, resulting in a limited support for 
the preparation of country missions. Participants encouraged United Nations entities to 
increase staff awareness and training on human rights-based approaches for enhanced 
coordination.  
</p>
<p>40. Representatives of United Nations entities appreciated the special procedures&#8217; 
unique ability to convey issues to international audiences. Special procedures&#8217; capacity to 
</p>
<p> <b>11 </b></p>


<p>expand the protection and promotion of human rights  to areas where human rights were not 
well developed was commended. Special procedures were called on to undertake  missions 
in a more systematic and coordinated manner.  
</p>
<p>41. Concern was raised about the protection of witnesses who risked their lives to 
provide information to special procedures and the United Nations in general. Participants 
called for increased and concerted efforts in addressing the rights and liberties of those and 
other human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>42. Representatives of United Nations entities encouraged special procedures to further 
the cooperation by exploring entry points into United Nations entities, while particular 
emphasis was placed on deepening working relationships and enhancing professional 
working methods between the special procedures and United Nations entities. Efficient and 
effective information sharing, including background briefings prior to country missions, 
was highlighted as a good practice, and further identification of additional good practices 
was highly encouraged. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Consultations with non-governmental organizations  
and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>43. Mandate holders acknowledged that the contribution of NGOs and NHRIs was 
essential to their country visits, to the preparation of thematic reports and to assisting 
victims with the submission of communications. They also commended NGOS and NHRIs 
for making the system of special procedures mandate holders well known. NGO and NHRI 
representatives encouraged special procedures to enhance their role in early warning and to 
consider ways to bring urgent matters to the attention of the Human Rights Council. The 
importance of urgent appeals for protection, institutionalized collaboration with civil 
society, collaboration with regional mechanisms, and integration of gender perspectives 
into the work of special procedures was also stressed.   
</p>
<p>44. Special procedures&#8217; reports were considered as essential for civil society advocacy. 
Special procedures communications could be enhanced  to strengthen the protection of 
victims. The capacity of mandate holders to call attention to sensitive topics and situations 
was stressed. Mandate holders called for better coordination of civil society meetings which 
are convened during country visits to allow for more efficient use of time and resources. 
Concern was raised about States failing to honour standing invitations. The centrality of the 
safety and protection of witnesses was emphasized, with deep concerns being expressed at 
the impunity enjoyed by those who violated the rights of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>45. NGOs and NHRIs saw the Council review as an opportunity for the United Nations 
human rights machinery to be reinforced. They called for the strengthening of the special 
procedures guarantees of their independence. Concerns were raised that there had been a 
decline in the quality of interactive dialogues between special procedures and the Council. 
Proposals were made to enhance these dialogues, including through the provision of more 
time in the Council and opportunities for informal interaction between States and mandate 
holders.. It was deplored that in debates in the Council,  States were increasingly resorting 
to unsubstantiated or unjustified allegations of violations of the Code of Conduct. . No 
support was expressed for proposals to create a body to oversee compliance with the Code 
by mandate holders, and increased use of the Internal Advisory Procedure on practices and 
working methods was encouraged. The accountability of States in respect of 
implementation of special procedures recommendations was emphasized and it was 
proposed that there should be a mechanism to ensure transparency and cooperation. The 
Coordination Committee was also encouraged to engage with the process of the review of 
</p>
<p><b>12</b>  </p>


<p>the Council so that the views of the special procedures could be integrated throughout the 
process. 
</p>
<p>46. Participants noted the lack of resources available to special procedures and called for 
increased support from States to enable them to undertake additional activities. They also 
made clear that national-level NGOs should be supported financially and their capacity 
strengthened so that the special procedures system could be fully accessible to those who 
need protection. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII.  Cooperation with human rights treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p>47. A joint meeting between mandate holders and participants of the eleventh Inter-
Committee meeting focusing on follow-up to the recommendations of human rights 
mechanisms was led by the respective Chairs. The follow-up procedure of the Committee 
against Torture was described by the Rapporteur for follow-up to concluding observations 
of that Committee, while the Special Rapporteurs on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
provided information on the development of follow-up mechanisms in relation to their 
mandates. 
</p>
<p>48. The meeting discussed and agreed on recommendations to be implemented jointly. 
Coordinated and systematic follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of treaty 
bodies and special procedures and enhanced collaboration between the two mechanisms 
were regarded as crucial. Cross-referencing of their recommendations and conclusions was 
essential for follow-up, as was identifying and sharing priority recommendations and 
conclusions. Special procedures mandate holders and treaty body experts recalled that the 
inclusion of their recommendations and conclusions in the universal periodic review had 
reinforced the weight of their respective recommendations and conclusions. Follow-up 
could be enhanced by specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound 
recommendations and conclusions.  
</p>
<p>49. Participants emphasized the comparative advantages and complementarities of both 
mechanisms: the flexibility of special procedures, including their capacity for immediate 
action and to undertake country visits was underlined, as was the cyclical and regular 
review of States parties&#8217; reports by treaty bodies. Special procedures were encouraged to 
reiterate treaty bodies&#8217; recommendations during visits. The recommendation of some treaty 
bodies to invite relevant mandate holders was considered to be a good practice. Participants 
called for more joint meetings, including briefings. More effective information 
management of the vast documentation produced by the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, including periodic updates and newsletters, as well as greater use of the 
Universal Human Rights Index was recommended. It was suggested that OHCHR prepare a 
compilation on good practices of cooperation between treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>50. Sustained follow-up at both the global and local levels was emphasized as critical to 
ensure the implementation of recommendations. Responsibility for follow-up rested with 
the State, and the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly had a responsibility to 
remind States of that and their human rights obligations. At the local level, stronger 
linkages with stakeholders were recommended through, inter alia, enhanced dissemination 
and translation of recommendations, round-table discussions, effective media strategies, 
and facilitation of visits by treaty body and special procedures experts. Activities by United 
Nations country teams  and OHCHR field offices were considered important in ensuring 
follow-up.
