<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Kenya was held at the 7th meeting, on 
</p>
<p>22 January 2015. The delegation of Kenya was headed by Githu Muigai, Attorney General 
</p>
<p>of the Republic. At its 14th meeting, held on 27 January 2015, the Working Group adopted 
</p>
<p>the report on Kenya. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kenya: China, Germany and Namibia. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Kenya: 
</p>

</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/KEN/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/KEN/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/KEN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great 
</p>
<p>Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America was transmitted to Kenya 
</p>
<p>through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Kenya, headed by Githu Muigai, Attorney General of the 
</p>
<p>Republic, affirmed the commitment of Kenya to the UPR mechanism. The second review 
</p>
<p>was particularly important because it provided an opportunity for States to account for the 
</p>
<p>promises made during the first review. Kenya underlined the implementation of a number 
</p>
<p>of the recommendations made in the first UPR review and that others were in the process of 
</p>
<p>being implemented through policy development initiatives and programmatic interventions.  
</p>
<p>6. Kenya stated that, since the previous UPR review, it had promulgated a new and 
</p>
<p>robust Constitution. The country has been in a period of constitutional and political 
</p>
<p>transition, implementing the various aspects of the new Constitution through direct 
</p>
<p>constitutional actions, mandatory legislative interventions, requisite policy development 
</p>
<p>and institutional reforms. Despite those achievements, a number of challenges, such as 
</p>
<p>poverty, corruption, terrorism and disease, continued to threaten the progress made by the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p>7. Kenya emphasized that the holding of peaceful elections in March 2013 should be 
</p>
<p>underscored, given that the previous elections had been fraught with violence and had 
</p>
<p>almost tipped Kenya into an abyss of chaos. The elections were adjudged by many </p>


<p>international observers to be free, fair and credible. The holding of peaceful election bore 
</p>
<p>testimony to the many reforms undertaken by the Government.  
</p>
<p>8. The preparation of the national report followed an all-inclusive and participatory 
</p>
<p>process that brought together government agencies, national human rights institutions, civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations and OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>9. Kenya stated that, during the review in 2010, it had accepted 149 recommendations 
</p>
<p>out of the 150 given. On the basis of the recommendations accepted in that review, wide 
</p>
<p>ranging reforms had been undertaken to improve access to justice, the rule of law and 
</p>
<p>access to economic and social rights, particularly for the poor and the vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>10. Of specific mention was the entrenchment in the Constitution of the Kenya National 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights, the National Gender and Equality Commission and the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Administrative Justice. This entrenchment provided the Commissions with 
</p>
<p>the necessary independence to monitor the observance of human rights in the country by 
</p>
<p>both public and private bodies.  
</p>
<p>11. Turning to the criminal justice system, Kenya indicated that wide ranging reforms in 
</p>
<p>the justice sector had seen the creation of a strong judiciary that was adequately empowered 
</p>
<p>to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution, improve the administration of justice, enforce 
</p>
<p>the respect for human rights and ensure that legislation and government actions were in line 
</p>
<p>with constitutional provisions. The judiciary benefitted from a distinctly independent and 
</p>
<p>considerably enhanced budget, selected its judges independently and had undertaken an 
</p>
<p>elaborate process for the vetting of judicial officers. 
</p>
<p>12. In ensuring the transformation of the police service, Kenya reported that various 
</p>
<p>constitutional, legislative and administrative measures had been taken. All police officers 
</p>
<p>were undergoing a vetting process against a set of criteria relating to professionalism, 
</p>
<p>integrity, performance record and psychological fitness. More than 17,000 police officers 
</p>
<p>have been trained and sensitized on the respect for human rights. An independent police 
</p>
<p>oversight authority was established in 2011.  
</p>
<p>13. With regard to recommendations concerning the humanizing of correctional 
</p>
<p>facilities, Kenya noted the efforts made to reduce overcrowding in correctional facilities 
</p>
<p>and create a more humane environment. 
</p>
<p>14. In order to protect and empower women and promote girls, Kenya stressed that 
</p>
<p>measures had been taken, including the constitutional guarantee for women to contest 
</p>
<p>elections and seek other appointive positions; the achievement of gender parity in primary 
</p>
<p>school enrolment; and the enactment of legislation to increase women&#8217;s access to land 
</p>
<p>ownership and use through inheritance and personal acquisition. It also noted that the 
</p>
<p>enactment of the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act 2011, aimed at preventing 
</p>
<p>and punishing female genital mutilation, which had been practised by a few communities in 
</p>
<p>the country, was a key milestone. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the recommendations on the prevention of torture, Kenya stated that 
</p>
<p>the Constitution provided safeguards for the prevention of torture. It noted that the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Torture Bill 2014 had been drafted through a consultative process and was 
</p>
<p>awaiting submission to the Cabinet for approval. Furthermore, it noted that the training 
</p>
<p>curriculum for police officers incorporated practical training on the respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment, which were also strongly 
</p>
<p>prohibited under the Police Service Act. 
</p>
<p>16. Kenya noted that it had received recommendations on the status of internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons and that it had taken significant measures to settle all persons who had 
</p>
<p>been displaced after the 2007 elections and forest evictions. </p>


<p>17. In relation to the protection of the right of freedom to information, Kenya mentioned 
</p>
<p>the development of the Access to Information and Data Protection Bills 2013, aimed at 
</p>
<p>giving effect to article 35 of the Constitution of Kenya, which provides for citizens&#8217; right to 
</p>
<p>gain access to information held by the Government and its agencies. The Bills have been 
</p>
<p>published and are awaiting consultation and tabling in parliament.  
</p>
<p>18. Kenya reported that it continued to cooperate fully with human rights special 
</p>
<p>procedures and mandate-holders from the United Nations and the African human rights 
</p>
<p>system. It has hosted the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and 
</p>
<p>sanitation and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>19. Kenya emphasized that it had cooperated and continued to cooperate fully with the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, in accordance with its obligations under the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>Despite protocol and professional etiquette demanding that Kenya not disclose the actual 
</p>
<p>nature of this cooperation, the Government of Kenya has provided all the required 
</p>
<p>documentation, given access to court files and witness testimonies and granted the Court 
</p>
<p>the requisite immunities and privileges to support its activities. 
</p>
<p>20. Kenya also emphasized that it had put in place measures to give effect to 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic rights, despite huge budgetary challenges experienced by the country.  
</p>
<p>21. To improve access to water and sanitation, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas, 
</p>
<p>the Maruba Dam was completed in the Machakos area, with water storage capacity and 
</p>
<p>treatment capacity serving 100,000 people. In Nairobi, the Sasumua Dam has been 
</p>
<p>rehabilitated substantially to reduce water shortage.  
</p>
<p>22. Concerning the food security situation, the Government, through the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, has various projects in place to address food security 
</p>
<p>challenges. 
</p>
<p>23. To improve the quality of education and ease the financial burden on many 
</p>
<p>households, the allocation of free tuition in secondary schools and free primary education 
</p>
<p>has been increased by 33 per cent in the 2014&#8211;2015 fiscal budget. This was a major step 
</p>
<p>towards ensuring that primary schooling and secondary education was truly free within the 
</p>
<p>following three years. Efforts have also been made to ensure that no child misses out on 
</p>
<p>school owing to poverty.  
</p>
<p>24. The Government of Kenya has committed itself to ensuring the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing through a number of policies, as well as legislative and programmatic 
</p>
<p>interventions. Other interventions include encouraging the private sector to invest in 
</p>
<p>affordable quality housing through a variety of incentives, and the introduction of 
</p>
<p>appropriate cost-effective building technology. 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to the recommendations made on the protection of indigenous peoples, 
</p>
<p>Kenya stated that its Constitution provided several avenues for the protection and 
</p>
<p>strengthening of indigenous peoples&#8217; personal and collective rights. Indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities&#8217; issues were addressed within the purview of vulnerable and marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups. 
</p>
<p>26. Kenya highlighted a few achievements of the Government since the previous 
</p>
<p>review, including the creation of and seamless transition to a devolved system of 
</p>
<p>government from the centralized system, with little disruption to service delivery.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to gender equality, Kenya emphasized that more than 21 per cent of 
</p>
<p>parliamentary representatives were female, the highest ever in the country&#8217;s history. The 
</p>
<p>Government of Kenya abolished all maternity charges in public facilities in June 2013, a 
</p>
<p>measure that has helped to reduce maternal mortality rates. </p>


<p>28. Concerning terrorism, Kenya indicated that it had on several occasions become a 
</p>
<p>victim of terror attacks, which have had a negative impact on the full realization of human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms. Lives had been lost and property destroyed. Travel 
</p>
<p>advisories issued against Kenya have dealt a blow to the tourism industry, which plays a 
</p>
<p>very important role in the national economy. Guided by relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>resolutions, Kenya has embarked on establishing the institutional, policy and legal 
</p>
<p>structures to safeguard the security of the nation from terrorism. The recent Security Laws 
</p>
<p>Amendment Act 2014 had been perceived as likely to hinder the enjoyment of human rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms. This suggestion was unfounded. A review of the Act will reveal its 
</p>
<p>similarities to legislation in comparable jurisdictions.  
</p>
<p>29. Kenya invited the international community and the members of the Working Group 
</p>
<p>on the Universal Periodic Review to form partnerships with it, provide it with support 
</p>
<p>towards the realization of human rights awareness campaigns and offer greater international 
</p>
<p>support for the provision of services to the refugee population hosted in Kenya. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

<p>80. Responding to questions, Kenya indicated that, since the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution in 2010, it had promulgated a piece of legislation that addressed the questions 
</p>
<p>of how Kenya ratified treaties and processed them into domestication legislation. 
</p>
<p>81. Regarding human rights defenders, Kenya stated that it was committed to open, 
</p>
<p>transparent and democratic constitutional system. Kenya welcomed the work of 
</p>
<p>independent human rights defenders. It underlined the actions that had been taken by the 
</p>
<p>Government in a few cases of interference in the work of human rights defenders. Kenya 
</p>
<p>reported that none of them was being detained in the country. 
</p>
<p>82. Regarding the International Criminal Court, Kenya stressed that its relationship with 
</p>
<p>the Court was very much misunderstood. It indicated that it had been among the first 
</p>
<p>countries to negotiate, ratify and domesticate the Rome Statute. It said that it would 
</p>
<p>therefore be untrue to suggest that Kenya had been a reluctant participant in the work of the 
</p>
<p>Court. Besides, major critical voices had come from countries that were not themselves 
</p>
<p>parties to the Court. Kenya had fully cooperated with the Court since an investigation into 
</p>
<p>the situation in Kenya was opened six years ago. Kenya had an extensive range of 
</p>
<p>agreements with the Court and had provided immunities and privileges for the officials of 
</p>
<p>the Court to work in Kenya. A permanent investigator and other officials of the Court 
</p>
<p>moved freely in the country. Kenya had supplied the Court with all of the information and 
</p>
<p>material that it was its duty to under Kenya laws and according to its interpretation of its 
</p>
<p>international obligations. Kenya stressed that a case concerning Kenya was ongoing before 
</p>
<p>the Court. The witnesses in that case were testifying in locations provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government through communication equipment in a manner that had been secured by the 
</p>
<p>Government. Criticism that Kenya had impended the work the Court was most regrettable 
</p>
<p>and untrue. 
</p>
<p>83. Kenya reported that it had come through a long period of national dialogue on the 
</p>
<p>new Constitution. Critical social issues had been put to the various forums in which the 
</p>
<p>Constitution was negotiated. The issues included abortion, death penalty and sexual 
</p>
<p>identity, and particularly the use of criminal law in such cases. The issues had been divisive 
</p>
<p>and the requisite political and social consensus on them was a work-in-progress. In the 
</p>
<p>meantime, Kenya had not carried out any execution since 1987. On the rights of lesbian, 
</p>
<p>gay, bisexual or transgender persons, Kenya stated that no individual could confirm that 
</p>
<p>criminal law had been applied to them on the basis of his/her sexual orientation. It also 
</p>
<p>stated that the judiciary had intervened in progressive ways, such as directing the 
</p>
<p>Government to recognize the right of those who wanted to change their sexual identify in 
</p>
<p>governmental documents. 
</p>
<p>84. Concerning terrorism, the question of the counter-terrorism initiatives of Kenya 
</p>
<p>arose in the context of the recent Security Laws Amendment Act 2014. Kenya reiterated 
</p>
<p>that the amendments had been consistent with the Constitution. The Act was pending in the 
</p>
<p>High Court, which had the final pronouncement. 
</p>
<p>85. As regards gender equality and reproductive health rights, Kenya indicated that it 
</p>
<p>had made very good progress in terms of gender inclusion. For example, 17 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>members of the boards of private companies were women, and the highest rate of female 
</p>
<p>representation in the public sector was 40 per cent. In August 2015, the Supreme Court 
</p>
<p>decided that Kenya should have a framework in place to ensure the constitutional quota of 
</p>
<p>women in the National Assembly and the Senate. 
</p>
<p>86. The Persons with Disability Act provided for the establishment of the National 
</p>
<p>Development Fund for Persons with Disability, which became fully operational in 2009&#8211;

</p>
<p>announced in the Official Gazette. </p>


<p>87. On the adoption of children, Kenya indicated that it had acceded to the Hague 
</p>
<p>Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. 
</p>
<p>It stated that it had developed guidelines on adoption, and that the National Adoption 
</p>
<p>Committee handled the process on intercountry adoption. It also stated that street children 
</p>
<p>were protected on an equal basis to other children under the care and protection measures 
</p>
<p>established by the Children Act, 2001. The Street Family Rehabilitation Trust Fund had 
</p>
<p>been established and street children were given protection, education, care and vocational 
</p>
<p>training. 
</p>
<p>88. Kenya recognized that the judiciary was understaffed. Staff mapping and a skills 
</p>
<p>exercise had recently been concluded with a view to addressing the staffing needs. It was, 
</p>
<p>however, encouraging to note that the number of judiciary officers and magistrates had 
</p>
<p>increased, as had the budget. The judiciary was committed to implementing the judiciary 
</p>
<p>framework for the period 2012&#8211;2015. 
</p>
<p>89. Kenya stressed that its vibrant civil society organizations were continuously called 
</p>
<p>upon to partner with the Government in the formulation of policies, legislation and 
</p>
<p>programmatic processes in line with the Constitution. Civil society organizations had been 
</p>
<p>involved in many processes, including in the preparation of the UPR report. Following a 
</p>
<p>request by non-governmental organizations to review the proposed amendment to the 
</p>
<p>Public Benefits Organization Act, the Government had set up a task force in December 
</p>
<p>2014 to explore options, secure a consensus and receive recommendations regarding the 
</p>
<p>amendment.  
</p>
<p>90. Concerning poverty alleviation, the Government had reviewed the 2009 national 
</p>
<p>policy on older persons and aging and the Persons with Disabilities Act to align them with 
</p>
<p>the Constitution. The Government had enacted the Social Assistance Act 2013, which 
</p>
<p>created an authority that was mandated with the provision of social assistance in the form of 
</p>
<p>financial or social services.  
</p>
<p>91. The Government was committed to implementing the recommendations contained in 
</p>
<p>the report of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. In December 2013, the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly debated and passed an amendment to the Truth, Justice and 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation Commission Act to effectively allow the National Assembly to consider the 
</p>
<p>report of the Commission and to provide for the immediate implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations contained therein. In accordance with the amendment, the Government 
</p>
<p>had created an inter-agency committee to examine the recommendations, as well as the 
</p>
<p>nature and scope of the implementation framework. Many of the recommendations were 
</p>
<p>already being implemented. 
</p>
<p>92. On the situation of refugees, Kenya had largely pursued an open door policy by 
</p>
<p>allowing a free flow of refugees into the country. That policy was characterized by the 
</p>
<p>liberal admission of refugees. Despite challenges with respect to the high number of 
</p>
<p>refugees and to terrorism-related incidents, Kenya was still committed to its obligations and 
</p>
<p>the terms of the tripartite agreement regarding the safe and dignified voluntary repatriation 
</p>
<p>of refugees to Somalia in line with international law. 
</p>
<p>93. On extrajudicial killings, torture and forced disappearance, Kenya indicated that the 
</p>
<p>excessive use of power and the abuse of office by law enforcement agencies were 
</p>
<p>considered criminal acts that were punishable by law. The Government had introduced 
</p>
<p>police reforms, including the creation of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, 
</p>
<p>staffed by civilians.  
</p>
<p>94. The Czech Republic appreciated the information on the implementation of previous 
</p>
<p>UPR recommendations.  </p>

</p>
<p>recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission and the

<p>decentralization of the administration.
