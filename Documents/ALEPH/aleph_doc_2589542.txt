CORPORATE ACTIVITIES
Acquisition of Minority Interests in Baralaba from JFE Shoji Trade Corporation (“JFE”)
During the period, JFE, who held a 37.5% interest in Baralaba Coal Pty Ltd, and a 20% interest in Wonbindi Coal Pty Ltd
transferred  their  total  minority  shareholdings  in  Baralaba  Coal  Pty  Ltd  and Wonbindi  Coal  Pty  Ltd  to  Noble  Group  and
Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC, for a nominal amount.
Termination of ANZ LC Facility
On 9 October 2015 the Company announced that it had received a notice from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
Limited (ANZ) stating that the ANZ will be terminating the Company’s A$81m bank guarantee facility (LC Facility) on 15
January 2016.
Subsequent to half year end, the Company announced that ANZ has assigned the LC Facility, including all of its security
interests held in the Company, Baralaba Coal Pty Ltd ACN 009 805 029, Wonbindi Coal Pty Ltd ACN 114 668  941 and

2015 
 
Background
Cockatoo Coal Limited and three associated companies, Baralaba Coal Pty Ltd, Cockatiel Coal Pty Ltd and Wonbindi Coal
Pty  Ltd  appointed  Grant  Sparks,  Martin  Ford  and  Stephen  Longley  of  PPB  Advisory  as  Administrators  effective  16
November 2015 pursuant to section 436A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).
Reasons for voluntary administration
The directors believed it was likely that the Company would at some point in the future not be able to meet all financial
commitments as and when they fell due. The key factors which lead to the appointment of voluntary administrators are
summarised as follows:




The declining price of coal
The contingent liabilities arising from agreements with Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal (WICET), Aurizon and
Gladstone Port Corporation (GPC)
The lack of permits to expand production
The withdrawal of ANZ’s facility
  Difficulty raising additional capital with the Companies’ existing capital structure and cost base
Care and maintenance
The Administrators placed Baralaba mine into Care and Maintenance on 8 February 2016.
Voting of creditors at the second meeting of creditors
Subsequent to half year end, on 1 March 2016, creditors for each of the Companies resolved that the Companies execute
the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) and Creditors’ Trust Deed substantially in the form of the DOCA and Creditors’
Trust Deed. The DOCA with Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC, was executed on 15 March 2016.
Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
The key features of the DOCA were:

COCKATOO COAL LIMITED
AND ITS CONTROLLED ENTITIES
D i r e c t o r ’ s   R e p o r t

The extinguishment of the major liabilities of Cockatoo Coal Limited and the three associated companies, including
the ‘ take or pay ‘agreements in place with WICET Holdings  Pty Ltd and Aurizon.
  A $100m debt facility provided by Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC which enabled the Companies to repay all
first and second lien lenders in full, fully cash backed financial assurance guarantees given for the benefit of the
Group to the state of Queensland, pay other certain creditor claims and provide  $27m of additional cash  for
working capital purposes.

The issuance of 6 billion new ordinary shares to Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC at $0.001 per share for gross
proceeds of $6 million. Additionally 4 billion of new ordinary shares were issued to JS Baralaba Wonbindi Pty Ltd as
part of the DOCA.
The DOCA was effectuated on 30 May 2016 at which point the Companies were handed back to the control of the Directors.
Company Strategy
On return of control of the Company to the Directors on 30 May 2016, the Company has started the process to restart the
mine,  which  includes  developing  a  new  mine  plan  given  the  change  in  its  circumstances  following  the  Voluntary
Administration and effectuation of the DOCA. Until the mine planning is complete and the Company’s plans updated, the
mining activities will remain in care and maintenance and the Company will remain focussed on minimising and controlling
costs.

Bowen Basin Projects
The Company has continued exploration and drilling activities carrying out open hole drilling and coal quality coring for raw
coal. The main focus of exploration activities was shifted to the company’s Dingo West Project. The Dingo West Project is
an exploration joint venture with JOGMEC targeting the Baralaba Coal Measures to the north of the Baralaba Complex.
Baralaba Complex
The Baralaba Complex is located near the town of Baralaba in the south eastern limb of the Bowen Basin, Queensland,
which comprises the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Baralaba Complex consists of Baralaba North (operational), Baralaba
Central  (closed),  and  Baralaba  South  (exploration  and  pre-feasibility).The  Baralaba  mine  is  an  open-pit  operation,
managed  and  operated  by  the  Company  with  certain  key  services,  including  drill  and  blast  and  haulage,  provided  by
contractors.  Predominantly  ULV  PCI  coal  for  steel  making  and  some  thermal  coal  are  produced  from  multiple  seams
forming the well-known Baralaba Coal Measures, the eastern basin equivalent of the Rangal Coal Measures. All the coal
sold is currently exported from the Port of Gladstone.
During the half year, operations transitioned from the Outrigger pit towards the Fairway pit within the Baralaba North mine.
Coal production at the Baralaba North mine began in May 2014.

Surat Basin Projects
The  Surat  Basin  is  a  well  established  energy  province,  with  existing  power  developments,  regional  centres,  service
industries and existing infrastructure. The potential for development of a significant export coal industry from the Surat will
be enhanced by the planned development of the Surat Basin Railway, connecting the region to the port of Gladstone by
developing a new rail freight corridor from Wandoan northwards to the existing Moura-Gladstone rail line, joining at the
township of Banana.
The Company’s Surat Basin projects have now been advanced to a stage where no further substantial field activities are
planned for these projects until there is further clarity regarding the development progress of the proposed Surat Basin
railway and other major coal mine developments in the region. Given the uncertainty in the timing of development of the
rail and port infrastructure, impairments have previously been recorded against the Group’s investments and other assets
that relate to the Surat Basin projects.

Note 1 - Reporting entity 
 
Cockatoo  Coal  Limited  (the  'Company')  is  a  company  domiciled  in  Australia.  The  condensed  consolidated  interim  financial 
statements of the Company as at and for the half year ended 31 December 2015 comprises the Company and its subsidiaries (together 
referred to as the 'Group') and the Group’s interest in associates. 
 
The consolidated annual financial report of the Group as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015 is available upon request from the 
Company’s registered office at Level 7, 10 Eagle Street, Brisbane, QLD, 4000 or at www.cockatoocoal.com.au. 
 
The financial report was authorised for issue by the directors on 29 July 2016.
Note 2 – Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance 
 
The consolidated interim financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance  with AASB 
134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001, and with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. 
 
The consolidated interim financial report does not include all of the information required for a full annual financial report, and should 
be read in conjunction with the consolidated annual financial report of the Group as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015. 
 
Going concern 
 
The consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realisation of 
assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.
The  Group  recorded  a  loss  for  the  period  of  $105,728k,  generated  $4,456k  of  cash  from  operating  activities,  used  $88,298k  in 
investing activities for the period, and had accumulated losses of $349,394k as at 31 December 2015. The Group had cash on hand 
of $17,982k, net assets of $203,683k and net current liabilities of $196,800k at 31 December 2015.
On 25 September 2015, ANZ indicated to the Group that it was not willing to continue to provide an existing $81m bank guarantee 
facility  under  its  current  arrangements.  On  16  November  2015,  the  Company  and  several  subsidiary  entities  were  placed  into 
Voluntary Administration.  
 
Subsequent to half year end, during February 2016, the mining activities of the Group were placed into care and maintenance by the 
Administrator, and the operating costs of the Group reduced accordingly. 
 
Subsequent to half year end, on 15 March 2016, the Company and subsidiaries in administration entered into a Deed of Company 
Arrangement (‘DOCA’) which was effectuated on 30 May 2016. The key features of the DOCA are to extinguish the major liabilities 
of the Group, including significant take or pay agreements in place with WICET Holdings Pty Ltd, Gladstone Ports Corporation and 
Aurizon. In addition, and as part of the DOCA, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Liberty Metals and Mining Holdings 
LLC (LMM) for $100m and an additional consideration deed under which the Company must pay LMM an amount equal to 3.75% 
of the aggregate gross revenue received by the Company and its subsidiaries quarterly in arrears. Refer to Note 21 for further details 
on the terms of the DOCA and use of LMM loan proceeds. This has resulted in approximately $27m of additional cash being made 
available to the Group for working capital purposes. 
 
The recent loan agreement and additional consideration deed entered into between the Company and LMM encompasses significant 
financial  and  non-financial  covenants.  The  Company  does  not  consider  itself  in  breach  of  the  loan  agreement  or  additional 
consideration deed  as  at  the date  of  this  report,  however  a  subsequent breach  resulting  in  a  default  under  either  or  both  of  those 
arrangements may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
In addition, subsequent to half year end, the State of Queensland has indicated to the Company that a reassessment of the Group’s 
environmental bonding requirements is necessary. Currently the company has total environmental bonds in place of $34.4m, in the 
form of charges over term deposits. The Company is in discussions with the State regarding their information requirements and are 
in the process of reassessing the plan for rehabilitation of mining operations at Baralaba.  As at the date of this report, the outcome 
of this assessment is unknown and there is significant uncertainty as to whether any additional bonding will be required by the State, 
and if so the quantum of the additional funding and whether the Group has the financial capacity to meet any additional funding 
requirements, or raise additional funding from shareholders or other parties.  
 
These conditions give rise to material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.

Note 2 – Basis of preparation (Con’t) 
 
In  the  event  the  Group  is  required  to  pay  significant  additional  environmental  rehabilitation  bonding  or  is  in  breach  of  the  loan 
agreement or additional consideration deed, it may not be able to continue its operations as a going concern and therefore may not 
be able to realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the ordinary course of operations and at the amounts stated in the interim 
financial report.
Note 3 - Significant accounting policies 
 
The accounting policies applied by the Group in the consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied by the 
Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015.
Note 4 - Estimates 
 
The preparation of the interim financial report requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. 
 
Except as described below, in preparing this consolidated interim financial report, the significant judgements made by management 
in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the 
consolidated financial report as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015.

During the period the Company sold its interest in Kingaroy Tenement EPC 882 to Moreton Resources Group. This resulted in an 
impairment reversal of $290k as it had been previously fully impaired.
In the prior period the Company sold its interest in the North Surat Joint Venture to North Surat Coal Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of New 
Hope  Corporation  Limited.  As  a  result of  the  sale, the  Company  recognised  a  reversal  of  impairment  on the  North  Surat  Joint 
Venture exploration and evaluation assets.

The  Directors  believe  that  indicators  of  impairment  existed  at  31  December  2015  given  the  Company  was  in  Voluntary 
Administration.  As  such,  the  Directors  have  completed  an  impairment  assessment  over  the  carrying  value  of  the  Group’s 
exploration and evaluation assets at 31 December 2015. The Director’s have considered the carrying value of the exploration and 
evaluation assets by comparison to market data on sales of similar assets and the value per tonne of resources implied. The Directors 
are satisfied that no impairment is required.
During the period the Company sold its interest in Kingaroy Tenement EPC 882 to Moreton Resources Group. This resulted in a 
disposal of $290k and impairment reversal of the same amount.
In the prior period the Company sold its interest in the North Surat Joint Venture to North Surat Coal Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of New 
Hope Corporation Limited. This resulted in a disposal of $10,292k of exploration and evaluation expenditure. The Company also 
sold other exploration and evaluation assets at cost for $500k. During the prior period impairment was reversed on certain non-
core exploration and evaluation assets, see Note 6.
The ultimate recoupment of exploration and evaluation expenditure is dependent on the successful development and  commercial 
exploitation, or alternatively sale of the respective areas of interest.

Impairment of Assets 
 
The  Directors  believe  that  indicators  of  impairment  existed  at  31  December  2015  given  the  Company  was  in  Voluntary 
Administration. As such, the Directors have completed an impairment assessment over the carrying value of the Group’s property, 
plant and equipment assets at 31 December 2015. 
 
In assessing the value of the assets relating to the Baralaba North Project, the Group has assessed the recoverable amount at 31 
December 2015 based on its fair value less cost of disposal. This is considered to be the most appropriate measure of recoverable 
amount given the Company was in administration at 31 December 2015, rather than its value in use which was the previous 
measure used to determine recoverable amont.  
 
The fair value less cost of disposal ws determined by discounting the future cash flows to be generated from the project. The key 
assumptions to which the model is most sensitive include: 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
Forecast commodity price of Pulverised Coal Injection coal 
Foreign exchange rates 
Mining, processing, administrative and capital costs 
Discount rate of 10% 
Remaining life of mine of approximately 20 years 
Forecast total saleable production of 76.25 million tonnes 
Certain infrastructure costs based on current market prices

Note 12- Property, Plant and Equipment (Con’t) 
 
The net present value projections have been based on the last mine plan produced by the Group before the Company entered 
Voluntary Administration, without consideration of the obligations that existed under the infrastructure agreements that were in 
place at the time of administration. The Directors consider it a reasonable assumption that any potential purchaser of the mine 
could look to utilise the mining assets in a manner aligned to the existing mine plan, without taking on the existing obligations 
under the infrastructure agreements which are currently above the market prices for the equivalent services. 
 
Management had considered each key assumption and has used external sources of information and utilised external consultants 
where possible and personnel within the Group to determine key inputs. 
 
Furthermore, the Group's cash flow forecasts are based on current estimates of future commodity prices and exchange rates. The 
Group has reviewed long term forecast data from externally verifiable sources when determining its forecasts. 
 
Changes in the above assumptions and estimates may adversely impact the net present value of the project which may result in 
significant impairment being recorded in relation to the mining assets. 
 
Production and capital costs are based on an estimate of future production levels. This information is obtained from external 
consultants, internally maintained budgets, life of mine models and project evaluations performed by the Group in its ordinary 
course of business. 
 
The Group has applied a discount rate of 10% to the forecast future attributable post-tax cash flows. This discount rate represents 
an estimate of the rate the market would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to this project.  
 
Based on the impairment review completed at 31 December 2015, the recoverable amount for the Baralaba North Project was 
considered sufficient to support the carrying value of the mine assets and therefore no impairment has been recorded for the half 
year ended 31 December 2015. This has been calculated based on the Group's existing resource statement and the pre-existing mine 
plan.

Note 18 – Contingent Liabilities 
 
Guarantees
During the period the Company received notice from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) that the ANZ would
terminate the Company’s $81m bank guarantee facility (LC facility) on 15 January 2016. Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings LLC
(LMM)  entered  into  a  Deed  of  Assignment  with  ANZ  on  3  December  2015  whereby  ANZ  assigned  LMM  all  the  rights  and
obligations of the LC facility.
With the Company entering Voluntary Administration certain Guarantees  were called and paid after 31 December 2015 totalling
$45,969k. The Company has recorded a provision of $45,969k (30 June 2015 – nil) in relation to these guarantees as detailed in Note
15.
The other guarantees at 31 December 2015 are:


$34,425k as an environmental bond to the State of Queensland against rehabilitation and any potential loss attributable to
mining operations at Baralaba;
$161k as an environmental bond to the State of Queensland against environmental offsets at the new train load out facility
currently under construction.
As at 31 December 2015 the Company has recorded a provision of $nil (30 June 2015 - $nil) in relation to these other guarantees. 
 
Infrastructure agreements 
  
The Group had entered into agreements for port and rail services (Infrastructure Agreements) that enable the Group to export 
coal from its existing 1 million tonne per annum mining operation. The Infrastructure Agreements included increasing take or 
pay usage commitments (rail and port charges) up to 3.5 million tonnes per annum. 
 
As at 31 December 2015 the Company has contingent liabilities in respect of these agreements totalling $791.5m (30 June 2015 
- $nil) which reflects claims made against the Company under these agreements due to entering into Voluntary Administration. 
The contingent liabilities relate to costs claimed by these suppliers for future commitments over the period of each agreement. 
 
No provisions have been recorded at 31 December 2015 in relation to these agreements as management were not able to 
reliably estimate the amount that would ultimately be payable to settle these claims. The claims have therefore been disclosed 
as a contingent liability at 31 December 2015.
The agreements were subsequently considered not to be Excluded Contracts under the Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)
which was effectuated on 30 May 2016. As such, they do not continue as agreements and are not contingent liabilities after 30 May
2016.

Signed at Brisbane this 29 day of July 2016
in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors:
Peter Richards 
Chairman

I n d e p e n d e n t   A u d i t o r ’ s   R e v i e w   R e p o r t   t o   t h e
M e m b e r s   o f   C o c k a t o o   C o a l   L i m i t e d
We have reviewed the accompanying interim financial report of Cockatoo Coal Limited, which comprises the interim condensed 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2015, condensed interim statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income, interim condensed statement of changes in equity and interim condensed statement of cash flows for the period ended on 
that  date,  notes  1  to  21  comprising  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  other  explanatory  information  and  the 
directors’ declaration of the Group comprising the Company and the entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or from time to 
time during the interim period.
Directors’ responsibility for the interim financial report  
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the interim financial report that gives a true and fair view in 
accordance with  Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the interim financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a  conclusion  on the  interim  financial  report  based  on our review.  We  conducted  our  review  in 
accordance  with  Auditing  Standard  on  Review  Engagements  ASRE  2410  Review  of  a  Financial  Report  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware  of 
any matter that makes us believe that the interim financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: 
giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2015 and its performance for the interim period 
ended  on  that  date;  and  complying  with  Australian  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and  the 
Corporations  Regulations  2001.  As  auditor  of  Cockatoo  Coal  Limited,  ASRE  2410  requires  that  we  comply  with  the  ethical 
requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report. 
 
A review of an interim financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Independence 
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001. 
 
Conclusion  
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the interim financial 
report of Cockatoo Coal Limited is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including: 
 
a)
giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2015 and of its performance for the half year 
ended on that date; and
b)
complying with Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134  Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 
2001.
Material uncertainties regarding continuation as a going concern
Without  modifying  our  conclusion,  we  draw  attention  to  note  2,  “Going  Concern”  in  the  interim  financial  report.  The  conditions 
disclosed in note 2 indicate the existence of material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business and at 
the amounts stated in the interim financial report.
