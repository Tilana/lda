</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Sierra Leone registered a positive trend in 2008 towards respect for civil and political 
rights although serious concerns remain in a number of areas. The people of Sierra Leone went 
to the polls on 5 July 2008 to elect their local representatives. Most election observers agreed 
that the election had been conducted in a fair and transparent manner and that the results were 
credible. Isolated incidents of harassment were reported however. Significant improvement was 
noted in the representation of women, with female candidates increasing their representation by 
40 per cent. Political, legal and security institutions in the country continue to make progress 
towards securing respect for the right to life and security of the person for citizens. The 
moratorium imposed on the execution of the death penalty remained in full force and effect, 
notwithstanding the change in Government. <b> 
</b></p>
<p> With the support of international partners, some progress has been made in promoting and 
protecting the rights of women and children. A change of attitude by some traditional leaders 
regarding female genital mutilation (FGM) was noted in the Northern Province where traditional 
leaders in the Kambia district have committed not to subject girls below the age of 18 to FGM. 
Gradual progress has also been achieved in securing legal protection of women&#8217;s rights. The 
Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs developed a roll-out plan for the 
gender justice acts which saw a significant degree of sensitization developed around women&#8217;s 
rights throughout the course of the year. These acts afford greater protection in cases of domestic 
violence and in relation to inheritance rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> In 2008 there was significant progress in the justice sector. The Government launched a 
three-year Justice Sector Reform Strategy and Investment Plan 2008-2010 on the basis of the 
recommendations of a task force constituted by the President to examine the reasons for the 
delay in the administration of justice and other related matters. Significant progress was also 
made in the implementation of a number of projects under the United Nations Peacebuilding 
Fund, which has helped to address some of the threats to peace consolidation, e.g. through 
building capacity within the justice sector, operationalizing the national human rights institution, 
and establishing a reparations programme. One of the greatest threats to peace consolidation still 
remains the low level of enjoyment of economic and social rights characterized by the lack of 
adequate basic social services including safe drinking water, health-care services, and education 
and housing facilities. <b> 
</b></p>
<p> Significant progress was achieved in operationalizing the national Human Rights 
Commission and building its capacity to discharge its statutory functions. However, the catalytic 
funding provided under the Peacebuilding Fund was scheduled to end in January 2009, and 
unless additional support is forthcoming from the Government and international partners, there 
are concerns that the operations of the Commission may be adversely affected. The 
Anti-Corruption Commission was strengthened by new legislation passed by Parliament in 
August 2008, and it now has prosecutorial powers and no longer depends on the Ministry of 
Justice to initiate proceedings. On 10 January 2008, the Constitutional Review Commission 
established by the Government submitted its report to the President. Thus far, the Government 
has made no pronouncements as to how it intends to deal with this report.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/52 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> However, a number of serious human rights concerns persist. Police have not been held 
accountable in many cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. Although legal remedies are 
provided for under the Constitution and in the laws of Sierra Leone, weak access to justice and 
legal representation often renders these ineffective. Two strategies, which are aimed at 
addressing the critical issue of justice sector reform, have been developed and are to be 
implemented by 2012. The recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are 
yet to be fully implemented although progress has been made, with the assistance of the 
Peacebuilding Fund, in the development and funding of a reparations programme. In the health 
sector, although the deployment of a contingent of Cuban doctors has been a positive 
development, many hospitals remain poorly staffed and lacking basic drugs thus rendering them 
unable to respond to emergencies. Sierra Leone still has one of the highest infant and under-five 
mortality rates, as well as one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. 
</p>
<p> In the light of this, the report concludes with a series of recommendations to the 
Government of Sierra Leone, which include providing support to the Human Rights 
Commission, completing the constitutional reform process, repealing the Public Order 
Act (1965) so as to enhance press freedom, enacting the draft sexual offences and matrimonial 
bills, and addressing the economic and social situation of the people of Sierra Leone. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 1793 (2007), the Security Council extended the mandate of the 
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) for nine months, ending 
30 September 2008, to assist the Government in furthering the consolidation of peace. Following 
the termination of this mandate, the Security Council, in resolution 1829 (2008), established the 
United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) for 12 months, 
effective as of 1 October 2008. The human rights mandate of the mission remains the same: 
(a) to provide assistance to national commissions and institutions for the promotion of good 
governance and human rights, including the development of a national plan of action for human 
rights; (b) to monitor and promote human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law; and 
(c) to support decentralization, the review of the 1991 Constitution and the enactment of relevant 
legislation. Most activities conducted by UNIOSIL Human Rights and Rule of Law Section in 
fulfilling the above mandate fell under the core areas of the Plan of Action of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and were implemented with 
funding support from OHCHR. Thus, in addition to providing advisory and technical services, 
several projects were conducted by the Section with OHCHR funding. This report covers the 
human rights situation in Sierra Leone in 2008 and the activities of UNIOSIL and, subsequently 
UNIPSIL which was established during this period.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION  
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. Sierra Leone has continued to register a positive trend towards respect for civil and 
political rights. Presidential and parliamentary elections were conducted in 2007 and on 
5 July 2008, the people of Sierra Leone went to the polls to elect representatives in local district 
councils across the country. There was a general consensus among local and international 
observers including the National Democratic Institute (NDI) based in the United States of 
America and National Elections Watch (NEW), a coalition of local civil society organizations, 
that the elections were free, fair and credible. Notwithstanding, there were instances of political 
intolerance, intimidation and harassment, especially of opposition and independent candidates, 
which impacted on the exercise of their political rights. Significant improvement was noted in 
the representation of women: out of 225 female candidates, 86 were successful, winning close 
to 18 per cent of the 475 seats that were contested, and 26 more than in 2004.  
</p>
<p>3. There were a number of reported cases of intimidation and harassment against opposition 
politicians during the electoral period and these actions were sometimes ordered or endorsed by 
highly placed Government officials including Members of Parliament. One notable incident was 
the attack on the convoy of the former Vice-President, and Sierra Leone People&#8217;s Party (SLPP) 
presidential candidate, in Koidu Town by alleged All Peoples&#8217; Congress (APC) supporters 
during his visit to launch the SLPP campaign for the local council elections in Kono District 
on 15 June.  
</p>
<p>4. The country is still divided along political and ethnic lines. The level of distrust between 
the two major political parties - the ruling APC and the SLPP which lost the elections - has 
prevented effective dialogue and meaningful political discussions on key national issues. This 
distrust has been exacerbated in part by a number of incidents starting with the annulment of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>votes from 477 polling stations in the 2007 presidential elections, through the allocation of 
cabinet posts, the removal from office of certain public officials who had served in the previous 
SLPP Government, the temporary closure of the SLPP radio, and the attacks on the offices of the 
SLPP in Bo and Freetown.  
</p>
<p>5. The level of mistrust has been further heightened by the establishment by the Government 
in 2008 of a commission of inquiry to investigate the misuse of Government or donor funds 
under the SLPP administration. This commission was established in response to the 
recommendations of a comprehensive audit of Government assets and programmes conducted by 
a presidential transitional team in 2007 which uncovered widespread abuse and mismanagement 
of public resources across the public sector. 
</p>
<p>6. The President has made significant overtures to address some of these concerns with a 
view to promoting political reconciliation. In August 2008, he ordered the reopening of the 
SLPP radio station, which had been shut down by the Ministry of Information, and pledged to 
maintain open lines of communications with the opposition. UNIOSIL worked with the Political 
Parties Registration Commission (PPRC) to enhance interparty dialogue and facilitate conflict 
resolution. UNIPSIL is maintaining this engagement. 
</p>
<p>7. The &#8220;task forces&#8221;, which were initially established by the political parties to assist in the 
electoral campaigns and provide crowd control at their rallies in the 2007 and 2008 electoral 
processes, are still in place and could undermine peace and security in the country. With 
elections over, these task forces which are comprised of youths, many of whom are former 
fighters, are reportedly engaged in extortion and acts of violence especially along the borders.  
</p>
<p>8. Prolonged detention of criminal suspects in police stations beyond the stipulated statutory 
time limit continued to violate the right to liberty and security of the person. The Constitution 
stipulates that once arrested, a suspect must be brought to court within 72 hours or 10 days in 
cases of grave offences. It was noted that many suspects were consistently arbitrarily detained in 
remand as a result of delays in concluding investigations occasioned by poor investigative 
capacity and inefficient coordination with other actors and agencies of the justice system. The 
Constitution and laws of Sierra Leone envisage both the writ of habeas corpus<i>,</i> to challenge the 
lawfulness of arrest and detention before judicial authorities, and the right to compensation for 
wrongful arrest and detention. However, given the challenges in accessing justice and legal 
representation, these remedies are ineffective and the police remained unaccountable for many 
cases of arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention during the year. 
</p>
<p>9. Freedom of association, assembly and movement were generally respected throughout the 
country. However, there were a number of isolated reports of restrictions on these rights, coupled 
with cases of intimidation and harassment, primarily during the local government elections.  
</p>
<p>10. Freedom of speech and press freedom were also generally respected. However the 
existence of the Public Order Act (1965), which criminalizes libel, continued to violate press 
freedom in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) and the Society for 
Democratic Initiative (SDI-SL) filed a petition in the Supreme Court, challenging the 
constitutionality of certain sections of the Act. At the end of 2008 a decision was still pending. In 
addition, isolated cases of intimidation and suppression of freedom of expression were noted: the 
police arrested and questioned a newspaper journalist on allegations of defamatory libel in </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/52 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>connection with a caricature of the President that appeared in a local newspaper and the Ministry 
of Information closed the opposition SLPP radio station on the grounds that the procedures for 
establishing a radio station were not followed. However this apparently illegal act, which was 
done without respect for due process and by an institution without the legal authority to close 
radio stations, sparked an angry wave of reactions from party supporters who threatened to 
demonstrate against the APC Government for stifling press freedom. On 13 May 2008, at a 
meeting with officials of the SLPP, the President granted permission for the SLPP Unity Radio 
to resume transmission.  
</p>
<p>11. While the right to own property is protected under the Constitution and laws of 
Sierra Leone, conflicting claims of ownership, especially in relation to land, have a negative 
impact on the consolidation of peace. A number of land disputes were noted in diverse parts of 
the country, some of which resulted in intercommunal violence, deaths and serious injuries. In 
Freetown and its environs, police records indicate an increase in reports of violence emanating 
from land disputes in 2008. In addition to an effective land registration system, a conflict 
mediation and an alternate dispute resolution mechanism must be put in place, as the current 
legal system may not be able to effectively address these concerns. 
</p>
<p>12. The Constitution provides that no one shall be deprived of property without due process of 
law. However, a number of incidents were noted in which property owners were evicted by 
police officers without due process being respected. On 8 October 2008, the police upon 
instruction from the Sierra Leone Tourist Board and the Freetown City Council demolished nine 
entertainment complexes along Lumley beach. The UNIPSIL human rights component 
monitored the demolitions and evictions which were carried out with use of force and 
intimidation. Numerous other evictions and demolitions of private properties were carried out by 
the police throughout the country without due process of the law, on lands purportedly owned by 
the Government.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. While there was no report of torture inflicted upon any suspects while in custody or in the 
course of investigation, there were reports of excessive use of force and firearms by police, some 
of which resulted in death. The report of the Jenkins Johnston Commission, which was 
established by the Government on 18 December 2007 to investigate killings on 
13 December 2007 when police intervened in a demonstration by property owners against the 
Koidu Holdings Company in Kono, was released in March 2008. The Commission found that 
excessive force had been used by the law enforcement agents and recommended prosecution of 
those involved. This has not yet taken place however as the police are proceeding with their own 
internal investigations into the matter. 
</p>
<p>14. The persistence of female genital mutilation (FGM) continued to pose a threat to the 
security of women and girls, with a number of deaths reported as a result of the practice. Many 
girls are forcibly subjected to FGM at a very young age by secret societies. However, some 
progress has been noted. In Kambia District, in the Northern Province, traditional leaders, 
following an innovative approach pioneered by Advocacy Movement Network (AMNET), a 
local non-governmental organization (NGO), with technical support from UNIPSIL, have 
pledged not to subject any girl below the age of 18 to FGM. UNIPSIL remains committed to 
supporting this initiative to eradicate FGM. It should be noted that there is no law specifically </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>criminalizing FGM but section 33 (1) of the Child Rights Act provides that &#8220;No person shall 
subject a child to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment including 
any cultural practice which dehumanizes or is injurious to the physical and mental welfare of a 
child.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. The moratorium imposed on the execution of the death penalty remained in full force and 
effect even with the change of Government. At the end of 2008, there were 11 prisoners on death 
row, with three appeal judgements pending. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Children&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>16. While the Government, with the support of international partners, made some progress in 
the promotion and protection of children&#8217;s rights, serious challenges remain. Sierra Leone has 
one of the highest infant and under-five mortality rates, as well as one of the highest maternal 
mortality rates in the world. Despite efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs), it is evident that these goals will not be met by 2015. Early and forced marriages 
(27 per cent of children marry before their fifteenth birthday and 62 per cent of girls marry 
before age 18), teenage pregnancy, high incidence of sexual exploitation and abuse, and cultural 
and religious bias towards girls&#8217; education are all critical challenges. 
</p>
<p>17. Thousands of orphaned and vulnerable children remain victims of exploitation including 
domestic work, hazardous labour, especially in the mining sector, commercial sex, and 
trafficking across borders. Even though Parliament passed the Anti-Human Trafficking Act in 
2005, containing stringent new provisions regulating adoptions, trafficking out of the country 
remains a major challenge. The Act was a positive development but effective implementation 
requires greater Government support. 
</p>
<p>18. Continued progress was noted in school enrolment thanks to the construction and 
rehabilitation of schools and polytechnics, and the assistance given to girl child education. 
Nevertheless, delays in the payment of teachers&#8217; salaries, poor conditions of service, and 
expensive school charges remain major challenges to the fulfilment of the right to education. 
19. Some progress was noted in the area of juvenile justice. A juvenile court, the first and only 
one in Sierra Leone, was established in Bo, Southern Province. In Freetown, specific days have 
been set aside for hearing of juvenile cases in the magistrate courts, and improvement was noted 
in transporting juveniles from remand homes for court sittings. Notwithstanding, legal 
representation for juveniles still remains a challenge, as many juveniles continue to appear in 
court without lawyers due in part to the lack of an effective legal aid system. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>20. Gradual progress was made in the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s right in 
Sierra Leone. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs, in collaboration 
with national and international partners, developed a roll-out plan for the three so-called gender 
justice acts which saw significant sensitization and educational programmes developed around 
women&#8217;s rights throughout the course of the year. These three acts, all passed at the same time in 
2007, are the Domestic Violence Act, the Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act 
and the Devolution of Estates Act. As a result, domestic violence is now a crime and victims of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/52 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>violence may now seek a protection order. Furthermore the inheritance rights of women are now 
afforded greater protection. However the gender justice acts must be supplemented by the 
enactment of the long-awaited draft sexual offences bill and the draft matrimonial bill if legal 
protection for women is to be properly strengthened.  
</p>
<p>21. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs, with the support of the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women (UNIFEM), undertook a national survey on sexual and gender-based violence and the 
report was released in December 2008 on the eve of the commencement of 16 days of activism 
against gender violence. The Ministry, in collaboration with the United Nations and national 
NGOs, has launched an advocacy programme for the enactment of the sexual offences bill and 
the matrimonial bill.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>22. Through the support of national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies, the 
Ministry has established a National Committee on Gender-based Violence (NaC-GBV) to 
coordinate all initiatives aimed at curbing sexual and gender-based violence. A few centres that 
cater specifically for women victims of domestic and sexual violence have been established in 
the country. The Peacebuilding Fund has also approved funding for the construction of two 
homes in Freetown and Makeni to provide temporary housing for women victims of sexual and 
domestic violence. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. Although women&#8217;s participation in the 2008 local government elections increased, they 
constitute only 18 per cent of the local councils and 12 per cent of the Cabinet. Another major 
concern is the growing insecurity of women due to rape, domestic violence and FGM. Due to the 
culture of silence, the gravity of the impact of traditional practices on women&#8217;s rights is still 
underestimated. The role of the United Nations and international partners in this regard remains 
crucial. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>D.  Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>24. There was a decline in the refugee population in the country in 2008. As of October 2008 
there were 8,<footnote name="3">0. However, the catalytic funding provided to the Commission under the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund will run out in January 2009, and unless additional support is forthcoming 
from the Government and international partners, there are concerns that the operations of the 
Commission may be adversely affected. In its 2009 national budget, the Government allocated </footnote>66 refugees, compared to 9,947 for the same month in 2007, and of these 
4,077 refugees were located in rural areas, and 4,<footnote name="2">9. With US$ 1.<footnote name="5">6. Through the Action 2 programme, the Section strengthened the capacity of the 
United Nations agencies along with Government ministries, the Human Rights Commission of 
Sierra Leone and key civil society organizations through training on a human rights-based 
approach to enhance integration and mainstreaming of human rights in their operations.  </footnote> million catalytic support under the Peacebuilding Fund, significant progress 
has been made in operationalizing the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone and building 
its capacity to discharge its statutory mandate. Offices have been secured, equipped and 
furnished, core staff recruited, institutional and operational modalities established, and a number 
of activities implemented, including the release of the first &#8220;State of human rights&#8221; report of the 
Commission to Parliament. Statutory instruments for filing complaints on human rights 
violations and procedures for conducting investigations, inquiries and hearings of such 
complaints have also been passed by Parliament and published. The operationalization of the 
Commission is a major milestone in strengthening the national capacity to promote and protect 
human rights in Sierra Leone. 
</footnote>89 in Freetown, Bo and Kenema. In the course 
of 2008, 1,040 refugees were assisted to voluntarily repatriate and 106 were resettled to third 
countries. 
</p>
<p>25. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has 
provided shelter support for 150 families in the former refugee communities and a further 
100 family shelters are in progress. Microcredit and starter kits support has been delivered to 
282 individual refugees. The draft refugee legislation was enacted which, inter alia, provides for 
a national refugee authority responsible for formulation of refugee policy. This authority will 
strive to ensure the rights of refugees are respected, granting refugee status prima facie in the 
case of large influxes and ensuring adequate facilities for reception and care of refugees. 
Furthermore, a refugee secretariat has been established in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. The level of enjoyment of economic and social rights remained low, owing to the 
continued lack of adequate basic social services including safe drinking water, health-care 
services, and education and housing facilities. Some progress was made in the energy sector, 
which resulted in an increase in the availability of electricity to Freetown. 
</p>
<p>27. For most of 2008, the country experienced the effects of the global food crisis with 
skyrocketing costs and in some cases scarcity of essential commodities such as food, medicines 
and petroleum products. The rate of unemployment remained high especially among youths. The 
period also saw numerous strike actions by employees of both the Government and the private 
sector over poor conditions of service, delayed and non-payment of salaries, poor working 
conditions, and illegal dismissals and redundancies. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
has identified the lack of availability of basic social services and the high level of poverty as one 
of the underlying causes of the ten-year civil conflict. However while significant progress has 
been made in addressing civil and political rights since the end of the conflict, very little progress 
has been made in addressing the social and economic concerns of people. Continuous low levels 
of enjoyment of economic and social rights have the propensity to unravel any gains that have 
been made. 
</p>
<p>28. One key area of concern is the health sector. While a number of hospitals and health 
centres have been refurbished and a contingent of foreign-trained doctors deployed in 
Government hospitals, many hospitals remain poorly staffed, lack basic drugs and medical 
supplies, and are virtually incapable of effectively responding to emergencies. There have also 
been instances of people dying in the hands of quack medical practitioners who prey on innocent 
victims, especially in communities where hospitals and medical facilities do not exist or are not 
affordable. In 2008, a review of the first full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP I) 
(2005-2007) was completed and achievements and lessons learned informed the preparation of 
PRSP II (2008-2012). The final draft of PRSP II recognizes and incorporates human rights, rule 
of law, and peace and security as essential prerequisites for sustainable growth and development.<b>

</p>
<p>only 231 million leones (US$ 77,000) for the Commission, which cannot cover the work of this 
institution. To avoid a funding gap and enhance the sustainability of the Commission, a 
three-year Strategic Action Plan has been developed by the Commission and work is now in 
progress with the technical support of UNIPSIL, backstopped by OHCHR, to develop the plan 
into a project proposal for the establishment of a basket fund for multi-donor support. Irish Aid 
has already made available the sum of &#8364;<footnote name="3">9. The Special Court completed the appeal in the case of the Civil Defence Forces (CDF) 
members who were convicted and sentenced to six years and eight years respectively for war 
crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions. 
The Appeal Chamber increased the sentences to 15 and 20 years respectively. The trial of the 
leading members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) was completed. The 
ground-breaking judgement in this trial, which was completed on 22 February 2008, resulted in 
the first conviction under international criminal law for the recruitment and use of child soldiers. 
Furthermore, the ruling that forced marriage is a crime against humanity was a welcome 
development in international jurisprudence. Final arguments of the Revolutionary United Front 
(RUF) trial involving Issa Hassan Sesay, Moses Kallon and Augustine Gbao were concluded 
on 24 June 2008 and a judgement was expected in December 2008. 
40. The Special Court for Sierra Leone is being slowly downsized as it has completed all but 
two cases. In addition to its remaining caseload, the Court is actively engaged in transfer of 
knowledge to local partners and archiving of jurisprudence for various purposes. A legacy 
working group consisting of the representatives of Government, civil society, United Nations 
agencies and international NGOs has been established to identify the areas of transfer of 
knowledge and implement capacity-building activities. In this context it is envisaged that the 
courts, prisons, prosecution service and civil society organizations will benefit from the 
experience of the Special Court.

<p><b>G.  Constitutional Review Commission 
</b></p>
<p>31. On 10 January 2008, the Constitutional Review Commission, established by the 
Government on 24 October 2006, submitted its report to the President. Thus far, the Government 
has made no pronouncements as to how it intends to deal with this report. The Commission 
proposed 136 amendments to the 1991 Constitution, 15 of which are entrenched provisions and 
require a national referendum for approval. A number of the proposed amendments relate to 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, including recommendations to (a) amend the 
provisions under section 27 (4) (d) (e) allowing discrimination against women, (b) render the 
national Human Rights Commission a constitutional body, and (c) introduce a list of 
non-derogable rights which cannot be restricted during periods of declared emergencies. 
However, the proposed amendments, taken together, fall short of addressing the 
recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and laying a foundation for 
peace, good governance and economic development. A number of key issues that warrant 
constitutional attention, such as separation of powers, checks and balances, decentralization, and 
the role of district councils and paramount chiefs were not adequately addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  United Nations Peacebuilding Fund 
</b></p>
<p>32. In 2008, implementation of a number of projects approved under the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund started, particularly in the area of human rights and the rule of law. These 
include among others, the US$ 3.<footnote name="4">5. The Section conducted capacity-building programmes in the area of human rights, 
democracy and the rule of law for civil society organizations, traditional leaders, religious 
organizations, and the Government and its institutions, including local district councils. It 
organized training programmes on human rights monitoring, investigation and reporting for the 
district Human Rights Committees, an umbrella grouping of local NGOs, benefiting over 
750 human rights activists. Joint monitoring of the human rights situation in the regions and joint 
training and sensitization programmes on human rights were also conducted with the 
Committees as a way of building their capacity. In 2008, in collaboration with the Committees in 
Kenema and Kailahun, the Section organized 16 training programmes benefitting

rights publications. The Section also donated six motorcycles to the district human rights 
committees in Kailahun, Kono, Port Loko, Moyamba, Bonthe and Pujehun to facilitate their 
mobility in furtherance of human rights activities, including in particular monitoring and 
reporting in their respective districts. Two regional human rights and law reference libraries were

INCLUDING TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Rule of law and administration of justice 
</b>33. Significant progress was made in the justice sector in 2008. A task force constituted by the 
President on 30 November 2007 to examine the reasons for the delay in the administration of 
justice and other related matters submitted its report with recommendations on 25 January 2008, 
to which the Government positively responded. It undertook to implement the recommendations 
within the framework of a three-year justice sector reform strategy and on 19 February 2008, the 
Government launched the Justice Sector Reform Strategy and Investment Plan 2008-2010. To 
coordinate and facilitate the implementation of the Strategy, a justice sector coordination office 
was established in the Ministry of Justice in 2008. UNDP, jointly with the Government, also </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>launched an US$ 11 million project, &#8220;Improving Access to Justice in Sierra Leone 2009-2011&#8221; to 
address gaps and challenges in the justice sector not covered by the Reform Strategy. 
Implementation of this project is in progress. 
34. Significant progress was made in the implementation of the US$ 3.<footnote name="4">9. The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section, in collaboration with UNDP, 
trained 100 police prosecutors and investigators on human rights in the administration of justice 
and on various aspects of the prosecutorial process. A manual on relevant national and 
international standards on human rights in the administration of justice was compiled and 
distributed. In collaboration with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the 
Ministry of Justice, the Section also produced a manual for police prosecutors aimed at providing 
practical guidance in their day-to-day work. In collaboration with the Ministry of Social Welfare, 
Gender and Children&#8217;s Affairs, the Justice Sector Development Programme, the Sierra Leone 
Police, the International Rescue Committee, Action Aid and Defence for Children International, 
a contribution was provided to the development of a training manual for the Family Support Unit 
(FSU) of the police for training FSU staff nationwide. In addition the Section trained 65 police 
officers selected for deployment in United Nations missions on various aspects of human rights, 
including women&#8217;s rights and gender in peacekeeping.

recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on constitutional reform and also 
suggested recommendations on a number of provisions that require amendment to ensure 
conformity with international norms and standards. </footnote> million prison project under the Peacebuilding Fund. 
Most of the substantive activities under the justice sector project, including the training of legal 
executives, police prosecutors and local court officials have been completed. The project also 
provided computers, Internet facilities and vehicles to enhance the work of the judiciary. 
However, implementation of some of the activities, including the refurbishment of the law 
library and the purchase of law books, the construction of courthouses, and residences for 
prosecutors, has been rather slow. Under the prison project, improvement was noted in the living 
conditions in some of the prisons. Beds and mattresses were procured and efforts at decongesting 
Pademba Road Prison commenced. 
</p>
<p>35. In January, there was a change in the leadership of the judiciary after His Honour 
Ade Renner, then Chief Justice, was asked by the President to go on extended leave. 
Justice Umu Jalloh, the most senior justice on the Bench, was accordingly sworn in as Acting 
Chief Justice on 28 January 2008. There were concerns that the orders of the President to the 
Chief Justice violated the Constitution but no petitions were filed to challenge the 
constitutionality of the action. In November 2008, the former Chief Justice tendered a letter of 
resignation. Justice Umu Jalloh was then appointed in December 2008 (the first female Chief 
Justice of Sierra Leone). 
</p>
<p>36. Very little progress was noted in building the prosecutorial capacity of the Ministry of 
Justice. The justice sector capacity-building project provided for the recruitment of 17 State 
Counsels. However, as of the end of 2008, only two had been recruited. Prosecution of criminal 
cases at the magistrate courts remained in the hands of police prosecutors who are not lawyers. 
To address their capacity needs, UNIPSIL and UNDP trained 100 police prosecutors in 
prosecutorial process and basic human rights under the capacity-building project. 
37. Some progress was made in the area of law reform. A new Anti-Corruption Act was passed 
by Parliament in August 2008 which expanded the powers of the Anti-Corruption Commission 
to arrest, charge and prosecute corruption cases without prior approval of the Ministry of Justice. 
The National Drug Control Act was passed in 2008 to replace the Dangerous Drugs Act and 
established the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency to implement the provisions of the Act 
and ensure conformity with international drug control conventions to which Sierra Leone is a 
signatory. A bill for the protection of persons with disabilities was also drafted and is now 
pending in Parliament.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B. Transitional justice - national reconciliation and implementation 
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIPSIL continued its advocacy, technical 
and advisory services to the Government in furtherance of the implementation of the 
recommendations made in the 2005 report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Some  </p>
<p>progress towards its implementation was made in 2008, including in particular the receipt of a 
US$ 3.<footnote name="4">8. In the justice sector, in addition to regularly monitoring the activities of the police, prisons 
and the courts, the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section collaborated with key partners to 
build the capacity of the justice sector institutions, improve justice delivery, and enhance judicial 
independence. UNIOSIL completed a draft handbook on human rights and the independence of 
the judiciary, to serve as a guide to human rights in the administration of justice for judges and 
magistrates. UNIOSIL provided technical support and advisory services in furtherance of the 
implementation of the justice sector capacity-building project, which received a US$ 3 million 
grant under the Peacebuilding Fund, and staff members served on the steering committee of the 
project. For prisons, the United Nations provided technical and advisory services in developing 
the capacity-building project for the prisons which received US$ 1.5 million support under the 
Peacebuilding Fund. UNIOSIL also computerized the data collection and documentation system 
at the Pademba Road Prison.

<p>programme for the victims of the civil conflict. In addition to providing technical support and 
advisory services, such as ensuring a human rights-based approach to all programme planning 
and implementation, members of staff of the Section also serve on the steering committee of the 
programme which provides overall guidance and control of the project. In collaboration with the 
Human Rights Commission, the Section also organized a stakeholders&#8217; consultative conference 
on the status of implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations 
in Freetown, which formulated strategies to facilitate the implementation of the outstanding 
recommendations. Of the 56 recommendations made only 20 have been fully or partially 
implemented. Many challenges remain in the implementation of the recommendations due in 
part to resource constraints and lack of a comprehensive Government policy. The Human Rights 
and Rule of Law Section is involved in advocacy activities in this connection and also serves on 
the National Steering Committee on Reparations where it provides guidance on the 
implementation of the recommendations as outlined in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
report.<b>

<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. The Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of the 
United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone 
</b></p>
<p>42. The mandate of the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section of UNIOSIL and its successor 
mission, UNIPSIL, is the following: (a) providing assistance to national commissions and 
institutions for the promotion of good governance and human rights, including the 
development of a national plan of action for human rights; (b) monitoring and promoting 
human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law; and (c) supporting the review of 
the 1991 Constitution and the enactment of relevant legislation. 
</p>
<p>43. At the beginning of 2008, the UNIOSIL Human Rights and Rule of Law Section was 
composed of 25 staff, including 6 international, 5 United Nations volunteers, and 14 national 
staff. In addition, OHCHR provided 10 national staff posts to facilitate national coverage of 
Section activities. Staff strength was reduced by 20 per cent in March 2008 consistent with 
Security Council resolution 1829 (2008). Further reductions in staffing took place upon the 
termination of the UNIOSIL mandate in September 2008. By the end of 2008, the Human Rights 
and Rule of Law Section had 3 international and 12 national staff, 10 of whom were supported 
under the OHCHR budget. OHCHR allocated US$ 326,000 in its biannual budget (2007-2008) 
to facilitate the implementation of Section activities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Activities of the Human Rights and Rule of Law Section 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Capacity building 
</b></p>
<p>44. In the area of greater country engagement, the Section focused on building national 
capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights and for the realization of rights. 
Significant achievements in this regard included the operationalization of the Human Rights 
Commission of Sierra Leone, and building its capacity for the effective implementation of its 
statutory mandate. The Section conducted a broad range of activities including capacity-building, 
policy advice, joint programming and the provision of material support. Technical support and 
advisory services were provided for the implementation of the US$ 1.5 million capacity-building 
of the Commission under the Peacebuilding Fund, and towards the formulation of the 
Commission&#8217;s five-year strategic action plan.<b> 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>46. Significant work was done in the area of human rights education for secondary schools. In 
August 2008, the Section, jointly with the Ministry of Education, organized a national 
consultative forum on the integration of human rights in the curriculum of secondary schools. 
The forum concluded that human rights education should not only be incorporated into the 
existing curriculum of junior and secondary schools, but should also be made mandatory for all 
schools. The forum also identified the subjects in which human rights should be integrated. The 
United Nations remains engaged in this process. 
</p>
<p>47. As part of the year-long advocacy on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, launched 
by the Secretary-General, the United Nations conducted several activities including radio 
programmes, nationwide sensitization workshops in communities and in schools, erection of 
billboards depicting the various articles of the Declaration, distribution of promotional materials 
(calendars, folders, stickers, etc.). Sensitization on the Declaration was also conducted 
in 12 prisons. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>2. Mainstreaming human rights 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Section succeeded in bringing together various stakeholders to consult on human 
rights issues. Through the efforts of the Section, the United Nations country team formally 
established a &#8220;human rights theme group&#8221; in a bid to foster the joint United Nations effort to 
strengthen protection and promotion of human rights in Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>52. The Section worked to develop a subregional approach to addressing the human rights 
challenges in the subregion consistent with the recommendations of the Secretary-General on 
inter-mission cooperation and cross-border activities (S/2005/135). Trafficking in human beings, 
the establishment of a database for human rights violations in each country, and increased 
information sharing have been identified as critical issues. 
</p>
<p>53. In collaboration with the Human Rights Commission of Sierra Leone, the Section 
commenced work on the formulation of a national plan of action for human rights which is 
ongoing. The Section also brought together various stakeholders and interlocutors to celebrate 
major United Nations days, including the 16 Days of Action against Domestic Violence, Child 
Rights Day and International Human Rights Day, as a way of facilitating recognition and respect 
for human rights. In addition, the Section continued to participate in the Justice Sector 
Coordination Group with a view to maximizing synergy through enhanced coordination among 
development partners in the justice sector.<b>

</p>
<p><b>4. Enhancing the cooperation of Sierra Leone with United Nations 
human rights treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>57. In order to encourage engagement by the national authorities with the work of the 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies, the Section worked closely with the Government to 
facilitate the ratification and domestication of international human rights instruments, and 
compliance with the country&#8217;s reporting obligations under international treaties. A national 
strategy on treaty bodies reporting was adopted by the Cabinet, which is now being implemented 
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the Section providing advisory services and technical 
support. The Section secured the designation of 55 technical staff from the various ministries and 
agencies of the Government as &#8220;focal persons&#8221; on treaty bodies reporting and trained them on all 
substantive issues involved in the reporting process and report drafting. The Section also 
provided technical assistance to the drafting of the common core document for the treaty 
monitoring bodies. A secretariat is now being established in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
support and coordinate the treaty body reporting process. It may be recalled that Sierra Leone is 
in default of its reporting obligations under at least four international treaties, in some cases as 
far back as 1973.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. Human rights monitoring and reporting 
</b></p>
<p>58. In furtherance of its monitoring mandate and to ensure comprehensive coverage of the 
country, the Section, in addition to its headquarters office in Freetown, maintained four field 
offices: Bo field office to cover the Southern Province; Kenema field office to cover the Eastern 
Province; Makeni field office to cover the Northern Province; and Freetown field office to cover 
the Western Area and its environs. In addition to their valuable monitoring activities, these field 
presences engaged in capacity-building and advocacy, which included training of Government 
officials, civil society and traditional leaders on various human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2008, the Section issued 250 daily reports, 50 weekly reports, and 11 monthly reports. 
These reports informed the United Nations system as to the human rights situation throughout 
the country and aimed to encourage and facilitate the taking of appropriate actions to address 
issues identified through interventions with key stakeholders. The Section also produced 
thematic reports on specific human rights issues including a monitoring report on sexual and 
gender-based violence (January-March 2008) and contributed to the regular periodic reports 
required under the UNIOSIL mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Monitoring local government elections 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Section monitored the human rights aspects of the local government elections 
on 5 July 2008. Human rights and fundamental freedoms relevant to elections, including freedom 
of association, movement, expression, assembly, the right to vote, equality and 
non-discrimination were generally respected. Notwithstanding, as mentioned earlier there were 
reports of isolated incidents of interference in the exercise of these rights.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Monitoring of the courts, prisons and police 
</b></p>
<p><b>Courts 
</b></p>
<p>61. Regular monitoring revealed that the courts, established under the statutory laws, 
functioned normally in all districts, even though some sat infrequently due to the absence of 
magistrates. The local courts however, which function under the customary laws, could not 
function for nine months throughout the country pending the appointment of new chairmen 
which took place only in October 2008. Delays in trials were noted in most of the courts. On 
11 June 2008, the High Court judge in Makeni publicly expressed in court his dissatisfaction 
with the slow processing of indictments. Lack of adequate prosecutors, overburdening of 
magistrates especially in Freetown where an average of 40-50 cases are handled every day, and 
legal practitioners taking more cases than they can conveniently handle, all account for the 
delays. Poor record-keeping systems in magistrate courts and the High Court also resulted in 
court files being misplaced or lost. In the absence of files, the cases are adjourned and trial 
prisoners suffer undue delay. A number of projects, funded by the Peacebuilding Fund, are under 
way to address these shortcomings. 
</p>
<p><b>Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>62. Based on monitoring of prisons the Section found that some progress was achieved. The 
supply of food items was more regular in most of the prisons compared to 2007. The problem of 
water supply was also resolved in most prisons through the construction of wells and connection 
with a pipe-borne water supply. Under the support of the Justice Sector Development 
Programme, a new prison was constructed in Kenema for female prisoners. In some of the 
prisons, such as in Port Loko and Bo, an income generation scheme was reactivated. The 
prisoners were engaged in soapmaking, weaving, and production of other small items.  
</p>
<p>63. On the other hand, medical facilities, including drugs and supplies, remained poor. In most 
centres, prisoners suffered from various skin diseases and no proper arrangements are in place 
for nursing mothers and their children. Sanitation remained poor in all prisons except for the 
newly built female prison in Kenema. There was either no supply or an inadequate supply of 
toiletries including soap, toothbrushes and sanitary items for women. Overcrowding remained a 
challenge in many of the prisons, with the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown the most 
overcrowded in the country. With a construction capacity of 314 prisoners it held about 
1,100 prisoners at the end of 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Remand homes 
</b></p>
<p>64. Conditions in the Freetown remand home have improved. Food supplies were standard and 
regular, and facilities to transport offenders to court have improved. Security concerns in the 
remand home have also been addressed, with the deployment of two additional police officers 
who also escort offenders to courts. However, the situation of the remand home in Bo has 
deteriorated. Food supply was inadequate and living conditions at the home remained poor at 
year end. In those provinces where there are no remand homes or approved schools for juvenile 
offenders, prison officers are obliged to accept juveniles in the prisons. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/52 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p><b>Police 
</b></p>
<p>65. It was noted that the police used force unnecessarily in a number of incidents, including the 
use of tear gas at Edwards Secondary School in Kingtom, Freetown, which left 15 students 
seriously injured, and at an incident at the State House when police severely brutalized 
6 journalists and damaged their equipment. Although an investigation was conducted, no charges 
were made against the officers. The Government provided US$ 6,200 compensation to the six 
journalists to close the matter. 
66. According to the police Complaint, Discipline and Internal Investigation Department 
(CDIID), 56 police officers were dismissed for misuse of power and for committing serious 
crimes such as rape, larceny, and others, and files have been sent to the Ministry of Justice for 
possible prosecution.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. Police detention facilities generally remained poor all over the country with inadequate 
supply of food, and poor living conditions including sanitation. In some of the detention 
facilities, juveniles were found together with adult suspects.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Some progress was made in 2008 in the promotion and protection of human rights. 
Efforts to strengthen national capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights 
have been undertaken through the establishment and operationalization of the Human 
Rights Commission. Several projects undertaken with the support of the United Nations 
Peacebuilding Fund led to capacity development in the area of human rights, and 
particularly in the justice sector and youth empowerment. Notwithstanding these positive 
developments, there are still a number of challenges in the area of human rights and the 
rule of law which must be addressed in furtherance of the consolidation of peace. Critical 
among these are sexual and gender-based violence, legal and constitutional reform, and 
capacity-building of justice sector institutions and the Human Rights Commission. 
</b>69. <b>Accordingly, the High Commissioner strongly urges the Government of Sierra Leone 
to:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Complete the constitutional reform process in time as per the recommendations 
of the Lome Peace Agreement and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Develop a comprehensive strategy for the implementation of the outstanding 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommendations, and support the implementation 
of the reparations programme through the establishment of a trust fund for victims of the 
conflict; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Provide adequate budgetary support for the Human Rights Commission and 
make timely disbursement of those allocations to enable the Commission to discharge its 
statutory function; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ratify and domesticate outstanding international human rights treaties and 
increase efforts to comply with the reporting obligations under these treaties; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/52 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Repeal the Public Order Act (1965) so as to enhance press freedom; 
 (f) Enact the draft sexual offences bill and the draft matrimonial bill to further 
protect women&#8217;s rights and effectively address the increasing wave of gender-based 
violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Establish remand homes in each province so as to prevent juvenile offenders 
from being kept in prisons with adults; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Take effective measures to ensure that &#8220;task forces&#8221; established by political 
parties to assist with their electoral campaigns, are declared illegal and disbanded; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Develop a clear policy on land reform, to include the enactment of land reform 
legislation, and establishment of effective legal mechanisms for resolution of land disputes. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The High Commissioner also urges all international partners to support the 
Government of Sierra Leone in addressing the human rights challenges that continue to 
pose threats to the consolidation of peace in the country.
