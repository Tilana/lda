<p><b>                                         Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/14.  The right to food 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on the issue of the right to food, in particular 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 62/164 of 18 December 2007 and Council resolution 6/2 
</p>
<p>of 27 September 2007, as well as all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which provides 
</p>
<p>that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for her or his health and 
</p>
<p>well-being, including food, the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger 
</p>
<p>and Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, in which the fundamental right of every person to be free 
</p>
<p>from hunger is recognized, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World 
</p>
<p>Food Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five 
</p>
<p>years later, adopted in Rome on 13 June 2002, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in 
</p>
<p>the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and 
</p>
<p>Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>paragraph 6 of its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the 
</p>
<p>same footing and with the same emphasis, </p>

<p><i> Reaffirming also </i>that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and 
</p>
<p>economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the 
</p>
<p>essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security 
</p>
<p>and poverty eradication, 
</p>
<p><i> Reiterating</i>, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the 
</p>
<p>Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used 
</p>
<p>as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the 
</p>
<p>importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of 
</p>
<p>refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law 
</p>
<p>and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced </i>that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources 
</p>
<p>and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food 
</p>
<p>Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally 
</p>
<p>in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of 
</p>
<p>increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated 
</p>
<p>efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global 
</p>
<p>dimensions and that there has been virtually no progress made on reducing hunger and 
</p>
<p>that it could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and 
</p>
<p>concerted action is taken, given the anticipated increase in the world&#8217;s population and 
</p>
<p>the stress on natural resources, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate 
</p>
<p>change are exacerbating destitution and desperation, causing a negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deep concern </i>at the number and scale of natural disasters, 
</p>
<p>diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in 
</p>
<p>massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food 
</p>
<p>security, in particular in developing countries, </p>

<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official 
</p>
<p>development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of 
</p>
<p>total official development assistance, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the theme &#8220;The right to food&#8221;, chosen by the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations to mark World Food Day on 16 October 2007, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note </i>of the Final Declaration adopted at the International Conference 
</p>
<p>on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development of the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>Organization of the United Nations in P&#244;rto Alegre, Brazil, on 10 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human 
</p>
<p>dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional 
</p>
<p>and international levels for its elimination; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms </i>the right of everyone to have access to safe and 
</p>
<p>nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of 
</p>
<p>everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or 
</p>
<p>her physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Considers it intolerable </i>that more than 6 million children still die every 
</p>
<p>year from hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 
</p>
<p>million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger 
</p>
<p>has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in 
</p>
<p>recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the 
</p>
<p>world&#8217;s present population; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that women and girls are disproportionately 
</p>
<p>affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender 
</p>
<p>inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys 
</p>
<p>to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated 
</p>
<p>that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take action to address gender inequality and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of </p>

<p>women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including 
</p>
<p>income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages 
</p>
<p>the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United 
</p>
<p>Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to 
</p>
<p>integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and 
</p>
<p>nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Encourages </i>all States to take steps with a view to achieving 
</p>
<p>progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the 
</p>
<p>conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully 
</p>
<p>the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger, and 
</p>
<p>recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive developments with respect to 
</p>
<p>the right to food in some developing countries and regions, including those 
</p>
<p>highlighted in the report of the Special Rapporteur (See A/62/289); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses </i>that improving access to productive resources and public 
</p>
<p>investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in 
</p>
<p>particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in 
</p>
<p>appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to 
</p>
<p>reduce vulnerability to droughts; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 
</p>
<p>per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm incomes; 
</p>
<p>that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge 
</p>
<p>for poor producers; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities 
</p>
<p>and local enterprises is an element key to food security and provision of the right to 
</p>
<p>food; </p>

<p> 11. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including 
</p>
<p>through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification 
</p>
<p>and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically 
</p>
<p>appropriate to the risk of drylands, and, in this regard, calls for the full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those 
</p>
<p>Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also stresses </i>its commitments to promote and protect, without 
</p>
<p>discrimination, the economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international human rights obligations and taking into account, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous 
</p>
<p>communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the 
</p>
<p>obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls 
</p>
<p>upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately 
</p>
<p>high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous 
</p>
<p>discrimination against them; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests </i>all States and private actors, as well as international 
</p>
<p>organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to 
</p>
<p>promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing 
</p>
<p>negotiations in different fields; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Recognizes </i>the need to strengthen national commitment as well as 
</p>
<p>international assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, 
</p>
<p>towards a better realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to 
</p>
<p>develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and 
</p>
<p>land because of hunger or natural or man-made disasters affecting the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Stresses </i>the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the 
</p>
<p>allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, 
</p>
<p>including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national 
</p>
<p>actions to implement sustainable food security policies; </p>

<p> 16. <i>Recognizes </i>the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha 
</p>
<p>Development Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution 
</p>
<p>to creating international conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Stresses </i>that all States should make every effort to ensure that their 
</p>
<p>international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade 
</p>
<p>agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Recalls </i>the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against 
</p>
<p>Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying 
</p>
<p>additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Recognizes </i>that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 
</p>
<p>to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and 
</p>
<p>invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as 
</p>
<p>the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the 
</p>
<p>necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who 
</p>
<p>suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on 
</p>
<p>World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Reaffirms </i>that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal 
</p>
<p>that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to 
</p>
<p>meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of 
</p>
<p>a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other 
</p>
<p>communicable diseases; 
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Urges </i>States to give adequate priority in their development strategies 
</p>
<p>and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of international development cooperation and 
</p>
<p>assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in 
</p>
<p>emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for 
</p>
<p>the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, 
</p>
<p>while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the 
</p>
<p>implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; </p>

<p> 23. <i>Calls upon </i>Member States, the United Nations system and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the 
</p>
<p>food crises currently occurring across Africa and expresses its deep concern that 
</p>
<p>funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across 
</p>
<p>different regions, including Southern Africa; 
</p>
<p> 24. <i>Invites </i>all relevant international organizations, including the World 
</p>
<p>Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have 
</p>
<p>a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food 
</p>
<p>in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States 
</p>
<p>aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a 
</p>
<p>negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 25. <i>Encourages </i>the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject 
</p>
<p>of the contribution of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, 
</p>
<p>including the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human 
</p>
<p>consumption and agriculture; 
</p>
<p> 26. <i>Recognizes</i> the negative impact of massive rises in prices of food on 
</p>
<p>the realization of the right to food, particularly on people in developing countries with 
</p>
<p>a high level of dependence on food imports for the fulfilment of nutritional national 
</p>
<p>requirements; 
</p>
<p> 27. <i>Takes note </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/7/5), and of his valuable work in the promotion of the right to food in all 
</p>
<p>parts of the world and expresses its appreciation for the work and commitment of the 
</p>
<p>first mandate-holder to achieving the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 28. <i>Encourages </i>the new mandate-holder on the right to food to discharge 
</p>
<p>his/her activities taking into account the important achievements in the fulfilment of 
</p>
<p>the mandate in recent years; </p>

<p> 29. <i>Supports </i>the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as 
</p>
<p>extended for a period of three years by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 
</p>
<p>September 2007; 
</p>
<p> 30. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General and the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial 
</p>
<p>resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 31. <i>Welcomes </i>the work already done by the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its 
</p>
<p>general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the 
</p>
<p>Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to 
</p>
<p>the inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of 
</p>
<p>other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, and is also 
</p>
<p>inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, 
</p>
<p>environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, 
</p>
<p>oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 
</p>
<p> 32. <i>Recalls </i>general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right 
</p>
<p>to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), in which the Committee noted, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption 
</p>
<p>and agriculture in the realization of the right to adequate food; 
</p>
<p> 33. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive 
</p>
<p>Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations in November 2004, represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide 
</p>
<p>an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally agreed development 
</p>
<p>goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 
</p>
<p> 34. <i>Requests </i>the Advisory Committee to consider potential 
</p>
<p>recommendations for approval by the Council on possible further measures to 
</p>
<p>enhance the realization of the right to food, bearing in mind the priority importance of 
</p>
<p>promoting the implementation of existing standards; </p>

<p> 35. <i>Welcomes </i>the continued cooperation of the High Commissioner, the 
</p>
<p>Committee and the Special Rapporteur, and encourages them to continue their 
</p>
<p>cooperation in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 36. <i>Calls upon </i>all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur in his/her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her 
</p>
<p>and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur to visit their countries to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate 
</p>
<p>more effectively; 
</p>
<p> 37. <i>Decides </i>to convene a panel discussion on the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>food in the period of its main session of 2009; 
</p>
<p> 38. <i>Recalls </i>the requests made by the General Assembly, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>62/164, that the Special Rapporteur submit to it an interim report at its sixty-third 
</p>
<p>session on the implementation of that resolution and to continue his work, including 
</p>
<p>by examining the emerging issues with regard to the realization of the right to food 
</p>
<p>within his existing mandate, and by the Council that the Special Rapporteur submit to 
</p>
<p>it a comprehensive report on the fulfilment of his/her mandate in 2009, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with its annual programme of work;  
</p>
<p> 39. <i>Invites </i>Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes, treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, as well as the private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her mandate, inter alia, through the submission of 
</p>
<p>comments and suggestions on ways and means of realizing the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 40. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of this matter under the same 
</p>
<p>agenda item in 2009 in accordance with its annual programme of work. 
</p>
<p><i>40th meeting 
27 March 2008 
</i></p>
<p>Adopted without a vote. </p>
