Commentary 
Revenues decreased due to reduced OptiBlendTM sales following a drop in oil prices 
compared to the previous corresponding period. The loss for the year increased due to 
decreased revenues and additional expenses relating to the promotion and marketing of 
EdenCreteTM in the US, particularly in Colorado and Georgia. These costs include costs of 
the expansion of the workforce in Colorado and engagement of consultants.
