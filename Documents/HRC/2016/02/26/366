<p><b>  29/6.  Independence and impartiality of the judiciary, jurors and 
</b></p>
<p><b>  assessors, and the independence of lawyers 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well 
</p>
<p>as by articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 
</p>
<p>2, 4, 9, 14 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and bearing in 
</p>
<p>mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors, the 
</p>
<p>Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct and the United Nations Principles and Guidelines 
</p>
<p>on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> all previous resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly on the independence and 
</p>
<p>impartiality of the judiciary and the integrity of the judicial system, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
</p>
<p>and lawyers submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-sixth and twenty-ninth 
</p>
<p>sessions, on judicial accountability1 and on the protection of children&#8217;s rights in the justice 
</p>
<p>system,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/29/26.  </footnote> respectively, 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, an independent legal 
</p>
<p>profession, an objective and impartial prosecution able to perform its functions accordingly 
</p>
<p>and the integrity of the judicial system are prerequisites for the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>and the application of the rule of law and for ensuring fair trials and the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice without any discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that prosecutors should, in accordance with the law, perform their 
</p>
<p>functions fairly, consistently and expeditiously, respect and protect human dignity, and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/26/32. 
</p>

<p>uphold human rights, thus contributing to due process and the smooth functioning of the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice system, 
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> the increasingly frequent attacks on the independence of judges, 
</p>
<p>lawyers, prosecutors and court officials, in particular threats, intimidation and interference 
</p>
<p>in the discharge of their professional functions, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that every State should provide an effective framework of remedies to 
</p>
<p>redress human rights grievances or violations and that the administration of justice, 
</p>
<p>including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent 
</p>
<p>judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments is essential to the full and non-discriminatory 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and 
</p>
<p>sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that it is essential to ensure that judges, prosecutors, lawyers and 
</p>
<p>court officials possess the professional qualifications required for the performance of their 
</p>
<p>functions through improved methods of recruitment and legal and professional training, and 
</p>
<p>through the provision of all necessary means for the proper performance of their role in 
</p>
<p>ensuring the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the importance of ensuring accountability, transparency and integrity in the 
</p>
<p>judiciary as an essential element of judicial independence and a concept inherent to the rule 
</p>
<p>of law when it is implemented in line with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
</p>
<p>Judiciary and other relevant human rights norms, principles and standards, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that judges, prosecutors and lawyers play a critical role in upholding 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the absolute and non-derogable right of freedom from torture and 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing also</i> that an independent and impartial judiciary, objective and 
</p>
<p>impartial prosecution services and an independent legal profession that foster a balanced 
</p>
<p>representation of men and women and the establishment of gender-sensitive procedures are 
</p>
<p>essential for the effective protection of women&#8217;s rights, including protection from violence 
</p>
<p>and revictimization through court systems, to ensuring that the administration of justice is 
</p>
<p>free from gender-based discrimination and stereotypes, and to a recognition that both men 
</p>
<p>and women benefit when women are treated equally by the justice sector, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of bar associations, professional associations of judges 
</p>
<p>and prosecutors, and non-governmental organizations working in defence of the principle 
</p>
<p>of the independence of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> the role that independent and effective national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>established in accordance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles) can and should play 
</p>
<p>in strengthening the rule of law and in supporting the independence and integrity of the 
</p>
<p>judicial system, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that legal aid is an essential element of a fair, humane and efficient 
</p>
<p>system of administration of justice that is based on the rule of law, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that children who come into contact with the law and/or the justice 
</p>
<p>system have rights, needs and interests that must be considered and respected, including 
</p>
<p>through the provision of child-friendly procedures, and that the administration of justice 
</p>
<p>must be in line with States&#8217; commitments and obligations under international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and with principles 
</p>
<p>and standards relating to children, including the principles of non-discrimination and the 
</p>
<p>best interests of the child, as well as the right to life and the right of the child to express his </p>


<p>or her own views freely in all matters affecting him or her, the views of the child being 
</p>
<p>given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all 
</p>
<p>decisions concerning the child in the administration of justice, including in relation to 
</p>
<p>pretrial measures, as well as being an important consideration in all matters concerning the 
</p>
<p>child with regard to the sentencing of his or her parents, or, where applicable, legal 
</p>
<p>guardians or primary caregivers, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the special needs of children in situations of vulnerability who are in contact 
</p>
<p>with justice systems, who may require particular attention, protection and skills from the 
</p>
<p>professionals interacting with them, especially from lawyers, prosecutors and judges, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 26/7 of 26 June 2014, in which the 
</p>
<p>Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
</p>
<p>lawyers for a period of three years, and acknowledging the importance of the mandate 
</p>
<p>holder&#8217;s ability to cooperate closely, within the framework of the mandate, with the Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including in the fields of 
</p>
<p>advisory services and technical cooperation, in the effort to guarantee the independence of 
</p>
<p>judges and lawyers,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to guarantee the independence of judges and lawyers 
</p>
<p>and the objectivity and impartiality of prosecutors, and their ability to perform their 
</p>
<p>functions accordingly, including by taking effective legislative, law enforcement and other 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures that will enable them to carry out their professional functions without 
</p>
<p>interference, harassment, threats or intimidation of any kind; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Encourages</i> States to promote diversity in the composition of the members of 
</p>
<p>the judiciary, including by taking into account a gender perspective and by promoting

</p>
<p>all levels, and to ensure that the requirements for joining the judiciary and the selection 
</p>
<p>process thereof are non-discriminatory, public and transparent, based on objective criteria, 
</p>
<p>and guarantee the appointment of individuals of integrity and ability with appropriate 
</p>
<p>training and qualifications in law, based on individual merit and under equal working

<p>conditions; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Stresses</i> that the term of office of judges, their independence, security, 
</p>
<p>adequate remuneration, conditions of service, pensions and age of retirement should be 
</p>
<p>adequately secured by law, that the security of tenure of judges is an essential guarantee of 
</p>
<p>the independence of the judiciary and that grounds for their removal must be explicit with 
</p>
<p>well-defined circumstances provided by law, involving reasons of incapacity or behaviour

<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and with principles and standards relating to 
</p>

<p>6. <i>Further encourages</i> States to consider, in collaboration with relevant national 
</p>
<p>entities such as bar associations, associations of judges and prosecutors, and educational

</p>
<p>action of judges, lawyers, prosecutors and other actors in the judicial system;

</p>
<p>families and professional associates, against all forms of violence, threat, retaliation,

<p>condemn such acts and bring perpetrators to justice; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Calls upon</i> States, in collaboration with relevant national entities such as bar 
</p>
<p>associations, associations of judges and prosecutors, and educational institutions, to provide 
</p>
<p>adequate training, including human rights training, for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, 
</p>
<p>both on initial appointment and periodically throughout their careers, taking into account 
</p>
<p>regional and international human rights law and, where applicable and relevant, the

</p>
<p>and regional human rights courts; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Underscores</i> the importance for States of developing and implementing an 
</p>
<p>effective and sustainable legal aid system that is consistent with their international human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations and takes into account relevant commitments and good practices, and of 
</p>

</p>
<p>appropriate eligibility criteria and in accordance with international human rights law;
