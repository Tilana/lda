Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>1. In its resolution 6/20, the Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to convene in 2008 a workshop for an exchange of good 
practices, added value and challenges for regional arrangements for the promotion and protection 
of human rights. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) convened the workshop in Geneva on 24 and 25 November 2008.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>2. At the workshop, the need for more coherent and regular cooperation among regional 
mechanisms and between regional and international mechanisms was highlighted. A number of 
the conclusions from the meeting identified entry points for greater OHCHR support in this 
respect. Specifically, they emphasized the importance of strengthening the Office&#8217;s internal 
capacity in relation to regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>3. Following discussions with the main cosponsor of Council resolution 6/20, OHCHR 
decided that it would submit a report on the information shared and observations made during 
the course of the workshop to the Council at its eleventh session, when a resolution on the matter 
would also be tabled.
