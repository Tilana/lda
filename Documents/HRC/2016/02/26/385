<p><b>Human Rights Council 
Twenty-ninth session 
</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 3 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 2 July 2015 
</b></p>
<p><b>  29/1.  Fiftieth anniversary of the adoption and fortieth   
</b></p>
<p><b>  anniversary of the entry into force of the International  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Covenants on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> that the International Covenants on Human Rights constitute the first all-
</p>
<p>embracing and legally binding international treaties in the field of human rights and, 
</p>
<p>together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, form the core of the International 
</p>
<p>Bill of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that 2016 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the General Assembly in its resolution 2200 
</p>
<p>(XXI) on 16 December 1966, and acknowledging the fundamental importance and special 
</p>
<p>status of these basic human rights instruments of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> that 2016 will also mark the fortieth anniversary of the entry into 
</p>
<p>force of the International Covenants on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Considering</i> that the anniversary of the adoption of the International Covenants on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights provides an opportunity for the United Nations and its Member States to 
</p>
<p>intensify their efforts to promote awareness and strengthened observance of the rights set 
</p>
<p>out in the Covenants and other international instruments in the field of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the observance and effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>universally recognized standards in the field of human rights as contained in the Covenants, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated, that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and 
</p>
<p>equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and that while the 
</p>
<p>significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and 
</p>
<p>religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States, regardless of their 
</p>
<p>political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never 
</p>
<p>exempt or excuse States from the promotion and protection of the other rights, in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and with international law, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of the International Covenants on Human Rights as 
</p>
<p>major components of international efforts to promote universal respect for and observance 
</p>
<p>of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> all States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and requests the Secretary-General to continue to 
</p>
<p>support the annual treaty event to this end; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages</i> States parties to consider limiting the extent of any reservations 
</p>
<p>that they lodge to the International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocols 
</p>
<p>thereto, to formulate any reservations as precisely and narrowly as possible and to review 
</p>
<p>regularly such reservations with a view to withdrawing them so as to ensure that no 
</p>
<p>reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> the strictest compliance by States parties with their obligations 
</p>
<p>under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, where applicable, the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocols thereto; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to make 
</p>
<p>provisions for events and arrangements aimed at the celebration of the anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenants on Human Rights and to circulate the relevant information among 
</p>
<p>States and other stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations organs and agencies, in coordination with the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner, to celebrate the anniversary of the International Covenants on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights by intensifying their own contributions to United Nations system-wide efforts to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Decides</i> to convene at its thirty-first session a high-level panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>the topic, &#8220;The fiftieth anniversary of the International Covenants on Human Rights: 
</p>
<p>universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights&#8221;, in 
</p>
<p>order to give the fiftieth anniversary of the International Covenants on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>attention commensurate with its historical significance; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Recommends</i> that the General Assembly mark the fiftieth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenants on Human Rights during its seventy-first session. 
</p>
<p><i>42nd meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>2 July 2015 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
