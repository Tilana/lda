<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comments of the Government of Kyrgyzstan on the report of 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment or punishment  
</b></p>
<p>1. Mr. Juan Mendez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, visited the Kyrgyz Republic on December 5 &#8211; 13, 2011 
and presented his report to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic on January 24, 2012.  
</p>
<p>2. The Kyrgyz Republic highly values this work and expresses its gratitude to the 
Special Rapporteur and his team.  
</p>
<p>3. In view of the interest in defining the objective situation with the practice of using 
torture in the country, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic invited the Special 
Rapporteur Mr. Juan Mendez to visit the Kyrgyz Republic and provided him with open and 
unrestricted access to all closed institutions in accordance with his mandate.  
</p>
<p>4. The Kyrgyz Government agrees to some findings and critical comments of the 
Special Rapporteur, at the same time it hereby submits some comments to his report.  
</p>
<p>5. The Government makes significant efforts to align the legislation with the new 
Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic of 2010 and international human rights commitments 
of the country. The Concept of legal policy has been drafted and is currently under review; 
the Jogorku Kenesh (the national Parliament) at present is considering the Law on the 
National Center on prevention of torture as well as a package of changes and amendments 
to the Criminal and Procedural Codes.  
</p>
<p>6. In terms of its oversight function, the agencies of the Office of the Prosecution of the 
Republic make regular and targeted efforts to combat torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>7. A number of departmental normative and regulatory acts were adopted and 
enforced.  
</p>
<p>8. On April 12, 2011 the Prosecutor General issued the Directive &#8220;On strengthening 
procuracy oversight over observance of constitutional guarantee of prohibition of torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;, in pursuance of this 
directive the prosecution agencies conduct activity aimed at strengthening the procuracy 
oversight over observance of constitutional guarantee of prohibition of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>9. On September 6, 2011 the Prosecutor General sent her instruction to the prosecutors 
of all levels, in addition to concrete tasks, this instruction provided for personal liability of 
the heads of territorial prosecution bodies for ensuring the observance of the constitutional 
guarantee of prohibition of torture on respective territories.  
</p>
<p>10. The Action Plan on prevention of torture (dated September 28, 2011) was drafted 
and is under implementation. For the purpose of verifying the observance of the Directive 
of the Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyz Republic by the lower level prosecutors, a mobile 
group composed of the staff of the Office of the Prosecutor General has been conducting 
the inspection which lasted since January 10 until February 15, 2012.  
</p>
<p>11. As the investigation of torture presents certain difficulties, the Office of the 
Prosecutor General developed and forwarded to the prosecutors for their use the 
Methodological Recommendations on investigation of torture and other cruel, inhuman or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment as well as the Methodology of inspecting the temporary 
detention facilities (IVS).  
</p>
<p>12. In pursuance of the abovementioned normative acts, municipal prosecutors conduct 
systematic inspections of the police control rooms, administrative punishment cells, 
temporary detention facilities (IVS) of district police departments; they also visit offices of 
the inquiry and criminal investigation officers, review the complaints registers and 
interview citizens. Surprise visits have also become a practice.  
</p>
<p>13. During 2011 the prosecutors conducted 860 surprise visits which resulted in 15 
submissions (disciplinary action was taken in respect of 3 persons), 4 notices of 
improvement, 1 person was warned on inadmissibility of violating the law and 6 criminal 
cases were initiated.  
</p>
<p>14. In order to ensure the observance of law, the prosecutors initiated the installation 
and functioning of video cameras in the temporary detention facilities (IVS) of the police 
departments of Jalal-Abad and Mailu-Suu cities, as well as Bazar-Korgon and Toktogul 
districts of the Jalal-Abad province. Similar activities are conducted in the IVS of the police 
departments of Suzak and Aksy districts. The Office of the Prosecution in the Talas 
province initiated the installation of video cameras in the IVS of the Talas provincial police 
department.  
</p>
<p>15. During 2011 the offices of the prosecution received 298 complaints on torture and 
other cruel treatment (in 2010 there were 270 such complaints). The review of 244 
complaints resulted in dropping the criminal proceedings (in 2010 there were 236 such 
decisions); criminal proceedings were initiated in respect of 54 or 18.1% of complaints (in 
2010 &#8211; 34 complaints or 12.6%). In the course of investigating these criminal cases the 
investigating officers issued resolutions to suspend 14 police officers from performing their 
duties.  
</p>
<p>16. The increase in the number of initiated criminal cases from 34 to 54 compared to 
2010 was caused not by the growth of instances of using torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, but due to pro active work of the offices of the 
prosecution.  
</p>
<p>17. The criminal and procedural legislation clearly regulates the process of verification 
and evaluation of evidence; all available evidence, including the confessionary statements, 
is subject to objective and comprehensive review. The collected evidence is compared with 
other evidence, the necessity of obtaining new evidence is explored and the sources of 
evidence are verified. Each evidence is subject to objective and comprehensive evaluation 
in their aggregate, therefore the decision of the court on the culpability of the convict is 
based not only on his / her confessionary statements, but also on all available and accessible 
evidence evaluated in their aggregate.  
</p>
<p>18. The criminal and procedural law does not envisage the priority of submitting a 
complaint on the use of torture first to the office of the prosecution and then to court; the 
rights of appeal of the suspect / accused / defendant against the actions of investigation 
bodies are not limited. In the event such complaint is received, it is registered in the case 
and the judge is obliged to verify the validity thereof. In case the court verdict is appealed 
against, the violation of such procedure may result in cancellation of the court verdict and 
disciplinary measures in respect of such judge.  
</p>
<p>19. The institutions of the penitentiary system of the country really do face certain 
challenges. More specifically, an acute problem is to provide the necessary living 
conditions for the inmates in the settlement colonies with the State penitentiary service 
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The premises of the correctional facilities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>badly need capital repair. For many years such repair has not been performed in the 
correctional institutions NN 1, 2, 3, 8, 14, 16, 31 etc. due to the lack of funds.   
</p>
<p>20. Among the inmates of the pre-trial detention centers (SIZO) there are convicts who 
are kept there to perform domestic duties, these inmates are detained in strict isolation from 
other persons in custody, and no contacts between them are allowed. This is in line with 
Article 46 of the Criminal penitentiary Code of the Kyrgyz Republic. 
</p>
<p>21. The life imprisonment is the strictest type of punishment envisaged in the criminal 
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, the execution of this punishment is not compatible with 
keeping the persons sentenced to life imprisonment in the institution of open and semi-open 
types (settlement colonies). Regrettably, difficult financial and economic situation of the 
country does not allow the allocation of funds for the construction of a special separate 
facility for this category of inmates. Therefore such persons are kept in SIZO No 1 and 
correctional colony No 47 without being provided with minimum living standards ensuring 
their normal life. In this context the Republic would appreciate the assistance from the 
international community and international organizations.  
</p>
<p>22. The case of Mr. A. Askarov deserves special mentioning as this case was the one of 
significant public response. The report contains a one-sided description of the criminal case 
against Mr. A. Askarov and other convicts as well as the criminal case against Mr. K. 
Turdahunov, Mr. S. Nurdinov, Mr. K. Ermakov and Mr. M. Ismanov.  
</p>
<p>23. The panel of judges on criminal cases and administrative infractions of the Supreme 
Court of the Kyrgyz Republic has confirmed the verdicts pronounced by the courts of the 
first and the second instances in respect of these criminal cases. At the same time the report 
fails to indicate the causes and effects as well as the court proceedings during the review of 
the cases and delivering the verdicts. In considering the case of Mr. Azimjan Askarov and 
other convicts, the courts received numerous statements and motions of the defense 
lawyers. On each statement judges were making decisions to investigate the allegations of 
torture and obtaining confessionary statements under coercion. Despite the fact that the 
court allowed the motion of Mr. Askarov&#8217;s defense lawyer concerning the examination of 
the latter, Mr. Askarov made a written waiver to undergo such examination in the presence 
of his defense lawyers, a forensic expert, the representatives of investigation bodies and the 
penitentiary institution. In addition, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Kyrgyz 
Republic also checked the validity of arguments made by the defense lawyers in respect of 
tortures and confessionary statements under coercion; these facts were not confirmed. The 
supervisory complaints of the defense lawyers contained allegations of illegal methods of 
investigation in respect of their clients. In the process of review of the case the supervisory 
instance conducted a comprehensive and objective investigation of these allegations, which 
were subsequently rejected as non-corresponding to the materials of the criminal case.  
</p>
<p>24. During the review and evaluation of the evidence pertaining to the criminal case 
against police officers Mr. K. Turdahunov, Mr. S. Nurdinov, Mr. K. Ermakov and Mr. M. 
Ismanov, the reviewing authority decided to uphold the judicial decisions made by the 
courts of previous instances, which confirm the innocence of these persons. As the findings 
of the forensic examination on the casus of bodily harm of the victim were ambiguous, the 
panel of judges on criminal cases and administrative infractions of the Supreme Court of 
the Kyrgyz Republic decided that the injuries of the victim were caused not by the actions 
of the police officers, but rather were inflicted during the double car accident committed by 
him and his escape and intention to disappear from the scene of the crime.  
</p>
<p>25. The report also says that the Special Rapporteur failed to get information on at least 
a single case when the evidence was not admitted due to the fact that it had been illegally 
obtained. During the meeting between the leadership of the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz 
Republic and the Special Rapporteur and his team, this issue was discussed. Later the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/61/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>copies of the decisions of a local court in the Kyrgyz language were sent to the Special 
Rapporteur, this decision was acquitting the defendant due to the confirmed fact that the 
evidence was obtained illegally. Therefore the Kyrgyz Republic has a practice of acquitting 
the defendants in the event that the use of coerced confessions is confirmed.  
</p>
<p>26. The Kyrgyz Republic remains open for a constructive dialogue and cooperation with 
the Special Procedures of the UN and expresses its hope for future fruitful interaction on 
issues of common interest.
