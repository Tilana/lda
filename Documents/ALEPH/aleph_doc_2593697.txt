PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
1.  Basis of Presentation
The financial statements included in this report reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the consolidated results of operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, and consolidated cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  The unaudited results of
operations for the interim periods reported are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
The financial statements were prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) for interim reporting.  As permitted under those rules, certain notes or other financial information
that are normally required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States have been
condensed or omitted from these interim financial statements.  These statements, therefore, should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Corporation’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of
Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction
to the associated debt liability.  The Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 has been recast to reduce
Other assets and Long-term debt by $38 million.
In the first quarter of 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which makes
changes to both the variable interest model and the voting interest model, which is applicable to all reporting entities
involved with limited partnerships or similar entities.  The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements:  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic, ASC
606.  This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted from the first
quarter of 2017.  We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, as a new ASC Topic, ASC 842.  The new standard will
require the recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases with lease terms greater than one year, including leases
currently treated as operating leases under the existing standard.  This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first
quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  This
ASU makes changes to various provisions associated with share-based accounting, including provisions affecting
the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for forfeitures, and the consideration of net settlement provisions on
the balance sheet classification of the share-based award.  This ASU is effective for us beginning in the first quarter
of 2017, with early adoption permitted.  We are currently assessing the impact of the ASU on our consolidated
financial statements.
2.  Common and Preferred Stock Issuance
In February 2016, we issued 28,750,000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575,000
shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Convertible Preferred Stock), par value $1 per share,
with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for total net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.  The dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock will
be payable on a cumulative basis.  Unless converted earlier, each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will
automatically convert into between 21.822 shares and 25.642 shares of our common stock based on the average
share price over a period of twenty consecutive trading days ending prior to February 1, 2019 (the “Final Average
Price”), subject to anti-dilution adjustments.
We also entered into capped call transactions that are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our
common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock if the Final Average Price exceeds $45.83 per
share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.  The number of common shares to be delivered by the counterparties to us
will be the value of the capped call transactions at conversion divided by the Final Average Price.  The value of the
capped call transactions will be zero if the Final Average Price is $45.83 or less and can be up to the capped value of
approximately $98 million if the Final Average Price is $53.625 or higher.  For any Final Average Price between
$45.83 and $53.625, the value of the capped call

transactions will be 12.55 million covered shares multiplied by the difference between the Final Average Price and
$45.83.   The premium paid for the capped call transactions was $37 million, which was recorded against Capital in
excess of par in the Statement of Consolidated Equity.

4.  Capitalized Exploratory Well Costs
The following table discloses the net changes in capitalized exploratory well costs pending determination of proved
reserves during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (in millions):

$1,415 
 
   (114 )
 $1,394
Exploratory wells costs charged to expense in the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $218 million, which
includes $104 million of exploratory well costs incurred in 2016 that are not reflected in the table above.  We
expensed the non-operated Melmar exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, where noncommercial quantities of
hydrocarbons were encountered.  In addition, at the non-operated Sicily exploration project in the Gulf of Mexico
where hydrocarbons were encountered, we decided in the second quarter not to pursue the project due to the current
price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases.  The cost of both wells drilled at Sicily were
expensed in the quarter.
Capitalized exploratory well costs capitalized for greater than one year following completion of drilling were $1,150
million at June 30, 2016 and primarily related to:
Australia:  Approximately 70% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to our Equus project on
license WA-390-P, offshore Western Australia, where development planning and commercial activities for our natural
gas discoveries are ongoing.  In December 2014, we executed a non-binding letter of intent with the North West Shelf
(NWS), a third-party joint venture with existing natural gas processing and liquefaction facilities.  In the second
quarter of 2016, we continued a joint front-end engineering study with NWS and discussions with potential long-term
purchasers of liquefied natural gas.  Successful execution of binding agreements with NWS is necessary before we
can execute a gas sales agreement and sanction development of the project.  In addition, in March 2016, we were
awarded a retention lease through 2021 covering certain areas within the WA-390-P License which include our
Equus discoveries.  At our adjacent WA-474-P license which could become part of the Equus project, we completed
drilling of an exploration commitment well in the second quarter of 2016 and encountered hydrocarbons.  The
associated well costs have been capitalized pending determination of proved reserves.
Ghana:  Approximately 20% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to offshore Ghana.  Since
2014, we have completed three appraisal wells and continue to progress subsurface evaluation and development
planning.  The government of Côte d’Ivoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of Ghana,
which includes a portion of our Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license.  We are unable to proceed with
development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter, which may also impact our ability to develop the
license.  The International Tribunal for Law of the Sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border
dispute in 2017.  Under terms of our license and subject to resolution of the border dispute, we have declared
commerciality for four discoveries, including the Pecan Field in March 2016 which would be the primary development
hub for the block.  We are continuing to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given
the maritime border dispute.

HESS CORPORATION AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Guyana:  Approximately 10% of the capitalized well costs in excess of one year relates to the Stabroek Block,
offshore Guyana, where the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, announced a significant oil
discovery at the Liza #1 well in the second quarter of 2015.  During 2016, the operator drilled the Liza #2 well which
also encountered hydrocarbons, continued pre-development activities for Liza, and completed a 17,000 square
kilometer 3D seismic shoot on the Stabroek Block.  The operator is currently drilling the Skipjack exploration well,
which is a separate prospect 25 miles northwest of the Liza discovery.
5.  Impairment
As a result of establishing the Bakken Midstream operating segment in the second quarter of 2015, we performed
impairment tests on the Offshore and Onshore reporting units prior to creation of the Bakken Midstream segment in
accordance with accounting standards for goodwill.  No impairment resulted from this assessment.  In addition, we
performed separate impairment tests at June 30, 2015, on the allocated goodwill to the Bakken Midstream segment
and Onshore reporting unit of the E&P segment following the creation of the Bakken Midstream segment.  No
impairment existed for the Bakken Midstream segment, but goodwill allocated to the Onshore reporting unit of $385
million did not pass the impairment test.  As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $385 million in the second
quarter of 2015 to reduce the Onshore reporting unit goodwill to its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical
purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards.
6.  Bakken Midstream Joint Venture
On July 1, 2015, we sold a 50% interest in Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) to Global Infrastructure Partners  for
net cash consideration of approximately $2.6 billion.  HIP and its affiliates primarily comprise our Bakken Midstream
operating segment which provides fee-based services including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of
natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids,
transportation of crude oil by rail car and the storage and terminaling of propane, primarily located in the Bakken
shale play of North Dakota.
We consolidate the activities of HIP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP.  At June 30, 2016,
HIP liabilities totaling $789 million (December 31, 2015: $824 million) are on a nonrecourse basis to Hess
Corporation, which includes total long-term debt of $684 million (December 31, 2015: $704 million).  At June 30,
2016, HIP assets available to settle its obligations include Cash and cash equivalents totaling $1 million (December
31, 2015: $3 million) and Property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of $2,444 million (December 31, 2015:
$2,358 million).
7.  Debt
We have $300 million in fixed-rate public notes that will mature in June 2017.  These notes have been classified as
long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016 based on available capacity under our $4 billion
committed revolving credit facility that expires in 2020.

10.  Guarantees and Contingencies
We are subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, including
administrative proceedings and proceedings relating to environmental matters.  A liability is recognized in our
consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be
reasonably estimated.  If the risk of loss is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of
loss is only reasonably possible, a liability is not accrued; however, we disclose the nature of those
contingencies.  We cannot predict with certainty if, how or when existing claims, lawsuits and proceedings will be
resolved or what the eventual relief, if any, may be, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of
development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.
Numerous issues may need to be resolved, including through lengthy discovery, conciliation and/or arbitration
proceedings, or litigation before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.  Subject to the foregoing, in
management’s opinion, based upon currently known facts and circumstances, the outcome of such lawsuits, claims
and proceedings, including the matters described below, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.  However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our opinion regarding the
outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
in the period in which the amounts are accrued and our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.
In September 2003, we received a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)
to remediate contamination in the sediments of the Lower Passaic River.  The NJDEP is also seeking natural
resource damages. The directive, insofar as it affects us, relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage
terminal in Newark, New Jersey we previously owned.  We and over 70 companies entered into an Administrative
Order on Consent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study the same contamination; this work
remains ongoing.  We and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the State of New Jersey and also agreed
with EPA to fund remediation of a portion of the site.  In April 2014, the EPA issued a Focused Feasibility Study
(“FFS”) proposing to conduct bank-to-bank dredging of the lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River at an
estimated cost of $1.7 billion.  On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (“ROD”) in respect of the
lower eight miles of the Lower Passaic River, selecting a remedy that includes bank-to-bank dredging at an
estimated cost of $1.38 billion.  The ROD does not address the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic River, which
may require additional remedial action.  In addition, the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate
assessment of damages to natural resources in the Passaic River.  Given that the EPA has not selected a remedy for
the entirety of the Lower Passaic River, total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time.   Based on
currently known facts and circumstances, we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us
because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our
former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could
not have contributed contamination along most of the river’s length.

12.   Financial Risk Management Activities
In the normal course of our business, we are exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil
and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values.  Financial risk management
activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas we produce or
by reducing our exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements.  Generally, futures, swaps or option
strategies may be used to fix the forward selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas production.  Forward
contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we conduct the business with the intent of
reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  These forward contracts comprise various currencies, primarily
the British Pound and Danish Krone.  Interest rate swaps may be used to convert interest payments on certain long-
term debt from fixed to floating rates.
Gross notional amounts of both long and short positions are presented in the volume table below.  These amounts
include long and short positions that offset in closed positions and have not reached contractual maturity.  Gross
notional amounts do not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities of the Corporation, but are used in the
calculation of cash settlements under the contracts.

Derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments:
Interest rate swaps:  At June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had interest rate swaps with gross notional
amounts totaling $1,300 million, which were designated as fair value hedges.  In the second quarter and first six
months of 2016, the unrealized change in fair value of interest rate swaps was an increase of $4 million and $18
million, respectively, compared with a decrease of $6 million and an increase of $4 million in the second quarter and
first six months of 2015, respectively.   Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps result in a corresponding
adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged fixed‑rate debt.
Crude oil collars:  Total losses from Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude oil collars in the second quarter and
first six months of 2015 decreased Sales and other operating revenues by $35 million and $18 million, respectively,
which included pre-tax losses of $35 million and $23 million, respectively, associated with changes in time value of
the hedging contracts.  There were no crude oil hedges outstanding in 2016.
Derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments:
Foreign exchange:  Total foreign exchange gains and losses, which are reported in Other, net in Revenues and non-
operating income in the Statement of Consolidated Income amounted to gains of $15 million and $21 million in the
second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared with a loss of $7 million and a gain of $8 million
in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.  Changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts
that are not designated as hedges, which are a component of total foreign exchange gains and losses above,
amounted to gains of $33 million and $13 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively,
compared with a loss of $41 million and a gain of $57 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015,
respectively.
The after‑tax foreign currency translation adjustments included in the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive
Income in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 amounted to a loss of $27 million and a gain of $142
million, respectively, compared with a gain of $72 million and loss of $48 million in the second quarter and first six
months of 2015, respectively.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Overview
Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development,
production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production
operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint
Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Norway.  The Bakken Midstream operating segment provides fee-based
services, including crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas
liquids, terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids, transportation of crude oil by rail car, and the
storage and terminaling of propane, primarily in the Bakken shale play of North Dakota.
Second Quarter Results
In the second quarter of 2016, we incurred a net loss of $392 million compared to a net loss of $567 million in the
second quarter of 2015.  Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods on pages 23 and
25, the adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $335 million compared to $147 million in the second
quarter of 2015.  Lower production and realized selling prices reduced second quarter 2016 results by approximately
$365 million after income taxes.  Second quarter 2016 results also reflected reductions in operating costs, general
and administrative expenses, and depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense compared with the
prior-year quarter due to lower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts.
2016 Revised Capital and Exploratory Expenditures and Production Guidance
Capital and Exploratory Expenditures:  E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are now projected to be
approximately $2.1 billion for the full year of 2016, down 48% from 2015, and $300 million lower than our previous
guidance.  The reduced spending reflects our continuing efforts to apply Lean principles to reduce costs and improve
operating efficiencies across our portfolio and certain deferred activity.  Bakken Midstream capital expenditures for
2016 are estimated to be $290 million which is down from previous guidance of $340 million.
Production:  For the full year 2016, net production is projected to be in the range of 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day (boepd) to 325,000 boepd.  The decline from our previous guidance of 330,000 boepd to 350,000 boepd
primarily reflects unplanned downtime at two Gulf of Mexico fields.  At the Tubular Bells Field, two wells were shut-in
for an extended period in the first half of 2016 due to defective subsurface valves.  These defective valves have been
replaced.  In July at the Tubular Bells Field, a subsurface valve in a third well failed and is expected to be remediated
in the fourth quarter.  Full year production is also impacted by a mechanical issue at a well at the Conger Field, which
is expected to be remediated in the fourth quarter.  The full year impact of these temporary mechanical issues is
expected to be approximately 20,000 boepd in 2016.
Response to Low Oil Prices
In the second quarter of 2016, we continued to focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet and reducing
costs and capital expenditures.  We ended the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total
liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately $7.7 billion.  We were also able to reduce
costs and improve operating efficiencies across our portfolio, resulting in a further reduction to projected full year
2016 capital and exploratory expenditures.  Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for 2016, we continue to
forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the year.  We
are able to fund our projected net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full year of 2016
with cash on hand.  Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve our financial
position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, by issuing debt and equity
securities, and/or pursuing asset sales.
Exploration and Production
In the second quarter of 2016, E&P incurred a net loss of $328 million compared with a net loss of $502 million in the
second quarter of 2015.  Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, the adjusted net
loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $271 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $96 million in
2015.  Worldwide net production averaged 313,000 boepd in the second quarter of 2016, compared to pro forma net
production, which excludes assets sold, of 386,000 boepd in the second quarter of 2015.  The average realized
crude oil selling price was $41.95 per barrel, down from $55.83 in the second quarter of 2015, which included
hedging.  The average realized natural gas liquids selling price in the second quarter of 2016 was $9.03 per barrel
compared to $11.06 in the prior-year quarter while the average realized natural gas selling price was $3.58 per
thousand cubic feet (mcf), down from $4.49 in the second quarter of 2015.

PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
Overview (continued)
The following is an update of our E&P activities:
Producing E&P assets:
·In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken oil shale play decreased to 106,000 boepd for the second quarter
of 2016 (2015: 119,000 boepd) primarily due to reduced drilling activity in response to low oil prices.  In the second
quarter of 2016, we operated an average of three rigs, drilled 20 wells and brought 26 new wells on
production.  Drilling and completion costs averaged $4.8 million per operated well in the second quarter of 2016, a
reduction of 14% from the prior-year quarter.  We currently plan to operate a two rig program starting in the third
quarter of 2016.  For the full year of 2016, we intend to bring 90 wells online and expect production to be 100,000
boepd to 105,000 boepd compared to previous guidance of 95,000 boepd to 105,000 boepd for 2016.
 ·In the Utica shale, five wells were brought on production and net production increased to 29,000 boepd in the
second quarter of 2016 (2015: 22,000 boepd).  We ceased drilling activities in March of this year in response to
lower commodity prices.
 ·In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 54,000 boepd (2015: 84,000 boepd).  The decrease in production
resulted from unplanned downtime due to defective subsurface valves at the Tubular Bells Field (Hess 57%), a
mechanical issue at one well in the Conger Field (Hess 38%), and extended planned shutdowns on third-party
hosted production facilities at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields.  These defective subsurface valves have been
replaced.  In July, a subsurface valve in an additional well at the Tubular Bells Field failed and is expected to be
remediated in the fourth quarter.  The mechanical issue at the Conger Field is also expected to be remediated in the
fourth quarter of this year.  For the full year of 2016, production for the Tubular Bells Field is expected to average
10,000 boepd.  In addition, we have commenced drilling of a fifth production well at Tubular Bells which is
scheduled to be brought online in early 2017.
 ·Net production from the Valhall Field (Hess 64%), offshore Norway, decreased to 19,000 boepd for the second
quarter of 2016 (2015: 35,000 boepd) as a result of a planned maintenance shutdown that was completed in July
2016.  In the second quarter of 2016, the operator, BP, and Aker ASA announced the creation of a new operating
entity, Aker BP ASA.
 ·At the North Malay Basin (Hess 50%), in the Gulf of Thailand, net production from the Early Production System
averaged 33 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) for the second quarter of 2016 (2015: 42 mmcfd).  In the second
quarter, we installed three wellhead platforms and the jacket for the central processing platform with first gas
projected in 2017.  The Phase 1 development drilling campaign is on schedule with eight out of eleven planned
wells now drilled.
 ·In the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand (Hess 50%), net production averaged 236 mmcfd for the
second quarter of 2016 (2015: 283 mmcfd) primarily due to lower net entitlement.  Commissioning of the new
booster compressor is scheduled for the third quarter of 2016 which will require a 15 day planned shut-down of
production facilities.
 ·At the South Arne Field (Hess 62%) in Denmark, where production averaged 15,000 boepd in the second quarter of
2016 (2015: 12,000 boepd), we completed a multi-well drilling campaign and demobilized the rig.  Planned
downtime of 20 days is scheduled in the third quarter of 2016.
Other E&P assets:
·In Guyana, at the offshore Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana
Limited, completed drilling of the Liza #2 well.  This well was designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil
discovery and included an extended drill stem test.  The Liza #2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17,963 feet and
encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Upper Cretaceous formations.  The
operator is currently drilling the Skipjack exploration well which is a separate prospect approximately 25 miles
northwest of the Liza discovery.
 ·Drilling and construction of production facilities at the Hess operated Stampede development project (Hess 25%) in
the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico continues with first production scheduled for 2018.  At the non-
operated Sicily project (Hess 25%) in the Gulf of Mexico where hydrocarbons were encountered, we decided in the
second quarter not to pursue the project due to the current price environment and the limited time remaining on the
leases.  Costs of both wells drilled at Sicily were expensed in the quarter.

Bakken Midstream
The following is an update of our Bakken Midstream activities:
·We continue to progress the construction of facilities and reconfiguration of pipelines in McKenzie and Williams
counties that are expected to increase the volumes of crude oil and natural gas to be sent to our natural gas
processing and crude oil and natural gas liquids logistics assets in Tioga and Ramberg.  We expect these projects
to be in service in 2017.

Results of Operations (continued)
“Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation” presented in this report is a non-GAAP financial
measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified
as affecting comparability of earnings between periods.  Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate
the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced
by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to
ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.  This measure is not, and should
not be viewed as, a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income (loss).
In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on
an after-tax basis.  Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its
review of variances in segment earnings.  Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of
explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax
amount.  After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax
amounts.

Selling Prices:  Average realized crude oil selling prices were 25% and 31% lower in the second quarter and first six
months of 2016, respectively, compared to same periods in 2015 primarily due to declines in Brent and West Texas
Intermediate crude oil prices.  In addition, realized selling prices for natural gas liquids were down 18% and
36%,  respectively, and realized selling prices for natural gas were down 20% and 24%, respectively, in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015.  Lower realized selling prices reduced
after-tax results by approximately $160 million and $390 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,

(a)Reflects natural gas production converted on the basis of relative energy content (six mcf equals
one barrel).  Barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of
natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude
oil over the recent past.  In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil.  See the
average selling prices in the table on page 20.
United States:  Onshore crude oil production was lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared
to the corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the Bakken shale play in response to
low oil prices.  Onshore natural gas liquids production was higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,
compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to greater processed volumes captured at the Bakken
shale.  Onshore natural

gas production was higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the corresponding periods
in 2015, primarily due to more wells being brought on production in the Utica shale play, partially offset by lower
natural gas production in the Bakken.  Total offshore production was lower in the second quarter and first six months
of 2016, compared to the corresponding periods in 2015, as a result of unplanned downtime due to defective
subsurface valves at the Tubular Bells Field, a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger Field, and extended
planned shutdowns on third-party hosted production facilities at the Tubular Bells and Conger Fields.
Europe:  Crude oil production was lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to planned maintenance downtime at the Valhall Field, Offshore
Norway, in the second quarter of 2016.
Africa:  Crude oil production was lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to reduced drilling activity in Equatorial Guinea and the sale of our
Algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Net production from the Algeria asset was 5,000 boepd in the second
quarter and first six months of 2015.
Asia:  Natural gas production was lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the
corresponding periods in 2015, primarily due to lower production entitlement at the JDA.
Sales Volumes:  The impact of lower sales volumes decreased after-tax results by approximately $205 million and
$225 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared with the corresponding
periods in 2015.

gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over
the recent past.  In addition, natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent to crude oil.  See the average
selling prices in the table on page 20.
Cost of Products Sold:  Cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil,
natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, as well as rail
transportation fees from our Bakken Midstream operating segment.  The decrease in Cost of products sold in the
second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared with the same periods in 2015, principally reflects the decline
in benchmark crude oil prices.
Cash Operating Costs:  Cash operating costs, consisting of Operating costs and expenses, Production and
severance taxes and E&P General and administrative expenses, were down in the second quarter and first six
months of 2016, compared to the same periods in 2015, resulting from lower operating costs and general and
administrative expenses due to lower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts, and lower production taxes in
the Bakken shale play.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization:  DD&A expenses were lower in the second quarter and first six months of
2016, compared with the prior-year periods, resulting from lower production and an improved portfolio average DD&A
rate due to the production mix.
Bakken Midstream Tariffs Expense:  Tariff expenses decreased in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the same
periods in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in volumes processed through the Tioga Gas Plant.  Tariff expenses in
the first six months of 2016 were comparable to the same period in 2015.

Exploratory dry hole costs in the second quarter of 2016 primarily relate to the write-off of two wells at the non-
operated Sicily prospect in the Gulf of Mexico where we decided not to pursue the project due to the current price
environment and the limited time remaining on the leases.  Exploratory dry hole costs in the first quarter of 2016
relate to the non-operated Melmar exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, where noncommercial quantities of
hydrocarbons were encountered.  Exploratory dry hole costs and exploratory lease impairment in the first six months
of 2015 included charges related to the Dinarta Block, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the write down of a foreign
exploration project to fair value.  See further information below under Items Affecting the Comparability of Earnings
Between Periods.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, are estimated to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in
the third quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full year.
Income Taxes:  Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the effective income tax rate for
E&P operations was a benefit of 47% and 43% in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively,
compared to a benefit of 56% and 51% in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.  Excluding
items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, the E&P effective income tax rate is expected to be a
benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter of 2016, and a benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the full
year of 2016, assuming no contribution from Libya.

Exploration expense:  In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $83 million ($52 million after
income taxes) to write-off the previously capitalized Sicily #1 exploration well completed in 2015.  In the first quarter
of 2015, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $159 million ($67 million after income taxes) to write-off a previously
capitalized exploration well and associated leasehold expenses related to the Dinarta Block, in the Kurdistan Region
of Iraq.  Exploration expenses also included a pre-tax charge of $16 million ($10 million after income taxes) to write
down a foreign exploration project to fair value.  These amounts are included in Exploration expenses, including dry
holes and lease impairment in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
Contract termination costs:  In the second quarter of 2016, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $36 million ($22 million
after income taxes) associated with the termination of a drilling rig contract.  In the second quarter of 2015, we
incurred a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($21 million after income taxes) associated with terminated international
office space.  The rig termination charge is included in Operating costs and expenses and the charge for the
terminated office lease is included in General and administrative expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
Gains on asset sale:  In the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($17 million after
income taxes) related to the sale of undeveloped Onshore acreage in the United States.  This gain is included in
Other, net in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
Impairment:  In the second quarter of 2015, we incurred a noncash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $385
million ($385 million after income taxes) associated with our onshore reporting unit.  As a result of establishing the
Bakken Midstream business as a separate operating segment in the second quarter of 2015, U.S. GAAP required the
allocation of goodwill to the Bakken Midstream segment and a goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting
units.
Inventory write-off:  In the first quarter of 2015, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($16 million after income
taxes) to write off surplus drilling materials in Equatorial Guinea.  This charge is included in Operating costs and
expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

(a)The partnership is not subject to tax and, therefore, the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income is a pre-tax
amount.
Total revenues and non-operating income for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 decreased, compared
to the same periods in 2015, as a result of lower rail export revenue.  The decrease in Operating costs and expenses
in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, primarily reflects the
decrease in third-party rail charges.  The increase in DD&A in the second quarter and first six months of 2016,
compared to the same periods in 2015, result from capital expenditures on gathering pipelines and railcars that have
been placed in service.  The increase in interest expense reflects borrowings by Hess Infrastructure Partners LP
(HIP) subsequent to its formation on July 1, 2015.  Net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Bakken
Midstream segment is estimated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $40
million to $50 million for the full year.

Corporate and other expenses were lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to 2015,
primarily due to reductions in employee costs, professional fees, and other general and administrative
expenses.  Third quarter 2016 corporate expenses after income taxes, are expected to be in the range of $25 million
to $30 million, and interest expense after taxes is expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million.  Our
estimate for corporate expenses for the full year is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million after
income taxes, and interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $195 million to $205 million after income taxes.
Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods:
In the first quarter of 2015, we incurred exit costs of $6 million ($4 million after income taxes).
Other Items Potentially Affecting Future Results:
Our future results may be impacted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, volatility in the selling prices of
crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas, reserve and production changes, impairment charges and exploration
expenses, industry cost inflation and/or deflation, changes in foreign exchange rates and income tax rates, changes
in deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with continued operating losses, the effects of weather,
political risk, environmental risk and catastrophic risk.  For a more comprehensive description of the risks that may
affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

Operating activities:  Net cash provided by operating activities was $137 million in the first six months of 2016,
compared to $1,076 million in the first six months of 2015.  The reduction in 2016 operating cash flows primarily
reflects lower production volumes and lower benchmark crude oil price in the first six months of 2016.
Investing activities:  The decrease in Additions to property, plant and equipment in the first six months of 2016, as
compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to reduced drilling activity (Bakken, Utica, Norway, Denmark
and Equatorial Guinea) and reduced development expenditures (Tubular Bells and the JDA).  Proceeds from asset
sales in the first six months of 2016 relates to the sale of undeveloped acreage, onshore United States and
consideration received from the December 2015 sale of our assets in Algeria.

representing 575,000 shares of 8% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for total net proceeds of $1,644
million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and offering expenses.  We repaid debt of $60 million
(2015: $34 million) and paid $169 million of common and preferred stock dividends in the first six months of 2016
(2015: $144 million).  We paid $78 million for the settlement of common stock repurchases during the first six months
of 2015.
Future Capital Requirements and Resources
We ended the second quarter of 2016 with $3.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity, including
available committed credit facilities, of approximately $7.7 billion.  Based on current forward strip crude oil prices for
2016, we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the
year.  We are able to fund our projected net operating cash flow deficit (including capital expenditures) for the full
year of 2016 with cash on hand.  Due to the low commodity price environment, we may take other steps to improve
our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays, by issuing debt and
equity securities, and/or pursuing asset sales.

Hess Corporation has a $4.0 billion syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in January 2020.  Based on our credit
rating as of June 30, 2016, borrowings on the facility will generally bear interest at 1.3% above the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR).   The interest rate will be higher if our credit rating is lowered.  The facility contains a financial
covenant that limits the amount of the total borrowings on the last day of each fiscal quarter to 65% of the
Corporation’s total capitalization, defined as total debt plus stockholders’ equity.  As of June 30, 2016, Hess
Corporation had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and was in compliance with this financial covenant.
HIP’s $400 million 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund
the joint venture’s operating activities and capital expenditures.  Borrowings generally bear interest at the LIBOR plus
an applicable margin ranging from 1.10% to 2.00%.  The interest rate is subject to adjustment based on the joint
venture’s leverage ratio, which is calculated as total debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
Amortization (EBITDA).  If the joint venture obtains credit ratings, pricing levels will be based on the credit ratings in
effect from time to time.  The joint venture’s credit facilities contain financial covenants that generally require a
leverage ratio of no more than

Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)
5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters and an interest coverage ratio, which is calculated as EBITDA to interest
expense, of no less than 2.25 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters.
At June 30, 2016, borrowings attributable to the joint venture, which are non-recourse to Hess Corporation, amounted
to $600 million on the Term Loan A loan facility and $90 million on the revolving credit facility excluding deferred
issuance costs.  HIP is in compliance with all debt covenants at June 30, 2016, and its financial covenants do not
currently impact its ability to issue indebtedness to fund future capital expenditures.
We also have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or
preferred stock.
Market Risk Disclosures
The Corporation is exposed in the normal course of business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of
crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values.  See Note 12, Financial
Risk Management Activities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial Risk Management Activities
Financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or
natural gas produced by us or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements.  Generally, futures,
swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of our crude oil or natural gas
production.  Forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which we do business with the
intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.  Interest rate swaps may also be used, generally to
convert fixed‑rate interest payments to floating.
We have outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $859 million at June 30, 2016, to
reduce our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies, primarily the British Pound and
Danish Krone.  The change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar
exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately $60 million at June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, our outstanding long‑term debt of $6,552 million, including current maturities, had a fair value of
$7,073 million.  A 15% increase or decrease in the rate of interest would decrease or increase the fair value of long-
term debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, by approximately $410 million or $470 million, respectively.
We have no outstanding commodity price hedges at June 30, 2016.
Forward-looking Information
Certain sections in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated by reference herein,

“intend,” “project,” “plan,” “predict,” “will,” “target” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which
generally are not historical in nature.  Forward-looking statements related to our operations and financial conditions
