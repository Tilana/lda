FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
3
The matters discussed in this report include forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-
looking terminology such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “might,”
“plan,” “potential,” “predict” or “should” or “will” or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology. In particular,
statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance contained in this report are
forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and
projections. While we believe these expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections are reasonable, such forward-looking
statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These
and other important factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual
results to differ from our expectations include:
•the potential adverse effects of ARP’s filings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) and restructuring
transactions on our operations, management and employees and the risks associated with operating our business during the
restructuring process;
•risks and uncertainties associated with ARP’s Chapter 11 proceedings including the ability to achieve the anticipated benefits
therefrom;
•our limited operating history as a separate public company, and that our historical financial information is not necessarily representative
of the results that we would have achieved had we been the owner or operator of our assets and may not be a reliable indicator of our
future results;
•whether we are able to continue to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation from Atlas Energy;
 •the fact that our primary assets are our partnership interests, including the IDRs, in ARP and partnership interests in AGP and, therefore,
our cash flow is dependent on the ability of ARP and AGP to make distributions in respect of those partnership interests;
•our ability to meet our liquidity needs, including as a result of any reduction or elimination of distributions from ARP or AGP and their
ability to meet their liquidity needs, and ability to satisfy covenants in our, ARP’s and AGP’s debt documents;
•actions that we, ARP and AGP may take in connection with our and its liquidity needs, including the ability to service our, ARP’s and
•actions that we, ARP and AGP may take in connection with our and its liquidity needs, including the ability to service our, ARP’s and
AGP’s debt;
•restrictive covenants in our, ARP’s and AGP’s indebtedness that may adversely affect operational flexibility;
 •the demand for natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate;
 •the price volatility of natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate;
 •changes in the differential between benchmark prices for oil and natural gas and wellhead prices that we, ARP and AGP achieve;
 •effects of partial depletion or drainage by earlier offset drilling on our, ARP’s and AGP’s acreage;  
 •economic conditions and instability in the financial markets;
 •the impact of our common units being quoted on the OTCQX Best Market and not listed on a national securities exchange;
 •changes in the market price of our common units;
 •future financial and operating results;
 •economic conditions and instability in the financial markets;
 •effects of debt payment obligations on our distributable cash;
 •the impact of ARP’s securities being quoted on the OTC rather than listed on the New York Stock Exchange;
 •resource potential;
4
•success in efficiently developing and exploiting our, ARP’s and AGP’s reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional
recoverable reserves;
•the accuracy of estimated natural gas and oil reserves;
 •the financial and accounting impact of hedging transactions;
 •the ability to fulfill the respective substantial capital investment needs of us, ARP and AGP;
 •expectations with regard to acquisition activity, or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions;
 •the limited payment of dividends or distributions, or failure to declare a dividend or distribution, on outstanding common units or other
equity securities;
•any issuance of additional common units or other equity securities, and any resulting dilution or decline in the market price of any such
securities;
•potential changes in tax laws that may impair ARP’s ability to obtain capital funds through investment partnerships;
 •the ability of ARP to raise funds through its investment partnerships or through access to capital markets;
 •the ability to obtain adequate water to conduct drilling and production operations, and to dispose of the water used in and generated by
these operations, at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules;
•the effects of unexpected operational events and drilling conditions, and other risks associated with drilling operations;
 •access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide for tertiary recovery operations;
 •impact fees and severance taxes;
 •changes and potential changes in the regulatory and enforcement environment in the areas in which we, ARP and AGP conduct
business;
•the effects of intense competition in the natural gas and oil industry;
 •general market, labor and economic conditions and related uncertainties;
 •the ability to retain certain key customers;
 •dependence on the gathering and transportation facilities of third parties;
 •the availability of drilling rigs, equipment and crews;
 •potential incurrence of significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental
regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment;
•uncertainties with respect to the success of drilling wells at identified drilling locations;
 •ability to identify all risks associated with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties, pipeline, facilities or existing wells, and the
sufficiency of indemnifications we receive from sellers to protect us from such risks;
•expirations of undeveloped leasehold acreage;
 •uncertainty regarding operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and exploration and development costs;
 •exposure to financial and other liabilities of the managing general partners of the investment partnerships;
 •the ability to comply with, and the potential costs of compliance with, new and existing federal, state, local and other laws and
regulations applicable to our, ARP’s and AGP’s business and operations;
•restrictions on hydraulic fracturing;
•ability to integrate operations and personnel from acquired businesses;
•exposure to new and existing litigations;
 •the potential failure to retain certain key employees and skilled workers;

5
•the effects of a cyber event or terrorist attack.
The foregoing list is not exclusive. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking
statements in this document are more fully described in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. The forward-looking statements included in this document speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. We
do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any such statements or to publicly announce the results of any

ATLAS ENERGY GROUP, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1—BASIS OF PRESENTATION
We are a publicly traded (OTC: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references to “Atlas Energy Group, LLC,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company,” refer to Atlas Energy Group, LLC, and our
combined and consolidated subsidiaries.
On February 27, 2015, our former owner, Atlas Energy, L.P. (“Atlas Energy”), transferred its assets and liabilities, other than those related
to its midstream assets, to us, and effected a pro rata distribution of our common units representing a 100% interest in us, to Atlas
Energy’s unitholders (the “Separation”). Concurrently with the distribution of our units, Atlas Energy and its remaining midstream interests
merged with Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”; NYSE: TRGP) and ceased trading.
At June 30, 2016, our operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:
·100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest
(consisting of 20,962,485 common and 3,749,986 preferred limited partner units) in Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”), a publicly
traded Delaware master limited partnership (“MLP”) (OTC: ARPJ) and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil
and natural gas liquids (“NGL”), with operations in basins across the United States. As part of its exploration and production activities,
ARP sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (“Drilling Partnerships”), in which it coinvests, to finance a portion
of its natural gas and oil production activities;
 ·all of the incentive distribution rights, an 80.0% general partner interest and a 2.1% limited partner interest in Atlas Growth Partners, L.P.
(“AGP”), a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations
primarily focused in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. On June 30, 2015, AGP concluded a private placement offering, during which
it issued $233.0 million of its common limited partner units. Of the $233.0 million of gross funds raised, we purchased $5.0 million
common limited partner units. AGP’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2016. AGP is offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units
and Class T common units, each representing limited partner interests in AGP, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis.
AGP must receive minimum offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary
offering may not exceed $1.0 billion. The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T
common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders'
deferred payment obligation to AGP. AGP is also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a
distribution reinvestment plan; and
 ·12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. (“Lightfoot L.P.”) and a 15.4% general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital
Partners GP, LLC (“Lightfoot G.P.” and together with Lightfoot L.P., “Lightfoot”), the general partner of Lightfoot L.P., an entity for which
Jonathan Cohen, Executive Chairman of the Company’s board of directors, is the Chairman of the Board. Lightfoot L.P. focuses its
investments primarily on incubating new MLPs and providing capital to existing MLPs in need of additional equity or structured debt. We
account for our investment in Lightfoot under the equity method of accounting. During both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, we received net cash distributions of approximately $0.4 million. During both the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
received net cash distributions of approximately $0.8 million.
At June 30, 2016, we had 26,037,992 common limited partner units issued and outstanding. The common units are a class of limited
liability company interests in us. The holders of common units are entitled to participate in company distributions and exercise the rights
or privileges available to holders of common units as outlined in the limited liability company agreement.
The accompanying condensed combined consolidated financial statements, which are unaudited except that the balance sheet at
December 31, 2015, was derived from audited financial statements, have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim reporting. They do not include all disclosures normally made in
12
financial statements contained in Form 10-K. It is suggested that these interim condensed combined consolidated financial statements be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. In
management’s opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the periods disclosed have been made. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation due to the adoption of certain accounting standards (see Note 5). The results of operations for the interim
periods presented may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year.
NOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Combination
Our condensed combined consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, subsequent to the transfer
of assets on February 27, 2015, include our accounts and accounts of our subsidiaries. Our condensed combined consolidated financial
statements for the portion of 2015 which is prior to the transfer of assets on February 27, 2015, were derived from the separate records
maintained by Atlas Energy and may not necessarily be indicative of the conditions or results of operations that would have existed if we
had been operated as an unaffiliated entity. Because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all the various entities
comprising us, Atlas Energy’s net investment in us is shown as equity in the condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed combined
consolidated balance sheets and related condensed combined consolidated statements of operations. Such estimates included
allocations made from the historical accounting records of Atlas Energy, based on management’s best estimates, in order to derive the
financial statements of us. Actual balances and results could be different from those estimates. Transactions between us and other Atlas
Energy operations have been identified in the condensed combined consolidated financial statements as transactions between affiliates.
In connection with Atlas Energy’s merger with Targa and the concurrent Separation, we were required to repay $150.0 million of Atlas
Energy’s term loan credit facility, which was issued in July 2013 for $240.0 million. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we included $150.0
million of Atlas Energy’s original term loan at the time of issuance, and the related interest expense, within our historical financial
statements. Atlas Energy’s other historical borrowings were allocated to our historical financial statements in the same ratio. We used
proceeds from the issuance of our Series A preferred units (see Note 10) and borrowings under our term loan credit facilities to fund the
$150.0 million payment.
We determined that ARP and AGP are variable interest entities (“VIE’s”) based on their respective partnership agreements, our power, as
the general partner, to direct activities that most significantly impact each of their respective economic performance, and our ownership of
each of their respective incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial statements of ARP and AGP into our
condensed combined consolidated financial statements. Our VIE’s operating results and assets balances are presented separately in
Note 12 – Operating Segment Information. As the general partner for both ARP and AGP, we have unlimited liability for the obligations of
ARP and AGP except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. The non-
controlling interests in ARP and AGP are reflected as (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the condensed combined
consolidated statements of operations and as a component of unitholders’ equity on the condensed combined consolidated balance
sheets. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
In accordance with established practice in the oil and gas industry, our condensed combined consolidated financial statements include
our pro-rata share of assets, liabilities, income and lease operating and general and administrative costs and expenses of the Drilling
Partnerships in which ARP has an interest. Such interests generally approximate 30%. Our condensed combined consolidated financial
statements do not include proportional consolidation of the depletion or impairment expenses of ARP’s Drilling Partnerships. Rather,
ARP calculates these items specific to its own economics.
On June 5, 2015, ARP completed the acquisition of our coal-bed methane producing natural gas assets in the Arkoma Basin in eastern
Oklahoma for $31.5 million, net of purchase price adjustments (the “Arkoma Acquisition”). ARP funded the purchase price using proceeds
from the issuance of 6,500,000 common limited partner units. The Arkoma Acquisition had an effective date of January 1, 2015. ARP
accounted for the Arkoma Acquisition as a transaction between entities under common control in its standalone consolidated financial
statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot. Our
primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service, capital
13
expenditures, and distributions to unitholders, which we expect to fund through operating cash flow, and cash distributions received.
We rely on the cash flows from the distributions received on our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot. The amount of cash that
ARP and AGP can distribute to their partners, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash they each generate from their
operations. ARP’s and AGP’s future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil
and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016.
These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted ARP’s and AGP’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained low
commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on ARP’s and AGP’s liquidity position and ability to make distributions.
Reductions of such distributions to us would adversely affect our ability to fund our cash requirements and obligations and meet our
financial covenants under our credit agreements.
On May 5, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to suspend ARP’s common unit and Class C preferred distributions, beginning with the
month of March of 2016, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.
Ability for the Company and ARP to Continue as a Going Concern
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and us, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a Restructuring
Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s senior secured revolving credit
facility (the “First Lien Lenders”), (ii) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s second lien term loan (the “Second Lien Lenders”) and (iii) holders
(the “Consenting Noteholders” and, collectively with the First Lien Lenders and the Second Lien Lenders, and their respective successors
or permitted assigns that become party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the “Restructuring Support Parties”) of approximately
80% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes due 2021 (the “7.75% ARP Senior Notes”) and the
9.25% ARP Senior Notes due 2021 (the “9.25% ARP Senior Notes” and, together with the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes, the “Notes”) of
ARP’s subsidiaries, Atlas Resource Partners Holdings, LLC and Atlas Resource Finance Corporation (together, the “Issuers”). Under the
Restructuring Support Agreement, the Restructuring Support Parties have agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support
ARP’s restructuring (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”). See Note 3, “ARP Restructuring
Support Agreement,” for further information.
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court,” and the cases
commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Filings”). The cases commenced thereby are being jointly administered under the caption “In re:
ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
The Restructuring, including as a result of ARP monetizing certain hedges to pay down borrowings outstanding under ARP’s senior
secured credit facility, will result in a reduction of ARP’s existing debt by approximately $900 million and elimination of approximately
$80 million of ARP’s annual debt service obligations. Pursuant to the Plan, ARP’s business assets and operations will vest in a limited
liability company, which will be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“New Holdco”). ARP expects to
consummate the Plan and emerge from Chapter 11 before the end of the third quarter of 2016. Interested parties should refer to the
information and the limitations and qualifications discussed in ARP’s disclosure statement related to ARP’s Restructuring (the “ARP
Disclosure Statement”) which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to ARP’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 25, 2016.
ARP intends to continue to operate its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, it is contemplated that
all of ARP’s suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired by the Plan and will be
satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary
course operations, ARP obtained interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking
authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay
vendors, oil and gas obligations and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated all of ARP’s outstanding debt obligations under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility (as defined below), the ARP Second Lien Term Loan (as defined below) and the indenture governing the ARP Notes. Any
efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as a result of ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement
are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.  Accordingly, we classified all of ARP’s outstanding debt obligations as a current
liability on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. See Note 5, Debt, for further information.
14
ARP’s Restructuring is not expected to materially impact us or our ownership interest in AGP or Lightfoot. We are not a party to ARP’s
Restructuring. We remain controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, we expect that ARP’s Restructuring
will not have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or the other businesses.
The significant risks and uncertainties related to ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings raise substantial doubt about ARP’s and our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the
going concern uncertainty. If we and ARP cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of
our and ARP’s assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.
Atlas Growth Partners - Liquidity and Capital Resources
AGP has historically funded its operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through cash generated from operations and
financing activities, including its private placement offering completed in 2015. AGP’s future cash flows are subject to a number of
variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of
2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted AGP’s revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on AGP’s liquidity position.
AGP is not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and ARP’s Restructuring is not expected to materially impact AGP.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of our condensed combined consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities that exist at the date of our condensed combined consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue
and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. Our condensed combined consolidated financial statements are based on a
number of significant estimates, including revenue and expense accruals, depletion, depreciation and amortization, fair value of
derivative and other financial instruments and fair value of certain gas and oil properties and asset retirement obligations. Such estimates
included estimated allocations made from the historical accounting records of Atlas Energy in order to derive the historical financial
statements of us. The natural gas industry principally conducts its business by processing actual transactions as many as 60 days after
the month of delivery. Consequently, the most recent two months’ financial results were recorded using estimated volumes and contract
market prices. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Net Income (Loss) Per Common Unit
Basic net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders per unit is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common
unitholders, which is determined after the deduction of net income attributable to participating securities and the preferred unitholders’
interests, if applicable, by the weighted average number of common unitholders units outstanding during the period.
Unvested unit-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
participating securities. A portion of our phantom unit awards, which consist of common units issuable under the terms of our long-term
incentive plans and incentive compensation agreements, contain non-forfeitable rights to distribution equivalents. The participation rights
result in a non-contingent transfer of value each time we declare a distribution or distribution equivalent right during the award’s vesting
period. However, unless the contractual terms of the participating securities require the holders to share in the losses of the entity, net
loss is not allocated to the participating securities. As such, the net income utilized in the calculation of net income (loss) per unit must be
after the allocation of only net income to the phantom units on a pro-rata basis.

(1)Net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders for the net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders per unit calculation is
net income (loss) attributable to common unitholders, less income allocable to participating securities. For the three months ended
June 30, 2016, and 2015, net loss attributable common unitholder’s ownership interest is not allocated to approximately 352,000 and
69,000 phantom units, respectively, because the contractual terms of the phantom units as participating securities do not require the
holders to share in the losses of the entity. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, net loss attributable common
unitholder’s ownership interest is not allocated to approximately 307,000 and 67,000 phantom units, respectively, because the
contractual terms of the phantom units as participating securities do not require the holders to share in the losses of the entity.
Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common limited partners per unit is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to
common limited partners, less income allocable to participating securities, by the sum of the weighted average number of common limited
partner units outstanding and the dilutive effect of unit option awards and convertible preferred units, as calculated by the treasury stock
or if converted methods, as applicable. Unit options consist of common units issuable upon payment of an exercise price by the
participant under the terms of our long-term incentive plan.

loss attributable to common unitholders per unit with those used to compute diluted net loss attributable to common unitholders per unit

Rabbi Trust
In 2011, we established an excess 401(k) plan relating to certain executives. In connection with the plan, we established a “rabbi” trust for
the contributed amounts. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we reflected $4.1 million and $5.6 million, respectively, related to the
value of the rabbi trust within other assets, net on our condensed combined
16
consolidated balance sheets, and recorded corresponding liabilities of $4.1 million and $5.6 million as of those same dates, respectively,
within asset retirement obligations and other on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheets. During the six months ended
June 30, 2016, a $2.3 million distribution was made to participants related to the rabbi trust.  No distributions were made to participants
related to the rabbi trust for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting guidance related to leases. The updated
accounting guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease asset and liability at the commencement date of all leases (with the exception
of short-term leases), initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. The updated guidance is effective for us as of
January 1, 2019 and requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the
earliest period presented.  We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on
our condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
In August 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs specific to
line-of-credit arrangements. The updated accounting guidance allows the option of presenting deferred debt issuance costs related to
line-of-credit arrangements as an asset, and subsequently amortizing over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of
whether there are any outstanding borrowings. We adopted the updated accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016 and it did not
have a material impact on our condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
In February 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to consolidation under the variable interest entity and voting
interest entity models. The updated accounting guidance modifies the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities, limited
partnerships and similar legal entities. We adopted this accounting guidance upon its effective date of January 1, 2016, and it did not
have a material impact on our condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the evaluation of whether there is substantial doubt about an
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The updated accounting guidance requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date
the financial statements are issued and provide footnote disclosures, if necessary.  We adopted this accounting guidance on January 1,
2016, and provided enhanced disclosures, as applicable, within our condensed combined consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The updated accounting guidance provides a
single, contract-based revenue recognition model to help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity
should recognize revenue, and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer
the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The updated accounting
guidance provides companies with alternative methods of adoption. We are currently in the process of determining the impact that the
updated accounting guidance will have on our condensed combined consolidated financial statements and our method of adoption.
NOTE 3—RESTRUCTURING SUPPORT AGREEMENT
As disclosed in Note 2, on July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and us, solely with respect to certain sections thereof,
entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement with the Restructuring Support Parties.  On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the
Restructuring Support Parties have agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support ARP’s Restructuring pursuant to the Plan.
In particular, under the Plan, on the Plan’s effective date (the “Plan Effective Date”), the First Lien Lenders will receive cash payment of all
obligations owed to them by ARP pursuant to the senior secured revolving credit facility (other than $440 million of principal and face
amount of letters of credit) and become lenders under an exit facility credit agreement (the “First Lien Exit Facility”), composed of a $410
million conforming reserve-based tranche and a $30 million non-conforming tranche. The non-conforming tranche will mature on May 1,
2017 and the conforming reserve-based tranche will mature on August 23, 2019. In addition, ARP will enter into a new second lien credit
agreement (the “Second Lien Exit Facility” and, together with the First Lien Exit Facility, the “Exit Facilities”). The Second Lien Lenders
will receive a pro rata share of the Second Lien Exit Facility, which will have an aggregate principal amount of $250 million plus the
amounts resulting from the accrual of paid in kind interest on the principal amount of $250 million from the commencement of ARP’s
Chapter 11 Filings, with interest expense paid in cash to be reduced to 2% and the remainder to be paid-in-kind from the
17
commencement date through May 1, 2017 at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 9% per annum. During the next 15-month period,
cash and in-kind interest will vary based on a pricing grid tied to ARP’s leverage ratio under the ARP revolving credit facility. After such
15-month period, interest will accrue at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 9% per annum and will be payable in cash. In addition to
the Second Lien Exit Facility, the Second Lien Lenders will receive a pro rata share of 10% of the common equity interests of New
HoldCo, subject to dilution by a management incentive plan. Holders of the Notes, in exchange for 100% of the $668 million aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest as of the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases, will receive, on
the Plan Effective Date, 90% of the common equity interests of New HoldCo as of the Plan Effective Date, subject to dilution by a
management incentive plan.
Under the Plan, holders of ARP’s limited partnership units will receive no recovery. On the Plan Effective Date, all of ARP’s preferred
limited partnership units and common limited partnership units will be cancelled without the receipt of any consideration.
ARP intends to continue to operate its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, all suppliers, vendors,
employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired by the Plan and will be satisfied in full in the ordinary course
of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, ARP obtained
interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking authority to use cash collateral
on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations
and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
Under the Plan, on the Plan Effective Date, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“ARP Mgt LLC”) will receive a preferred share of
New HoldCo. The preferred share will entitle ARP Mgt LLC to receive 2% of the economics of New HoldCo (subject to dilution if catch-up
contributions are not made with respect to future equity issuances, other than pursuant to the management incentive plan) and certain
other rights as provided for in the Restructuring Support Agreement. Four of the seven initial members of the board of directors of New
HoldCo are representatives of ARP Mgt LLC (the “New HoldCo Class A Directors”). For so long as ARP Mgt LLC holds such preferred
share, the New HoldCo Class A Directors will be appointed by a majority of ARP’s Class A Directors then in office. New HoldCo will
have a continuing right to purchase the preferred share at fair market value (as determined pursuant to the methodology provided for in
New HoldCo's limited liability company agreement), subject to the receipt of certain approvals, including the holders of at least 67% of the
outstanding common shares of New HoldCo unaffiliated with ARP Mgt LLC voting in favor of the exercise of the right to purchase the
preferred share.

and all necessary actions in furtherance of the Restructuring, the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan; (iv) make commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any and all required regulatory and/or third-party approvals for the Restructuring; and (v) operate the business
in the ordinary course, taking into account the Restructuring.
The Restructuring Support Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, including the failure to meet specified
milestones related to filing, confirmation and consummation of the Plan, among other requirements, and in the event of certain breaches
by the parties under the Restructuring Support Agreement. There can be no assurance that the restructuring transactions will be
consummated.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $18.7 million and $29.0 million, respectively, of non-cash property,
plant and equipment additions, within the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our condensed combined consolidated
statements of cash flows.
ARP capitalizes interest on borrowed funds related to capital projects only for periods that activities are in progress to bring these projects
to their intended use. The weighted average interest rates used to capitalize interest on combined borrowed funds by ARP was 6.6% for
both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  The weighted average interest rates used to capitalize interest on combined
borrowed funds by ARP were 6.7% and 6.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amounts of interest
capitalized by ARP were $2.4 million and $4.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amounts of
interest capitalized by ARP were $4.8 million and $8.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of accretion expense
related to ARP and AGP’s asset retirement obligations within depreciation, depletion and amortization in our condensed combined
consolidated statements of operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $3.3 million and $3.2 million,
respectively, of accretion expense related to ARP and AGP’s asset retirement obligations within depreciation, depletion and amortization
in our condensed combined consolidated statements of operations.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, ARP recorded
liabilities of $9.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in asset retirement obligations in our condensed consolidated balance sheet due
to the liquidation of some of ARP’s Drilling Partnerships.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, ARP recorded liabilities of
$12.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in asset retirement obligations in our condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the
liquidation of some of ARP’s Drilling Partnerships.

In April 2015, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs. The updated
accounting guidance requires that debt issuance costs be presented as a direct deduction from the associated debt obligation. We
adopted this accounting guidance upon its effective date of January 1, 2016. The retrospective effect of the reclassification resulted in the
following changes:

June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Term Loan Facilities
First Lien Credit Facility. On March 30, 2016, we, together with New Atlas Holdings, LLC (the “Borrower”) and Atlas Lightfoot, LLC,
entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to our credit agreement with Riverstone Credit Partners, L.P., as administrative
agent (“Riverstone”), and the lenders (the “Lenders”) from time to time party thereto (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”).
The outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement were bifurcated between the existing First Lien Credit Agreement and the
new Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below), with $35.0 million and $35.8 million (including $2.4 million in deemed prepayment
premium) in borrowings outstanding, respectively. In connection with the execution of the Third Amendment, the Borrower made a
prepayment of approximately $4.25 million of the outstanding principal, which was classified as current portion of long-term debt on our
condensed combined consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, and $0.5 million of interest. The Third Amendment amended
the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things:
·provide the ability for us and the Borrower to enter into the new Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below);
 ·shorten the maturity date of the First Lien Credit Agreement to September 30, 2017, subject to an optional extension to September 30,
2018 by the Borrower, assuming certain conditions are met, including a First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit
Agreement) of not more than 6:00 to 1:00 and a 5% extension fee;
 ·modify the applicable cash interest rate margin for ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans to 0.50% and 1.50%, respectively, and add a pay-
in-kind interest payment of 11% of the principal balance per annum;
20
·allow the Borrower to make mandatory pre-payments under the First Lien Credit Agreement or the new Second Lien Credit Agreement,
in its discretion, and add additional mandatory pre-payment events, including a monthly cash sweep for balances in excess of $4
million; 
 ·provide that the First Lien Credit Agreement may be prepaid without premium;
 ·replace the existing financial covenants with (i) the requirement that we maintain a minimum of $2 million in EBITDA on a trailing twelve-
month basis, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2016, and (ii) the incorporation into the First Lien Credit Agreement of the
financial covenants included in ARP’s credit agreement, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2016;
 ·prohibit the payment of cash distributions on our common and preferred units;
 ·require the receipt of quarterly distributions from AGP and Lightfoot; and
 ·add a cross-default provision for defaults by ARP.
Second Lien Credit Agreement. Also on March 30, 2016, we and the Borrower entered into a new second lien credit agreement (the
“Second Lien Credit Agreement”) with Riverstone and the Lenders. As described above, $35.8 million of the indebtedness previously
outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was moved under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Credit
Agreement is presented in the table above net of an unamortized discount of $1.9 million as of June 30, 2016, related to the 4,668,044
warrants issued in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement (see Note 10).
The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on March 30, 2019, subject to an optional extension (the “Extension Option”) to March 30,
2020, assuming certain conditions are met, including a Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) of not
more than 6:00 to 1:00 and a 5% extension fee. Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured on a second priority
basis by security interests in the same collateral that secures borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of 30%, payable in-kind through an increase in the
outstanding principal. If the First Lien Credit Agreement is repaid in full prior to March 30, 2018, the rate will be reduced to 20%. If the
Extension Option is exercised, the rate will again be increased to 30%. If our market capitalization is greater than $75 million, we can
issue common units in lieu of increasing the principal to satisfy the interest obligation.
The Borrower may prepay the borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement without premium at any time. The Second Lien Credit
Agreement includes the same mandatory prepayment events as the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to the Borrower’s discretion to
prepay either the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement.
The Second Lien Credit Agreement contains the same negative and affirmative covenants and events of default as the First Lien Credit
Agreement, including customary covenants that limit the Borrower’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or
investments, make distributions if a default exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other persons, enter
into swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts, or engage in certain asset dispositions. In
addition, the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires that we maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Lien Credit
Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and each fiscal quarter ending thereafter.
As a result of the cross-default, on July 11, 2016, we entered into waiver agreements (the “Waivers”) with Riverstone and the Lenders in
connection with the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waivers, Riverstone and the
Lenders agreed to waive under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement:
·the cross-defaults relating to ARP’s default, for so long as the forbearing parties continue to forbear from exercising their rights and
remedies; and
·the potential default relating to ARP’s ongoing negotiations with its lenders and noteholders to the extent any resulting restructuring is
completed prior to October 31, 2016
21
We and ARP’s future debt maturities, excluding any future payment-in-kind interest payments, are as follows: $1,580.5 million, $35.0
million and $35.8 million, respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively.
In connection with the Term Loan Facilities, the lenders thereunder syndicated participations in loans underlying the facilities. As a result,
certain of the Company’s current and former officers participated in approximately 12% of the loan syndication and warrants and a
foundation affiliated with a 5% or more unitholder participated in approximately 12% of the loan syndication.
ARP First Lien Credit Facility
ARP is party to a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2013 by and among ARP, the lenders from time
to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended, supplemented or modified from
time to time (the “ARP First Lien Credit Facility”), which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing
base of $1.5 billion scheduled to mature in July 2018.
On June 8, 2016, ARP received notice from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility that its borrowing base had been redetermined in accordance with the ARP First Lien Credit Facility and reduced from
$700.0 million to $530.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, $669.5 million in borrowings were outstanding (which includes $4.2 million in
letters of credit) under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility, resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of $143.7 million. The ARP First Lien
Credit Facility provides that within 30 days after ARP’s receipt of a notification of a borrowing base deficiency, ARP must elect to cure the
borrowing base deficiency through any combination of the following actions: (i) repay amounts outstanding under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency, either within 30 days after receipt of the borrowing base deficiency notice
or in four equal monthly installments beginning on July 11, 2016; or (ii) pledge as collateral additional oil and gas properties acceptable
to the administrative agent and lenders sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency within 60 days after receipt of the borrowing base
deficiency notice. As part of the discussions with ARP’s lenders and noteholders (see Notes 1 and 3), ARP determined not to make the
first installment payment that was due on July 11, 2016.
In connection therewith and in support of negotiations with ARP’s First Lien Lenders, Second Lien Lenders, and Consenting
Noteholders, on July 11, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries entered into two forbearance agreements: (i) with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility (the “ARP First Lien Credit
Forbearance”) and (ii) with the Consenting Noteholders of the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes (the “ARP
Notes Forbearance”).
Pursuant to the ARP First Lien Credit Forbearance, the administrative agent and the lenders representing approximately 81% of the
outstanding indebtedness under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies arising from
non-payment of the first installment of the borrowing base deficiency cure due on July 11, 2016 and related cross-defaults (the “ARP
Specified Default”) until the earliest to occur of (i) July 27, 2016, (ii) the occurrence of an event of default under the ARP First Lien Credit
Facility (unrelated to the ARP Specified Default) or (iii) the exercise by any holder of indebtedness outstanding under the ARP Second
Lien Term Loan, the ARP Notes or any other material indebtedness of ours of rights or remedies against us or the other loan parties or
their respective property.
Pursuant to the ARP Notes Forbearance, the holders of approximately 78% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 7.75%
ARP Senior Notes and approximately 82% of the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies
arising from the cross-default that resulted from the ARP Specified Default until the earliest to occur of (i) July 27, 2016, (ii) another event
of default under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes indenture or the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes indenture or (iii) any other holder of the ARP
Notes commences a legal proceeding against us or the other loan parties or their respective property. The holders of a majority of the
Second Lien Term Loan were supportive of the forbearance.
ARP’s borrowing base is scheduled for semi-annual redeterminations in May and November of each year. Up to $20.0 million of the ARP
First Lien Credit Facility may be in the form of standby letters of credit, of which $4.2 million was outstanding at June 30, 2016. ARP’s
obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility are secured by mortgages on ARP’s oil and gas properties and first priority security
interests in substantially all of ARP’s assets. Additionally, obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain
of ARP’s material subsidiaries, and any non-guarantor subsidiaries of ARP are minor. At June 30, 2016, the weighted average interest
rate on outstanding borrowings under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility was 4.0%.
22
The ARP First Lien Credit Facility contains customary covenants including, without limitation, covenants that limit ARP’s ability to incur
additional indebtedness (but which permits second lien debt in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300.0 million and third lien debt
that satisfies certain conditions including pro forma financial covenants), grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a
borrowing base deficiency or default exists or would result from the distribution, merge or consolidate with other persons, or engage in
certain asset dispositions including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.  The ARP First Lien Credit Facility also requires that ARP
maintain a ratio of First Lien Debt to EBITDA (ratio as defined in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility) of not greater than 2.75 to 1.00, and a
ratio of current assets to current liabilities (ratio as defined in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day
of any fiscal quarter. ARP was not in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility and
as a result, we classified $669.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as current portion of long-
term debt and $12.2 million of deferred financing costs related to the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as current assets within our
condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.Any efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as
a result of the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
Pursuant to the ARP Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP completed the sale of substantially all of its commodity hedge positions on
July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 and used the proceeds to repay $233.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility. Accordingly, approximately $440 million remained outstanding under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as of July 27,
2016, the date of ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings.
On the Plan Effective Date, ARP expect to enter into the new ARP First Lien Exit Facility, which will replace the ARP First Lien Credit
Facility (see Note 3).
ARP Second Lien Term Loan
ARP is party to a Second Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of February 23, 2015 by and among ARP, the lenders from time to time party
thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time
(the “ARP Second Lien Term Loan”), which provides for a second lien term loan in an original principal amount of $250.0 million. The
ARP Second Lien Term Loan matures on February 23, 2020. The Second Lien Term Loan is presented in the table above net of
unamortized discount of $5.5 million as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s obligations under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan are secured on a second priority basis by security interests in all of ARP’s
assets and those of its restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the ARP First Lien Credit Facility. In addition, the obligations under the ARP
Second Lien Term Loan are guaranteed by ARP’s material restricted subsidiaries. At June 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate
on outstanding borrowings under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan was 10.0%.
The ARP Second Lien Term Loan contains customary covenants including, without limitation, covenants that limit ARP’s ability to make
restricted payments, take on indebtedness, issue preferred units, grant liens, conduct sales of assets and subsidiary stock, make
distributions from restricted subsidiaries, conduct affiliate transactions and engage in other business activities. In addition, the ARP
Second Lien Term Loan contains covenants substantially similar to those in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility, including, among others,
restrictions on swap agreements, debt of unrestricted subsidiaries, drilling and operating agreements and the sale or discount of
receivables. ARP was not in compliance with the financial covenants as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan and
as a result, we classified $244.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan, which is net of $5.5
million unamortized discount and $9.4 million deferred financing costs, as current portion of long-term debt within our condensed
combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.  Any efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as a result of
the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
On the Plan Effective Date, ARP expects to enter into the new ARP Second Lien Exit Facility, which will replace the ARP Second Lien
Term Loan (see Note 3).
ARP Senior Notes
At June 30, 2016, ARP had $354.4 million outstanding of its 7.75% ARP Senior Notes due 2021. The 7.75% ARP Senior Notes were
presented net of a $0.3 million unamortized discount as of June 30, 2016.
23
At June 30, 2016, ARP had $312.1 million outstanding of its 9.25% ARP Senior Notes due 2021. The 9.25% ARP Senior Notes were
presented net of a $0.8 million unamortized discount as of June 30, 2016.
In January and February 2016, ARP executed transactions to repurchase $20.3 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes and $12.1 million of its
9.25% Senior Notes for $5.5 million, which included $0.6 million of interest. As a result of these transactions, we recognized $26.5 million
as gain on early extinguishment of debt, net of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.9 million, in our condensed
combined consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of ARP’s material subsidiaries. The guarantees
under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, subject to certain
customary automatic release provisions, including, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of, or all of the equity interests in, the subsidiary guarantor, or the subsidiary guarantor is declared “unrestricted” for covenant
purposes, and any subsidiaries of ARP, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. There are no restrictions on ARP’s ability to
obtain cash or any other distributions of funds from the guarantor subsidiaries.
The indentures governing the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes contain covenants including, without limitation,
covenants that limit ARP’s ability to incur certain liens, incur additional indebtedness; declare or pay distributions if an event of default
has occurred; redeem, repurchase, or retire equity interests or subordinated indebtedness; make certain investments; or merge,
consolidate or sell substantially all of ARP’s assets. ARP was in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2016.
On June 6, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as resigning trustee (“Wells Fargo”) and
U.S. Bank National Association, as successor trustee (“U.S. Bank”), entered into an Instrument of Resignation, Appointment and
Acceptance (the “Instrument”). In connection with the Instrument, Wells Fargo resigned as trustee, note custodian, registrar and paying
agent under the Indenture dated as of July 30, 2013, as supplemented and amended and ARP accepted such resignation and appointed
U.S. Bank as the successor trustee, note custodian, registrar and paying agent under the such indenture.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and the
9.25% ARP Senior Notes and as a result, we classified $354.4 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the 7.75% ARP Senior
Notes, which is net of $0.3 million unamortized discount and $9.5 million deferred financing costs, and $312.1 million of ARP’s
outstanding amounts under the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes, which is net of $0.8 million unamortized discount and $8.3 million deferred
financing costs, as current portion of long-term debt within our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Any efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement
are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
On the Plan Effective Date, the 7.75% Senior Notes and the 9.25% Senior Notes (together with accrued but unpaid interest) will be
cancelled and the holders will receive 90% of the common equity interests of New HoldCo (see Note 3).
NOTE 6—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
ARP and AGP use a number of different derivative instruments, principally swaps and options, in connection with their commodity price
risk management activities.  ARP and AGP do not apply hedge accounting to any of their derivative instruments. As a result, gains and
losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.
ARP and AGP enter into commodity future option contracts to achieve more predictable cash flows by hedging their exposure to changes
in commodity prices. At any point in time, such contracts may include regulated New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures and
options contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified counterparties. NYMEX contracts are generally
settled with offsetting positions, but may be settled by the physical delivery of the commodity. Crude oil contracts are based on a West
Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) index. Natural gas liquids fixed price swaps are priced based on a WTI crude oil index, while ethane,
propane, butane and iso butane contracts are based on the respective Mt. Belvieu price.  These contracts were recorded at their fair
values.
We recorded net derivative assets on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheets of $234.6 million and $358.1 million at June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of the $2.3 million of net gain in accumulated other comprehensive income within
unitholders’ equity on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet related to derivatives at June 30, 2016, we expect to
reclassify $1.5 million of gains to our condensed combined consolidated statement of operations over the next twelve-month period as
these contracts expire. Aggregate gains of $0.8 million of gas and oil
24
production revenues will be reclassified to our condensed combined consolidated statements of operations in later periods as the
remaining contracts expire.
Pursuant to the ARP Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP completed the sale of certain of substantially all of its commodity hedge
positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 and used the proceeds to repay $233.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ARP
First Lien Credit Facility.
The following table summarizes the commodity derivative activity and presentation in our condensed combined consolidated statement of
operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we received approximately $4.9 million in net proceeds from the early termination
of our remaining natural gas and oil derivative positions for production periods from 2015 through 2018. The net proceeds from the early
termination of these derivatives were used to reduce indebtedness under our Term Loan Facilities.

On May 1, 2015, AGP entered into a secured credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks. As of June 30, 2016, the lenders under
the credit facility have no commitment to lend to AGP under the credit facility, but AGP and its subsidiaries have the ability to enter into
derivative contracts to manage their exposure to commodity price movements which will benefit from the collateral securing the credit
facility. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by mortgages on AGP’s oil and gas properties and first priority security interests in
substantially all of its assets. The credit facility may be amended in the future if AGP and the lenders agree to increase the borrowing
base and the lenders’ commitments thereunder. The secured credit facility agreement contains covenants that limit AGP and its
subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions, merge into or consolidate with other
persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts,
or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. AGP was in compliance with these
covenants as of June 30, 2016. In addition, AGP’s credit facility includes customary events of default, including failure to timely pay,
breach of covenants, bankruptcy, cross-default with other material indebtedness (including obligations under swap agreements in excess
of any agreed upon threshold amount), and change of control provisions.

Secured Hedge Facility
At June 30, 2016, ARP had a secured hedge facility agreement with a syndicate of banks under which certain Drilling Partnerships have
the ability to enter into derivative contracts to manage their exposure to commodity price movements. Under ARP’s revolving credit
facility, ARP is required to utilize this secured hedge facility for future commodity risk management activity for its equity production
volumes within the participating Drilling Partnerships. ARP, as general partner
27
of the Drilling Partnerships, administers the commodity price risk management activity for the Drilling Partnerships under the secured
hedge facility and guarantees their obligations under it. Before executing any hedge transaction, a participating Drilling Partnership is
required to, among other things, provide mortgages on its oil and gas properties and first priority security interests in substantially all of its
assets to the collateral agent for the benefit of the counterparties. The secured hedge facility agreement contains covenants that limit
each of the participating Drilling Partnership’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a
default under the secured hedge facility agreement exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other
persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts,
or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.
An event of default occurred under the secured hedging facility agreement upon ARP’s filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter
11.  The lenders under the secured hedge facility agreed to forbear from exercising remedies in respect of such event of default while the
Chapter 11 Filings are pending and, upon occurrence of the effective date of the Plan contemplated by ARP’s Restructuring Support
Agreement, such event of default will no longer be deemed to exist or to continue under the secured hedge facility.
In addition, it will be an event of default under ARP’s revolving credit facility if ARP, as general partner of the Drilling Partnerships,
breaches an obligation governed by the secured hedge facility and the effect of such breach is to cause amounts owing under swap
agreements governed by the secured hedge facility to become immediately due and payable.
NOTE 7—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We and our subsidiaries use a market approach fair value methodology to value our financial instruments. The fair value of a financial
instrument depends on a number of factors, including the availability of observable market data over the contractual term of the underlying
instrument. We and our subsidiaries separate the fair value of our financial instruments into the three level hierarchy (Levels 1, 2 and 3)
based on our/their assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to
determine fair value. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all derivative financial instruments were classified as Level 2.
Information for our and our subsidiaries’ financial instruments measured at fair value at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as

Other Financial Instruments
We and our subsidiaries’ other current assets and liabilities on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheets are considered to
be financial instruments. The estimated fair values of these instruments approximate their carrying amounts due to their short-term nature
and thus are categorized as Level 1. The estimated fair values of our and ARP’s debt at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which
consist of borrowings under our term loan facilities, ARP’s senior notes and borrowings under ARP’s term loan and revolving credit
facility, were $1,020.7 million and $929.2 million, respectively, compared with the carrying amounts of $1,661.6 million and $1,614.7
million, respectively. The carrying values of outstanding borrowings under the ARP revolving credit facility, which bear interest at variable
interest rates, approximated their estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of the ARP senior notes and term loan facility were
based upon the market approach and calculated using the yields of the ARP senior notes and term loan facility as provided by financial
institutions and thus were categorized as Level 3 values.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Management estimated the fair values of ARP’s natural gas and oil properties transferred to ARP upon liquidations of certain Drilling
Partnerships (see Note 8) based on discounted cash flow model, which considered the estimated remaining lives of the wells based on
reserve estimates, ARP’s future operating and development costs of the assets, the respective natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids
forward price curves, and estimated salvage values using ARP’s historical experience and external estimates of recovery values. These
estimates of fair value are Level 3 measurements as they are based on unobservable inputs.
Management estimated the fair value of asset retirement obligations transferred to ARP upon liquidations of certain Drilling Partnerships
(see Note 4) based on discounted cash flow projections using ARP’s historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, the
estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates, external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in
the future considering inflation rates, federal and state regulatory requirements, and ARP’s assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.
These estimates of fair value are Level 3 measurements as they are based on unobservable inputs.
Management estimated the fair value of the Warrants associated the Second Lien Credit Agreement (see Note 10) using a Black-Scholes
pricing model which is based on Level 3 inputs including a unit price on the date of issuance of $0.50, exercise price of $0.20, risk free
rate of 1.8%, a term of 10 years, and estimated volatility rate of 57%. The volatility rate used is consistent with that of ARP and similar
sized entities within the industry. The estimated fair value per warrant was $0.40.
NOTE 8—CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Relationship with ARP. ARP does not directly employ any persons to manage or operate its business. These functions are provided by
employees of us and/or our affiliates.
Relationship with AGP. AGP does not directly employ any persons to manage or operate its business. These functions are provided by
employees of us and/or our affiliates. Atlas Growth Partners, GP, LLC (“AGP GP”) receives an annual management fee in connection with
its management of AGP equivalent to 1% of capital contributions per annum. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
AGP paid approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million related to AGP GP for this management fee. During the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, AGP paid approximately $1.1 million and $0.6 million related to AGP GP for this management fee. We charge direct
costs, such as salary and wages, and allocate indirect costs, such as rent for offices, to AGP by us based on the number of its employees
who devoted substantially all of their time to activities on its behalf. AGP reimburses us at cost for direct costs incurred on its behalf. AGP
will reimburse all necessary and reasonable costs allocated by the general partner. AGP was required to pay AGP GP an amount equal
to any actual, out-of-pocket expenses related to its private placement offering and the formation and financing of AGP, including legal
costs incurred by AGP GP, which payments were approximately 2% of the gross proceeds of its private placement offering.
Relationship with Drilling Partnerships. ARP conducts certain activities through, and a portion of its revenues are attributable to,
sponsorship of the Drilling Partnerships. ARP serves as the ultimate general partner and operator of the Drilling Partnerships and
assumes customary rights and obligations for the Drilling Partnerships. As the ultimate general partner, ARP is liable for the Drilling
Partnerships’ liabilities and can be liable to limited partners of the Drilling Partnerships if it breaches its responsibilities with respect to the
operations of the Drilling Partnerships. ARP is entitled to receive management fees, reimbursement for administrative costs incurred, and
to share in the Drilling Partnership’s revenue and costs and expenses according to the respective partnership agreements.
29
In March 2016, ARP transferred $36.7 million of investor capital raised and $13.3 million of accrued well drilling and completion costs
incurred by ARP to the Atlas Eagle Ford 2015 L.P. private drilling partnership for activities directly related to their program. In June 2016,
ARP transferred $5.2 million of funds to certain of the Drilling Partnerships that were projected to make monthly or quarterly distributions
to their limited partners over the next several months and/or quarter to ensure accessible distribution funding coverage in accordance with
the respective Drilling Partnerships’ operations and partnership agreements in the event ARP experiences a prolonged restructuring
period as ARP performs all administrative and management functions for the Drilling Partnerships. On July 26, 2016, ARP adopted
certain amendments to the Drilling Partnerships’ partnership agreements, in accordance with ARP’s ability to amend the Drilling
Partnerships’ partnership agreements to cure an ambiguity in or correct or supplement any provision of the Drilling Partnerships’
partnership agreements as may be inconsistent with any other provision, to provide that bankruptcy and insolvency events, such as the
Chapter 11 Filings, with respect to the managing general partner will not cause the managing general partner to cease to serve as the
managing general partner of the Drilling Partnerships nor cause the termination of the Drilling Partnerships.
ARP intends to continue to fund the Drilling Partnerships’ operations and obligations, as necessary, until they are liquidated. Depending
on commodity pricing and each of the Drilling Partnerships’ reserves value, ARP expects to realize all outstanding receivables from the
Drilling Partnerships’ through the receipt of cash flows from their operations and/or the transfer of net assets and liabilities to ARP upon
their liquidation. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, ARP recorded $7.2 million and $12.4 million of gas and oil properties and asset
retirement obligations, respectively, transferred to ARP as a result of certain Drilling Partnership liquidations. The gas and oil properties
and asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair values on the respective dates of the Drilling Partnerships’ liquidation and
transfer to ARP (see Note 7) and resulted in a non-cash loss of $6.2 million, net of liquidation and transfer adjustments, for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, which was recorded in other income/(loss) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, ARP had trade receivables of $8.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively, from certain of the
Drilling Partnerships, which were recorded in accounts receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  As of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, ARP had trade payables of $1.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to certain of the Drilling Partnerships,
which were recorded in accounts payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Other Relationships.  We have other related party transactions with regard to our Term Loan Facilities (see Note 5), our Series A
preferred units (Note 10) and our general partner and limited partner interest in Lightfoot (see Note 1).
NOTE 9—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
ARP is the ultimate managing general partner of the Drilling Partnerships and has agreed to indemnify each investor partner from any
liability that exceeds such partner’s share of Drilling Partnership assets. ARP has structured certain Drilling Partnerships to allow limited
partners to have the right to present their interests for purchase. Generally, for Drilling Partnerships with this structure, ARP is not
obligated to purchase more than 5% to 10% of the units in any calendar year, no units may be purchased during the first five years after
closing for the Drilling Partnership, and ARP may immediately suspend the presentment structure for a Drilling Partnership by giving
notice to the limited partners that it does not have adequate liquidity for redemptions. In accordance with the Drilling Partnership
agreement, the purchase price for limited partner interests would generally be based upon a percentage of the present value of future
cash flows allocable to the interest, discounted at 10%, as of the date of presentment, subject to estimated changes by ARP to reflect
current well performance, commodity prices and production costs, among other items. Based on its historical experience, as of June 30,
2016, the management of ARP believes that any such estimated liability for redemptions of limited partner interests in Drilling
Partnerships which allow such transactions would not be material.
While its historical structure has varied, ARP has generally agreed to subordinate a portion of its share of Drilling Partnership gas and oil
production revenue, net of corresponding production costs and up to a maximum of 50% of unhedged revenue, from certain Drilling
Partnerships for the benefit of the limited partner investors until they have received specified returns, typically 10% to 12% per year
determined on a cumulative basis, over a specified period, typically the first five to eight years, in accordance with the terms of the
partnership agreements. ARP periodically compares the projected return on investment for limited partners in a Drilling Partnership
during the subordination period, based upon historical and projected cumulative gas and oil production revenue and expenses, with the
return on investment subject to subordination agreed upon within the Drilling Partnership agreement. If the projected return on investment
falls below the agreed upon rate, ARP recognizes subordination as an estimated reduction of its pro-rata share of gas and oil production
revenue, net of corresponding production costs, during the current period in an amount that will achieve the agreed upon investment
return, subject to the limitation of 50% of unhedged cumulative net production revenues over the subordination period. For Drilling
Partnerships for which ARP has recognized subordination in a historical period, if projected investment returns subsequently
30
reflect that the agreed upon limited partner investment return will be achieved during the subordination period, ARP will recognize an
estimated increase in its portion of historical cumulative gas and oil net production, subject to a limitation of the cumulative subordination
previously recognized. For both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, $0.5 million of ARP’s gas and oil production revenues,
net of corresponding production costs, from certain Drilling Partnerships were subordinated, which reduced gas and oil production
revenues and expenses.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of ARP’s gas
and oil production revenues, net of corresponding production costs, from certain Drilling Partnerships were subordinated, which reduced
gas and oil production revenues and expenses.
As of June 30, 2016, we and our subsidiaries are committed to expend approximately $4.6 million on drilling and completion
expenditures.
Legal Proceedings
We and our subsidiaries are parties to various routine legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Our and our
subsidiaries’ management believe that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition or results of operations.
NOTE 10—ISSUANCES OF UNITS
We recognize gains or losses on ARP’s and AGP’s equity transactions as credits or debits, respectively, to unitholders’ equity on our
condensed combined consolidated balance sheets rather than as income or loss on our condensed combined consolidated statements of
operations. These gains or losses represent our portion of the excess or the shortage of the net offering price per unit of each of ARP’s
and AGP’s common units as compared to the book carrying amount per unit.
In connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement, on April 27, 2016, we issued to the Lenders, warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase
up to 4,668,044 common units representing limited partner interests at an exercise price of $0.20 per unit. The Warrants expire on March
30, 2026 and are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. On April 27, 2016, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant
to which we agreed to register the offer and resale of our common units underlying the Warrants as well as any common units issued as
in-kind interest payments under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Warrants include a cashless exercise provision entitling the
Lenders to surrender a portion of the underlying common units that has a value equal to the aggregate exercise price in lieu of paying
cash upon exercise of a warrant. As a result of issuance of the Warrants, we recognized a $1.9 million debt discount on the Second Lien
Credit Agreement, which will be amortized over the term of the debt, and a corresponding $1.9 million increase to unitholders’ equity –
warrants on our condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
On February 27, 2015 we issued and sold an aggregate of 1.6 million of our newly created Series A convertible preferred units, with a
liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit (the “Series A Preferred Units”), at a purchase price of $25.00 per unit to certain members of our
management, two management members of the Board, and outside investors. Holders of the Series A Preferred Units are entitled to
monthly distributions of cash at a rate equal to the greater of (i) 10% of the liquidation preference per annum, increasing to 12% per
annum, 14% per annum and 16% per annum on the first, second and third anniversaries of the of the private placement, respectively or
(ii) the monthly equivalent of any cash distribution declared by us to holders of our common units, as well as Series A Preferred Units at a
rate equal to 2% of the liquidation preference per annum. All or a portion of the Series A Preferred Units will be convertible into our units
at the option of the holder at any time following the later of (i) the one-year anniversary of the distribution and (ii) receipt of unitholder
approval. The conversion price will be equal to the greater of (i) $8.00 per common unit; and (ii) the lower of (a) 110.0% of the volume
weighted average price for our common units over the 30 trading days following the distribution date; and (b) $16.00 per common unit.
We sold the Series A Preferred Units in a private transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The
Series A Preferred Units resulted in proceeds to us of $40.0 million. We used the proceeds to fund a portion of the $150.0 million payment
by us to Atlas Energy related to the repayment of Atlas Energy’s term loan (see Note 2). The Series A Purchase Agreement contains
customary terms for private placements, including representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities.
On August 26, 2015, at a special meeting of our unitholders, the unitholders approved changes to the terms of the Series A Preferred
Units to provide that each Series A Preferred Unit will be convertible into common units at the option of the holder.
On January 7, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that we were not in compliance with NYSE’s continued listing criteria under
Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our common units had been less than $1.00
for 30 consecutive trading days.  We also were notified by the NYSE on December 23, 2015, that we were not in compliance with the
NYSE’s continued listing criteria under Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company
31
Manual because our average market capitalization had been less than $50 million for 30 consecutive trading days and our stockholders’
equity had been less than $50 million. On March 18, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that it determined to commence proceedings to
delist our common units from the NYSE as a result of our failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B
of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at
least $15 million. The NYSE also suspended the trading of our common units at the close of trading on March 18, 2016. Our common
units began trading on the OTCQX on Monday, March 21, 2016 under the ticker symbol: ATLS.
On May 12, 2016, due to the income tax ramifications of potential options we were considering, the Board of Directors delayed the vesting
of approximately 911,900 units granted, under our long-term incentive plan, to employees, directors and officers, until March 2017. The
phantom units were set to vest between June 8, 2016 and September 1, 2016. The delayed vesting schedule did not have a significant
impact on the compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or our remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to such
awards.

ARP has an equity distribution agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representative of the several banks named therein (the
“Agents”). Pursuant to the equity distribution agreement, ARP may sell from time to time through the Agents common units representing
limited partner interests of ARP having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. Sales of common units, if any, may be made in
negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market” offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act,
including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, the existing trading market for the common units, or sales made to or
through a market maker other than on an exchange or through an electronic communications network. ARP will pay each of the Agents a
commission, which in each case shall not be more than 2.0% of the gross sales price of common units sold through such Agent. Under
the terms of the equity distribution agreement, ARP may also sell common units from time to time to any Agent as principal for its own
account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of common units to an Agent as principal would be pursuant to the
terms of a separate agreement between ARP and such Agent. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, ARP did not issue any
common limited partner units under the equity distribution program. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, ARP issued 2,403,288
common limited partner units under the equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $17.5 million, net of $0.5 million in commissions
and offering expenses paid.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP issued 245,175 common limited partner units under the
equity distribution program for net proceeds of $0.2 million, net of $4,000 in commissions and offering expenses paid. During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, ARP issued 2,885,824 common limited partner units under the equity distribution agreement for net
proceeds of $21.4 million, net of $0.6 million in commissions and offering expenses paid.
In August 2015, ARP entered into a distribution agreement with MLV & Co. LLC (“MLV”) which ARP terminated and replaced in
November 2015, when ARP entered into a distribution agreement with MLV and FBR Capital Markets & Co. pursuant to which ARP may
sell its 8.625% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class D ARP Preferred Units”) and 10.75% Class E
Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class E ARP Preferred Units”). ARP did not issue any Class D Preferred Units nor
Class E Preferred Units under the August 2015 and November 2015 preferred equity distribution programs for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
In May 2015, in connection with the Arkoma Acquisition, ARP issued 6,500,000 of its common limited partner units in a public offering at
a price of $7.97 per unit, yielding net proceeds of $49.7 million. ARP used a portion of the net proceeds to fund the Arkoma Acquisition
and to reduce borrowings outstanding under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility.
In April 2015, ARP issued 255,000 of its 10.75% Class E ARP Preferred Units at a public offering price of $25.00 per unit for net proceeds
of $6.0 million.
On March 31, 2015, to partially pay its portion of the quarterly installment related to the Eagle Ford acquisition, ARP issued an additional
800,000 Class D ARP Preferred Units to the seller at a value of $25.00 per unit.
On May 12, 2016, due to the income tax ramifications of the potential options ARP was considering, the Board of Directors delayed the
vesting date of approximately 110,000 units granted to employees, directors and officers until March 2017.  The phantom units were set to
vest between May 15, 2016 and August 31 ,2016. The delayed vesting schedule did not have a significant impact on ARP’s
compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or our remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to such awards.

On July 12, 2016, ARP received notification from the New York Stock Exchange that the NYSE commenced proceedings to delist ARP’s
common units as a result of ARP’s failure to comply with the continued listed standards set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual to maintain an average closing price of $1.00 per unit over a consecutive 30 day period. The Class D ARP Preferred
Units and Class E ARP Preferred Units were also delisted from the NYSE. ARP’s common units, Class D ARP Preferred Units, and
Class E ARP Preferred Units began trading on the OTC market on July 13, 2016 with the ticker symbol “ARPJ” for ARP’s common units,
“ARPJP” for Class D ARP Preferred Units, and “ARPJN” for Class E ARP Preferred Units.

On April 5, 2016, we announced that AGP’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Under the terms of AGP’s initial offering, AGP offered in a private placement $500.0 million of its common limited partner units. The
termination date of the private placement offering was December 31, 2014, subject to two 90 day extensions to the extent that it had not
sold $500.0 million of common units at any extension date. AGP exercised each of such extensions. Under the terms of the offering, an
investor received, for no additional consideration, warrants to purchase additional common units in an amount equal to 10% of the
common units purchased by such investor. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $10.00 per common unit being purchased and may
be exercised from and after the warrant date (generally, the date upon which AGP gives the holder notice of a liquidity event) until the
expiration date (generally, the date that is one day prior to the liquidity event or, if the liquidity event is a listing on a national securities
exchange, 30 days after the liquidity event occurs). Under the warrant, a liquidity event is defined as either (i) a listing of the common
units on a national securities exchange, (ii) a business combination with or into an existing publicly-traded entity, or (iii) a sale of all or
substantially all of AGP’s assets.
Through the completion of AGP’s private placement offering on June 30, 2015, AGP issued $233.0 million, or 23,300,410 of its common
limited partner units, in exchange for proceeds to AGP, net of dealer manager fees and commissions and expenses, of $203.4 million. We
purchased 500,010 common units for $5.0 million during the offering. In connection with the issuance of common limited partner units,
unitholders received 2,330,041 warrants to purchase AGP’s common units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
In connection with the issuance of ARP’s unit offerings during the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded gains of $0.2 million
within unitholders’ equity and a corresponding decrease in non-controlling interests on our condensed combined consolidated balance
sheet and condensed combined consolidated statement of unitholders’ equity. In connection with the issuance of ARP’s and AGP’s unit
offerings for the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded gains of $2.9 million within equity and a corresponding decrease in non-
controlling interests on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheets and condensed combined consolidated statement of
unitholders’ equity.
NOTE 11—CASH DISTRIBUTIONS
Our Cash Distributions. We have a cash distribution policy under which we distribute, within 50 days following the end of each calendar
quarter, all of our available cash (as defined in our limited liability company agreement) for that quarter to our unitholders. As a result of
the First Lien Credit Agreement and Second Lien Credit Agreement entered into on March 30, 2016 (see Note 5), we are prohibited from
paying future cash distributions on our common and preferred units.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we paid a distribution of $1.0 million to Class A preferred unitholders. During the six months
ended June 30, 2015, we paid a distribution of $0.7 million to Class A preferred unitholders.
ARP Cash Distributions. ARP has a monthly cash distribution program whereby ARP distributes all of its available cash (as defined in
the partnership agreement) for that month to its unitholders within 45 days from the month end. If ARP’s common unit distributions in any
quarter exceed specified target levels, we will receive between 13% and 48% of such distributions in excess of the specified target levels.
While outstanding, the Class B ARP Preferred Units received regular quarterly cash distributions equal to the greater of (i) $0.40 (or
$0.1333 per unit paid on a monthly basis) and (ii) the quarterly common unit distribution. In July 2015, the remaining 39,654 Class B
Preferred Units were converted into ARP common limited partner units.
The Class C ARP Preferred Units received regular quarterly cash distributions equal to the greater of (i) $0.51 (or $0.17 per unit paid on a
monthly basis) and (ii) the quarterly common unit distribution. On May 5, 2016, the Board of
33
Directors elected to suspend ARP’s common unit and Class C preferred distributions, beginning with the month of March of 2016, due to
the continued lower commodity price environment.
ARP pays quarterly distributions on its Class D ARP Preferred Units at an annual rate of $2.15625 per unit, $0.5390625 per unit paid on
a quarterly basis, or 8.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference. ARP pays quarterly distributions on its Class E ARP Preferred Units at
an annual rate of $2.6875 per unit, or $0.671875 per unit on a quarterly basis, or 10.75% of the $25.00 liquidation preference. On June
16, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to suspend the distributions on the Class D ARP Preferred Units and the Class E ARP Preferred
Units, beginning with the second quarter 2016 distribution, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.  The Class D ARP
Preferred Units and Class E ARP Preferred Units accrued distributions of $1.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively, from April 15, 2016
through June 30, 2016.  However, due to the distribution suspension and ARP’s recent Chapter 11 filings, these amounts were not
earned as the preferred units will be cancelled without receipt of any consideration on the Plan Effective Date.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP paid four monthly cash distributions totaling $5.1 million to common limited partners
($0.0125 per unit per month); $2.5 million to Preferred Class C limited partners ($0.0125 per unit per month); and $0.2 million to the
General Partner Class A holder ($0.0125 per unit per month). During the six months ended June 30, 2015, ARP paid six monthly cash
distributions totaling $71.2 million to common limited partners ($0.1966 per unit in both January and February 2015 and $0.1083 per unit
in March through June 2015); $4.0 million to Preferred Class C limited partners ($0.1966 per unit in both January and February 2015 and
$0.17 per unit in March through June 2015); and $3.6 million to the General Partner Class A holder ($0.1966 per unit in both January and
February 2015 and $0.1083 per unit in March through June 2015).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP paid two distributions totaling $4.4 million to Class D Preferred units ($0.5390625 per
unit) for the period October 15, 2016 through April 14, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, ARP paid two distributions
totaling $4.1 million to Class D Preferred units ($0.6169270 per unit for the period October 2, 2014 through January 14, 2015 and
$0.539063 per unit for the period January 15, 2015 through April 14, 2015).
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP paid two distributions totaling $0.3 million to Class E Preferred units ($0.671875 per
unit) for the period October 15, 2015 through April 14, 2016.  No distributions were paid to Class E Preferred units during the six months
ended June 30, 2015.
AGP Cash Distributions. AGP has a cash distribution policy under which it distributes to holders of common units and Class A units on a
quarterly basis a distribution of $0.175 per unit, or $0.70 per unit per year, to the extent AGP has sufficient available cash after
establishing appropriate reserves and paying fees and expenses, including reimbursements of expenses to the general partner and its
affiliates. Distributions are generally paid within 45 days of the end of the quarter to unitholders of record on the applicable record date.
Unitholders are entitled to receive distributions from AGP beginning with the quarter following the quarter in which AGP first admits them
as limited partners.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, AGP paid a distribution of $8.2 million to common limited partners ($0.1750 per unit per
quarter) and $0.2 million to the general partner’s Class A units ($0.1750 per unit per quarter). During the six months ended June 30, 2015,
AGP paid a distribution of $3.8 million to common limited partners ($0.1750 per unit per quarter) and $0.1 million to the general partner’s
Class A units ($0.1750 per unit per quarter).

ITEM 2:MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
We believe the assumptions underlying the condensed combined consolidated financial statements are reasonable. The historical
financial statements included in this Form 10-Q reflect substantially all the assets and liabilities transferred from our former owner, Atlas
Energy, on February 27, 2015. However, our historical condensed combined consolidated financial statements included herein may not
necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what they would have been had our
predecessor been a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Form 10-Q to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company,” when used in
a historical context or in the present tense, refer to the businesses and subsidiaries owned by Atlas Energy Group, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, and its combined subsidiaries or that Atlas Energy contributed to Atlas Energy Group, LLC in connection with
the separation and distribution on February 27, 2015 and refer to Atlas Energy Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its
combined subsidiaries. References to “Atlas Energy, L.P.” or “Atlas Energy” refer to Atlas Energy, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries,
unless the context otherwise requires. References to “Atlas Energy Group, LLC” prior to the separation refer to Atlas Energy Group, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company that is currently the general partner of ARP. References in this Form 10-Q to “ARP” or “Atlas
Resource Partners” refer to Atlas Resource Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and references to “AGP” or “Atlas Growth
Partners” refer to Atlas Growth Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We are a publicly traded (OTC: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011.
On February 27, 2015, our former owner, Atlas Energy, L.P. (“Atlas Energy”), transferred its assets and liabilities, other than those related
to its midstream assets, to us, and effected a pro rata distribution of our common units representing a 100% interest in us, to Atlas
Energy’s unitholders (the “Separation”). Concurrently with the distribution of our units, Atlas Energy and its remaining midstream interests
merged with Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”; NYSE: TRGP) and ceased trading.
At June 30, 2016, our operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:
·100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest
(consisting of 20,962,485 common and 3,749,986 preferred limited partner units) in ARP, a publicly traded Delaware master limited
partnership (“MLP”) (OTC: ARPJ) and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids (“NGL”),
with operations in basins across the United States. As part of its exploration and production activities, ARP sponsors and manages tax-
advantaged investment partnerships (“Drilling Partnerships”), in which it coinvests, to finance a portion of its natural gas and oil
production activities;
 ·All of the incentive distribution rights, an 80.0% general partner interest and a 2.1% limited partner interest in AGP, a Delaware limited
partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations primarily focused in the
Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. On June 30, 2015, AGP concluded a private placement offering, during which it issued $233.0 million
of its common limited partner units. Of the $233.0 million of gross funds raised, we purchased $5.0 million common limited partner units.
AGP’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 5, 2016. AGP is offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T common units,
each representing limited partner interests in AGP, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis. AGP must receive minimum
offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0
billion. The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T common units will be sold for a cash
purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders' deferred payment obligation to AGP.
AGP is also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution reinvestment; and
 ·15.4% general partner interest and 12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. (“Lightfoot L.P.”) and Lightfoot Capital
Partners GP, LLC (“Lightfoot G.P.”), its general partner (collectively, “Lightfoot”), which incubate new MLPs and invest in existing MLPs.

FINANCIAL PRESENTATION
Our condensed combined consolidated financial statements were derived from the accounts of Atlas Energy and its controlled
subsidiaries for the periods prior to February 27, 2015. Because a direct ownership relationship did not exist among all the various
entities consolidated in our condensed combined consolidated financial statements, Atlas Energy’s net investment in us is shown as
equity in the condensed combined consolidated financial statements. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed combined
consolidated balance sheets and related condensed combined consolidated statements of operations. Such estimates included
allocations made from the historical accounting records of Atlas Energy, based on management’s best estimates, in order to derive our
financial statements. Actual balances and results could be different from those estimates. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in the combination of the financial statements.
Our condensed combined consolidated financial statements contain our accounts and those of our combined consolidated subsidiaries,
all of which are wholly-owned at June 30, 2016, except for ARP and AGP, which we determined are variable interest entities (“VIE’s”)
based on their respective partnership agreements, our power, as the general partner, to direct activities that most significantly impact their
economic performance, and our ownership of the incentive distribution rights. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial statements of
ARP and AGP into our condensed combined consolidated financial statements. Our VIE’s operating results and assets balances are
presented separately in Note 12 – Operating Segment Information. As the general partner for both ARP and AGP, we have unlimited
liability for the obligations of ARP and AGP except for those contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the
general partner. The non-controlling interests in ARP and AGP are reflected as (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests in
the condensed combined consolidated statements of operations and as a component of unitholders’ equity on the condensed combined
consolidated balance sheets. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Throughout this section, when we refer to
“our” condensed combined consolidated financial statements, we are referring to the condensed combined consolidated results for us,
our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the consolidated results of ARP and AGP, adjusted for non-controlling interests in ARP and AGP.
Certain amounts in the prior year’s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified due to the adoption of certain accounting
standards (see Item 1: “Financial Statements (Unaudited)” - Note 2).
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
First Lien Credit Agreement
On March 30, 2016, we, together with New Atlas Holdings, LLC (the “Borrower”) and Atlas Lightfoot, LLC, entered into a third amendment
(the “Third Amendment”) to our credit agreement with Riverstone Credit Partners, L.P., as administrative agent (“Riverstone”), and the
lenders (the “Lenders”) from time to time party thereto (the “First Lien Credit Agreement”).  See “Credit Facilities – Term Loan Facilities”

Restructuring and Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the
38
“Bankruptcy Court,” and the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Filings”). See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for more
information.
Restructuring Support Agreement
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and us, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into the Restructuring
Support Agreement with the Restructuring Support Parties.  On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions
for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Restructuring Support Parties have
agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support ARP’s Restructuring pursuant to the Plan.
In particular, under the Plan, on the Plan’s effective date (the “Plan Effective Date”), the First Lien Lenders will receive cash payment of all
obligations owed to them by ARP pursuant to the senior secured revolving credit facility (other than $440 million of principal and face
amount of letters of credit) and become lenders under an exit facility credit agreement (the “First Lien Exit Facility”), composed of a $410
million conforming reserve-based tranche and a $30 million non-conforming tranche. The non-conforming tranche will mature on May 1,
2017 and the conforming reserve-based tranche will mature on August 23, 2019. In addition, ARP will enter into a new second lien credit
agreement (the “Second Lien Exit Facility” and, together with the First Lien Exit Facility, the “Exit Facilities”). The Second Lien Lenders
will receive a pro rata share of the Second Lien Exit Facility, which will have an aggregate principal amount of $250 million plus the
amounts resulting from the accrual of paid in kind interest on the principal amount of $250 million from the commencement of ARP’s
Chapter 11 Filings, with interest expense paid in cash to be reduced to 2% and the remainder to be paid-in-kind from the commencement
date through May 1, 2017 at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 9% per annum. During the next 15-month period, cash and in-kind
interest will vary based on a pricing grid tied to ARP’s leverage ratio under the ARP revolving credit facility. After such 15-month period,
interest will accrue at a rate equal to Adjusted LIBO Rate plus 9% per annum and will be payable in cash. In addition to the Second Lien
Exit Facility, the Second Lien Lenders will receive a pro rata share of 10% of the common equity interests of New HoldCo, subject to
dilution by a management incentive plan. Holders of the Notes, in exchange for 100% of the $668 million aggregate principal amount of
Notes outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest as of the commencement of the Chapter 11 cases, will receive, on the Plan Effective
Date, 90% of the common equity interests of New HoldCo as of the Plan Effective Date, subject to dilution by a management incentive
plan.
Under the Plan, holders of ARP’s limited partnership units will receive no recovery. On the Plan Effective Date, all of ARP’s preferred
limited partnership units and common limited partnership units will be cancelled without the receipt of any consideration.
ARP intends to continue to operate its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, all suppliers, vendors,
employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired by the Plan and will be satisfied in full in the ordinary course
of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, ARP obtained
interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking authority to use cash collateral
on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations
and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
Under the Plan, on the Plan Effective Date, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“ARP Mgt LLC”) will receive a preferred share of
New HoldCo. The preferred share will entitle ARP Mgt LLC to receive 2% of the economics of New HoldCo (subject to dilution if catch-up
contributions are not made with respect to future equity issuances, other than pursuant to the management incentive plan) and certain
other rights as provided for in the Restructuring Support Agreement. Four of the seven initial members of the board of directors of New
HoldCo are representatives of ARP Mgt LLC (the “New HoldCo Class A Directors”). For so long as ARP Mgt LLC holds such preferred
share, the New HoldCo Class A Directors will be appointed by a majority of ARP’s Class A Directors then in office. New HoldCo will
have a continuing right to purchase the preferred share at fair market value (as determined pursuant to the methodology provided for in
New HoldCo's limited liability company agreement), subject to the receipt of certain approvals, including the holders of at least 67% of the
outstanding common shares of New HoldCo unaffiliated with ARP Mgt LLC voting in favor of the exercise of the right to purchase the
preferred share.
In accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Restructuring Support Agreement, each of the Restructuring Support
Parties has agreed, among other things, to: (i) support and take all commercially reasonable actions
39
necessary or reasonably requested by ARP to facilitate consummation of the Restructuring in accordance with the Plan and the related
term sheets, including without limitation, if applicable, to timely vote to accept the Plan; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to support
the confirmation of the Plan and approval of the Disclosure Statement and the solicitation procedures; (iii) not object to, delay, interfere,
impede, or take any other action to delay, interfere or impede, directly or indirectly, with the Restructuring, confirmation of the Plan, or
approval of the Disclosure Statement or the solicitation procedures; and (iv) not object to our efforts to enter into the Exit Facilities, and not
object to, or support the efforts of any other person to oppose or object to, the Exit Facilities.
In accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP has agreed, subject to
applicable fiduciary duties, among other things, to: (i) support and complete the Restructuring and all transactions set forth in the Plan and
the Restructuring Support Agreement; (ii) complete the Restructuring and all transactions set forth or described in the Plan; (iii) take any
and all necessary actions in furtherance of the Restructuring, the Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan; (iv) make commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any and all required regulatory and/or third-party approvals for the Restructuring; and (v) operate the business
in the ordinary course, taking into account the Restructuring.
The Restructuring Support Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events, including the failure to meet specified
milestones related to filing, confirmation and consummation of the Plan, among other requirements, and in the event of certain breaches
by the parties under the Restructuring Support Agreement. There can be no assurance that the restructuring transactions will be
consummated.
Liquidation of Hedge Portfolio
On July 27, 2016, pursuant to ARP’s Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP completed the sale of certain of its commodity hedge
positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 and used the proceeds to repay $233.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ARP
First Lien Credit Facility. Accordingly, approximately $440 million remains outstanding under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as of
July 27, 2016.
NYSE Delisting
On July 12, 2016, ARP received notification from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) that the NYSE commenced proceedings to
delist ARP’s common units as a result of its failure to comply with the continued listed standards set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual to maintain an average closing price of $1.00 per unit over a consecutive 30 day period. ARP’s Class D
Preferred Units and Class E Preferred Units were also delisted from the NYSE. ARP’s common units, Class D Preferred Units, and Class
E Preferred Units began trading on the OTC market on July 13, 2016 with the ticker symbol “ARPJ” for its common units, “ARPJP” for its
Class D Preferred Units, and “ARPJN” for its Class E Preferred Units.
Forbearance Agreements
On July 11, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries entered into two forbearance agreements: (i) with Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders under the First Lien Credit Facility and (ii) with certain holders of ARP’s 7.75%
Senior Notes and certain holders of ARP’s 9.25% Senior Notes to forbear from exercising rights and remedies arising from non-payment
of the first installment of the borrowing base deficiency cure due on July 11, 2016 and any associated cross-defaults until July 27, 2016 or
another event of default occurred. See “Credit Facilities – Credit Facility” section below.
Suspension of ARP’s Preferred D and Preferred E Unit Distributions.
On June 16, 2016, our Board of Directors elected to suspend ARP’s 8.625% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units
and ARP’s 10.75% Class E Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units distributions, beginning with the second quarter 2016
distribution, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.
40
First Lien Credit Facility Borrowing Base Redetermination.
On June 8, 2016, ARP received notice from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility that ARP’s borrowing base had been redetermined in accordance with the ARP First Lien Credit Facility and reduced from
$700.0 million to $530.0 million. See “Credit Facilities – First Lien Credit Facility” section below.
Suspension of ARP’s Common Unit and Class C ARP Preferred Unit Distributions.
On May 5, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to suspend ARP’s common unit and ARP’s Class C preferred distributions, beginning
with the month of March of 2016, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.
Senior Note Repurchases.
In January and February 2016, ARP executed transactions to repurchase $20.3 million of their 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and $12.1
million of their 9.25% ARP Senior Notes for $5.5 million. As a result of these transactions, ARP recognized $26.5 million as gain on early
extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2016. (See Item 1: “Financial Statements (Unaudited)” – Note 5 for further details).
Atlas Growth Partners
Effective Registration Statement
AGP’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 5, 2016. AGP is offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T common units,
each representing limited partner interests in AGP, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis. AGP must receive minimum
offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0 billion.
The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T common units will be sold for a cash
purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders' deferred payment obligation to AGP.
AGP is also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan.
Cash Distributions
On August 3, 2016, AGP declared a quarterly distribution of $0.1750 per common unit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The $4.2
million distribution, including $0.1 million to its general partner, will be paid on August 12, 2016 to unitholders of record at the close of
business on June 30, 2016.
GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We expect our and our subsidiaries’ businesses to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions
made by us and our subsidiaries and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or
interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our and our subsidiaries’ actual results may vary materially from our
expected results.
The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines since the fourth quarter of 2014
through the second quarter of 2016. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a
significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production
activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and
investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.
Our subsidiaries’ future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, the ability to make payments on debts and the ability to make
distributions to unitholders, including ARP’s and AGP’s ability to make distributions to us, depend on our subsidiaries’ success in
producing current reserves efficiently, developing existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically. Our
subsidiaries face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures
are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. Our subsidiaries attempt to overcome this natural decline by
drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than produced. To the extent our subsidiaries do not have sufficient
capital, our subsidiaries’ ability to drill and acquire more reserves will be negatively impacted.  Based on current market conditions, ARP
believes that a reduction in its debt and cash
41
interest obligations is needed to improve its financial position and flexibility and to position it to take advantage of opportunities that may
arise out of the current industry downturn.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Gas and Oil Production
Production Profile. At June 30, 2016, our consolidated gas and oil production revenues and expenses consisted of our subsidiaries’ gas
and oil production activities. ARP has focused its natural gas, crude oil and NGL production operations in various plays throughout the
United States. AGP’s gas and oil production derives from its wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime plays.
Through June 30, 2016, our subsidiaries have established production positions in the following operating areas:
·the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas, in which ARP and AGP acquired acreage and producing wells in November 2014;
 ·AGP’s and ARP’s Barnett Shale and Marble Falls play, both in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas. The Barnett Shale contains
mostly dry gas and the Marble Falls play contains liquids rich gas and oil;
 ·ARP’s coal-bed methane producing natural gas assets in (1) the Raton Basin in northern New Mexico and the Black Warrior Basin in
central Alabama, which ARP acquired in 2013; (2) the Central Appalachia Basin in West Virginia and Virginia, which ARP acquired in
2014, and; (3) the Arkoma Basin in eastern Oklahoma, which ARP acquired from us in 2015.
 ·ARP’s Rangely field in northwest Colorado, a mature tertiary CO2 flood with low-decline oil production, where ARP has a 25% non-
operated net working interest position following its acquisition on June 30, 2014;
 ·ARP’s Appalachia Basin assets, including the Marcellus Shale, a rich, organic shale that generally contains dry, pipeline-quality natural
gas, and the Utica Shale, which lies several thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale, is much thicker than the Marcellus Shale and
trends primarily towards wet natural gas in the central region and dry gas in the eastern region; the Chattanooga Shale in northeastern
Tennessee, which enables ARP to access other formations in that region such as the Monteagle and Ft. Payne Limestone; and the New
Albany Shale in southwestern Indiana, a biogenic shale play with a long-lived and shallow decline profile; and
 ·AGP’s and ARP’s Mid-Continent assets, including Mississippi Lime and Hunton plays in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich
area, where AGP participated in non-operated well drilling since 2014, and ARP’s Niobrara Shale assets in northeastern Colorado, a
predominantly biogenic shale play that produces dry gas.
The following table presents the number of wells our subsidiaries drilled and the number of wells our subsidiaries turned in line, both

Well Construction and Completion
Drilling Program Results. At June 30, 2016, our well construction and completion revenues and expenses consisted solely of ARP’s
activities. The number of wells ARP drills will vary within ARP’s partnership management segment depending on the amount of capital it
raises through its Drilling Partnerships, the cost of each well, the depth or type of each well, the estimated recoverable reserves
attributable to each well and accessibility to the well site. Well construction and completion revenues and costs and expenses incurred
represent the billings and costs associated with the completion of wells for Drilling Partnerships ARP sponsors. As ARP’s drilling
contracts with the Drilling Partnerships are on a “cost-plus” basis, an increase or decrease in its average cost per well also results in a
proportionate increase or decrease in its average revenue per well, which directly affects the number of wells ARP drills.

basis.
The $2.4 million and $5.2 million decreases in well construction and completion gross profit margin during the three and six month
periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year period was due to a decrease in the number of
ARP’s partnership wells for which completion activities were being performed related to timing and the economics of such activities
during the challenging commodity price environment along with a downward revision to ARP’s estimated total costs to complete wells,
which resulted in an unfavorable adjustment to ARP’s gross profit margin  recognized on ARP’s percentage of completion basis for the
wells in progress.

At June 30, 2016, our administration and oversight revenues and expenses consist solely of ARP’s activities. Administration and
oversight fee revenues represent supervision and administrative fees earned for the drilling and subsequent ongoing management of
wells for ARP’s Drilling Partnerships. Typically, ARP receives a lower administration and oversight fee related to shallow, vertical wells it
drills within the Drilling Partnerships, such as those in the Marble Falls play, as compared to deep, horizontal wells, such as those drilled
in the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shales. The following table presents the number of gross and net development wells ARP drilled for
its Drilling Partnerships during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no exploratory wells drilled during

The $0.9 million decrease in administration and oversight fee revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior
year period was primarily due to a decrease in the number of wells spud within the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with the

At June 30, 2016, our well services revenues and expenses consisted solely of ARP’s activities. Well services revenue and expenses
represent the monthly operating fees ARP charges and the work ARP’s service company performs, including work performed for ARP’s
Drilling Partnership wells during the drilling and completing phase as well as ongoing maintenance of these wells and other wells for
which ARP serves as operator.
The $1.9 million and $4.1 million decreases in well services revenue during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2016,
respectively, as compared to the respective prior year period is primarily related to lower fee revenue associated with ARP’s salt water
gathering and disposal systems within the Mississippi Lime and Marble Falls operating areas, which are utilized by ARP’s Drilling
Partnership wells, and an increased number of wells having been shut in, which results in a reduction of the monthly operating fees
which ARP charges the Drilling Partnerships.
The $0.7 million decreases in well services expenses during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior
year periods are primarily related to lower labor costs.

At June 30, 2016, our gathering and processing margin consisted solely of ARP’s activities. Gathering and processing revenues and
expenses include gathering fees ARP charges to its Drilling Partnership wells and the related expenses and gross margin for ARP’s
processing plants in the New Albany Shale and the Chattanooga Shale. Generally, ARP charges a
49
gathering fee to its Drilling Partnership wells equivalent to the fees it remits. In Appalachia, a majority of ARP’s Drilling Partnership wells
are subject to a gathering agreement, whereby ARP remits a gathering fee of 16%. However, based on the respective Drilling Partnership
agreements, ARP charges its Drilling Partnership wells a 13% gathering fee. As a result, some of its gathering expenses, specifically
those in the Appalachian Basin, will generally exceed the revenues collected from the Drilling Partnerships by approximately 3%.
The $0.3 million and $0.8 million unfavorable movements in gathering and processing margin during the three and six month periods
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year period was principally due to lower overall natural gas prices
in Appalachia and lower gathering fees, particularly from ARP’s Marcellus Shale Drilling Partnership wells in Northeastern Pennsylvania,
which are utilizing ARP’s gathering pipeline.

Gain (Loss) on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. ARP and AGP recognize changes in the fair value of their derivatives immediately within gain
(loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on their consolidated statements of operations. The recognized gains/(losses) are due to
decreases/(increases) in commodity future prices relative to our commodity fixed price swaps during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period.
Other, Net. Our $0.3 million increase in other, net for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was
primarily due to a $0.2 million increase in income from our equity investment in Lightfoot.
Our $0.7 million increase in other, net for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a
$0.6 million increase in income from our equity investment in Lightfoot.
General and Administrative Expenses. Our $0.8 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 is primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease in other corporate activities and a $0.2 million decrease in stock compensation
expense, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in non-recurring transaction costs. ARP’s
50
$10.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year
period is primarily due to a $7.4 million increase in ARP’s restructuring costs to various financial advisors and legal counsel, a $2.1
million increase in ARP’s salaries, wages and benefits and a $1.9 million increase in ARP’s syndication expense due to lower program
fundraising activities, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in ARP’s non-cash stock compensation. AGP’s $0.1 million decrease in
general and administrative expenses from the comparable prior year period is due to a decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate
activities due to the completion of its private placement offering in June 2015.
Our $18.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily due to a $16.5
million decrease in non-recurring transaction costs attributable to our spin-off from Atlas Energy during the prior year period and a $4.3
million decrease in other corporate activities, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in stock compensation expense. ARP’s $10.4
million increase in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period is
primarily due to an $8.5 million increase in ARP’s salaries, wages and benefits, a $5.6 million increase in ARP’s restructuring costs to
various financial advisors and legal counsel, and a $1.4 million increase in ARP’s syndication expenses due to lower program
fundraising activities, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in ARP’s non-cash stock compensation and a $0.5 million decrease in
other corporate expenses. AGP’s $1.9 million decrease in general and administrative expenses from the comparable prior year period is
due to a decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activities due to the completion of its private placement offering in June 2015.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016 was primarily due to an $11.3 million and a $22.1 million decrease in AGP’s and ARP’s depletion expense. The following
table presents total depletion expense, depletion as a percent of gas and oil production revenue and depletion expense per Mcfe for
ARP’s and AGP’s operations for the respective periods (in thousands, except for percentage and per Mcfe data):

Depletion expense varies from period to period and is directly affected by changes in ARP’s gas and oil reserve quantities, production
levels, product prices and changes in the depletable cost basis of ARP’s gas and oil properties. The decreases in depletion expense and
depletion expense per Mcfe when compared with the comparable prior year period were due to impairments of ARP’s proved properties
recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices, which reduced the depletable cost
basis of ARP’s proved gas and oil properties in the current year periods. The increases in the depletion expense as a percentage of gas
and oil revenues when compared with the comparable prior year period were due to decreases in ARP’s gas and oil revenues as a result
of lower commodity prices and production volumes in the current year periods, partially offset by the decreases in depletion expense
described above. The fluctuations in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil revenues and depletion
expenses per Mcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period, were all partially offset by an
increase in AGP’s depletion expense associated with the expansion of its Eagle Ford operations.
Interest Expense. The decrease in our interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period
consisted of $3.2 million of discount amortization for our Term Loan Facilities in the prior year period and $2.9 million of accelerated
amortization of the discount of our Term Loan Facilities resulting from repayments made to reduce the outstanding balance during the
prior year period and a $2.1 million decrease in interest on outstanding term loans primarily resulting from lower outstanding borrowings
and the refinancing of the Deutsche Bank Term Loan in 2015 to the Riverstone Term Loan Facilities in March 2016 that among other
things decreased the interest rate by approximately 6% per annum, partially offset by the $3.6 million of paid-in-kind interest on our
current Riverstone Term Loan Facilities during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in ARP’s interest expense during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $4.1 million in accelerated amortization related
to the reduction of the borrowing base of ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility in June 2016, a $1.9 million increase associated with higher
outstanding borrowings under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility, a $1.7 million decrease in ARP’s capitalized interest due to lower capital
spending and a $0.2 million increase associated with amortization of ARP’s deferred financing costs, partially offset by a
51
$0.7 million decrease associated with interest expense on ARP’s Senior Notes due to its repurchases in January and February of 2016.
The decrease in our interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $5.7
million of accelerated amortization of the deferred financing costs associated with the portion of Atlas Energy’s Term Loan Facility
allocated to us in February 2015, $3.2 million of discount amortization for our Term Loan Facilities in the prior year period, a $3.2 million
decrease in interest on outstanding term loans primarily resulting from lower outstanding borrowings and the refinancing of the Deutsche
Bank Term Loan in 2015 to the Riverstone Term Loan Facilities in March 2016 that among other things decreased the interest rate by
approximately 6% per annum, $2.9 million of accelerated amortization of the discount of our Term Loan Facilities resulting from
repayments made to reduce the outstanding balance during the prior year period and $1.3 million of discount amortization for our Term
Loan Facilities with Deutsche Bank during the six months ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by the $3.6 million of paid-in-kind interest
on our current Riverstone Term Loan Facilities and $0.3 million in amortization of deferred financing costs for the current Riverstone Term
Loan Facilities during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in ARP’s interest expense during the six months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of $4.1 million associated with accelerated amortization of ARP’s deferred
financing costs resulting from a reduction of the borrowing base of its First Lien Credit Facility in June 2016, a $3.8 million increase
associated with ARP’s Term Loan Facility entered into February 2015, a $3.2 million decrease in ARP’s capitalized interest due to lower
capital spending, a $2.7 million increase associated with higher outstanding borrowings under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility and a $1.3
million increase associated with amortization of ARP’s deferred financing costs, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease associated with
accelerated amortization of ARP’s deferred financing costs resulting from a reduction of the borrowing base of its credit facility in
February 2015 and a $1.1 million decrease associated with interest expense on ARP’s Senior Notes due to our repurchases in January
and February of 2016.
Gain on Early Extinguishment of Debt. The gain on early extinguishment of debt for the six months ended June 30, 2016 represents a
$26.5 million gain related to the repurchase of a portion of ARP’s 7.75% and 9.25% Senior Notes, partially offset by $3.7 million of
accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and $2.4 million of prepayment penalties related to the restructuring of our Term
Loan Facility with Riverstone. Of ARP’s $26.5 million gain, $27.4 million related to the gain from the redemption of the principal values
and accrued interest, partially offset by $0.9 million related to the accelerated amortization of the related deferred financing costs.
Other income (loss). The $6.2 million loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 represents ARP’s non-cash loss, net of liquidation and
transfer adjustments, of certain Drilling Partnerships’ liquidation and transfer of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations to
ARP.
(Income) Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests. (Income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests includes an allocation of
ARP’s and AGP’s net income (losses) to non-controlling interest holders. The movement in loss attributable to non-controlling interests
between the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the prior year comparable period was primarily due to an increase in ARP’s net loss
during the current year period. ARP’s increase in net loss primarily related to the $46.3 million increase in the loss on mark-to-market
derivatives and a $45.9 million decrease in gas and oil revenue due to lower production volumes and decreases in commodity prices
compared to the prior year period.
The movement in income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests between the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the prior year
comparable period was primarily due to ARP’s net loss during the current year period. ARP’s net loss primarily related to the $105.8
million decrease in the gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives and a $101.6 million decrease in gas and oil revenue due to lower
production volumes and decreases in commodity prices compared to the prior year period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot. Our
primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service, capital expenditures, and distributions to
unitholders, which we expect to fund through operating cash flow, and cash distributions received.
We rely on the cash flows from the distributions received on our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot. The amount of cash that
ARP and AGP can distribute to their partners, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash they each generate from their
operations. ARP’s and AGP’s future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil
and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and
52
have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted ARP’s and AGP’s revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on ARP’s and AGP’s liquidity position
and ability to make distributions. Reductions of such distributions to us would adversely affect our ability to fund our cash requirements
and obligations and meet our financial covenants under our credit agreements.
On May 5, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to suspend ARP’s common unit and Class C preferred distributions, beginning with the
month of March of 2016, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.
Ability for the Company and ARP to Continue as a Going Concern
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and us, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a Restructuring
Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s senior secured revolving credit
facility (the “First Lien Lenders”), (ii) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s second lien term loan (the “Second Lien Lenders”) and (iii) holders
(the “Consenting Noteholders” and, collectively with the First Lien Lenders and the Second Lien Lenders, and their respective successors
or permitted assigns that become party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the “Restructuring Support Parties”) of approximately
80% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes due 2021 (the “7.75% ARP Senior Notes”) and the
9.25% ARP Senior Notes due 2021 (the “9.25% ARP Senior Notes” and, together with the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes, the “Notes”) of
ARP’s subsidiaries, Atlas Resource Partners Holdings, LLC and Atlas Resource Finance Corporation (together, the “Issuers”). Under the
Restructuring Support Agreement, the Restructuring Support Parties have agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support
ARP’s restructuring (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”). See “ARP Restructuring Support
Agreement,” for further information.
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of their subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court,” and
the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Filings”). The cases commenced thereby are being jointly administered under the caption
“In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
The Restructuring, including as a result of ARP monetizing certain hedges to pay down borrowings outstanding under ARP’s senior
secured credit facility, will result in a reduction of ARP’s existing debt by approximately $900 million and elimination of approximately
$80 million of ARP’s annual debt service obligations. Pursuant to the Plan, ARP’s business assets and operations will vest in a limited
liability company, which will be classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“New Holdco”). ARP expects to
consummate the Plan and emerge from Chapter 11 before the end of the third quarter of 2016. Interested parties should refer to the
information and the limitations and qualifications discussed in ARP’s disclosure statement related to ARP’s Restructuring (the “ARP
Disclosure Statement”) which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to ARP’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 25, 2016.
ARP intends to continue to operate its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, it is contemplated that
all of ARP’s suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired by the Plan and will be
satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary
course operations, ARP obtained interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking
authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay
vendors, oil and gas obligations and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
The Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated all of ARP’s outstanding debt obligations under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility (as defined below), the ARP Second Lien Term Loan (as defined below) and the indenture governing the ARP Notes. Any
efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as a result of ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement
are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.  Accordingly, we classified all of ARP’s outstanding debt obligations as a current
liability on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. See “Credit Facilities” below for further information.
ARP’s Restructuring is not expected to materially impact the Company or its ownership interest in AGP or Lightfoot. We are not a party to
ARP’s Restructuring. We remain controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, we expect that ARP’s
Restructuring will not have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or the other businesses.
53
The significant risks and uncertainties related to ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings raise substantial doubt about ARP’s and our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of
business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the
going concern uncertainty. If we and ARP cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of
our and ARP’s assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.
Atlas Growth Partners - Liquidity and Capital Resources
AGP has historically funded its operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through cash generated from operations and
financing activities, including its private placement offering completed in 2015. AGP’s future cash flows are subject to a number of
variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of
2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted AGP’s revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on AGP’s liquidity position.
AGP is not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and ARP’s Restructuring is not expected to materially impact AGP.

The change in cash flows used in operating activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:
·an increase in our working capital of $94.7 million primarily due to decreases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and liabilities
associated with drilling contracts as a result of lower operating activities; and an increase due to derivative cash settlements; partially
offset by lower accounts receivable, as a result of revenue declines, lower subscription receivables, due to a decline in ARP’s fund
raising for well drilling activities, and an increase in cash outflow for well drilling liabilities;
·a decrease in oil and gas production costs of $21.4 million due to ARP’s cost control measures and lower production activities; and
·a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $10.4 million primarily due to our non-recurring transaction costs attributable to
our spin-off from Atlas Energy during the prior year period, partially offset by ARP’s higher salaries, wages, and benefits and costs
associated with its restructuring; and partially offset by
·a decrease in ARP’s and AGP’s gas and oil production revenues of $99.3 million, due to lower commodity pricing and production
volumes;
·a decrease in ARP’s well construction and completion and well services margins totaling $8.6 million, due to lower revenue generating
activities, partially offset by lower associated expenses; and
·an increase in cash interest of $7.4 million primarily due to ARP’s higher outstanding balances on its revolving credit facility and the
debt under ARP’s term loan facility issued in February 2015, partially offset by ARP’s senior note repurchases in January and February
2016.
54
The change in cash flows used in investing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:
·a decrease of $57.5 million in capital expenditures due to lower capital expenditures related to our subsidiaries’ drilling activities; and
 ·a decrease of $49.1 million in net cash paid for acquisitions due primarily to ARP’s and AGP’s deferred purchase price payments and
working capital settlements for ARP’s and AGP’s Eagle Ford acquisition in 2015.
The change in cash flows provided by financing activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:
·a decrease of $242.5 million in net borrowings under ARP’s term loan and credit facilities due to the second lien term loan proceeds of
$242.5 million issued in the first quarter of 2015, net of $7.5 million of discount;
 ·a decrease of $126.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of AGP’s common limited partner units under its private placement
offering in first half of 2015 and the issuance of ARP’s common limited partner units in the first half of 2015 under ARP’s equity
distribution program;
 ·a decrease of $40.0 million related to the issuance of our Series A preferred units;
 ·an increase of $5.5 million related to ARP’s senior note repurchases in the first quarter of 2016; and
 ·an increase of $0.3 million in distributions paid to preferred unitholders primarily due to the issuance of the Series A preferred units in
the first quarter of 2015; partially offset by
 ·an increase of $223.5 million in net borrowings on ARP’s revolving credit facility;
 ·a decrease of $73.1 million in net repayments under our term loan facilities due to our $148.1 million payment to Atlas Energy in
connection with the repayment of Atlas Energy’s then existing term loan in the first quarter of 2015, which was partially funded by the
$115.3 million interim and term loan A facilities, net of $12.5 million of discount, entered into in the first quarter of 2015, and $45.1 million
in repayments on the interim and term loan A facilities during the first half of 2015, partially offset by $4.3 million in net repayments in the
first quarter of 2016 on our term loan facilities;
 ·an increase of $19.8 million related to the Arkoma transaction adjustment reflected in the first quarter of 2015; and
 ·a decrease of $8.1 million in deferred financing costs primarily related to the issuance of ARP’s $250.0 million second lien term loan in
the first quarter of 2015;
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the $3.6 million of paid-in-kind interest related to the Term Loan Facilities represented non-
cash transactions. Our issuance of 4,668,044 warrants in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement during the six months
ended June 30, 2016 represented a non-cash transaction.
Capital Requirements
At June 30, 2016, the capital requirements of our subsidiaries’ natural gas and oil production consist primarily of expenditures to maintain
or increase production margin in future periods, as well as land, gathering and processing, and other non-drilling capital expenditures.

Atlas Resource Partners. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, ARP’s total capital expenditures consisted primarily of $2.2
million for wells drilled exclusively for ARP’s own account compared with $13.5 million for the comparable prior year period, a reduction
of $0.2 million of investments in its Drilling Partnerships compared with $5.1 million for the prior year comparable period, $0.8 million of
leasehold acquisition costs compared with $1.4 million for the prior year comparable period and $2.9 million of corporate and other costs
compared with $7.0 million for the prior year comparable period.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP’s total capital expenditures consisted primarily of $9.8 million for wells drilled
exclusively for ARP’s own account compared with $25.8 million for the comparable prior year period, $0.6 million of investments in its
Drilling Partnerships compared with $18.7 million for the prior year comparable period, $2.0 million of leasehold acquisition costs
compared with $3.8 million for the prior year comparable period and $6.4 million of corporate and other costs compared with $21.2 million
for the prior year comparable period.
Atlas Growth Partners. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, AGP’s $0.8 million of total capital expenditures consisted primarily
of its wells drilled and leasehold acquisition costs. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, AGP’s $3.2 million of total capital
expenditures consisted primarily of its wells drilled and leasehold acquisition costs.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, AGP’s $6.3 million of total capital expenditures consisted primarily of its wells drilled and
leasehold acquisition costs. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, AGP’s $13.1 million of total capital expenditures consisted
primarily of its wells drilled and leasehold acquisition costs.
We and our subsidiaries continuously evaluate acquisitions of gas and oil assets. In order to make any acquisitions in the future, we and
our subsidiaries believe we will be required to access outside capital either through debt or equity placements or through joint venture
operations with other energy companies. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will be successful in our and our
subsidiaries’ efforts to obtain outside capital.
As of June 30, 2016, our subsidiaries are committed to expending approximately $4.6 million on drilling and completion and other capital
expenditures.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, our subsidiaries’ off-balance sheet arrangements were limited to ARP’s letters of credit outstanding of $4.2 million,
and commitments to spend $4.6 million related to ARP’s and AGP’s drilling and completion and capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions.
ARP is the managing general partner of the Drilling Partnerships and has agreed to indemnify each investor partner from any liability that
exceeds such partner’s share of Drilling Partnership assets. ARP has structured certain Drilling Partnerships to allow limited partners to
have the right to present their interests for purchase. Generally, for Drilling Partnerships with this structure, ARP is not obligated to
purchase more than 5% to 10% of the units in any calendar year, no units may be purchased during the first five years after closing for the
Drilling Partnership, and ARP may immediately suspend the presentment structure for a Drilling Partnership by giving notice to the limited
partners that it does not have adequate liquidity for redemptions. In accordance with the Drilling Partnership agreement, the purchase
price for limited partner interests would generally be based upon a percentage of the present value of future cash flows allocable to the
interest, discounted at 10%, as of the date of presentment, subject to estimated changes by ARP to reflect current well performance,
commodity prices and production costs, among other items. Based on its historical experience, as of June 30, 2016, management
believes that any such estimated liability for redemptions of limited partner interests in Drilling Partnerships which allow such transactions
would not be material.
CREDIT FACILITIES
As of June 30, 2016, we had not guaranteed any of ARP’s or AGP’s obligations or debt instruments.
Term Loan Facilities
First Lien Credit Facility. On March 30, 2016, we, together with the “Borrower and Atlas Lightfoot, LLC, entered into the Third Amendment
to the First Lien Credit Agreement with Riverstone, as administrative agent, and the Lenders.
The outstanding loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement were bifurcated between the existing First Lien Credit Agreement and the
new Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below), with $35.0 million and $35.8 million (including
56
$2.4 million in deemed prepayment premium) in borrowings outstanding, respectively. In connection with the execution of the Third
Amendment, the Borrower made a prepayment of approximately $4.25 million of the outstanding principal, which was classified as
current portion of long-term debt on our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, and $0.5 million of
interest. The Third Amendment amended the First Lien Credit Agreement to, among other things:
·provide the ability for us and the Borrower to enter into the new Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below);
 ·shorten the maturity date of the First Lien Credit Agreement to September 30, 2017, subject to an optional extension to September 30,
2018 by the Borrower, assuming certain conditions are met, including a First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit
Agreement) of not more than 6:00 to 1:00 and a 5% extension fee;
 ·modify the applicable cash interest rate margin for ABR Loans and Eurodollar Loans to 0.50% and 1.50%, respectively, and add a pay-
in-kind interest payment of 11% of the principal balance per annum;
 ·allow the Borrower to make mandatory pre-payments under the First Lien Credit Agreement or the new Second Lien Credit Agreement,
in its discretion, and add additional mandatory pre-payment events, including a monthly cash sweep for balances in excess of $4
million;
 ·provide that the First Lien Credit Agreement may be prepaid without premium;
 ·replace the existing financial covenants with (i) the requirement that we maintain a minimum of $2 million in EBITDA on a trailing twelve-
month basis, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2016, and (ii) the incorporation into the First Lien Credit Agreement of the
financial covenants included in ARP’s credit agreement, beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2016;
 ·prohibit the payment of cash distributions on our common and preferred units;
 ·require the receipt of quarterly distributions from AGP and Lightfoot; and
 ·add a cross-default provision for defaults by ARP.
Second Lien Credit Agreement. Also on March 30, 2016, we and the Borrower entered into the Second Lien Credit Agreement with
Riverstone and the Lenders. $35.8 million of the indebtedness previously outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was moved
under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Second Lien Credit Agreement is presented net of an unamortized discount of $1.9 million
as of June 30, 2016, related to the 4,668,044 warrants issued in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement (See “Issuance of
Units” below).
The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on March 30, 2019, subject to an optional extension (the “Extension Option”) to March 30,
2020, assuming certain conditions are met, including a Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Lien Credit Agreement) of not
more than 6:00 to 1:00 and a 5% extension fee. Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured on a second priority
basis by security interests in the same collateral that secures borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement.
Borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of 30%, payable in-kind through an increase in the
outstanding principal. If the First Lien Credit Agreement is repaid in full prior to March 30, 2018, the rate will be reduced to 20%. If the
Extension Option is exercised, the rate will again be increased to 30%. If our market capitalization is greater than $75 million, we can
issue common units in lieu of increasing the principal to satisfy the interest obligation.
The Borrower may prepay the borrowings under the Second Lien Credit Agreement without premium at any time. The Second Lien Credit
Agreement includes the same mandatory prepayment events as the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to the Borrower’s discretion to
prepay either the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement.
The Second Lien Credit Agreement contains the same negative and affirmative covenants and events of default as the First Lien Credit
Agreement, including customary covenants that limit the Borrower’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or
investments, make distributions if a default exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other persons, enter
into swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts, or engage in certain asset dispositions. In
addition, the Second Lien Credit Agreement requires that we maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Second Lien Credit
Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2017 and each fiscal quarter ending thereafter.
57
As a result of the cross-default, on July 11, 2016, we entered into waiver agreements (the “Waivers”) with Riverstone and the Lenders in
connection with the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Waivers, Riverstone and the
Lenders agreed to waive under the First Lien Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Credit Agreement:
·the cross-defaults relating to the ARP’s default, for so long as the forbearing parties continue to forbear from exercising their rights and
·the cross-defaults relating to the ARP’s default, for so long as the forbearing parties continue to forbear from exercising their rights and
remedies; and
·the potential default relating to ARP’s ongoing negotiations with its lenders and noteholders to the extent any resulting restructuring is
completed prior to October 31, 2016
We and ARP’s future debt maturities, excluding any future payment-in-kind interest payments, are as follows: $1,580.5 million, $35.0
million and $35.8 million respectively, for the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively.
In connection with the Term Loan Facilities, the lenders thereunder syndicated participations in loans underlying the facilities.  As a
result, certain of the Company’s current and former officers participated in approximately 12% of the loan syndication and warrants and a
foundation affiliated with 5% or more unitholder participated in approximately 12% of the loan syndication.
ARP First Lien Credit Facility
ARP is party to a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2013 by and among ARP, the lenders from time
to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended, supplemented or modified from
time to time (the “ARP First Lien Credit Facility”), which provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing
base of $1.5 billion scheduled to mature in July 2018.
On June 8, 2016, ARP received notice from Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility that its borrowing base had been redetermined in accordance with the ARP First Lien Credit Facility and reduced from
$700.0 million to $530.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, $669.5 million in borrowings were outstanding (which includes $4.2 million in
letters of credit) under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility, resulting in a borrowing base deficiency of $143.7 million. The ARP First Lien
Credit Facility provides that within 30 days after ARP’s receipt of a notification of a borrowing base deficiency, ARP must elect to cure the
borrowing base deficiency through any combination of the following actions: (i) repay amounts outstanding under the ARP First Lien
Credit Facility sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency, either within 30 days after receipt of the borrowing base deficiency notice
or in four equal monthly installments beginning on July 11, 2016; or (ii) pledge as collateral additional oil and gas properties acceptable
to the administrative agent and lenders sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency within 60 days after receipt of the borrowing base
deficiency notice. As part of the discussions with ARP’s lenders and noteholders, ARP determined not to make the first installment
payment that was due on July 11, 2016.
In connection therewith and in support of negotiations with ARP’s First Lien Lenders, Second Lien Lenders, and Consenting
Noteholders, on July 11, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries entered into two forbearance agreements: (i) with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility (the “ARP First Lien Credit
Forbearance”) and (ii) with the Consenting Noteholders of the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes(the “ARP
Notes Forbearance”).
Pursuant to the ARP First Lien Credit Forbearance, the administrative agent and the lenders representing approximately 81% of the
outstanding indebtedness under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies arising from
non-payment of the first installment of the borrowing base deficiency cure due on July 11, 2016 and related cross-defaults (the “ARP
Specified Default”) until the earliest to occur of (i) July 27, 2016, (ii) the occurrence of an event of default under the ARP First Lien Credit
Facility (unrelated to the ARP Specified Default) or (iii) the exercise by any holder of indebtedness outstanding under the ARP Second
Lien Term Loan, the ARP Notes or any other material indebtedness of ours of rights or remedies against us or the other loan parties or
their respective property.
Pursuant to the ARP Notes Forbearance, the holders of approximately 78% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 7.75%
ARP Senior Notes and approximately 82% of the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes agreed to forbear from exercising their rights and remedies
arising from the cross-default that resulted from the ARP Specified Default until the earliest to occur of (i) July 27, 2016, (ii) another event
of default under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes indenture or the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes indenture or (iii) any other holder of the ARP
Notes commences a legal proceeding against us or the other
58
loan parties or their respective property. The holders of a majority of the Second Lien Term Loan were supportive of the forbearance.
ARP’s borrowing base is scheduled for semi-annual redeterminations in May and November of each year. Up to $20.0 million of the ARP
First Lien Credit Facility may be in the form of standby letters of credit, of which $4.2 million was outstanding at June 30, 2016. ARP’s
obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility are secured by mortgages on ARP’s oil and gas properties and first priority security
interests in substantially all of ARP’s assets. Additionally, obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain
of ARP’s material subsidiaries, and any non-guarantor subsidiaries of ARP are minor. At June 30, 2016, the weighted average interest
rate on outstanding borrowings under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility was 4.0%.
The ARP First Lien Credit Facility contains customary covenants including, without limitation, covenants that limit ARP’s ability to incur
additional indebtedness (but which permits second lien debt in an aggregate principal amount of up to $300.0 million and third lien debt
that satisfies certain conditions including pro forma financial covenants), grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a
borrowing base deficiency or default exists or would result from the distribution, merge or consolidate with other persons, or engage in
certain asset dispositions including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.  The ARP First Lien Credit Facility also requires that ARP
maintain a ratio of First Lien Debt to EBITDA (ratio as defined in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility) of not greater than 2.75 to 1.00, and a
ratio of current assets to current liabilities (ratio as defined in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day
of any fiscal quarter. ARP was not in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility and
as a result, we classified $669.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as current portion of long-
term debt and $12.2 million of deferred financing costs related to the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as current assets within our
condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. Any efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as
a result of the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
Pursuant to the ARP Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP completed the sale of certain of substantially all of its commodity hedge
positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 and used the proceeds to repay $233.5 million of borrowings outstanding under the ARP
First Lien Credit Facility. Accordingly, approximately $440 million remained outstanding under the ARP First Lien Credit Facility as of
July 27, 2016, the date of ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings.
On the Plan Effective Date, ARP expects to enter into the new First Lien Exit Facility, which will replace the First Lien Credit Facility (see
“Restructuring Support Agreement” above).
ARP Second Lien Term Loan
ARP is party to a Second Lien Credit Agreement, dated as of February 23, 2015 by and among ARP, the lenders from time to time party
thereto, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time
(the “ARP Second Lien Term Loan”), which provides for a second lien term loan in an original principal amount of $250.0 million. The
ARP Second Lien Term Loan matures on February 23, 2020. The Second Lien Term Loan is presented net of unamortized discount of
$5.5 million as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s obligations under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan are secured on a second priority basis by security interests in all of ARP’s
assets and those of its restricted subsidiaries that guarantee the ARP First Lien Credit Facility. In addition, the obligations under the ARP
Second Lien Term Loan are guaranteed by ARP’s material restricted subsidiaries. At June 30, 2016, the weighted average interest rate
on outstanding borrowings under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan was 10.0%.
The ARP Second Lien Term Loan contains customary covenants including, without limitation, covenants that limit ARP’s ability to make
restricted payments, take on indebtedness, issue preferred units, grant liens, conduct sales of assets and subsidiary stock, make
distributions from restricted subsidiaries, conduct affiliate transactions and engage in other business activities. In addition, the ARP
Second Lien Term Loan contains covenants substantially similar to those in the ARP First Lien Credit Facility, including, among others,
restrictions on swap agreements, debt of unrestricted subsidiaries, drilling and operating agreements and the sale or discount of
receivables. ARP was not in compliance with the financial covenants as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan and
as a result, we classified $244.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the ARP Second Lien Term Loan, which is net of $5.5
million unamortized discount and $9.4 million deferred financing costs, as current portion of
59
long-term debt within our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.  Any efforts to enforce such payments
are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable
provisions of Chapter 11.
On the Plan Effective Date, ARP expects to enter into the new ARP Second Lien Exit Facility, which will replace the ARP Second Lien
Term Loan (see “Restructuring Support Agreement” above).
ARP Senior Notes
At June 30, 2016, ARP had $354.4 million outstanding of its 7.75% ARP Senior Notes due 2021. The 7.75% ARP Senior Notes were
presented net of a $0.3 million unamortized discount as of June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2016, ARP had $312.1 million outstanding of its 9.25% ARP Senior Notes due 2021. The 9.25% ARP Senior Notes were
presented net of a $0.8 million unamortized discount as of June 30, 2016.
In January and February 2016, ARP executed transactions to repurchase $20.3 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes and $12.1 million of its
9.25% Senior Notes for $5.5 million, which included $0.6 million of interest. As a result of these transactions, we recognized $26.5 million
as gain on early extinguishment of debt, net of accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.9 million, in our condensed
combined consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of ARP’s material subsidiaries. The guarantees
under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes are full and unconditional and joint and several, subject to certain
customary automatic release provisions, including, in certain circumstances, the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the
assets of, or all of the equity interests in, the subsidiary guarantor, or the subsidiary guarantor is declared “unrestricted” for covenant
purposes, and any subsidiaries of ARP, other than the subsidiary guarantors, are minor. There are no restrictions on ARP’s ability to
obtain cash or any other distributions of funds from the guarantor subsidiaries.
The indentures governing the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and 9.25% ARP Senior Notes contain covenants including, without limitation,
covenants that limit ARP’s ability to incur certain liens, incur additional indebtedness; declare or pay distributions if an event of default
has occurred; redeem, repurchase, or retire equity interests or subordinated indebtedness; make certain investments; or merge,
consolidate or sell substantially all of ARP’s assets. ARP was in compliance with these covenants as of June 30, 2016.
On June 6, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as resigning trustee (“Wells Fargo”) and
U.S. Bank National Association, as successor trustee (“U.S. Bank”), entered into an Instrument of Resignation, Appointment and
Acceptance (the “Instrument”). In connection with the Instrument, Wells Fargo resigned as trustee, note custodian, registrar and paying
agent under the Indenture dated as of July 30, 2013, as supplemented and amended and ARP accepted such resignation and appointed
U.S. Bank as the successor trustee, note custodian, registrar and paying agent under the such indenture.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and the
9.25% ARP Senior Notes and as a result, we classified $354.4 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under the 7.75% ARP Senior
Notes, which is net of $0.3 million unamortized discount and $9.5 million deferred financing costs, and $312.1 million of ARP’s
outstanding amounts under the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes, which is net of $0.8 million unamortized discount and $8.3 million deferred
financing costs, as current portion of long-term debt within our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Any efforts to enforce such payments are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of enforcement
are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
On the Plan Effective Date, the 7.75% ARP Senior Notes and the 9.25% ARP Senior Notes (together with accrued but unpaid interest)
will be cancelled and the holders will receive 90% of the common equity interests of New HoldCo (see “Restructuring Support
Agreement” above).
ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS SECURED HEDGE FACILITY
At June 30, 2016, ARP had a secured hedge facility agreement with a syndicate of banks under which certain Drilling Partnerships have
the ability to enter into derivative contracts to manage their exposure to commodity price movements. Under ARP’s revolving credit
facility, ARP is required to utilize this secured hedge facility for future commodity risk management activity for its equity production
volumes within the participating Drilling Partnerships. ARP, as general partner
60
of the Drilling Partnerships, administers the commodity price risk management activity for the Drilling Partnerships under the secured
hedge facility and guarantees their obligations under it. Before executing any hedge transaction, a participating Drilling Partnership is
required to, among other things, provide mortgages on its oil and gas properties and first priority security interests in substantially all of its
assets to the collateral agent for the benefit of the counterparties. The secured hedge facility agreement contains covenants that limit
each of the participating Drilling Partnership’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a
default under the secured hedge facility agreement exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other
persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts,
or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets.
An event of default occurred under the secured hedging facility agreement upon ARP’s filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter
11.  The lenders under the secured hedge facility agreed to forbear from exercising remedies in respect of such event of default while the
Chapter 11 Filings are pending and, upon occurrence of the effective date of the Plan contemplated by ARP’s Restructuring Support
Agreement, such event of default will no longer be deemed to exist or to continue under the secured hedge facility.
In addition, it will be an event of default under ARP’s revolving credit facility if ARP, as general partner of the Drilling Partnerships,
breaches an obligation governed by the secured hedge facility and the effect of such breach is to cause amounts owing under swap
agreements governed by the secured hedge facility to become immediately due and payable.
ATLAS GROWTH PARTNERS SECURED CREDIT FACILITY
On May 1, 2015, AGP entered into a secured credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks. As of June 30, 2016, the lenders under
the credit facility have no commitment to lend to AGP under the credit facility, but AGP and its subsidiaries have the ability to enter into
derivative contracts to manage their exposure to commodity price movements which will benefit from the collateral securing the credit
facility. Obligations under the credit facility are secured by mortgages on AGP’s oil and gas properties and first priority security interest in
substantially all of its assets. The credit facility may be amended in the future if AGP and the lenders agree to increase the borrowing
base and the lenders’ commitments thereunder. The secured credit facility agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of AGP and
its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions, merge into or consolidate with other
persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts,
or engage in certain asset dispositions, including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. In addition, AGP’s credit facility includes
customary events of default, including failure to timely pay, breach of covenants, bankruptcy, cross-default with other material
indebtedness (including obligations under swap agreements in excess of any agreed upon threshold amount), and change of control
provisions.
ISSUANCE OF UNITS
We recognize gains or losses on ARP’s and AGP’s equity transactions as credits or debits, respectively, to unitholders’ equity on our
condensed combined consolidated balance sheets rather than as income or loss on our condensed combined consolidated statements of
operations. These gains or losses represent our portion of the excess or the shortage of the net offering price per unit of each of ARP’s
and AGP’s common units as compared to the book carrying amount per unit.
In connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement, on April 27, 2016, we issued to the Lenders, warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase
up to 4,668,044 common units representing limited partner interests at an exercise price of $0.20 per unit. The Warrants expire on March
30, 2026 and are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions. On April 27, 2016, we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant
to which we agreed to register the offer and resale of our common units underlying the Warrants as well as any common units issued as
in-kind interest payments under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The Warrants include a cashless exercise provision entitling the
Lenders to surrender a portion of the underlying common units that has a value equal to the aggregate exercise price in lieu of paying
cash upon exercise of a warrant. As a result of issuance of the Warrants, we recognized a $1.9 million debt discount on the Second Lien
Credit Agreement, which will be amortized over the term of the debt, and a corresponding $1.9 million increase to unitholders’ equity –
warrants on our condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
On February 27, 2015 we issued and sold an aggregate of 1.6 million of our newly created Series A convertible preferred units, with a
liquidation preference of $25.00 per unit (the “Series A Preferred Units”), at a purchase price of $25.00 per unit to certain members of our
management, two management members of the Board, and outside investors. Holders of the Series A Preferred Units are entitled to
monthly distributions of cash at a rate equal to the greater of (i) 10% of the liquidation preference per annum, increasing to 12% per
annum, 14% per annum and 16% per annum on the first, second and third anniversaries of the of the private placement, respectively or
(ii) the monthly equivalent of any cash distribution
61
declared by us to holders of our common units, as well as Series A Preferred Units at a rate equal to 2% of the liquidation preference per
annum. All or a portion of the Series A Preferred Units will be convertible into our units at the option of the holder at any time following the
later of (i) the one-year anniversary of the distribution and (ii) receipt of unitholder approval. The conversion price will be equal to the
greater of (i) $8.00 per common unit; and (ii) the lower of (a) 110.0% of the volume weighted average price for our common units over the
30 trading days following the distribution date; and (b) $16.00 per common unit. We sold the Series A Preferred Units in a private
transaction exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Series A Preferred Units resulted in proceeds to us of
$40.0 million. We used the proceeds to fund a portion of the $150.0 million payment by us to Atlas Energy related to the repayment of
Atlas Energy’s term loan. The Series A Purchase Agreement contains customary terms for private placements, including representations,
warranties, covenants and indemnities.
On August 26, 2015, at a special meeting of our unitholders, the unitholders approved changes to the terms of the Series A Preferred
Units to provide that each Series A Preferred Unit will be convertible into common units at the option of the holder.
On January 7, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that we were not in compliance with NYSE’s continued listing criteria under
Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the average closing price of our common units had been less than $1.00
for 30 consecutive trading days.  We also were notified by the NYSE on December 23, 2015, that we were not in compliance with the
NYSE’s continued listing criteria under Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because our average market
capitalization had been less than $50 million for 30 consecutive trading days and our stockholders’ equity had been less than $50 million.
On March 18, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that it determined to commence proceedings to delist our common units from the
NYSE as a result of our failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15 million. The NYSE
also suspended the trading of our common units at the close of trading on March 18, 2016. Our common units began trading on the
OTCQX on Monday, March 21, 2016 under the ticker symbol: ATLS.
On May 12, 2016, due to the income tax ramifications of potential options we were considering, the Board of Directors delayed the vesting
of approximately 911,900 units granted, under our long-term incentive plan, to employees, directors and officers, until March 2017. The
phantom units were set to vest between June 8, 2016 and September 1, 2016. The delayed vesting schedule did not have a significant
impact on the compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or our remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to such
awards.
Atlas Resource Partners
ARP has an equity distribution agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., as representative of the several banks named therein (the
“Agents”). Pursuant to the equity distribution agreement, ARP may sell from time to time through the Agents common units representing
limited partner interests of ARP having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million. Sales of common units, if any, may be made in
negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be “at-the-market” offerings as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act,
including sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange, the existing trading market for the common units, or sales made to or
through a market maker other than on an exchange or through an electronic communications network. ARP will pay each of the Agents a
commission, which in each case shall not be more than 2.0% of the gross sales price of common units sold through such Agent. Under
the terms of the equity distribution agreement, ARP may also sell common units from time to time to any Agent as principal for its own
account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of common units to an Agent as principal would be pursuant to the
terms of a separate agreement between ARP and such Agent. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, ARP did not issue any
common limited partner units under the equity distribution program. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, ARP issued 2,403,288
common limited partner units under the equity distribution agreement for net proceeds of $17.5 million, net of $0.5 million in commissions
and offering expenses paid.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, ARP issued 245,175 common limited partner units under the
equity distribution program for net proceeds of $0.2 million, net of $4,000 in commissions and offering expenses paid. During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, ARP issued 2,885,824 common limited partner units under the equity distribution agreement for net
proceeds of $21.4 million, net of $0.6 million in commissions and offering expenses paid.
In August 2015, ARP entered into a distribution agreement with MLV & Co. LLC (“MLV”) which ARP terminated and replaced in
November 2015, when ARP entered into a distribution agreement with MLV and FBR Capital Markets & Co. pursuant to which ARP may
sell its 8.625% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class D ARP Preferred Units”) and 10.75% Class E
Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (“Class E ARP Preferred Units”).
62
ARP did not issue any Class D Preferred Units nor Class E Preferred Units under the August 2015 and November 2015 preferred equity
distribution programs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
In May 2015, in connection with the Arkoma Acquisition, ARP issued 6,500,000 of its common limited partner units in a public offering at
a price of $7.97 per unit, yielding net proceeds of $49.7 million. ARP used a portion of the net proceeds to fund the Arkoma Acquisition
and to reduce borrowings outstanding under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility.
In April 2015, ARP issued 255,000 of its 10.75% Class E ARP Preferred Units at a public offering price of $25.00 per unit for net proceeds
of $6.0 million.
On March 31, 2015, to partially pay its portion of the quarterly installment related to the Eagle Ford acquisition, ARP issued an additional
800,000 Class D ARP Preferred Units to the seller at a value of $25.00 per unit.
On May 12, 2016, due to the income tax ramifications of the potential options ARP was considering, the Board of Directors delayed the
vesting date of approximately 110,000 units granted to employees, directors and officers until March 2017.  The phantom units were set to
vest between May 15, 2016 and August 31,2016. The delayed vesting schedule did not have a significant impact on ARP’s
compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or our remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to such awards.
On July 12, 2016, ARP received notification from the New York Stock Exchange that the NYSE commenced proceedings to delist ARP’s
common units as a result of ARP’s failure to comply with the continued listed standards set forth in Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual to maintain an average closing price of $1.00 per unit over a consecutive 30-day period. The Class D ARP Preferred
Units and Class E ARP Preferred Units were also delisted from the NYSE. ARP’s common units, Class D ARP Preferred Units, and
Class E ARP Preferred Units began trading on the OTC market on July 13, 2016 with the ticker symbol “ARPJ” for ARP’s common units,
“ARPJP” for Class D ARP Preferred Units, and “ARPJN” for Class E ARP Preferred Units.

On April 5, 2016, we announced that AGP’s registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Under the terms of AGP’s initial offering, AGP offered in a private placement $500.0 million of its common limited partner units. The
termination date of the private placement offering was December 31, 2014, subject to two 90 day extensions to the extent that it had not
sold $500.0 million of common units at any extension date. AGP exercised each of such extensions. Under the terms of the offering, an
investor received, for no additional consideration, warrants to purchase additional common units in an amount equal to 10% of the
common units purchased by such investor. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $10.00 per common unit being purchased and may
be exercised from and after the warrant date (generally, the date upon which AGP gives the holder notice of a liquidity event) until the
expiration date (generally, the date that is one day prior to the liquidity event or, if the liquidity event is a listing on a national securities
exchange, 30 days after the liquidity event occurs). Under the warrant, a liquidity event is defined as either (i) a listing of the common
units on a national securities exchange, (ii) a business combination with or into an existing publicly-traded entity, or (iii) a sale of all or
substantially all of AGP’s assets.
Through the completion of AGP’s private placement offering on June 30, 2015, AGP issued $233.0 million, or 23,300,410 of its common
limited partner units, in exchange for proceeds to AGP, net of dealer manager fees and commissions and expenses, of $203.4 million. We
purchased 500,010 common units for $5.0 million during the offering. In connection with the issuance of common limited partner units,
unitholders received 2,330,041 warrants to purchase AGP’s common units at an exercise price of $10.00 per unit.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
See Notes 2 and 5 to our condensed combined consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recently issued
accounting standards.
For a more complete discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our
condensed combined consolidated financial statements, please refer to our Management’s Discussion and
63
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
ITEM 3:QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our and our
subsidiaries’ potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest
rates and commodity prices. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of
reasonable possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we and our subsidiaries view and manage our
ongoing market risk exposures. All of the market risk-sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.
General
All of our and our subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars, and as a result, we do not have exposure to
currency exchange risks.
We and our subsidiaries are exposed to various market risks, principally fluctuating interest rates and changes in commodity prices.
These risks can impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our subsidiaries manage these risks through regular
operating and financing activities and periodic use of derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts and interest rate cap and
swap agreements. The following analysis presents the effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position as if the
hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred on June 30, 2016. Only the potential impact of hypothetical assumptions was
analyzed. The analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our and our subsidiaries’ business.
ARP and AGP are subject to the risk of loss on their derivative instruments that would incurred as a result of non-performance by
counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. ARP and AGP maintain credit policies with regard to their
counterparties to minimize their overall credit risk. These policies require (i) the evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition
to determine their credit worthiness; (ii) the quarterly monitoring of our oil, natural gas and NGLs counterparties’ credit exposures;
(iii) comprehensive credit reviews on significant counterparties from physical and financial transactions on an ongoing basis; (iv) the
utilization of contractual language that affords them netting or set off opportunities to mitigate exposure risk; and (v) when appropriate,
requiring counterparties to post cash collateral, parent guarantees or letters of credit to minimize credit risk.  ARP’s assets related to
derivatives as of June 30, 2016 represent financial instruments from ten counterparties; all of which are financial institutions that have an
“investment grade” (minimum Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB+ or better) credit rating and are lenders associated with ARP’s revolving
credit facility. Subject to the terms of ARP’s revolving credit facility, collateral or other securities are not exchanged in relation to
derivatives activities with the parties in the revolving credit facility.
Interest Rate Risk. As of June 30, 2016, we had $72.6 million of outstanding borrowings under our term facilities and ARP had $669.5
million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and $244.5 million of outstanding borrowings under its term loan
facility. Holding all other variables constant, a hypothetical 100 basis-point or 1% change in variable interest rates would change our
consolidated interest expense for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2017 by $9.9 million, excluding the effect of non-controlling
interests.
Commodity Price Risk. Our subsidiaries’ market risk exposures to commodities are due to the fluctuations in the commodity prices and
the impact those price movements have on our subsidiaries’ financial results. To limit the exposure to changing commodity prices, ARP
and AGP use financial derivative instruments, including financial swap and option instruments, to hedge portions of future production.
The swap instruments are contractual agreements between counterparties to exchange obligations of money as the underlying
commodities are sold. Under these swap agreements, ARP and AGP receive or pay a fixed price and receive or remit a floating price
based on certain indices for the relevant contract period. Option instruments are contractual agreements that grant the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase or sell commodities at a fixed price for the relevant period.
Holding all other variables constant, including the effect of commodity derivatives, a 10% change in average commodity prices would
result in a change to our consolidated operating income for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2017 of approximately $1.5 million,
net of non-controlling interests.
Realized pricing of natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids production is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide prices for crude oil
and spot market prices applicable to United States natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production. Pricing for natural gas, oil and
natural gas liquids production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years. To limit
64
AGP’s and ARP’s exposure to changing natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices, AGP and ARP enter into natural gas and oil swap,
put option and costless collar option contracts. At any point in time, such contracts may include regulated NYMEX futures and options
contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter (“OTC”) futures contracts with qualified counterparties. NYMEX contracts are generally
settled with offsetting positions, but may be settled by the delivery of natural gas. OTC contracts are generally financial contracts which
are settled with financial payments or receipts and generally do not require delivery of physical hydrocarbons. Crude oil contracts are
based on a West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) index. Natural gas liquids fixed price swaps are priced based on a WTI crude oil index,
while other natural gas liquids contracts are based on an OPIS Mt. Belvieu index.

ITEM 4:CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure
controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of our disclosure committee
appointed by such officers, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that,
as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
66
PART II
ITEM 1A:RISK FACTORS
There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors disclosed in Part I – Item 1A “–Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2015 except as follows.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties related to ARP’s Chapter 11 cases.
ARP and certain of its subsidiaries have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, and we are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties associated with those bankruptcy cases. These risks include the following:
·our ability to continue as a going concern;
 ·whether the proposed Plan outlined in the Restructuring Support Agreement will be confirmed and consummated;
 ·our ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;
 ·our ability to fund and execute our business plan;
 ·our ability to attract, motivate, and retain management;
 ·significant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 cases; and
 ·negative effects and increased costs of a prolonged duration of the Chapter 11 cases.
We will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have
interests in the Chapter 11 cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and
operations in various ways and may increase the longer ARP and its subsidiaries have to operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
ARP may not be able to obtain confirmation of the Plan, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
There can be no assurance that the Plan will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. ARP might receive official objections to confirmation
of the Plan from the various committees and stakeholders in the Chapter 11 proceedings. We cannot predict the impact that any objection
might have on the Plan or on a Bankruptcy Court’s decision to confirm the Plan. Any objection may cause us and ARP to devote
significant resources in response, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
While certain of ARP’s stakeholders have agreed to support the Plan under the Restructuring Support Agreement, if ARP is unable to
implement the Plan, any alternative plan of reorganization will also require the willingness of certain stakeholders to agree to the
exchange or modification of their interests. There can be no guarantee of success with respect to the Plan or any other plan of
reorganization. If the Plan is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize ARP’s
business. There can be no assurance as to whether ARP will successfully reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11 or, if ARP does
successfully reorganize, as to when ARP would emerge from Chapter 11. If no plan of reorganization can be confirmed, or if the
Bankruptcy Court otherwise finds that it would be in the best interest of holders of claims and interests, the Chapter 11 cases may be
converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to which a trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our
assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. There can be no assurance that a different
outcome for ARP would not materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
During the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may
experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to effectively, efficiently and safely conduct our business, and could impair our ability to execute our strategy
and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our ownership interests in ARP will be cancelled upon confirmation and consummation of the Plan, which could impact our liquidity for
normal operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures and distributions to our unitholders and which raises significant risks
and uncertainties about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash distributions received with respect to our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot. Our
primary cash requirements, in addition to normal operating expenses, are for debt service, capital
67
expenditures, and distributions to unitholders, which we expect to fund through operating cash flow, and cash distributions received. We
rely on the cash flows from the distributions received on our ownership interests in ARP, AGP, and Lightfoot.
Upon confirmation and consummation of the Plan, our ownership interests in ARP will be cancelled. Specifically, we will no longer hold
common units, Class C preferred units or incentive distribution rights in ARP and will instead hold a 2% preferred economic interest in
ARP. If we are unable to receive sufficient distributions on our interest in ARP in the future (together with our interests in AGP and
Lightfoot), we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness.
In addition, the significant risks and uncertainties related to ARP’s Chapter 11 cases raise substantial doubt about ARP’s and our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis of
accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the
normal course of business. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of the going concern uncertainty. If we and ARP cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and
classification of our and ARP’s assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be
material.
Unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income, including their share of ordinary income and capital gain upon
dispositions of properties by us or ARP or cancellation of our or ARP’s debt, even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. A
unitholder’s share of our taxable income, gain, loss and deduction, or specific items thereof, may be substantially different than the
unitholder’s interest in our economic profits.
Our unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable
income, whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to
their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income.
For example, ARP has repurchased approximately $20.3 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes and approximately $12.1 million of our 9.25%
Senior Notes at prices lower than face amount. In addition, ARP will recognize cancellation of indebtedness (“COD”) income and other
amounts of income as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Plan, which could be substantial. These transactions will, and
other similar transactions in the future may, result in COD income that will be allocated to our unitholders. Some or all of our unitholders
may be allocated substantial amounts of such taxable income, and income tax liabilities arising therefrom may exceed cash distributions.
The ultimate effect to each unitholder would depend on the unitholder’s individual tax position with respect to the units; however, taxable
income allocations from us, including COD income, increase a unitholder’s tax basis in their units.
In addition, we and our subsidiaries may sell a portion of our properties and use the proceeds to pay down debt or acquire other
properties rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders, and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable
income with respect to that sale. A unitholder’s share of our taxable income upon a disposition of property by us may be ordinary income
or capital gain or some combination thereof. Even where we dispose of properties that are capital assets, what otherwise would be
capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in order to “recapture” ordinary deductions that were previously allocated to that
unitholder related to the same property.
A unitholder’s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof) may be substantially greater than, or our tax losses and
deductions (or specific items thereof) may be substantially less than, the unitholder’s interest in our economic profits. This may occur, for
example, in the case of a unitholder who purchases units at a time when the value of our units or of one or more of our properties is
relatively low or a unitholder who acquires units directly from us in exchange for property whose fair market value exceeds its tax basis at
the time of the exchange. Cash distributions from us decrease a unitholder’s tax basis in its units, and the amount, if any, of excess
distributions over a unitholder’s tax basis in its units will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder, above and beyond the
unitholder’s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof).
ITEM 3: DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
On June 16, 2016, our Board of Directors elected to suspend ARP’s 8.625% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units
and ARP’s 10.75% Class E Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units distributions, beginning with the second quarter 2016
distribution, due to the continued lower commodity price environment.
68
As of July 15, 2016, the cumulative unpaid dividends on ARP’s 8.625% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units and
ARP’s 10.75% Class E Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units, were $2.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated its obligations under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility and as a
result, we classified $669.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under ARP’s First Lien Credit Facility as current portion of long-term
debt within our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated its obligations under ARP’s Second Lien Term Loan and as a
result, we classified $244.5 million of ARP’s outstanding amounts under ARP’s Second Lien Term Loan, which is net of $5.5 million
unamortized discount and $9.4 million deferred financing costs, as current portion of long-term debt within our condensed combined
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings constituted an event of default that accelerated ARP’s obligations under ARP’s 7.75% Senior Notes and ARP’s
9.25% Senior Notes and as a result, we classified $354.4 million of our outstanding amounts under ARP’s 7.75% Senior Notes, which is
net of $0.3 million unamortized discount and $9.5 million deferred financing costs, and $312.1 million of our outstanding amounts under
ARP’s 9.25% Senior Notes, which is net of $0.8 million unamortized discount and $8.3 million deferred financing costs, as current portion
of long-term debt within our condensed combined consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Any efforts to enforce these payments are automatically stayed as a result of ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings, and the holders’ rights of
enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of Chapter 11.
An event of default occurred under ARP’s secured hedging facility agreement upon ARP’s filing of voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11.  The lenders under ARP’s secured hedge facility agreed to forbear from exercising remedies in respect of such event of
default while ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings are pending and, upon occurrence of the effective date of the Plan contemplated by the
Restructuring Support Agreement, such event of default will no longer be deemed to exist or to continue under ARP’s secured hedge
facility.
