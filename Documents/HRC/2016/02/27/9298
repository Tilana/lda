<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In the present report, prepared pursuant to Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/38 and decision 1/102 of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression presents and analyses information on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression from United Nations 
sources, high-ranking national officials and institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
individuals, gathered during his visit to Azerbaijan from 24 to 27 April 2007. 
 Azerbaijan has always been at the crossroads of different cultures and ethnic groups. The 
dissolution of the Soviet Union and the ensuing independence of Azerbaijan have given a new 
impetus to the country, which is struggling to establish and consolidate democratic structures, 
develop civil society and ensure steady economic growth. 
</p>
<p> During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of Azerbaijan, 
Ilham Aliyev, with senior State and Government officials, as well as with representatives of 
the media, trade unions and members of civil society. He also had an exchange of views with 
members of the diplomatic corps and senior officials of international organizations. 
</p>
<p> The media environment is marked by various problems. According to information 
gathered by the Special Rapporteur, current laws concerning defamation, libel and insult are 
not in line with the increasing trend towards decriminalization of related offences, and courts 
tend to be particularly severe in judging journalists and other media professionals who have 
sometimes been victims of repression, including violence and persecution, by law enforcement 
officials. 
</p>
<p> Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged by his meetings with Government 
and State representatives and hopes that executive measures will be taken promptly to appraise 
national policies, especially the action of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For its part, the 
Ministry of Justice should review several court decisions, which have created a widespread 
sense of fear and self-censorship among journalists, thus diminishing their editorial freedom. A 
swift revision of the current legislation on the media to make it fully compatible with 
international standards would be a first step forward. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, the communications market seems to be seriously underdeveloped for various 
reasons. At the regional level, the presence of large media companies in neighbouring 
countries does not encourage fresh financial investments, which could strengthen media 
representation and capacities. Without an adequate increase in economic resources, the 
development of professional capacities of media representatives, especially training on human 
rights and professional ethics, is unlikely. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is a full report of the mission of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, 
to Azerbaijan, made from 24 to 27 April 2007 at the invitation of the Government. The 
document contains information and opinions from various sources, received by the Special 
Rapporteur prior to, during and following his visit to the country. 
</p>
<p>2. The contents of the present document refer to the situation prevailing in Azerbaijan at the 
time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that his mandate does 
not concern exclusively the right to the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and 
expression of the media, but also all forms of opinion and expression as exercised by citizens, 
groups and associations regarding civil, political, social, economic and cultural matters. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to mention that, in the preparation of his mission and 
his report, he consulted material from United Nations sources, particularly the concluding 
observations of the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/CO/73/AZE) of November 2001 
adopted upon the consideration of the initial report submitted by Azerbaijan; the concluding 
observations of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/1/Add.104) of 
December 2004; and those of the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/CR/30/1) of May 2003. 
The Special Rapporteur also took note of the core document for use by the treaty bodies 
(HRI/CORE/1/Add.117) of 27 February 2002, submitted by the Government of Azerbaijan. 
</p><p>4. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the President of Azerbaijan, 
Ilham Aliyev, with senior State and Government officials, as well as with representatives of 
the media, trade unions, non-governmental organizations working in the field of human rights 
and members of civil society. He also had an exchange of views with members of the 
diplomatic corps and senior officials of international organizations. 
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur attended a meeting entitled &#8220;Role of the media in 
the development of tolerance and mutual understanding&#8221;, organized by the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference, on 28 April, in Baku. In his address, the Special Rapporteur brought to the 
attention of the audience a number of issues he considered crucial for the development of 
harmonious, multicultural societies in which the right to free speech and editorial freedom are 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>6. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
maintains a presence in Azerbaijan in the framework of its &#8220;Regional Office for South 
Caucasus&#8221; project under the supervision of a senior human rights adviser based in Tbilisi. Its 
main activities include advisory support for Governments through training sessions and technical 
advice, in particular in the area of the administration of justice, freedom of expression and 
vulnerable groups, with an aim to strengthening national and local capacities to translate 
obligations under international human rights instruments into effective laws, regulations and 
policies. Furthermore, OHCHR focuses on increasing the awareness and understanding of 
recommendations and concluding observations of treaty bodies and special procedure 
mechanisms through training activities on the effective implementation of recommendations. It 
conducts human rights education programmes and disseminates OHCHR material in local and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>United Nations official languages. Another key priority is the engagement of United Nations 
country teams in the region to incorporate human rights-based approaches in their policy and 
programming work. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of Azerbaijan for its openness, 
which allowed him to carry out his mission in an effective way. The Special Rapporteur would 
also like to express his gratitude to all national and international figures, institutions, members of 
the media, trade unions, non-governmental organizations and individuals with whom he met and 
had a comprehensive exchange of opinions and information. Moreover, he wishes to thank the 
United Nations Office in Azerbaijan for its valuable support and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  BACKGROUND 
</b></p>
<p>8. Following its official proclamation of national sovereignty in 1989, Azerbaijan 
became independent in October 1991 amidst internal tensions and mounting ethnic strife 
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, which would develop into full-scale war over the 
Nagorny Karabakh region in 1992. Heydar Aliyev won the presidential elections in 1993; his son 
Ilham Aliyev became president after a landslide victory in an election held in October 2003. The 
country&#8217;s first Parliament, elected in 1995, replaced the temporary Melli-Majlis legislative rule. 
</p><p>9. Since independence, the main sources of instability have been the domestic political 
situation and the conflict over the Nagorny Karabakh region. While the political situation 
appears more stable nowadays, a solution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict is still pending in 
spite of long-running and continuing efforts to find a lasting peace and a future for almost 
one million internally displaced Azerbaijanis. The country is suffering from a number of 
problems typical of democracies in transition, such as the low level of implementation of judicial 
reforms with a view to promote the rule of law and human rights. Rapid economic development, 
linked to oil resources, needs to be consolidated through reinvestment in economic, social and 
cultural fields in order to develop a fully thriving society. 
</p>
<p>10. It is worth noting that both the 2003 presidential elections and the 2005 parliamentary 
elections raised concerns at the international level regarding their fairness and impartiality. The 
ruling party of President Aliyev, the Yeni Azerbaijan Party, held the majority in the electoral 
commissions and was strongly sponsored through State media, while the time allotted to 
opposition parties was reportedly inferior. The parliamentary elections of November 2005 saw 
some improvements: a decree by President Aliyev in May 2005, calling for a democratic 
electoral process exempt from unlawful political interference, was welcomed by the international 
community as a step towards free and impartial elections. Nonetheless, mismanagement of 
voters&#8217; cards, the arrests of several opposition members and bans on demonstrations before the 
electoral round showed that Azerbaijan did not meet the requirements in the organization of free 
and democratic elections. 
</p>
<p>11. Furthermore, in 2005, the atmosphere in the national media was particularly tense owing to 
the killing, in March, of one of the most prominent journalists in the country, Elmar Huseynov, 
who was shot dead close by his apartment in Baku. Mr. Huseynov was renowned for a number of 
inquiries published by his magazine, <i>Monitor</i>, which shut down after his murder. Despite 
international pressure to find a satisfactory outcome to the inquiry into Mr. Huseynov&#8217;s murder, 
circumstances surrounding that crime remain unclear. </p>

</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the significant role played by the Representative on 
Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), 
whose report of July 2005 on his visit to Azerbaijan contained an excellent analysis of the 
shortcomings in the exercise of media freedom, as well as a number of valuable 
recommendations, which need further attention from relevant national authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Constitution of Azerbaijan came into force on 27 November 1995. It created a 
presidential republic with separation of powers among the legislative, executive and judicial 
branches, providing a legal basis for the domestic implementation of international law in general 
and international human rights law in particular. International treaties were recognized as a 
constituent part of the internal legal system and given a higher hierarchical status in the event of 
conflict with a national law (art. 151). Article 12 (II) of the Constitution empowers domestic 
courts to apply international human rights treaties to which Azerbaijan is party, an engagement 
that needs to be corroborated and developed by a vast judicial practice, particularly by the 
jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. The natural limitation to the 
application of international law is that it may not contravene the Constitution and laws adopted 
by referendum (art. 151). 
</p>
<p>14. The Constitution of Azerbaijan guarantees a broad range of political, civil, social, 
economic and cultural rights, as well as the rights of national minorities. It guarantees freedom of 
speech and of the press, and specifically bars media censorship, a matter that is also subject to 
article 7 of the Law on Mass Media. Of specific relevance are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 47, Freedom of Thought and Speech, which states that everyone may enjoy 
freedom of thought and speech; nobody should be forced to promulgate his or her 
thoughts and convictions or to renounce his or her thoughts and convictions; 
propaganda provoking racial, national, religious and social discord and animosity is 
prohibited; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 48, Freedom of Conscience, which states that everyone enjoys freedom of 
conscience; everyone has the right to define his or her attitude to religion, to profess, 
individually or together with others, any religion or to profess no religion, to express 
and spread one&#8217;s beliefs concerning religion; everyone is free to carry out religious 
rituals, however this should not violate public order and contradict public morals; 
religious beliefs and convictions do not excuse infringement of the law; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 49, Freedom of Gatherings, which states that everyone has the right to meetings; 
everyone has the right, having notified respective governmental bodies in advance, 
peacefully and without arms, to meet with other people, organize meetings, 
demonstrations, processions and place pickets; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Article 50, Freedom of Information, which states that everyone is free to seek, acquire, 
transfer, prepare and distribute information; freedom of mass media is guaranteed; State 
censorship in mass media, including the press, is prohibited. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>15. The Law on Mass Media, adopted on 7 December 1999 and signed into effect by the 
President on 8 February 2000, includes general rules for the preparation, production and 
dissemination of mass information within the country, and sets ground rules for the activities of 
the press, news agencies and television and radio enterprises. While article 1 declares that mass 
information is free and that the State is engaged in ensuring that citizens can enjoy the right to 
free information, article 5 defines the legislative safeguards of the information sphere, namely 
the Constitution and other instruments in addition to the Law on Mass Media and other 
appropriate acts. Article 7 prohibits censorship; article 8 defines mass media prerogatives, 
including a number of provisions regulating the right of journalists to receive information. 
Article 14 states that no prior agreement is required when requesting permission for printing or 
broadcasting. Lastly, article 59 forbids any interference by national bodies and institutions, 
private and public associations in the right to seek and distribute information. 
</p>
<p>16. The Law on Mass Media also includes provisions, such as article 10, which limit media 
freedom through the enumeration of a number of issues that cannot be properly investigated by 
media professionals. By doing so, media professionals could automatically be accused of 
violating the Law, especially when dealing with information involving broad concepts such as 
attempts on the integrity of the State or humiliating the honour and dignity of citizens, which can 
have a broad legal application. While the Law has been seen as an improvement, it is widely 
thought that it still does not meet accepted international standards and that it should be 
re-examined and amended and its implementation reinforced. Likewise, article 11 prohibits the 
publication of information in the following cases: (a) information provided to a journalist on the 
condition of confidentiality; (b) information allowing the source of the information to be 
identified if the informant has stipulated that he or she should not be identified; (c) preliminary 
investigations and inquiry secrets, without the permission of the investigator, prosecutor or the 
person conducting the inquiry; (d) information about the identity of a minor accused of 
committing a crime, without his or her permission or without the permission of his or her legal 
representative. Moreover, under this article, a journalist may, by court ruling, be compelled to 
reveal his or her sources in order to: (a) protect human life; (b) prevent a serious crime; 
(c) protect a person accused of committing a serious crime. Lastly, it is interesting to note that 
the provisions of the Law on Mass Media are also applicable to Internet media companies, 
professionals and bloggers. 
</p>
<p>17. The Statute on Television and Radio Broadcasting was adopted in June 2002 with the aim 
of providing a framework for the activities of State, public service, municipal and private 
broadcasting. In article 9 of that law, general principles concerning the functioning of a public 
service broadcaster are laid down, a matter that will be dealt with in a subsequent law, as 
explained in another part of the present report. In October 2002, President Aliyev also signed a 
decree on the creation of a national television and radio council, a body responsible for, 
inter alia, the issuance of broadcasting licences to television and radio channels, the monitoring 
of their activity and the protection of the interests of the audience. Six of its nine members were 
to be appointed by the President of Azerbaijan. 
</p><p>18. On 24 August 2002, an attempt was made to amend, by Presidential Decree, the 1998 Law 
on State Secrets, in order to strengthen provisions requiring journalists to submit articles 
containing information on State secrets to a commission for review prior to publication, and </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>requiring them to disclose their sources in such cases. Journalists protested and foreign 
embassies and international organizations also expressed concerns. In September 2002, the 
Government amended the law so that it no longer required journalists to reveal their sources.<b>1</b> 
19. The Law on Public Television and Radio Broadcasting was adopted by the Parliament 
on 11 September 2004 and endorsed by the President on 29 September. The Government 
informed the Special Rapporteur that a number of international experts, including representatives 
of OSCE, the Council of Europe and local organizations, participated in its drafting. The 
Government further emphasized that according to findings of a monitoring study conducted by 
the British Broadcasting Council, public television was in line with the relevant international 
standards, particularly the principles of transparency and independence. 
</p>
<p>20. The Law on Public Television and Radio Broadcasting was widely criticized by various 
interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur with regard to the creation of an independent public 
service and the control the Government could in principle exercise over it. In particular, the law 
was criticized for failing to create a clear mechanism for the transformation of a State into public 
service broadcaster and hampering, in article 21, the independence of the Broadcasting Council, 
as its appointment would fall under the President&#8217;s prerogatives. Furthermore, the law did not 
specify who would actually govern the public broadcaster, given that the role of Director General 
of the management board appears severely diminished by the provisions contained in 
article 25.3. Article 29 also raised much controversy, as it states that the legal supervision of 
activities of the public broadcaster are to be exercised by the relevant State authority, which can 
be interpreted in various ways, including political interference. 
</p>
<p>21. Through the Law on the Acquisition of Information, adopted in 2005, a citizen can have 
access to or demand information from governmental bodies. Article 40 of the law defines a 
classification period for official and personal information, respectively of 5 and 75 years. 
Freedom of information is further regulated under article 3.6 of the Constitutional Law on 
Regulating the Exercise of Human Rights and Freedoms, which requires the intervention of 
Parliament with an appropriate legislative mechanism. In particular, article 284 of the Criminal 
Code envisages criminal sanctions for the disclosure of State secrets, while article 189.0.1 of the 
Code of Administrative Offences provides for sanctions on journalists for disclosing 
information, such as State secrets, information about private life and sensitive commercial 
information, if such disclosure is prohibited by law. 
</p>
<p>22. The Law on the Acquisition of Information, adopted in 1998, seems to widen the scope of 
the Law on Information, Information Technology and Protection of Information. The Law could 
be considered a first, raw attempt at legislating on the quick progress of an information society 
based on new technological tools. 
</p>
<p>23. The Office of the Human Rights Commissioner (ombudsperson) of Azerbaijan was 
established in 2001. According to article 2.1 of the Constitutional Law of 28 December 2001 
establishing that Office, the Commissioner is to be elected by an 83-vote majority of the 
125-member Parliament (Milli Mejlis) from three candidates nominated by the President of the

</p>
<p>Republic. The elected commissioner, who has a non-renewable mandate of seven years, holds 
ample powers and prerogatives - with the exception of investigations into the executive, the 
legislative and the judicial authorities - especially in the submission of motions for pardon and 
amnesty, and in examining complaints concerning the administration of justice.  
</p><p>24. Elmira Suleimanova, who was elected first commissioner in July 2002, stated that her 
Office was focusing on legislative reforms of economic, social and cultural rights, and on 
compliance of national legislation with international standards in the framework of a national 
plan on human rights. The Office, within its ample mandate, also possesses a system of 
complaints, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitutional Law, that deals with 
cases submitted by various categories of complainants, from asylum-seekers to media 
professionals. Her Office, Ms. Suleimanova added, had been campaigning, in partnership with its 
main counterpart, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, against daily violence, including violent 
behaviour of law enforcement officials.  
</p>
<p>25. In November 2001, when examining the second report of Azerbaijan on its implementation 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee, in its concluding observations, expressed its concern at reported obstacles imposed 
on the registration and free operation of non-governmental human rights organizations and 
political parties. The Committee urged the State party to take all necessary steps to allow 
national non-governmental organizations to function without hindrance. With regard to political 
parties, the Committee urged the State party to take all necessary measures to ensure that 
registration was not used to silence political movements opposed to the Government and to limit 
the rights of association guaranteed by the Covenant.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>26. In May 2003, the Committee against Torture recommended, inter alia, that the State party 
ensure: the independence of the judiciary, in accordance with the basic principles on the 
independence of the judiciary; the prompt creation of a new bar association and take measures to 
guarantee an adequate number of qualified and independent lawyers are able to act in criminal 
cases; the full independence of the ombudsman; the full protection of non-governmental human 
rights defenders and organizations.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  SITUATION OF THE MEDIA IN AZERBAIJAN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  General overview 
</b></p>
<p>27. The creation of the Press Council on 15 March 2003, at the first congress of Azerbaijani 
journalists, represented a step forward in the reinforcement of media freedom in Azerbaijan. The 
Council was set up as a body to perform regulatory functions between the media and society, 
engaging in close cooperation with the authorities as a means to solve media-related problems.  
</p>
<p>

<p>para. 7. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>28. Nonetheless, the birth of the Council was marred by vivid polemics among the journalists 
themselves: a part of the category (representing six publications: <i>Hurriyet</i>, <i>Novoe Vremya</i>, 
<i>Jumhurriyet</i>, <i>Veten</i>, <i>Uch Nogte</i> and <i>Ganun</i>) boycotted the event, accusing the Government of 
being behind the election of the Council&#8217;s members; the Government strenuously denied any 
involvement, pointing out that the creation of the Press Council was a positive step forward for 
freedom of expression in Azerbaijan.<b>4</b> The Council mainly serves to solve conflicts between the 
media and individuals and private companies, monitors publications and implements the 
provisions of the journalists&#8217; code of ethics, elaborated and adopted by the Press Council itself, 
and are aimed at helping journalists to be more impartial and more aware of their important 
function in the society at large.  
</p>
<p>29. According to its chairman Aflatun Amasov, the Council receives on 
average 800 complaints a year, 100 of which are related to the impossibility of obtaining 
information from primary sources and to the refusal of admission to journalists to various events. 
In order to facilitate the exchange of information between independent media and State press 
departments, the Council has called for the establishment of unified regulations for all State-run 
press services and for the improvement of the quality of the information provided, a suggestion 
endorsed by the Government. Despite its crucial role, the Council operates in very difficult 
economic conditions and the payment of its employees&#8217; salaries is apparently ensured by a 
private foreign fund.  
</p>
<p>30. One initiative of the Press Council, in collaboration with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
was the creation of a &#8220;press vest&#8221; that media professionals are required to wear during 
demonstrations in order to make sure that they can be distinguished from ordinary 
demonstrators, especially if the event turns violent. This initiative came as a result of complaints 
of some 70 journalists to the Press Council of mistreatment by police after the elections in 2003. 
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has distributed the vests to the Press Council and to media 
workers, but it is not clear whether there is a record of the number of vests and to whom they 
correspond. However, the Special Rapporteur was provided evidence that media professionals 
were treated violently even when they wore the vest. 
</p>
<p>31. The Press Council came under criticism for its inactivity and for failing to create a bridge 
between the Government and the media, being thus unable to settle conflicts between authorities 
and journalists. Generally speaking, journalists found little support from the Press Council, 
which was considered not very active and too acquiescent with State institutions. Beyond the 
continuing phenomenon of violence against journalists, the Council was unable to intervene in 
the case of the eviction of an opposition newspaper from a Government building in late 2006. 
The Council Chairman stated that it was unconditionally against any abuse and violence against 
media professionals, whose independence was linked to economic factors. He also pointed out 
that, besides the Council, some other 50 journalist unions existed in the country.  
</p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>32. According to information received from the Government after the mission, in 2007, the 
Press Council was provided with premises in a central part of the city, as well as the necessary 
equipment and means of functioning. The Government was also responsible for securing the 
salaries of the management and technical personnel of the Council.  
</p>
<p>33. The Press Council expressed great concern at the state of the financial situation of the 
media at large. The Council considered that large investments by private companies and State 
subsidies for the media from all political orientations were two complex yet indispensable 
developments to guarantee the survival of the media in the country, while initiatives to increase 
the supply of advertising and its exemption from taxes were two parallel steps that the 
Government could take in order to make the media environment more palatable to private 
investors.  
</p>
<p>34. In their meeting with the mission delegation, several journalists and editors expressed their 
dismay at the ongoing atmosphere of intimidation and violence towards the media and the high 
number of defamation trials against media representatives. With regard to the former, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs was criticized for failing to solve the most serious cases of recent 
years and for lacking control over demonstrations, in which media professionals and protesters 
were beaten and abused by the police. Furthermore, it was stated that acts of violence could also 
be committed against journalists traditionally regarded as close to the Government whenever 
they interfere with major business interests. In relation to television broadcasting, media 
representatives criticized the strict application of rules for obtaining broadcasting licences and 
that the advertising market appeared to be in the hands of the Government. Lastly, journalists 
and editors remarked that, in spite of the country&#8217;s impressive economic growth, the information 
market was depressed owing to the lack of financial investments and the consequent low 
revenues of professionals, another element that was seriously jeopardizing the independence of 
the media and the degree of pluralism. It was added that the press was at a great disadvantage; 
even the relatively low price of daily newspapers was a prohibitive expense for most 
Azerbaijanis, who increasingly rely on television and radio as their primary sources of news and 
information, while the biggest newspaper had a circulation of only 15,000 copies. It was noted 
that, in order to survive, newspapers have to find powerful sponsors and align themselves with 
political parties, thus sacrificing their editorial independence. Despite these constraints, about 
600 newspapers are registered in Azerbaijan; nearly 100 are published at least once a month. 
Moreover, recent statistical data provided by the Government certify the registration 
of 2,678 mass-media outlets throughout the country.  
</p>
<p>35. Other journalists stated that the country&#8217;s media panorama was rapidly evolving together 
with an adequate body of laws, although a change in the behaviour of law enforcement agencies, 
in particular at lower levels of authority, could take longer. The Director General of the public 
television channel ITV, which commenced broadcasting on 29 August 2005, explained that the 
very articulated political scene puts great pressure on independent journalism because it was 
objectively difficult to satisfy all requests made by some 53 political parties. In his opinion, ITV 
managed to maintain good relations with governmental parties and opposition forces, but 
complaints from both sides about alleged partiality, often amplified by the opposition media, 
were numerous. In such a context, ITV preferred to give priority to professional standards and 
the development of contacts with foreign broadcasting companies, which have provided 
technical and substantive assistance, such as free access to some of their archives.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>36. Government representatives also underlined that they regarded the defence of the freedom 
of expression as a priority and that many journalists in conflict with the Government and law 
enforcement agencies were not politically independent because they worked in opposition 
parties, often with important roles. Allegations of violations of freedom of expression were used 
as a political tool in the framework of larger political strategies. In their opinion, the influence of 
political parties was clearly reflected by the financial resources invested in a number of 
newspapers, which could not survive on their income alone. The enlargement of the 
communications market, economically solid investors and adequate training for journalists could 
greatly help to improve media freedom. Other governmental sources added that President Aliyev 
had intervened in favour of the press by means of an executive order on paying off newspaper 
debts to publishing houses, issued on 8 February 2006. Pursuant to that order, debts of 
newspapers, including leading opposition newspapers, amounting to $450,000 were paid by the 
State budget.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also received information concerning the initiative of 
some 20 Azerbaijan journalists, mainly working for <i>Gundalik Azarbaycan</i> and 
<i>Realnyy Azerbaydzhan</i>, who decided to seek political asylum in various West European countries 
at the end of May 2007, on the grounds of lack of security to carry out their professional 
activities and of the persecution by State authorities. The offices of the two newspapers were 
closed for alleged fire-safety violations before the owner of the building decided, on 
26 May 2007, to rescind the lease with immediate effect. The journalists also protested about the 
arrest of <i>Gundalik Azarbaycan </i>founder Eynulla Fatullayev and the attack against the newspaper 
editor, Uzeyir Jafarov (see paragraph 43 below).  
</p>
<p>38. At the time of writing, in Azerbaijan, there were 7 national, 12 regional and 11 cable 
television channels. Two foreign television channels and five radio stations also operate in the 
country. In spite of the existence of adequate legislative provisions, no new licences were issued 
to private television channels until 2005, and the privatization of the State broadcasting company 
AzTV Channel 2 (now known as ITV) left AzTV Channel 1 under governmental control. With 
regard to the press, around 100 outlets had regular publications. According to information 
received from the Government, they had an overall circulation of some 40 million copies 
per year. Regarding the new media, Azerbaijan currently counts on some 900,000 Internet users 
and has 5,409 registered web domains.  
</p>
<p>39. The mission delegation also met a group of female journalists and academics, who felt that, 
despite the increasing number of women working in the information market, their role was 
severely underestimated and relegated to marginal posts, most often in opposition papers. More 
integration and a general upgrading of women&#8217;s roles, also in the academic environment, were 
expected.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Defamation  
</b></p>
<p>40. One of the main factors that restricts the freedom of the press and which shows the 
extent of hostility towards the media, especially towards those linked to opposition parties, is 
the use of criminal libel suits by government officials. Articles on cases of alleged corruption 
and other material critical of official misconduct often fall under articles 147 (&#8220;Slander&#8221;) </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>and 148 (&#8220;Insult&#8221;) of the Criminal Code.<b>5</b> Citizens convicted following the application of these 
articles can be sentenced to both the payment of heavy fines and prison terms. Following 
consideration, in November 2001, of the second report of Azerbaijan on its implementation of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee expressed its concern at the extensive limitations on the right to freedom of 
expression of the media. While noting the explanations given by the delegation with regard to 
that issue, the Committee remained concerned at reports of harassment and criminal libel suits 
used to silence journalists critical of the Government or public officials, as well as the closure of 
print media outlets and the imposition of heavy fines, aimed at undermining freedom of 
expression.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>41. Many media professionals expressed their concern at the current legislation on defamation 
and the extensive use of jail sentences by the judiciary, which had a chilling effect on media 
freedom at large. When meeting with the mission delegation, a number of journalists stated that 
they had been sentenced to long prison terms or to paying heavy fines at the end of defamation 
trials.  
</p>
<p>42. In the wake of the killing, in March 2005, of journalist Elmar Huseynov, who had often 
been on trial on defamation charges, President Aliyev called on government officials to not file 
lawsuits against the media, establishing a de facto moratorium on libel cases. Unfortunately, the 
moratorium was never made law and President Aliyev has apparently been the only government 
official to respect the moratorium.<b>7</b> In 2006, several publications were still the target of criminal 
defamation suits by government officials and other prominent figures. It has been reported that, 
in 2006, the newspaper <i>Azadliq</i> was fined approximately $300,000 on charges of libel and of 
having insulted the reputation and dignity of government officials a dozen times, while a number 
of journalists served prison sentences. Shahin Agabayli, editor-in-chief of <i>Milli Yol</i>, was 
imprisoned and subsequently pardoned by President Aliyev; Serdar Alibeyli, whom the Special 
Rapporteur met, and Faramaz Novruzoglu, editor-in-chief and reporter of the weekly <i>Nota Bene</i>, 
were respectively sentenced to 18 months and two years on charges of defamation of the 
Minister for Internal Affairs. Samir Sadagatoglu, editor of the weekly<i> Sanat</i>, was arrested for 
publishing an article on Islam in November 2006 and detained for three months.  
</p>
<p>43. More recent cases of journalists convicted on charges of defamation regard 
Eynulla Fatullayev, founder and editor of<i> Gundalik Azarbaycan</i> and <i>Realnyy Azerbaydzhan</i>, and 
Rovshan Kebirli and Yashan Agazadeh of the newspaper <i>Muhalifet</i>. On 20 April 2007,

</p>
<p>Fatullayev was sentenced to two and half years in prison for an article on a website, in which he 
criticized Azerbaijani authorities and the army in connection with the massacre of Khojaly in 
February 1992, alleging that they had failed to protect Khojaly residents from the attack of 
Armenian forces. Fatullayev denied posting the article and stated that his trial was linked to 
another article he had published in 2005 in <i>Monitor</i>, the newspaper of the late Elmar Huseynov. 
For the same incident, Fatullayev was also fined approximately $12,000, in a civil suit brought 
against him by the Azerbaijan Centre for Refugees and Displaced Persons. Furthermore, the 
premises of <i>Gundalik Azarbaycan</i> and <i>Realnyy Azerbaydzhan</i> were closed down by the 
authorities on 22 May. It is worth noting that Mr. Fatullayev&#8217;s deputy, Uzeir Jafarov, was 
assaulted and seriously injured by unknown individuals a few hours after he had testified in 
favour of Mr. Fatullayev. It should be recalled that, in autumn 2006, Mr. Fatullayev&#8217;s father was 
kidnapped and released after his son temporarily stopped his publications.  
</p>
<p>44. On 16 May 2007, Rovshan Kebirli and Yashar Agazadeh were sentenced to two and half 
years in prison for defaming a relative of President Aliyev who, in their opinion, had exploited 
family connections for his business activities. The Special Rapporteur asked the Azerbaijani 
authorities to reconsider these two cases and to release Fatullayev, Kebirli and Agazadeh 
immediately.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>45. On 4 May 2006, <i>Sanat</i> reporter Rafik Taghi and editor Samir Sadatoglu were sentenced, 
under article 283.1 of the Criminal Code, to three and four years of prison respectively on 
charges by the office of the General Prosecutor for &#8220;inciting racial, national and religious 
hatred&#8221;. In 2006, <i>Sanat</i> published an article containing a comparison of religious values and their 
modernity. The proceedings of their trial were biased by the presence in the Court of numerous 
religious activists who threatened the defendants and their colleagues covering the event. 
Nonetheless, on 6 July 2007, the Appellate Court of Baku decided to uphold the original verdict. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur regrets to note that, at the time of writing, a number of media 
professionals were being detained, mainly following defamation trials. The case of 
Sakit Zahidov case is particularly indicative of the prevailing atmosphere in the political debate. 
Mr. Zahidov, also known as Mirza Sakit, a journalist and satirist for <i>Azadliq</i>, was arrested in 
June 2006, on the charge of &#8220;possession of illegal narcotics with intent to distribute&#8221;, and 
eventually sentenced, on 4 October 2006 to three years&#8217; imprisonment by a Baku court on the 
charge of &#8220;possession of drugs for the purpose of personal consumption&#8221;. Reportedly, the 
journalist&#8217;s trial fell short of recognized international standards and was marred by several 
irregularities. Nonetheless, Mr. Zahidov had his appeal rejected in December 2006 and was 
transferred to the prison facility at Qobustan, notorious for its harsh detention conditions. On 
23 April 2007, Mr. Zahidov was transferred to the penitentiary system central hospital in Baku 
because of serious health problems.

<p>47. High-ranking officials of the Government denied all allegations of persecution of the 
media. They affirmed that the systematic use of defamation and slander was perpetrated by a 
mere 10 to 15 per cent of journalists, who were apparently unable to perceive the difference 
between criticism and insults. The head of the presidential executive staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, 
stated that he believed that the articles of the Criminal Code on liability for insulting someone&#8217;s 
honour and dignity and for libel should remain in force for the time being. He also stated that 
media issues were too often politicized, while the real point was to understand to what extent 
media professionals intended respecting national laws. The same concepts were reiterated by 
Ali Hasanov, head of the Public and Political Department of the presidential executive staff, who 
added that the State protected the independence of the media; the reaction of international 
organizations to recent events was not appropriate, because freedom of expression was not in 
question, but the respect all citizens must pay to national laws. Recalling that censorship had 
been abolished by article 50 of the Constitution, Mr. Hasanov recalled that President Aliyev had 
often intervened in favour of media professionals, regardless of their political opinions, through 
the cancellation of fines and pardons.  
</p>
<p>48. When meeting with the Special Rapporteur, representatives of the office of the Prosecutor 
General stated that, taking into account the recent history of Azerbaijan, defamation of national 
symbols and similar offences were very sensitive issues and that the reform of the related articles 
of the Criminal Code was a complex matter, at the centre of discussions with international 
organizations. The recruitment of new judges, adequately trained with more progressive systems, 
could inject new blood into the administration of justice.  
</p><p>49. According to information sent by the Government after the mission, the issue of 
defamation and, in particular, the possibility of confining it to civil rather than criminal law was 
the subject of extensive discussions within the Government and society at large. In particular, the 
Government stated that the adoption of such measures was envisaged for the future and that it 
was already engaged in cooperation with OSCE, the Council of Europe and local 
non-governmental organizations to work on improving public-media relations and strengthen 
media professional standards. The Special Rapporteur noted this information with satisfaction, 
emphasizing that the abolishment of criminal defamation procedures against media professionals 
would be a major step in the direction of securing a free and independent press.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violence against media professionals 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur received consistent and detailed information from various sources 
concerning acts of violence, either perpetrated by law enforcement officials or by unknown 
persons, against journalists and other media workers. This worrying sequence of aggressions 
against media professionals and the lack of efficient and impartial investigations into them had a 
chilling effect on the freedom of expression in the country. The ensuing climate of impunity was 
reinforced by the fact that, in most cases, the identity of the assailants remained unknown, and as 
a result no one was ultimately brought to justice for these crimes. Also, cases of beating and 
harassment of journalists by law enforcement officials were not investigated in a comprehensive 
manner.  
</p>
<p>51. Violence against journalists seemed to rise during politically sensitive periods, such as 
election campaigns. This was the case in the period prior to the November 2005 parliamentary </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>elections, though the policy of wearing press jackets was already in place. According to 
information provided by the Press Council, at least 40 journalists were subjected to violence 
while fulfilling their professional duties in the most recent elections. 
</p>
<p>52. Representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said that the main priority of its action 
was the fight against new forms of entrenched criminal activities, such as drug trafficking. It was 
acknowledged that, occasionally, police officers resorted to the use of excessive force in dealing 
with public protests, however the Ministry was doing its best to modernize law enforcement 
attitudes, which were a legacy from the times of the Soviet Union. Significant progress had been 
made in establishing a real collaboration with all media and the phenomenon of mistreatment of 
journalists was closely monitored.  
</p><p>53. Following his meeting with the Minister for Internal Affairs, the Special Rapporteur 
received a 7-page unsigned and undated document containing names of alleged victims and 
perpetrators and the precise circumstances of numerous incidents mainly related to the elections 
of November 2005 from the Ministry. It also contained the results of a review, carried out by the 
Internal Investigations Department, relating to a number of reports of alleged human rights 
violations by the police. A total of 68 investigations, mainly linked to cases of alleged violations 
during the electoral period, were conducted in 2005 by the Department. Disciplinary proceedings 
were consequently brought against seven police officers: one was dismissed from service in the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs; one was demoted through the presentation of a &#8220;notification on 
incomplete qualification for the official post&#8221;; two policemen received a severe reprimand; and 
the remaining three a reprimand.  
</p>
<p>54. On 9 May 2007, subsequent to a specific oral request made by government representatives 
during his visit, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Permanent Mission of Azerbaijan at 
the United Nations Office in Geneva, in which he mentioned the names of 12 journalists whose 
human rights appeared to have been severely violated. The Special Rapporteur asked for a 
prompt re-examination of their judicial cases and the opportunity of financial compensation for 
those who had suffered permanent physical injury.  
55. In this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to raise again some of the cases he brought 
to the attention of the authorities of Azerbaijan and hopes that a positive conclusion can be found 
as soon as possible. In March 2005, Elmar H&#252;seynov, editor-in-chief of the weekly <i>Monitor</i>, was 
murdered by unidentified individuals as he was returning home to his apartment building in 
Baku. The trial of the main suspect in Mr. H&#252;seynov&#8217;s murder could shed light on the 
circumstances and the motives of this heinous crime, which are still unclear. However, in order 
to ensure the respect of the right to a fair trial and the search for truth, relevant authorities might 
consider opening a new investigation. 
</p>
<p>56. On 6 March 2006, Fikret H&#252;seynli, correspondent for <i>Azadliq</i>, whom the Special 
Rapporteur met personally, was abducted, beaten and left unconscious in the outskirts of Baku 
by unidentified men. Mr. H&#252;seynli had received hostile phone calls concerning articles he wrote 
about allegations of corruption of high-ranking officials and other prominent figures in the 
country. He survived the attack, but his physical condition is precarious and investigations into 
his case have brought no results.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>57. On 18 May 2006, Baxaddin Xaziyev, deputy chairman of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan 
and editor-in-chief of <i>Bizim Yol</i>, whom the Special Rapporteur met personally, was abducted and 
beaten by unidentified men in Baku. Mr. Xaziyev was seriously injured and suffered permanent 
injury to a leg, which was badly broken when his aggressors drove over it. After leaving the 
hospital, he went into hiding because of the risk of further attacks. His abduction might have 
been linked to a series of articles about corruption in the oil and fishing industries, in which 
several high-ranking officials were named. Despite the political and professional motives that 
could have been considered, the investigations focused solely on his private life and were 
inconclusive. 
</p>
<p>58. On 24 November 2006, special forces evicted <i>Azadliq</i>, the main opposition newspaper, 
from the premises it had occupied, free of charge, since 1992 on the basis of an agreement with 
the then-mayor of Baku. The eviction was made possible by a court decision which found that 
agreement illegal. The same day, the independent television channel ANS was closed down by 
the National Television and Radio Council on the grounds that the legislation relevant to the 
issuance of broadcasting licences had been violated. ANS recommenced its programmes three 
weeks later until it was granted a new licence on 27 April 2007.  
</p>
<p>59. On 24 December 2006, Ali Orucov, press secretary of the party Azerbaijan National 
Independence and contributor to the newspaper <i>Rating</i>, was assaulted. The next day, a journalist, 
Nijat Huseynov, working for <i>Azadliq</i>, was seriously injured by four assailants and hospitalized 
for three weeks. Reportedly, police questioned Mr. Huseynov about the attack and made a sketch 
of two of the assailants, but to no avail.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Independent countries emerging from the dissolution of the Soviet Union have been 
experiencing a period of transition marked by political instability and lack of consistent 
social growth. They have inherited a legacy of a powerful and centralized State that still 
influences the behaviour of some State institutions, particularly law enforcement and 
regulatory agencies, as well as the way relations between the State and the media are 
structured.</b>  
</p>
<p>61. <b>The unsettled conflict with Armenian forces over the Nagorny Karabakh region in 
the 1990s is still a burden for Azerbaijan and its people. The existence of almost a million 
internally displaced persons and significant material losses, including a large part of 
territory, are an open wound that may, at times, be used for political ends. Unfortunately, 
despite some recent efforts, conditions to achieve a peaceful solution of this conflict are still 
far from being achieved.</b>  
</p>
<p>62. <b>Owing to impressive economic growth, the present situation leaves the door open to 
rapid modernization, which should be followed by general social growth. Nonetheless, 
democracy cannot be consolidated without the free circulation of ideas and opinions 
ensured by an independent press and media. The public interest is best served by a variety 
of independent news media, both printed and broadcast, which must be allowed to emerge 
and operate freely. There is an undeniable need to promote the expression of a number of 
voices and opinions, still unheard, within Azerbaijani society. In addition, there is a need to </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b>encourage dialogue among the various business and social categories and interaction with 
political actors. Moreover, dialogue among media professionals and other intellectual 
categories with business stakeholders could pave the way to a greater understanding of 
their respective positions and expectations, thus ultimately contributing to the end of the 
current stalemate. </b> 
</p>
<p>63. <b>Freedom of expression begins at home, and the flow of news across national frontiers 
cannot be free if the flow of news within those frontiers is not free. Nor can there be any 
&#8220;national sovereignty&#8221; over news and opinion. Printed and broadcast media should have 
unrestricted access to foreign news and information services, and the public should enjoy 
similar freedom, without interference, to receive foreign publications and broadcasts. 
National frontiers must be open to foreign journalists, who should be allowed to travel 
freely throughout the country and have access to both official and unofficial news sources.</b> 
</p>
<p>64. <b>Journalists, editors and other media workers are often under varying degrees of 
pressure from those in key institutions, business lobbies and informal associations often 
acting in close cooperation. In this context, investigative journalism is facing obstacles, 
especially when it addresses sensitive topics. Correspondents in small towns are even more 
vulnerable; public authorities are often hostile and the civil society is still unable to react to 
abuses and provide protection. In order to avoid trouble and violent reactions, numerous 
media professionals may be forced to work on a sort of &#8220;stand-by&#8221; mode, limiting their 
activity to the coverage of statements, communiqu&#233;s and press conferences. Lack of 
independence of media professionals thus remains a serious obstacle to freedom of 
expression.</b> 
</p>
<p>65. <b>The media environment also suffers from poor financial investments; while national 
television channels and radios have their own audience, newspapers and other printed 
press are able to sell only a few thousand copies. Furthermore, the presence of large foreign 
media groups, in particular from Turkey and the Russian Federation, does not encourage 
the growth of national media outlets. On the one hand, the dominance of powerful media 
corporations, often linked to political and business elites, can restrain editorial 
independence, narrow diversity of opinion and entrench self-censorship. On the other, 
media enterprises need considerable financial investments to operate not only freely but 
also effectively; the real challenge consists in maintaining a distance between truly 
autonomous media professionals and media corporations, which, by definition, are bound 
to make financial benefits. In this panorama, the survival of the country&#8217;s rich and varied 
cultural heritage is at stake because of the prevalence of commercial programmes that 
prioritize economic return over quality information and other educational and 
socially-oriented initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>According to information gathered by the Special Rapporteur, some sectors of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and of the judiciary appear to exert considerable pressure on 
the media. In addition to cases of physical violence, the use of defamation trials severely 
penalized press and media freedom through the imposition of prison terms and heavy fines. 
Publishers, editors and journalists reported that they practised self-censorship owing to 
various pressures, including the threat of expensive libel suits. Accusations of defamation 
included denigration of national symbols, thus systematically reducing room for debate 
about foreign policy.  </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/7/14/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>67. <b>Bearing in mind the vital role played by the media in creating broad awareness of 
political, economic and social issues, the fact that many journalists go on trial for 
defamation charges remains totally unacceptable. Political and public figures continue to 
sue journalists, although they should, because of their institutional roles, be ready to accept 
criticism and public scrutiny to a greater extent than the ordinary citizen should.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Other categories, including trade unionists, writers, students and in general human 
rights defenders are also under severe stress; in an oppressing atmosphere of conformism, 
they are often depicted as traitors and proxies of hostile forces. For the purpose of 
guaranteeing pluralism, relevant authorities should make sure that both State and private 
media provide enough room for constructive debate and dialogue on sensitive issues, 
especially to those groups that rarely have the opportunity to express their opinions to a 
wide audience.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Training for media professionals could help improve the quality of information. 
Efforts should be made to increase human rights awareness and a culture of independence, 
openness and impartiality through an ethical approach to journalism. Such a step will not 
be possible without the financial support of the State, international organizations and 
private enterprises.  
</b></p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the United Nations, OSCE and other regional bodies 
to strengthen their efforts together with the concerned countries in order to find a fair and 
durable solution to the conflict in Nagorny Karabakh. The persistence of this conflict has a 
negative influence, at the national and regional levels, on the exercise and full enjoyment of 
freedom of expression, and in particular on freedom of movement.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Azerbaijan and other 
relevant institutions to consider repealing criminal legislation on defamation and similar 
offences, especially articles 147, 148 and 323 of the Criminal Code, with the purpose of 
including it, after an adequate process of revision, in civil law. The existence of an 
increasing body of law, at the regional and national levels, holding that criminal 
defamation laws per se are contrary to the right to freedom of expression, and the example 
provided by countries with a similar historical background, may help the relevant 
Azerbaijani institutions take such a decision. Civil defamation laws have proven adequate 
to protect reputations. These laws should include the principle that public figures should 
tolerate a greater degree of criticism than ordinary citizens, and that the analysis of 
historical events and national affairs cannot be considered an offence. New legislation will 
also ensure that fines are proportionate to the offence and do not suffocate media activity.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>State authorities should be encouraged to follow President Aliyev&#8217;s example and 
publicly declare their willingness to renounce legal means to respond to libel and 
defamation. Alternatively, President Aliyev, using his prerogatives and powers, and with 
the assistance of the Human Rights Commissioner, could decide to enforce an amnesty on 
sentences for libel and defamation, and a moratorium to be quickly converted into law.  </b></p>

<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Azerbaijan and relevant national 
bodies to regard action against impunity of crimes targeting media professionals and 
opinion makers as one of the main priorities of democratic evolution. In particular, the 
judiciary should ensure impartial, comprehensive investigations and judgements when law 
enforcement agencies appear to be involved in crimes against the exercise of freedom of 
expression and good governance.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Government should take immediate remedial measures, including financial 
compensation as appropriate, for all media professionals and opinion makers who are 
victims of violence, in particular whenever law enforcement officials appear to have been 
involved in these criminal acts.   
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the Government to consider appropriate legislation 
for the establishment of an independent national human rights commission, which would 
supplement the activities of the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner 
(ombudsperson), mainly in the effective implementation of the national plan for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, adopted in December 2006.   
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages all stakeholders involved in the exercise of 
freedom of opinion and expression to find fresh impetus in their work and to show genuine 
openness and commitment to dialogue with their counterparts. Relevant governmental 
authorities should speedily carry out human rights training programmes for the benefit of 
their officials and cadres, in order to bring their performance into line with the 
development of a true democratic State.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls for a general and broad revision of the laws on 
television and radio broadcasting. The speedy establishment of an appropriate legal and 
institutional framework to consider and issue licences to independent broadcasters should 
be seen as a priority. In this connection, the mandate of the National Television and Radio 
Council should be made more effective, and the council should be able to work 
independently. Likewise, the Press Council should be provided with additional human and 
material resources in order to increase its autonomy.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Parliament needs to legislate on specific and urgent measures for the promotion 
of the press, whose role, in a period of great technological revolution, remains fundamental 
for educational purposes, and especially for the development in its readership of a critical 
approach and analysis of information.   
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Through the support of international organizations, the establishment of a school of 
journalism could create a favourable environment for the development of journalism 
ethics. Professional training and financial investments, especially an increase in salaries, 
could help improve the moral stance of the press and the media industry. </b></p>
