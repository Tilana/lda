Notes to Financial Statements
1.   Organization
     Southwest  Oil & Gas Income Fund VIII-A, L.P. was organized under  the
     laws of the state of Delaware on November 30, 1987, for the purpose of
     acquiring  producing oil and gas properties and to produce and  market
     crude oil and natural gas produced from such properties for a term  of
     50  years, unless terminated at an earlier date as provided for in the
     Partnership  Agreement.   The  Partnership  sells  its  oil  and   gas
     production  to  a  variety of purchasers with the prices  it  receives
     being  dependent  upon the oil and gas economy.  Southwest  Royalties,
     Inc.  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary of Clayton Williams  Energy,  Inc.,
     serves  as the Managing General Partner.  Revenues, costs and expenses
     are allocated as follows:
                              Limited   General
                              Partners  Partners

the  Managing  General Partner an amount equal to 3%  of  initial
          capital contributions for such organization costs.
(2)Administrative costs in any year which exceed  2%  of  capital
          contributions shall be paid by the Managing General  Partner  and

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     The  interim financial information as of September 30, 2005,  and  for
     the  three  and  nine months ended September 30, 2005,  is  unaudited.
     Certain  information  and footnote disclosures  normally  included  in
     financial  statements prepared in accordance with  generally  accepted
     accounting principles have been condensed or omitted in this Form 10-Q
     pursuant  to the rules and regulations of the Securities and  Exchange
     Commission.  However,  in  the opinion of  management,  these  interim
     financial  statements include all the necessary adjustments to  fairly
     present  the  results of the interim periods and all such  adjustments
     are  of  a normal recurring nature. The interim consolidated financial
     statements should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's Annual
     Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004.
In September 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
     Accounting  Bulletin No. 106 ("SAB 106"). SAB 106  expresses  the  SEC
     staff's views regarding SFAS No. 143 and its impact on both the  full-
     cost  ceiling  test  and  the calculation of  depletion  expense.   In
     accordance  with  SAB  106, beginning in the first  quarter  of  2005,
     undiscounted abandonment costs for wells to be drilled in  the  future
     to develop proved reserves are included in the unamortized cost of oil
     and  gas  properties, net of related salvage value,  for  purposes  of
     computing  depreciation,  depletion  and  amortization  ("DD&A").  The
     implementation  of  SAB  106 did not have a  material  impact  on  our
     financial statements.

Item 2.   Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and
        Results of Operations
General
Southwest  Oil & Gas Income Fund VIII-A, L.P. was organized as  a  Delaware
limited  partnership  on November 30, 1987. The offering  of  such  limited
partnership interests began on March 31, 1988, minimum capital requirements
were  met  on July 6, 1988, and the offering concluded on March  31,  1989,
with total limited partner contributions of $6,798,000.
The  Partnership was formed to acquire interests in producing oil  and  gas
properties,  to produce and market crude oil and natural gas produced  from
such properties, and to distribute the net proceeds from operations to  the
limited  and  general partners.  Net revenues from producing  oil  and  gas
properties are not reinvested in other revenue producing assets  except  to
the extent that production facilities and wells are improved or reworked or
where methods are employed to improve or enable more efficient recovery  of
oil and gas reserves. The economic life of the Partnership thus depends  on
the   period  over  which  the  Partnership's  oil  and  gas  reserves  are
economically recoverable.
Increases   or   decreases   in  Partnership   revenues   and,   therefore,
distributions  to partners will depend primarily on changes in  the  prices
received  for production, changes in volumes of production sold,  increases
and  decreases  in  lease operating expenses, enhanced  recovery  projects,
offset  drilling  activities pursuant to farm-out  arrangements,  sales  of
properties,  and  the depletion of wells.  Since wells deplete  over  time,
production can generally be expected to decline from year to year.
Well  operating costs and general and administrative costs usually decrease
with   production   declines;  however,  these  costs  may   not   decrease
proportionately.  Net income available for distribution to the partners  is
therefore expected to fluctuate in later years based on these factors.
Oil and Gas Properties
Oil  and  gas  properties  are accounted for at cost  under  the  full-cost
method.  Under this method, all productive and nonproductive costs incurred
in  connection with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and
gas  reserves  are capitalized.  Gain or loss on the sale of  oil  and  gas
properties  is not recognized unless significant oil and gas  reserves  are
sold.
Should the net capitalized costs exceed the estimated present value of  oil
and gas reserves, discounted at 10%, such excess costs would be charged  to
current  expense.  As of September 30, 2005, the net capitalized costs  did
not exceed the estimated present value of oil and gas reserves.
<PAGE>
Critical Accounting Policies
The  Partnership follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and
gas  properties.   The  full cost method subjects  companies  to  quarterly
calculations of a "ceiling", or limitation on the amount of properties that
can  be capitalized on the balance sheet.  If the Partnership's capitalized
costs  are in excess of the calculated ceiling, the excess must be  written
off as an expense.
The  Partnership's discounted present value of its proved oil  and  natural
gas  reserves  is  a  major  component  of  the  ceiling  calculation,  and
represents  the  component  that requires the  most  subjective  judgments.
Estimates  of  reserves are forecasts based on engineering data,  projected
future  rates  of  production and the timing of future  expenditures.   The
process  of  estimating oil and natural gas reserves  requires  substantial
judgment,  resulting  in  imprecise determinations,  particularly  for  new
discoveries.   Different reserve engineers may make different estimates  of
reserve quantities based on the same data.
The  passage  of  time  provides  more  qualitative  information  regarding
estimates of reserves, and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect
updated  information.   However,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  more
significant  revisions  will not be necessary in  the  future.   If  future
significant  revisions  are  necessary  that  reduce  previously  estimated
reserve quantities, it could result in a full cost property writedown.   In
addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation
of  the  ceiling,  estimates  of proved reserves  are  also  a  significant
component  of  the calculation of depletion, depreciation, and amortization
("DD&A").
While  the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment,  the
associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in  the
discounted  present  value of the reserves do not  require  judgment.   The
ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last
day  of  the  period are generally held constant indefinitely. Because  the
ceiling  calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last  day  of
the  applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely, the resulting value
is  not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves.  Oil and natural
gas  prices have historically been cyclical and, on any particular  day  at
the  end of a quarter, can be either substantially higher or lower than the
Partnership's  long-term price forecast that is a barometer for  true  fair
value.

Revenues
The  Partnership's oil and gas revenues increased to $688,965 from $443,527
for  the  quarters  ended  September 30, 2005 and  2004,  respectively,  an
increase  of  55%.  The principal factors affecting the comparison  of  the
quarters ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:
The average price for a barrel of oil received by the Partnership increased
during  the  quarter ended September 30, 2005 as compared  to  the  quarter
ended  September  30, 2004 by 42%, or $17.49 per barrel,  resulting  in  an
increase of approximately $180,100 in revenues.  Oil sales represented  89%
of  total oil and gas sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2005  as
compared to 87% during the quarter ended September 30, 2004.
The  average price for an mcf of gas received by the Partnership  increased
during  the same period by 41%, or $2.35 per mcf, resulting in an  increase
of approximately $22,500 in revenues.
The  total  increase in revenues due to the change in prices received  from
oil and gas production is approximately $202,600.  The market price for oil
and  gas  has  been extremely volatile over the past decade and  management
expects  a  certain  amount of volatility to continue  in  the  foreseeable
future.
<PAGE>
Oil  production  increased approximately 1,096 barrels or  12%  during  the
quarter ended September 30, 2005 as compared to the quarter ended September
30, 2004, resulting in an increase of approximately $45,900 in revenues.
Gas  production  decreased approximately 569 mcf  or  6%  during  the  same
period, resulting in a decrease of approximately $3,200 in revenues.
The  net  total  increase in revenues due to the change  in  production  is
approximately  $42,700.   The increase in oil  volumes  is  primarily  from
improved production on two properties.
Costs and Expenses
Total  costs  and  expenses increased to $258,454  from  $232,394  for  the
quarters  ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, an  increase  of
11%.   The  increase  is the result of higher depletion expense  and  lease
operating   costs,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease   in   general   and
administrative expense and accretion expense.
Lease   operating  costs  and  production  taxes  were   16%   higher,   or
approximately $30,700 more during the quarter ended September 30,  2005  as
compared  to the quarter ended September 30, 2004.  The increase  in  lease
operating  costs  are  primarily  from surface  equipment  repairs  on  one
property.   Production taxes increased from the higher  revenues  resulting
from higher oil and gas prices.
General  and  administrative  costs consist of independent  accounting  and
engineering fees, computer services, postage, and Managing General  Partner
personnel  costs.   General  and  administrative  costs  decreased  12%  or
approximately  $3,600  during  the quarter  ended  September  30,  2005  as
compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2004.  The decrease in  General
and  Administrative  Expense is primarily due to lower engineering  service
costs.
Depletion  expense increased to $2,751 for the quarter ended September  30,
2005  from $2,613 for the same period in 2004.  This represents an increase
of  5%.  The contributing factor to the decrease in depletion expense is in
relation  to  the  BOE depletion rate for the quarter ended  September  30,
2005,  which was $.23 applied to 11,899 BOE as compared to $.24 applied  to
10,898 BOE for the same period in 2004.
Accretion  expense decreased to $3,929 for the quarter ended September  30,
2005  from $5,077 for the same period in 2004.  This represents a  decrease
of  23%.   The  decrease  in accretion is from discontinuing  accretion  on
several wells that reached their projected end of life in 2004.

Revenues
The  Partnership's  oil  and  gas revenues  increased  to  $1,701,209  from
$1,286,259  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2005  and  2004,
respectively,  an  increase of 32%.  The principal  factors  affecting  the
comparison  of  the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and  2004  are  as
follows:
The average price for a barrel of oil received by the Partnership increased
during  the  nine months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to  the  nine
months ended September 30, 2004 by 34%, or $12.79 per barrel, resulting  in
an  increase  of approximately $375,900 in revenues.  Oil sales represented
88%  of total oil and gas sales during the nine months ended September  30,
2005 as compared to 85% during the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
The  average price for an mcf of gas received by the Partnership  increased
during the same period by 17%, or $.95 per mcf, resulting in an increase of
approximately $30,100 in revenues.
The  total  increase in revenues due to the change in prices received  from
oil and gas production is approximately $406,000.  The market price for oil
and  gas  has  been extremely volatile over the past decade and  management
expects  a  certain  amount of volatility to continue  in  the  foreseeable
future.
<PAGE>
Oil  production increased approximately 576 barrels or 2% during  the  nine
months  ended  September  30, 2005 as compared to  the  nine  months  ended
September  30, 2004, resulting in an increase of approximately  $21,800  in
revenues.
Gas  production  decreased approximately 2,269 mcf or 7%  during  the  same
period, resulting in a decrease of approximately $13,000 in revenues.
The  net  total  increase in revenues due to the change  in  production  is
approximately $8,800.
Costs and Expenses
Total  costs and expenses increased to $661,328 from $625,184 for the  nine
months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of  6%.
The  increase is the result higher lease operating costs, partially  offset
by a decrease in depletion expense , general and administrative expense and
accretion expense.
Lease operating costs and production taxes were 9% higher, or approximately
$45,100 more during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to
the  nine  months ended September 30, 2004. The increase in lease operating
costs  are  primarily  from  surface equipment  repairs  on  one  property.
Production  taxes increased from the higher revenues resulting from  higher
oil and gas prices.
General  and  administrative  costs consist of independent  accounting  and
engineering fees, computer services, postage, and Managing General  Partner
personnel  costs.   General  and  administrative  costs  decreased  6%   or
approximately  $5,200 during the nine months ended September  30,  2005  as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
Depletion  expense decreased to $8,270 for the nine months ended  September
30,  2005  from  $8,613  for the same period in 2004.   This  represents  a
decrease  of  4%.   The  contributing factor to the decrease  in  depletion
expense is in relation to the BOE depletion rate for the nine months  ended
September  30,  2005, which was $.24 applied to 34,673 BOE as  compared  to
$.25 applied to 34,475 BOE for the same period in 2004.
Accretion  expense decreased to $11,786 for the nine months ended September
30,  2005  from  $15,231 for the same period in 2004.   This  represents  a
decrease of 23%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The  primary source of cash is from operations, the receipt of income  from
interests in oil and gas properties.  The Partnership knows of no  material
change, nor does it anticipate any such change.
Cash  flows  provided by operating activities were approximately $1,061,600
in  the  nine  months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to approximately
$603,200 in the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
Cash  flows used in investing activities were approximately $6,900  in  the
nine  months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to approximately  $13,000
in the nine months ended September 30, 2004.  The principle use of the 2005
cash  flow  from  investing activities was the  addition  of  oil  and  gas
properties.
Cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $947,300 in  the
nine  months ended September 30, 2005 as compared to approximately $549,000
in  the  nine  months ended September 30, 2004.  The only use in  financing
activities was the distributions to partners.
Total  distributions during the nine months ended September 30,  2005  were
$950,000  of  which  $855,000 was distributed to the limited  partners  and
$95,000  to  the  general partners.  The per unit distribution  to  limited
partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $62.89.  Total
distributions during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were $550,000
of  which  $495,000 was distributed to the limited partners and $55,000  to
the general partners.  The per unit distribution to limited partners during
the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $36.41.
The  sources  for  the  2005 distributions of $950,000  were  oil  and  gas
operations  of  approximately $1,061,600 and the  change  in  oil  and  gas
properties  of  approximately  $(6,900),  resulting  in  excess  cash   for
contingencies  or  subsequent  distributions.  The  sources  for  the  2004
distributions  of  $550,000  were oil and gas operations  of  approximately
$603,200  and  the  change  in  oil  and gas  properties  of  approximately
$(13,000),  resulting  in  excess  cash  for  contingencies  or  subsequent
distributions.
Cumulative cash distributions of $11,039,627 have been made to the partners
and  limited partners.  As of September 30, 2005, $9,983,906 or $734.33 per
limited  partner  unit  has  been  distributed  to  the  limited  partners,
representing 147% of capital contributed.
As  of  September 30, 2005, the Partnership had approximately  $480,800  in
working  capital.   The  Managing  General  Partner  knows  of  no  unusual
contractual  commitments.  The partnership held many long-lived  properties
at  inception,  however  due to the restrictions  on  property  development
imposed  by  the partnership agreement, the Partnership cannot develop  its
non  producing  properties.  Without continued development,  the  producing
reserves continue to deplete.  Accordingly, as the Partnership's properties
have  matured  and  depleted, the net cash flows from  operations  for  the
partnership  has  steadily  declined, except in  periods  of  substantially
increased  commodity pricing.  Maintenance of properties and administrative
expenses for the Partnership are increasing relative to production.  As the
properties   continue   to   deplete,   maintenance   of   properties   and
administrative costs as a percentage of production are expected to continue
to increase.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In  September  2004,  the Securities and Exchange Commission  issued  Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 106 ("SAB 106"). SAB 106 expresses the SEC  staff's
views  regarding SFAS No. 143 and its impact on both the full-cost  ceiling
test and the calculation of depletion expense.  In accordance with SAB 106,
beginning in the first quarter of 2005, undiscounted abandonment costs  for
wells  to  be drilled in the future to develop proved reserves are included
in  the  unamortized cost of oil and gas properties, net of related salvage
value,  for  purposes of computing depreciation, depletion and amortization
("DD&A").  The implementation of SAB 106 did not have a material impact  on
our financial statements.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The  Partnership  is  not a party to any derivative or embedded  derivative
instruments.
Item 4.   Controls and Procedures
The  Managing  General  Partner  has established  disclosure  controls  and
procedures   that  are  adequate  to  provide  reasonable  assurance   that
management will be able to collect, process and disclose both financial and
non-financial information, on a timely basis, in the Partnership's  reports
to  the  SEC.   Disclosure controls and procedures  include  all  processes
necessary  to  ensure  that material information  is  recorded,  processed,
summarized  and  reported within the time periods specified  in  the  SEC's
rules  and  forms,  and  is  accumulated and  communicated  to  management,
including our chief executive and chief financial officers, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures.
With respect to these disclosure controls and procedures:
management  has  evaluated the effectiveness  of  the  disclosure
          controls  and procedures as of the end of the period  covered  by
          this report;
this evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with  the
          participation  of management, including the chief  executive  and
          chief financial officers of the Managing General Partner; and
it  is  the  conclusion of chief executive  and  chief  financial
          officers  of  the Managing General Partner that these  disclosure
          controls   and   procedures  are  effective  in   ensuring   that
          information  that is required to be disclosed by the  Partnership
          in   reports  filed  or  submitted  with  the  SEC  is  recorded,
          processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods
          specified in the rules and forms established by the SEC.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There  has  not been any change in the Partnership's internal control  over
financial  reporting that occurred during the quarter ended  September  30,
2005  that  has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to  materially
affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
