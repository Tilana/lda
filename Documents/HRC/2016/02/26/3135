<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming and building upon</i> Human Rights Council resolution 17/11 of

</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its resolutions and those of the Commission on Human Rights on the

the Commission on the Status of Women, the General Assembly and the Security Council,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration 
on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for 
Action and the Cairo Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and

Violations of International Humanitarian Law, adopted by the General Assembly in its

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence 
in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and<b> </b>the establishment of a trust 
fund for victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court and the families of such 
victims,<b> </b>and noting the mandate of the Court to permit the participation of victims at all 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twentieth session (A/HRC/20/2), chap. I. 
</p>

<p>stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court and to protect their 
safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy,1 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the identification of violence against women as a priority for United 
Nations programmes, funds and specialized agencies, especially the United Nations Entity 
for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that remedies for women and girls who have been subjected to violence may 
include a range of judicial and non-judicial measures that can result in reparations, such as 
restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition, and measures of 
satisfaction, such as public apologies, commemorations and judicial decisions restoring 
dignity and reputation,  
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> that women who are subjected to violence should be provided with 
access to the mechanisms of justice and, as provided for by national legislation, to just and 
effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, and information about their rights 
in seeking redress through such mechanisms,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that sexual violence, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations, 
affects victims, families, communities and societies, and stressing that effective remedies in 
those situations should include access to health care, psychosocial support, legal assistance 
and socioeconomic reintegration services for victims of sexual violence,  
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> that effective remedies for women and girls should aim to have a 
transformative effect by addressing the root causes of violence against them,  
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> <i>also</i> that men and boys have an important role to play in addressing the 
root causes of violence against women and in facilitating the access of women and girls to 
just and effective remedies for the harm they have suffered, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that alternatives to judicial remedies can, particularly in cases of 
mass violations, allow victims, victims&#8217; advocacy groups and civil society to be involved in 
the process in proactive ways, thereby conveying a sense of agency that can have a 
reparative effect and promote greater access to remedies by victims,  
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that education can play a key role in efforts to guarantee non-repetition of 
violence against women and girls by promoting changes in attitudes and behaviour,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all acts of violence against women and girls, whether 
these acts are perpetrated by the State, private persons or non-State actors, and calls for the 
elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general 
community and where perpetrated or condoned by the State, in accordance with the 
Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, and stresses the need to treat 
all forms of violence against women and girls as a criminal offence, punishable by law, and 
the duty to provide victims with access to just and effective remedies and specialized 
assistance, including medical and psychological assistance, as well as effective counselling;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Underscores</i> that States have the primary responsibility for protecting women 
and girls facing violence and, in this regard, urges States to take measures to investigate, 
prosecute, punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt 
and appropriate remedies, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of 
violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in 
situations of armed conflict;  
</p>

<p>3. <i>Urges</i> States to encourage the removal of all barriers to women&#8217;s access to 
justice and to ensure access to effective legal assistance for all female victims of violence 
so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues 
relating to family law, and also ensure that victims have access to just and effective 
remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including through the adoption of national 
legislation, where necessary;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also urges</i> States to ensure that remedies for women and girls subjected to 
violence, whether judicial, administrative, policy or other measures, are available, 
accessible, acceptable, age- and gender-sensitive and adequately address victims&#8217; needs, 
including by protecting confidentiality, preventing stigmatization, revictimization or further 
harm to victims, allowing reasonable time for women subjected to violence to come 
forward to seek redress, ensuring reasonable evidentiary standards, providing necessary 
translation services and minimizing the complexity of procedures;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>5. <i>Further urges</i> States to place a high priority on removing gender bias from 
the administration of justice and enhancing the capacity of law enforcement officials to deal 
appropriately with violence against women, including by providing systematic gender-
sensitivity and awareness training, as appropriate, for police and security forces, 
prosecutors, judges and lawyers, integrating gender into security sector reform initiatives, 
developing protocols and guidelines, and enhancing or putting in place appropriate 
accountability measures for adjudicators; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> <i>the need</i> to pay particular attention to marginalized groups of women 
and girls and the importance for States to ensure that remedies take into account the 
differential impact of violence on women due to multiple, intersecting and aggravated 
forms of discrimination;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Urges</i> States to adopt measures to enhance the awareness of women, and in 
particular women at known risk of gender-based violence, of their rights, the law and the 
protection and legal remedies it offers, including by disseminating information on the 
assistance available to women and families who have experienced violence, and ensuring 
that timely and appropriate information is available to all women who have been subjected 
to violence, at all stages of the justice system;  
</p>
<p>8.<b> </b><i>Emphasizes</i> that the involvement of victims, victims&#8217; advocacy groups, 
women&#8217;s organizations and other relevant stakeholders in the design, implementation, 
monitoring and evaluation of remedies enhances their effectiveness;<b>  
</b></p>
<p>9. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences, and takes note of her recent thematic report on gender-related 
killings of women;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/20/16. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Invites</i> States and all other relevant stakeholders, including regional 
organizations and mechanisms, treaty bodies, United Nations entities, special procedures, 
civil society organizations, academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to 
contribute to the mandate holder&#8217;s study on State responsibility for eliminating violence 
against women by submitting relevant information, including on providing remedies for 
women who have been subjected to violence, as well as on challenges identified in that 
regard; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Welcomes</i> the panel discussion on the theme of remedies for women 
subjected to violence held as part of the 2012 annual discussion on women&#8217;s rights, and 
</p>
<p>requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare 
</p>

<p>a summary report on the proceedings, including conclusions and recommendations made by 
participants, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-first session;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare, in consultation 
with relevant stakeholders, and to present to the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-third 
session, recommendations on how to create and/or strengthen linkages and synergies 
between the mechanisms of the Council, and also with other relevant intergovernmental 
processes on the issue of violence against women and girls; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all forms 
of violence against women, its causes and consequences, as a matter of high priority, in 
conformity with its annual programme of work.
