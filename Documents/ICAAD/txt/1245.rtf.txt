JUDGMENT

1.      
After deliberating for 2½ hours the three assessors have expressed their unanimous opinion that the accused is guilty of 6 counts of "Abuse of Office" punishable under section 111 of the Penal Code Cap 17 and of 3 counts of "Discharge of Duty with Respect to Property in which he has a Private Interest" punishable under section 109 of the Penal Code.

2.      
I adjourned overnight to consider my judgment. I direct myself in accordance with my summing up and the evidence adduced at the trial.

3.      
I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved all the elements of the offence of "Abuse of Office" in Counts 1  6 beyond reasonable doubt.

4.      
I am also satisfied that the prosecution has proved all the elements of the offence of "Discharge of Duty with Respect to Property in which he has a Private Interest" in Counts No. 7  9 beyond reasonable doubt.

5.      
The three assessors have expressed their unanimous opinion that the accused abused his office for the purpose of gain in Counts No. 1  6. I agree with the opinions of the assessors that the accused abused his office for the purpose of gain.

6.      
I find that the assessors opinions were supported by the evidence adduced at the trial.

7.      
I agree with the opinions of the assessors that the accused is guilty of a felony in Counts No. 1  6 and that the accused is guilty of the offences in Counts No. 7  9 as charged.

8.      
I accordingly convict the accused of a felony on Counts No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. I also convict the accused of Counts No. 7, 8 and 9.
