<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/13 
and 19/37. It describes the activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur since her last 
report in March 2013 and provides a thematic overview of the main issues relating to the 
mandate as well as the lessons learned from the experience of the Special Rapporteur 
during her six-year tenure. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since her previous report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/22/54 and its 
addenda) in March 2013, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken visits to Kyrgyzstan from 
15 to 26 April, Madagascar from 15 to 26 July and Benin from 28 October to 8 November 
</p><p>2013. The reports on these visits are presented as addenda (A/HRC/22/54/Add.1, 2 and 3, 
respectively) to this report. Her country visit to India, initially scheduled to take place from 
16 to 27 April 2012, was postponed at the request of the Government in April 2012. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that this visit did not take place. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is yet to receive replies to her requests for invitations from 
Cambodia, Canada, Gambia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Viet Nam and the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela, as well as confirmation of the new dates for the visit to India. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Conferences, seminars and engagement with civil society 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur participated in numerous conferences, workshops and 
seminars during the period under review. She delivered a keynote speech at the 
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) conference on crimes against 
children, held in Bangkok from 19 to 21 March 2013. On 28 and 29 May, she participated 
in a conference organized by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in the 
Dominican Republic on good practices relating to the prevention of sexual exploitation of 
children and adolescents in travel and tourism. She made a presentation at a seminar on 
psychosocial support for street children organized by the SAMU Social non-governmental 
organization in Paris from 6 to 11 June. A keynote speech was delivered on her behalf at an 
ECPAT conference on sports events and child protection organized in Warsaw on 13 and 
14 June. She also participated in a regional consultation organized by ECPAT in Addis 
Ababa on 1 and 2 August 2013 on actions to stop the commercial sexual exploitation of 
children in Africa. On 12 September, she participated in a workshop on the protection of 
migrant children in the framework of the International Metropolis Conference in Tampere. 
On 18 September, the Special Rapporteur participated in an International Organization of la 
Francophonie workshop on alternative care in Paris. On 28 September, she gave a lecture at 
the International University of Rabat on children&#8217;s rights. She reported to the General 
Assembly on 16 October and participated in a panel event on 17 October organized by the 
European Union and Uruguay on A World Fit for Children. On 10 and 11 December, she 
attended a round table on promoting and protecting the rights of street children in South-
East Asia organized jointly by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), Consortium for Street Children and AVIVA in Singapore.<b> </b></p>


<p><b> 2. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>5. A summary of communications sent and replies received appears in the 
communication report (A/HRC/23/51).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Reflecting on a six-year tenure as Special Rapporteur on the 
sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Objective and methodology 
</b>6. As she reached the end of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography undertook to review the major 
developments relating to her work that have taken place over the past six years and draw 
lessons from her experience as mandate holder. Since 2008, the world has undergone 
significant changes that have had a far-reaching impact on the extent and nature of the sale 
and sexual exploitation of children. The progression of globalization, the continued 
expansion of the use of the Internet, including in developing countries, increased migration 
&#8212; either internationally or domestically, in particular due to urbanization, the economic 
and financial crisis, natural disasters, conflicts and climate-related changes have all affected 
children&#8217;s vulnerability. Although numerous efforts have been undertaken to address the 
scourge of the sale and sexual exploitation of children through a better understanding of 
these phenomena and innovative practices and enhanced cooperation among actors, 
numerous gaps remain. 
</p>
<p>7. Against this backdrop, the Special Rapporteur has deployed significant efforts to 
raise awareness of the issue, sharing her experience and expertise, encouraging 
coordination among key stakeholders, and advocating for responses at the global, regional 
and national levels. She has produced action-oriented reports with a view to reinforcing 
policies and practices. Her participation in numerous conferences, expert and high-level 
meetings has contributed to the visibility of the issue. She has advised on regional and 
global strategies aimed at addressing these phenomena.  
</p>
<p>8. In carrying out her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has taken a holistic approach to 
addressing the sale and sexual exploitation of children, building on the interdependence and 
interrelatedness of children&#8217;s rights. The sale and sexual exploitation of children are 
complex phenomena with multiple manifestations and a wide array of root causes. Their 
manifestations and the factors that expose children to risk have significantly changed in the 
past as a result of developments in the global environment. 
</p>
<p>9. Taking stock of the six years of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, the present report 
aims to identify responses and good practices across regions and to inform future efforts.  
</p>
<p>10. The report is based on the work carried out by the Special Rapporteur and her 
predecessors, including through country visits, on reports and studies of United Nations 
human rights mechanisms and agencies, other regional, international and non-governmental 
organizations, and on academic research. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of the issues and trends relating to the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>11. An analysis of the core substantive aspects of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate 
points to a worsening of several manifestations of the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children. However, the real scope is still unknown due to various factors, such as the 
inadequacy of some legislation, which does not clearly define all the relevant offences, the </p>


<p>absence of reliable data on the extent of the violations and their evolution over time and the 
lack of transnational information sharing. Moreover, the criminal nature of these activities 
implies that they are generally hidden. Most children and families do not report cases of 
abuse and exploitation because of stigma, a fear of reprisals and a lack of trust in the 
authorities. The social tolerance that can exist with respect to these phenomena and the lack 
of awareness also contribute to under-reporting. Taking these limitations into consideration, 
the studies and reports that are available nevertheless provide an overall picture of the 
phenomenon today.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sexual exploitation of children online</b>1<b>  
</b></p>
<p>12. The Internet has been significantly misused as a tool for the dissemination of child 
pornography. Estimates indicate that the number of child abuse images online runs into the 
millions and the number of individual children depicted is most likely in the tens of 
thousands.2 The age of victims has tended to decrease and representations are becoming 
more graphic and violent. Images are increasingly disseminated through peer-to-peer 
networks, making them more difficult to detect.3 Data from the Internet Watch Foundation 
suggest that the number of domains hosting child sexual abuse content halved between 
2006 and 2012 and that the 9,550 web pages reported were hosted on 1,561 domains from 
38 countries in 2012.4 However, this does not mean that there has been a decrease in the 
circulation of child sexual abuse images. 
</p>
<p>13. In 2011, the International Association of Internet Hotlines received 29,908 reports of 
child abuse material, 71 per cent involving prepubescent children and 6 per cent involving 
very young children. By 2012, that number had jumped to 37,404 reports, 76 per cent 
involving prepubescent children and 9 per cent involving very young children.5  
</p>
<p>14. By the beginning of 2013, the International Child Sexual Exploitation image 
database managed by INTERPOL had enabled identification of 3,000 victims and 
1,500 offenders from more than 40 countries, as well as data related to numerous 
unidentified victims whose cases are yet to be investigated.6  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>15. Child prostitution is still a prominent problem in many countries. It encompasses all 
forms of transactional sex involving children. It may be performed in exchange for money 
but also for other goods or favours. Demand for child prostitution is fuelled by overall 
demand for prostitution, beliefs that having sex with a child is &#8220;safer&#8221; and a range of issues 
revolving around power, superiority and the perception of children as objects.  
</p><p>16. Although no reliable data is available on the extent of the phenomenon, studies 
indicate that it exists in all environments, including in developed countries, and across

<p>various socioeconomic levels. The root causes of child prostitution have become worse in 
recent years. They include early sexualization and the dissemination of sexualized images 
of children, the effects of the economic crisis as well as violence, gangs and peer pressure. 
Some studies point to consumerism and the attractiveness of some goods for children as an 
incentive for transactional sex. Child sex tourism is one critical aspect of child prostitution. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism</b>7<b>  
</b></p>
<p>17. The actual scale of child sex tourism is not known due to the lack of available data. 
However, during her official visits to tourism destination countries, the Special Rapporteur 
has been advised by local actors that child sex tourism has been increasing, driven by the 
overall growth in tourism.  
</p>
<p>18. While child sex tourism tends to occur more commonly in developing countries, no 
country or tourism destination is exempt. Destinations are constantly shifting, with 
offenders favouring countries with weak legislation and controls, where they can act with 
impunity.  
</p>
<p>19. Data from the Trafficking in Persons Report 2013 indicate that instances of child sex 
tourism are reported in 55 countries out of the 188 covered by the report, with offenders 
originating from 18 countries and travelling to 30 countries (7 are countries of both origin 
and destination).8 However, the criminal nature of the activity and the negative impact in 
terms of a country&#8217;s image for tourism development mean that the large majority of cases 
are never reported.  
</p>
<p>20. The growth in international tourism, with the number of international tourists set to 
reach 1.8 billion by 2030, according to the World Tourism Organization, shows that it will 
continue to remain an important challenge in the coming years. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Child trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>21. Recent estimates indicate that child trafficking is on the rise as a proportion of all 
human trafficking. Child trafficking includes several forms of exploitation, including sexual 
exploitation, involving in many instances practices amounting to the sale of children.  
</p>
<p>22. The 2012 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons of the United Nations Office on 
Drugs and Crime indicates that detected cases of child trafficking represented 27 per cent of 
human trafficking in 2007&#8211;2010, up from 20 per cent in 2003&#8211;2006. In recent years, the 
increase has been greater for girls. Between 2006 and 2009, the proportion of girls in the 
number of total victims has grown from 13 to 17 per cent. Two out of every three child 
victims are girls. Although trends are not homogenous globally, the report finds that more 
than 20 countries recorded a clear increase in the proportion of child trafficking detected in 
the period 2007&#8211;2010 compared with the period 2003&#8211;2006. Significantly, in Africa and 
the Middle East, over two thirds of the detected victims of trafficking are children. 
Globally, trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation represents 58 per cent of the 
total number of detected cases.9

<p><b> 5. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Illegal adoption 
</i></p>
<p>23. Illegal adoption is also an extremely hidden phenomenon. However, a review of the 
situation of intercountry adoption points to heightened risks of illegal adoption due to the 
conjunction of various factors. Existing records suggest that there has been an increase in 
intercountry adoptions worldwide between 2000 and 2004, followed by a significant 
decrease.10 Demand for adoption has continued to increase, while supply decreases, 
creating the conditions for abuse, corruption, excessive fees amounting to the sale of 
children, and the illegal adoption of children.11  
</p>
<p>24. This phenomenon will require ongoing attention in coming years to ensure that 
adequate governance frameworks are put in place to prevent and combat illegal adoption. 
</p>
<p><i>  Transfer of organs 
</i>25. The sale of organs continues to be a major concern, although there is a dearth of data 
on the phenomenon and on the extent to which it affects children. Studies on the topic have 
highlighted that &#8220;tourism&#8221; for organ transplants has expanded, again facilitated by the 
development of international travel. People from high-income countries travel to poor areas 
where people will sell their organs as a survival strategy. Existing research has highlighted 
that the most vulnerable members of the population are particularly affected by this crime.12  
</p>
<p><i>  Child marriage 
</i></p>
<p>26. Child marriage remains widespread in many countries, despite the adoption of 
domestic legal frameworks forbidding it. Child marriage is rooted in unequal gender status 
and power relations in society. In many cases, it can be regarded as a form of sale of 
children. The requirement to provide a dowry for younger girls can be an incentive for 
parents to arrange to marry their daughters at an early age. Child marriage can be used as a 
means to settle family debts or provide economic security to families.  
</p>
<p>27. In total, some 158 countries have adopted laws prohibiting marriage before the age 
of 18, although in 146 of them, marriage under the age of 18 can be performed with 
parental consent. In spite of these measures, early marriage continues to take place 
worldwide. Although a few countries have made progress, the available data shows that 
globally, the incidence of early marriage was stable between 2001 and 2010. As many as 61 
countries still have a prevalence rate of child marriage of over 20 per cent.13 According to 
UNICEF data from 2012, one third of women aged 20 to 24 years old &#8212; that is, some 
70 million women &#8212; were married before the age of 18.14

<p><i>  Serious consequences  
</i></p>
<p>28. All forms of abuse, violence and exploitation have serious short- and long-term 
physical, psychological and social effects, not only for the girls and boys who are the direct 
victims, but also for their families and communities. Victims of sexual violence are at high 
risk of unwanted pregnancy and of contracting HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted 
diseases. In their daily lives, they are confronted with social stigma, family rejection, 
psychological stress and depression. Images of sexually exploited children circulated online 
will never disappear, which has a devastating effect on victims. The development of 
responses and care for victims, including reparation and rehabilitation, needs to address 
these consequences.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Increased vulnerability and new risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>29. The current patterns of the sale and sexual exploitation of children are explained by 
a number of critical aspects of the protective environment around children, and unfold in a 
context in which those aspects are affected. Vulnerability is a function of a child&#8217;s exposure 
to risk and his or her resilience; it depends on the situation of the child, but most 
importantly on the child&#8217;s immediate environment and the broader context. All these 
elements are interdependent.15  
</p>
<p>30. The underlying push and pull factors that affect the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children are multidimensional and are linked to the political, legal, socioeconomic, cultural 
and environmental context, both at national and transnational levels.  
</p>
<p>31. Today, more children are at risk of sale and sexual exploitation than was previously 
the case. The gravity of these risks has increased due to the combined effect of more 
profound and lasting disruptions in children&#8217;s protective environments and the development 
of global integration and instruments for committing crimes.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Weakening of families 
</b></p>
<p>32. The family represents the first layer of a child&#8217;s protective environment. When 
families are not able to fulfil their protective role because of the absence of one or two 
parents, a lack of parental skills or insufficient resources, children are particularly at risk of 
being exploited. 
</p>
<p>33. Recent studies have highlighted numerous factors that have affected the ability of 
families to care for their children. With the economic crisis, parents have been forced to 
spend longer hours at work, leaving children unattended.  
</p>
<p>34. However, economic circumstances are not the only factors that weaken families. 
A UNICEF study has found that children in Eastern Europe and Central Asia are 
increasingly being separated from their parents, indicating greater vulnerability of families. 
The study underlines that the fact that the vast array of causes, including poverty, single 
parenthood, migration, deprivation of parental rights, and disability of the child, actually 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
  See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography on effective prevention strategies in combating the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children (A/68/275). </p>


<p>reflect a lack of access to social services in support of parenting, including day-care or 
educational facilities.16  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly emphasized in her reports that support to 
parents and families in their parental responsibilities and capacities should be a priority in 
order to prevent and combat the sale and sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Economic hardship 
</b></p>
<p>36. Poverty exacerbates vulnerability when combined with other risk factors.17 When 
poverty is combined with one or several negative events, such as drought, loss of 
employment or death or illness of a family member, it places significant stress on families. 
When State institutions and social services are not able to provide adequate support for 
families in their child-rearing responsibilities and to offer adequate protection to children, 
poverty becomes a risk factor.  
</p>
<p>37. Globally, between 2007 and 2012, the economic and financial crisis significantly 
affected households and contributed to destabilizing the socioeconomic environment for 
children. In particular, unemployment and less secure employment have been on the rise, 
with young people bearing the brunt of the crisis.18 This has simultaneously affected the 
economic stability of families and reduced young people&#8217;s prospects of being gainfully 
employed, in turn increasing their exposure to risky behaviours and making them 
vulnerable to exploitation. Studies have shown that children are at increased risk of leaving 
education to enter employment after the main household income earner has become 
unemployed. Furthermore, evidence suggests that crises lead to an increase in the number 
of children living or working on the street and the number of children entering into 
commercial sexual exploitation in order to assist their parents financially.19  
</p>
<p>38. Although research indicates that in 2008&#8211;2009, governments managed to maintain 
social spending and offset the effects of the crisis on the most vulnerable, since 2010, the 
trend has been reversed. Increased fiscal austerity has led to significant cuts in social 
spending, including family benefits, pensions and delivery of social services, resulting in 
negative effects for households.20  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur has witnessed the effects of economic hardship and 
insufficient social services in many countries she has visited and draws attention to States&#8217; 
responsibilities to ensure the provision of adequate safety nets. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Migration 
</b></p>
<p>40. Migration has significant effects on the vulnerability of children to sale and 
exploitation. When children and families migrate to new places, they often leave behind the

<p>social support, coping mechanisms and protective environment a community and familiar 
context provide. Children migrating on their own are easy prey for traffickers. While it 
holds numerous positive aspects, migration is also an important component of international 
mobility that facilitates the sale and sexual exploitation of children. 
</p>
<p>41. The number of migrants worldwide has increased rapidly in the past few years, 
reaching almost 1 billion persons &#8212; one in seven human beings. The number of 
international migrants in 2010, estimated at 214 million according to the Department of 
Economic and Social Affairs, could almost double by 2050, and internal migrants 
accounted for 740 million migrants in 2009, according to the United Nations Development 
Programme.21 Similarly, the number of people uprooted by conflict or persecution is at its 
highest level in 18 years.22  
</p>
<p>42. Children and young people represent an important proportion of the migrant 
population. It is estimated that there are 33 million international migrants under the age of 
20, representing 16 per cent of the international migrant population, but over 20 per cent in 
Africa and Asia. One third of these migrants are adolescents, while 39 per cent are under 
the age of 10.23 Data on internal migration and children left behind is not available. 
However, global trends suggest that this issue will remain significant in the coming years.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Conflicts and violence</b>24<b> 
</b></p>
<p>43. The breakdown of families, communities and social and institutional structures 
during conflict and in its aftermath puts children at great risk of being sold, trafficked and 
sexually exploited. The World Development Report 2011 of the World Bank estimates that 
approximately 1.5 billion people live in countries affected by repeated cycles of political 
and criminal violence.25 The current nature of conflicts, mostly civil wars fought by armed 
groups rather than the military, disproportionately affects civilians. Children pay a high toll. 
A child living in a conflict-affected or fragile developing country is nearly three times more 
likely to be out of school than a child living in a developing country that is unaffected by 
these factors. Sexual and gender-based violence is a major issue, during and in the 
aftermath of conflict. Women and children account for close to 80 per cent of refugees and 
internally displaced persons. As more countries fall into conflict and high levels of political 
and criminal violence, involving an increasingly complex range of protagonists and ever 
more violent schemes, children will continue to be exposed to heightened risks.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Climate change and natural disasters</b>26<b> 
</b></p>
<p>44. Global warming and natural disasters have continued to affect children in all parts of 
the world. According to UNICEF, &#8220;climate-related hazards are increasing, accounting for 
70 per cent of all disasters today compared to 50 per cent two decades ago, and such

<p>26 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography on the protection of children from sale and sexual exploitation following humanitarian 
crisis due to natural disasters (A/HRC/19/63). </p>


<p>climate-related crises are projected to affect hundreds of millions every year as early as 
2015&#8221;.27 
</p>
<p>45. Drought, earthquakes and floods put children at risk. They directly affect the child&#8217;s 
daily environment by impacting food security, water sources and diseases, among others.28 
They increase vulnerability by creating further hardships for families and may be an 
incentive to migrate. They weaken governance systems, affect delivery of services and 
dislocate families. Following a natural disaster, children are more likely to be unidentified, 
hastily fostered, adopted or placed in long-term care institutions. Some people exploit the 
chaotic environment to engage in criminal activities, including selling children for the 
purposes of illegal adoption, forced labour or sexual exploitation. Evidence suggests that 
climate extremes have a tangible impact on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.29  
</p>
<p>46. Climate change and natural disasters are likely to remain significant concerns in 
coming years. Data from the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction indicate 
that floods and storms have been on the rise since 1980 and in particular since 2006, 
although there are strong variations from one year to the next.30 A 2013 World Bank report 
has underlined the devastating impact of global warming, even with a modest rise of 
temperature, with significant effects on communities and on children in Asia and Africa.31  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Evolving social norms 
</b></p>
<p>47. Social norms are a critical element of a protective environment for children. They 
can increase vulnerability, especially when they lead to discrimination, gender bias, 
harmful practices, and social acceptance and under-reporting of violations. Conversely, 
social norms promoting protective behaviours can play an important role in reducing risk 
and enhancing resilience. They also influence the functioning of formal institutions and 
good governance, including public accountability.32  
</p>
<p>48. Research has demonstrated how developments in the broader context modify the 
level of social acceptance of violence.33 The Special Rapporteur has observed in recent 
years how communities have coped with some of the challenges they face by increasing 
their social tolerance of child sexual exploitation, resulting in the normalization and 
permissibility of the crime. For example, communities have increasingly tolerated the 
emergence of child prostitution due to the rapid growth of tourism in some areas as an 
inevitable and acceptable price to pay for economic development.  
</p>
<p>49. Similarly, the expansion of the Internet and social networking has had an impact on 
children&#8217;s social norms. The exposure of children to child pornography inspires and

<p>influences their sexual practices and affects their behaviour. Prevailing standards and peer 
pressure has led adolescents to share sexualized images of themselves, making them 
vulnerable to abuse and potentially redefining some of the social limits of acceptability of 
child pornography. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 7. Increasing global demand 
</b></p>
<p>50. The demand for sex with children is persistent and growing, underpinned by an 
environment of social tolerance, complicity and impunity. Despite popular misconceptions, 
the demand for sex with children does not only come from paedophiles. It stems from 
overall demand for sex and typically happens as &#8220;opportunities&#8221; arise in that context. 
Perpetrators of child sexual exploitation are of all ages, may be male or female and can be 
from very different socioeconomic backgrounds and professions. 
</p>
<p>51. Moreover, child sexual exploitation is a very lucrative industry, allegedly a source of 
billions of dollars of profit.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Global spread of the Internet</b>34<b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. The growth of the Internet and the ongoing development of evolving technologies 
over the past decade, across the world, is a major phenomenon that has significantly 
affected the global context of the sale and sexual exploitation of children and will continue 
to do so in coming years. In 2004, 14 per cent of the world&#8217;s population was using the 
Internet, with 7 per cent in the developing world.35 In 2012, almost 39 per cent of the 
world&#8217;s population was online, and 31 per cent of the population in the developing world.36  
</p>
<p>53. The Internet brings tremendous positive opportunities, in particular for children and 
young people. Although the Internet may not represent a determinant per se of the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children, it does nonetheless operate as an instrument for offenders, 
multiplying the possibilities of obtaining, distributing and selling child abuse material and 
facilitating access to children in all parts of the world, and consequently promoting the 
growth of this phenomenon.  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Globalization and financial transactions 
</b></p>
<p>54. While some aspects of globalization can bring advantages, the increased integration 
of a country into the global economy can also facilitate transnational organized crime. The 
International Monetary Fund has underlined the fact that global financial flows have 
continued to increase since 2000, making countries increasingly integrated.37 Transnational 
criminal networks use the tools offered by globalization for registration and financial 
transactions, to develop lucrative activities involving the sex industry and thus creating new 
risks for the sexual exploitation of children. As global integration continues to grow and 
new payment tools develop, the use by criminals of the possibilities globalization offers, 
including for the sale and sexual exploitation of children, will remain a central 
preoccupation. 
</p>
<p>55. To sum up, since 2008 major changes have occurred in the nature, extent, and root 
causes of the sale and sexual exploitation of children. Although progress has been made in 
some areas, the result has been an overall preoccupying growth in the phenomenon, as

<p>suggested by existing &#8212; albeit all too often scarce &#8212; data. These developments have been 
fuelled by global changes that have exacerbated risk factors and are likely to keep 
unfolding in coming years, raising serious concerns about possible future developments. 
For this reason, it is important that responses are constantly adapted to a shifting and ever 
more complex environment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Preventing and combating the sale and sexual exploitation of children: 
Evolving responses 
</b></p>
<p>56. In the framework of her mandate, and in particular during her country visits, the 
Special Rapporteur has had the opportunity to interact with numerous stakeholders and 
learn about many initiatives aimed at preventing and combating the sale and sexual 
exploitation of children. Her reports have highlighted various promising approaches that 
can positively inform policies and practices. 
</p>
<p>57. As the Special Rapporteur has repeatedly underlined, responses to the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children need to take into account the complexity and 
multidimensional nature of the phenomenon.  
</p>
<p>58. Effective strategies take a systemic approach and include the coordinated 
strengthening of protective factors and mitigation of risk factors. Throughout her mandate, 
the Special Rapporteur has consistently emphasized the need for comprehensive approaches 
that contribute to system-building by ensuring adequate legislation, a sound institutional 
framework, effective policies, delivery of quality services, and promotion of protective 
social norms. Responses therefore work in synergy and are mutually reinforcing when 
adequately coordinated. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Child protection strategies 
</b></p>
<p>59. While a large number of action plans and strategies have been developed, they are 
very often only partially or incompletely implemented in some countries owing to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Weak capacities of the institutions responsible for the design, implementation and 
monitoring of action plans and strategies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Inadequate allocations of budget and qualified human resources; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Multiple sectoral action plans and insufficient coordination among actors leading to 
duplication of work and ineffective use of resources; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Shortage or absence of monitoring and assessment mechanisms to measure the 
impact of actions undertaken. 
</p>
<p>60. In order to overcome these challenges, a strong child protection system is 
indispensable.38 UNICEF actively promotes and supports the implementation of such 
systems; with input from civil society, it assisted in developing the 2012 Children&#8217;s Code in 
Kyrgyzstan, which includes provision for the establishment of a comprehensive child 
protection system. 
</p>
<p>61. In her thematic reports and country visit reports, the Special Rapporteur has 
emphasized the importance of a systemic approach and focused her recommendations on 
the various elements of a child protection system.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>38
 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
</p>
<p>pornography on building rights-based and comprehensive national child protection systems to prevent 
and combat the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography (A/66/228). </p>


<p><b> 2. Adequate legislation 
</b></p>
<p>62. Despite the increasing number of ratifications of child rights instruments, universal 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the two Optional Protocols 
thereto is still to be reached. 
</p>
<p>63. Laws and regulations are critical for the functioning of child protection systems. 
They determine the prohibition of certain acts and express public recognition that some 
violations are not acceptable. Criminalization is also a precondition for offenders to be 
punished, and for victims to benefit from redress. In addition, laws define the mandate of 
various institutions involved in the protection of children from exploitation.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has observed that the effectiveness of child protection 
legislation is often hampered by imprecise definitions, which leads to inadequate protection 
of children from violations of their rights. In many cases, domestic legislation is not in 
compliance with the relevant international instruments. The status of child victims of some 
forms of sexual exploitation is often not recognized. Instead, it is the child who is 
criminalized or punished. 
</p>
<p>65. While each country needs to adopt legislation in line with its legal tradition and 
system, international standards provide important guidance on the legislative measures to 
be adopted in addressing the sale and exploitation of children. This includes a number of 
provisions concerning the age of the victim, the rights of victims to assistance, redress and 
compensation, the prosecution of offenders, and extraterritorial jurisdiction.39  
66. Across regions, laws are constantly being reviewed and amended to ensure better 
compliance with international standards. The Protection Project at The Johns Hopkins 
University and the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children have developed 
a model law for child protection, building on best practices from countries across the world. 
It includes both model provisions, in line with international standards, and examples of 
existing legislation from 68 countries. One chapter is devoted to various aspects of the 
protection of children from sexual exploitation.40 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Child-sensitive justice  
</b>67. Child-sensitive justice is a central element of a child protection system. Promoting 
justice for children requires comprehensive approaches that ensure that children are better 
served and protected by justice systems. It entails simultaneously considering justice for 
children within the broader rule of law agenda while guaranteeing specialized interventions, 
focusing on the interactions between the security, justice and social sectors.41  
68. The United Nations has adopted guidelines on justice in matters involving child 
victims and witnesses of crime.42 The Special Rapporteur is concerned that in many places 
she has visited, significant efforts need to be made to ensure that justice systems respect the 
rights of children involved as victims and witnesses in criminal cases related to the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children. It is also important that child offenders be treated in

</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Combating impunity 
</b></p>
<p>69. Combating impunity for perpetrators of the sale and sexual exploitation of children 
is a major challenge. When laws &#8212; even where they exist &#8212; are not enforced, organized 
crime is likely to flourish and social tolerance for exploitation is likely to increase. 
Impunity stems from limited reporting of violations due to a lack of trust in the system and 
the nature of the crime, which can be seen as shameful and stigmatizing for victims within 
their communities.  
</p>
<p>70. Impunity is the result of weak law enforcement due to a lack of capacity or 
corruption. It is also due to the complexity of the criminal networks involved, the tools they 
use and their transnational nature. 
</p>
<p>71. In several instances, the Special Rapporteur has voiced her concern at the culture of 
impunity that prevails in numerous contexts. In order to address impunity, including the 
implicit norms that undermine necessary actions against offenders, governance systems 
need to be strengthened. Links between governance systems and development have 
received increased attention lately, particularly in the context of the formulation of a post-
2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Child-sensitive complaint and reporting mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>72. In a joint report, the Special Rapporteur and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence against Children highlighted the numerous initiatives 
undertaken at the national level to promote accessible and child-sensitive counselling, 
complaint and reporting mechanisms for child rights violations, including sexual abuse and 
exploitation.44  
</p>
<p>73. Child helplines have developed significantly over the past decade. Helplines are toll-
free telephone numbers that can be called by victims or others to seek help and information. 
Membership of Child Helpline International, the federation of child helplines worldwide, 
has grown from 49 members in 46 countries at its creation in 2003 to 173 members in 
142 countries as of October 2012.45 Data from Child Helpline International shows that in 
Europe in 2005, only 8 per cent of contacts to helplines involved a visit to the website while 
in 2012, that figure had reached 52 per cent.46  
</p>
<p>74. Independent human rights institutions for children play an important role in the 
protection of children from sale and sexual exploitation. For the most part, they have the 
power to consider individual complaints, carry out investigations and make both individual 
and policy recommendations to address relevant issues. The development of these 
institutions across regions has been unfolding since 1989 and has accelerated since the mid-

<p>2000s, according to data from UNICEF which found that, as of 2012, over 200 independent 
institutions were operating in over 70 countries.47  
</p>
<p>75. During her country visits, the Special Rapporteur has become aware of good 
practices in this area. For example, in Guatemala municipal child protection boards (Juntas 
Municipales de Protecci&#243;n a la Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia), under the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, 
receive and register complaints on child rights violations, direct such complaints to the 
relevant authorities and raise awareness on child rights, among other activities. Staffed by 
trained volunteers, these boards aim to address the absence or weakness of the judiciary in 
some municipalities and resolve conflicts that do not require judicial intervention. 
</p><p>76. In Mauritius, the Special Rapporteur acknowledged the work of the Office of the 
Ombudsperson for Children, which has a range of competencies, including making 
proposals on laws and policies, advising the Government and relevant authorities on 
childcare, and receiving and investigating cases of child rights violations. It strongly 
promotes a multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approach. 
</p>
<p>77. In Senegal, the Special Rapporteur has learnt about the impressive consultation work 
carried out by the Technical Monitoring Committee in Mbour and the approach its 
members have chosen to adopt to children&#8217;s rights. The Committee meets every month to 
consider cases of child trafficking, child labour, abuse and sexual exploitation and takes the 
necessary action. Where required, help is provided to find a lawyer for children in conflict 
with the law.  
</p>
<p>78. However, for the most part, complaint mechanisms still do not provide adequate 
protection for children. They are frequently unavailable or difficult to access, particularly 
for vulnerable children. Where they do exist, they often lack adequate resources and their 
staff often lack the skills needed to offer children adequate protection.  
</p>
<p>79. Children may lack information on the existence of these mechanisms and how to 
access them. They may not trust the mechanisms and may fear stigmatization, public 
exposure and reprisals. They may feel that they will not be listened to and believed. These 
issues are particularly challenging in cases of sexual exploitation, which are deeply taboo 
and often committed by people in children&#8217;s immediate environment. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Intersectoral coordination  
</b></p>
<p>80. The multidimensional nature of the sale and sexual exploitation of children requires 
significant coordination among the various actors involved. Coordinating bodies provide an 
important tool to ensure the coherence and sustainability of coordination efforts. They need 
to include various parts of the relevant Government in preventing and responding to the 
crime. They also need to involve relevant stakeholders in civil society and the private 
sector. 
</p>
<p>81. In the framework of her official visit to Honduras, for instance, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomed the establishment of the Inter-Agency Commission to Combat the 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, which is responsible for 
ensuring the implementation of legal and administrative measures to combat commercial 
sexual exploitation and trafficking.

<p><b> 7. Detection, care and recovery  
</b></p>
<p>82. Care for victims is an essential aspect of the fight against the sale and sexual 
exploitation of children. It should seek to rehabilitate victims and avoid revictimization by 
addressing the factors that made them vulnerable. Adequate care involves a continuum of 
actions, from identification of victims and children at risk, to care centres, justice and social 
measures. Many countries have created centres providing comprehensive care for victims 
towards their recovery and reintegration.  
</p>
<p>83. In Latvia, the Special Rapporteur visited the Ilguciems Prison for women and girls. 
She praised the methodology employed by the caretakers at this centre, where she 
witnessed a child-rights approach to the care, rehabilitation and follow-up of the girls. The 
social rehabilitation programmes implemented include measures to encourage forward-
looking thinking and to prepare the girls for discharge and reintegration into society 
through acquiring and developing basic skills.  
</p>
<p>84. In the United States, the Special Rapporteur learnt about the Manhattan Child 
Advocacy Center, which provides multidisciplinary care in treating cases of physical and 
sexual abuse, child prostitution and trafficking, with staff and representatives from social 
services, the judiciary, the police and medical personnel housed under one roof. The 
services provided include orientation, forensic interviews, client and family advocacy, and 
medical evaluation with a paediatrician, as well as adequate care and follow-up on cases.  
</p>
<p>85. During her visit to France, the Special Rapporteur learnt about how child victims of 
sexual violence are heard immediately following their identification. Several hospitals have 
created forensic units specializing in hearing children&#8217;s testimonies as soon as the child 
victim is identified. Victims are cared for by a multidisciplinary team of psychologists and 
medical doctors.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Social protection 
</b></p>
<p>86. The formulation and implementation of sound social policies that effectively address 
the root causes of the sale and sexual exploitation of children and ensure the care of victims 
is critical to preventing and combating the phenomena. The past few years have seen an 
increased recognition of the fundamental role of families in the protective environment and 
the importance of policies aimed at supporting them. Most recently, additional attention has 
also been given to the links between social protection and the protection of children from 
abuse, violence and exploitation.  
</p>
<p>87. The 2008 UNICEF Child Protection Strategy emphasizes the need to strengthen 
families as essential components of national child protection systems.48 The Guidelines for 
the Alternative Care of Children emphasize the importance of policies aimed at supporting 
families in their responsibilities of care by addressing the root causes of children&#8217;s 
separation from their family through a range of multisectoral interventions.49 Most recently, 
the report of the High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda has emphasized 
the importance of empowering families.50

<p>88. Interventions need to consist of both economic support and social measures and 
accessible quality services ranging from housing to childcare, psychosocial support and 
counselling. Family strengthening has positive effects beyond the protection of children

<p>from exploitation; it is also beneficial for the socioeconomic development of societies as a 
whole.51  
</p>
<p>89. Social protection is also an important element of strategies aiming to protect 
children from sale and sexual exploitation. Social protection includes a range of 
interventions, such as transfers in cash or in kind, social services, social insurance and 
protection from discriminatory practices.52  
</p>
<p>90. The United Nations has stepped up its engagement in this area. The Social 
Protection Floor Initiative, a United Nations joint initiative led by the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), was launched in 2009.53 It 
acknowledges the importance of social justice for human dignity and social cohesion and 
emphasizes the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, achieved by having 
their basic needs met.  
</p>
<p>91. The 2013 ILO World Report on Child Labour also concentrates on economic 
vulnerability and the role of social protection in addressing child labour. The report 
concludes that social protection alone is not sufficient to prevent and address child labour. 
Complementary measures, particularly those related to health and schooling, are needed for 
effective protection.54  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Preventive measures</b>55<b> 
</b></p>
<p>92. Prevention is the key to an effective, rights-based child protection system. It aims to 
avoid harm or mitigate its effects, including by avoiding revictimization. Primary 
prevention involves the universal provision of quality social services in order to prevent 
problems from arising. Secondary prevention concentrates on specific at-risk groups by 
providing additional targeted support. Tertiary prevention targets perpetrators and/or 
victims to limit the effects of the violation and prevent it from reoccurring. 
</p>
<p>93. Preventive measures are both universal and targeted. They are effective if they 
tackle the multiple facets of child vulnerability, building in a sustainable manner on the full 
range of policy instruments listed in the present report, including legislation, social policy, 
international cooperation and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Capacity-building  
</b></p>
<p>94. In many places, low capacities, including financial and human resources, thwart 
efforts to tackle any form of abuse, violence and exploitation of children and to care for 
victims. Significant efforts are needed to train professionals to identify and address the 
relevant crimes and foster child-sensitive approaches to prevent and combat these child 
rights violations. Capacity-building also necessitates adequate budgetary allocations to 
enable the relevant institutions and services to operate effectively.

children (A/68/275). </p>


<p><b> 11. Data collection and analysis 
</b></p>
<p>95. The collection and analysis of reliable data on the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children remains a major challenge. The lack of reliable data reduces the visibility of the 
issue and the development of adequate responses and prevention. Data collection is made 
difficult by various factors. The phenomena involved are extremely hidden. The culture of 
silence that surrounds these crimes due to the fear of reprisals, cultural taboos, shame and a 
lack of confidence in the justice system results in high levels of under-reporting, which in 
turn exacerbates difficulties in collecting data. Furthermore, many States lack an integrated 
data collection system. Such systems require harmonized, quality indicators and the 
collection by various actors and parts of Government of data which is adequately 
disaggregated, regularly shared, centralized and disseminated. 
</p>
<p>96. During her visit to Estonia, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the information 
provided by the Ministry of Justice about an ongoing initiative to establish an electronic 
database to store information related to all cases that are referred to the justice system, 
including the type of crime, the age of the accused and the victim(s), gender and other 
elements. 
</p>
<p>97. Qualitative research on the drivers of the sale and sexual exploitation of children, 
risk factors, offender profiles and the effectiveness of responses is also critically lacking 
and requires additional attention in coming years. 
</p>
<p><b> 12. Child participation</b>56<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. Child participation is a key component of an effective child protection system and an 
overarching principle of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It therefore represents 
an obligation for States. It needs to be incorporated into all programmes and policies at all 
levels, from homes to governments.  
</p>
<p>99. In recent years, child participation has received increased attention. In 2009, the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted its general comment No. 12 on the right of 
the child to be heard. Since then, it has contributed much needed guidance on the issue and 
paved the way for the development of practical tools for implementing this right.57 Yet in 
practice, efforts need to be further strengthened in order to ensure that children&#8217;s voices are 
taken seriously.  
</p>
<p>100. In her report on child participation as a key element in preventing and combating the 
sale and sexual exploitation of children (A/67/291), the Special Rapporteur set forth a 
number of practical approaches that have yielded positive changes in ways of working with 
children as partners. These include: facilitating child-sensitive and appropriate information, 
taking into account the sensitive nature of the issues; involving children in creative arts, 
especially theatre; producing child-friendly media, including leaflets, booklets, posters, 
television and radio broadcasts; using child-friendly spaces and forums such as children&#8217;s 
associations, youth forums, children&#8217;s councils and parliaments, and blogs; fostering online 
participation, combined with online safety initiatives; and encouraging children&#8217;s 
participation in public policy development and monitoring, including research and data 
collection at the national, regional and international levels. The Special Rapporteur has 
insisted on the need to scale up and disseminate these practices.

<p><b> 13. Corporate social responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>101. Corporal social responsibility has received increased attention in the light of 
recognition of the business sector&#8217;s role in upholding and promoting human rights. 
Initiatives seeking to strengthen corporate social responsibility have developed 
considerably in very recent years, building concurrently on the private sector&#8217;s voluntary 
efforts to take action, and on renewed momentum internationally through the adoption of 
various important guidelines and resources.  
</p>
<p>102. The concept refers to the duty of businesses to respect human rights.58 The Human 
Rights Council endorsed the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: 
Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221;&#8217; Framework 
(A/HRC/17/31) in 2011 as a global standard for preventing and addressing the risk of 
adverse impacts on human rights linked to business activity.  
</p>
<p>103. The Guiding Principles have been adapted to the child rights framework in the 
Children&#8217;s Rights and Business Principles developed by UNICEF, the United Nations 
Global Compact and Save the Children, published in 2012.59 In addition, the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child has adopted a general comment No. 16 (2013) on State obligations 
regarding the impact of the business sector on children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>104. A significant number of businesses have adopted codes of conduct in an attempt to 
adhere to international standards. In partnership with governments and non-governmental 
organizations, they have also supported information and awareness-raising campaigns, as 
well as prevention and child protection programmes. Initiatives include the creation and 
expansion of various networks. The International Association of Internet Hotlines 
(INHOPE) was created in 1999 and has grown to a network of 44 hotlines in 38 countries, 
where the public can report child sexual abuse.60 In 2007, leading mobile telephone 
operators and content providers in the European Union signed the European Framework for 
Safer Mobile Use by Younger Teenagers and Children.61 Since 2008, Google has used 
technology to identify duplicates of abuse images online and has recently developed 
additional tools towards ending online child pornography.62  
</p>
<p>105. The Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in 
Travel and Tourism was introduced in 1996 and now has over 1,000 members, including 
leading travel and tourism companies.63  
</p>
<p>106. Financial coalitions aiming to combat these crimes have multiplied, brining together 
the public sector and banks, credit card and Internet payment companies and other financial 
actors. In the United States, the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography was created 
in 2006 to combat child pornography.64 The model has expanded to the Asia Pacific region

<p>in 2009 and to Europe through the European Financial Coalition against Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation of Children Online in 2012.65 
</p>
<p>107. In her country visits, several interesting initiatives were brought to the attention of 
the Special Rapporteur. In El Salvador, the Ministry of Tourism reported on a programme 
to raise awareness among personnel in small- and medium-sized enterprises, such as 
tourism agencies, small hotels and tour operators, about the commercial sexual exploitation 
of children and trafficking of children. In Madagascar, telecommunication companies have 
supported the establishment of child helplines.  
</p>
<p>108. In coming years, efforts are likely to focus on the consolidation of the application of 
these instruments, expansion of private sector-led initiatives and sharing of good practices. 
In 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to establish a working group to promote the 
implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
(A/HRC/RES/17/4),  which provides an avenue for taking stock of developments and 
advocating for increased corporate social responsibility, including for children. 
</p>
<p><b> 14. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>109. The transnational nature of the sale and sexual exploitation of children, owing to the 
development of information technologies, trafficking networks, tourism and migration, 
frequently involves children being transferred from one country to another and often 
implicates transnational criminal networks. This calls for coordinated preventive measures 
across countries, particularly neighbouring countries. Consequently, it is virtually 
impossible to address these crimes adequately without solid networks at the regional and 
international levels aimed at promoting coordination and cooperation. Compliance with 
international standards plays an important role in ensuring a common understanding of the 
nature of the crimes and fostering cooperation among countries. Cooperation ranges from 
border control and verification of travel documents to joint efforts from law enforcement 
authorities and joint preventive programmes, including harmonization of legislation, 
sharing of information and learning from good practices. 
</p>
<p>110. Over the past few years, international cooperation to address the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography has increased. Many countries have police attach&#233;s 
within their embassies who support coordination with local law enforcement authorities and 
help build their capacities, assist with investigations, and facilitate the sharing of 
information. 
</p>
<p>111. INTERPOL has developed its activities aimed at coordinating law enforcement 
globally to prevent and combat crimes against children. In particular, it has set up a system 
of &#8220;green notices&#8221; issued to provide warnings and criminal intelligence about persons who 
have committed criminal offences and are likely to repeat these crimes in other countries.66  
</p>
<p>112. Managed by INTERPOL and funded by the European Commission, the International 
Child Sexual Exploitation image database is a powerful intelligence and investigative tool. 
It was launched in 2001, revamped in 2009, and is regularly updated with the latest 
technology, which allows specialist investigators to share data with colleagues across the 
world. It uses sophisticated image comparison software to make connections between 
victims, abusers and places. Police forces in almost 40 countries are currently connected to 
the database and cooperate in the identification of child sexual exploitation victims and 
their abusers.67

<p>113. The Virtual Global Task Force is an alliance of twelve law enforcement agencies 
that seek to build partnerships with non-government organizations and the private sector to 
help protect children from online child abuse. Since its creation in 2003, it has helped 
rescue hundreds of children from sexual abuse, prompted investigations, and identified 
hundreds of offenders around the world.68  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Changes in the nature and extent of the sale and sexual exploitation of children 
reveal preoccupying trends. Even though this issue has gained increased visibility over 
the past years, thanks to the joint efforts of numerous stakeholders, millions of 
children worldwide are still victims of sexual exploitation today and have their 
childhood stolen. The phenomenon has developed and become increasingly complex. 
Risk factors are growing and multiplying. The social tolerance for these crimes, 
impunity, corruption and precarious socioeconomic situations remain among the most 
challenging obstacles to overcome in combating this scourge. Strategies aimed at 
preventing and combating the phenomenon need to be constantly reviewed in the light 
of renewed challenges and emerging threats. Importantly, such strategies can only be 
effective if they tackle the multidimensional nature of the problem in a comprehensive 
and holistic manner. This requires multidisciplinary approaches bridging various 
parts of policymaking and tackling the broader environment that can either protect 
children or make them more vulnerable. It also calls for increased coordination 
among actors at the local, national, regional and global levels.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>As she reaches the end of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur recognizes that, 
despite the significant efforts deployed, the growing magnitude of the risks makes 
children more vulnerable, raising significant concerns for the years ahead. Efforts 
need to be constantly strengthened and reassessed in order to ensure appropriate 
responses. Appropriate responses can only be formulated through genuine political 
commitment at the highest level. Laws, action plans and strategies are not enough if 
they are not translated into concrete actions, with adequate funding and capacities to 
be fully operational.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>As the world reflects on global development goals for the post-2015 era, the 
Special Rapporteur underlines the importance of taking into consideration the strong 
linkages between economic, social and political development and child protection 
issues. To this end, the Special Rapporteur recommends the inclusion of child-
sensitive social protection in the post-2015 development agenda. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>In order to effectively prevent and combat the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children in the years ahead, the Special Rapporteur underlines the need to strengthen 
and develop comprehensive child rights strategies, building on: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>National comprehensive and child rights-centred protection systems; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Comprehensive and child rights-centred transnational cooperation. 
</b>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>68

<p> <b>1.  At the national level  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites all States to accelerate efforts towards 
comprehensive and child rights-centred protection systems, in order to create: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Comprehensive legal frameworks (both civil and criminal) to prevent, 
prohibit and protect children from all forms of sale and sexual exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Child-sensitive justice systems;  
(c) Strong institutions and mechanisms, including community-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms, equipped with well-trained staff, providing care, recovery, reintegration 
and follow-up of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Sustainable preventive measures that take into account all the 
underlying factors, including demand;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Social protection policies and family strengthening programmes; 
(f) Strong corporate social responsibility among the private sector, Internet 
</b></p>
<p><b>service providers, telecommunications, tourism, travel, media and financial 
institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Societies in which children and young people are involved in designing 
solutions and contributing to assessment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Reliable and updated information;  
(i) Regular assessment and accountability mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p> <b>2. At the international level  
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the international community to establish a 
coordinated global response, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensuring the universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establishing a comprehensive and global legal framework to prevent, 
prohibit and protect children from all forms of sale and sexual exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Sharing and updating information related to child victims and offenders 
through strong cooperation among law enforcement agencies and justice systems;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Harmonizing practices and procedures to prevent and respond to the 
sale and sexual exploitation of children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Sharing expertise and scaling up good practices;  
(f) Providing sustainable support to the development and strengthening of 
</b></p>
<p><b>child protection systems, especially in low-income countries; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Increasing cooperation and harmonization in the work of the United 
Nations system. During her country visits, despite some excellent support and work 
undertaken, the Special Rapporteur sometimes observed a lack of coherence and 
numerous overlaps in the work of United Nations entities. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Regarding the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of providing pragmatic, 
realistic and action-oriented recommendations to be shared with all relevant </b></p>


<p><b>stakeholders, particularly in the framework of country visits, in order to ensure 
enhanced ownership of the recommendations and the actions to be undertaken. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>Close cooperation with States and other stakeholders, in particular during and 
after country visits, is critical to making a difference in children&#8217;s lives. Constructive 
dialogue involving all stakeholders has enabled the Special Rapporteur to bring about 
concrete change through the implementation of recommendations before and after the 
submission of her reports. Results have included States&#8217; ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, reform of legislation, increased compliance with 
international standards and strengthening of institutions and services.  
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>Owing to the multidimensional nature of the sale and sexual exploitation of 
children and its intersection with a number of connected phenomena, including 
migration, the expansion of the Internet and related concepts such as various forms of 
child abuse and exploitation, close cooperation with the other existing human rights 
mechanisms is crucial, as well as with the private sector, particularly Internet service 
providers and the telecommunications, tourism and travel industries.  
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>In order to ensure proper monitoring and follow-up to these recommendations, 
including the possibility of providing the necessary technical assistance &#8212; if requested 
&#8212; particularly in the framework of country visits, support to the mandate should be 
strengthened.
