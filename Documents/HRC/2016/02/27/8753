</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Germany 
(Berlin, Cologne, Karlsruhe, Heidelberg, Nuremberg, Leipzig, Crostwitz, Rostock and 
Hamburg) from 22 June to 1 July 2009. 
 The Special Rapporteur held extensive meetings with authorities from the executive, 
legislative and judicial branches, including at the <i>L&#228;nder</i> and municipal levels. The Special 
Rapporteur also had extensive meetings with representatives of civil society organizations 
that are active in the realm of racism and xenophobia, associations representing minority 
groups, religious communities, and individual victims of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates several recommendations, including the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency should be provided with the human and 
financial resources necessary for it to be present in all 16 <i>L&#228;nder</i>. In addition, its 
mandate should be made more robust, allowing it to investigate complaints brought 
to its attention and to bring proceedings before the courts. Finally, the Agency

</p>
<p>should be empowered to conduct <i>proprio motu</i> investigations, including in areas 
such as employment and housing discrimination. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An explicit reference to racism as an aggravating circumstance in crimes should be 
added under section 46 of the Criminal Code. In addition, the Government should 
develop specific training for police officers, prosecutors and judges on the 
identification and characterization of hate crimes. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government should continue to make use of sections 84 and 85 of the Criminal 
Code and article 4 (b) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination in order to declare illegal and prohibit organizations 
which promote and incite racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; As provided by article 1, paragraph 4, of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur strongly 
recommends that special measures be taken to ensure an adequate representation of 
persons with a migration background in State institutions &#8211; particularly in the areas 
of employment and education, in political institutions and the civil administration.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited Germany 
(Berlin, Cologne, Karlsruhe, Heidelberg, Nuremberg, Leipzig, Crostwitz, Rostock and 
Hamburg) from 22 June to 1 July 2009. He held extensive meetings with authorities from 
the executive, legislative and judicial branches. In light of Germany&#8217;s federal structure and 
the scope of competences of the <i>L&#228;nder</i>, the Special Rapporteur conducted meetings both at 
the federal level and at the level of the <i>L&#228;nder</i> and municipalities. A full list of authorities 
met by the Special Rapporteur is contained in the appendix. 
</p>
<p>2. Apart from the agenda he covered with the Government and State institutions, the 
Special Rapporteur also had extensive meetings with representatives of civil society 
organizations that are active in the realm of racism and xenophobia, associations 
representing minority groups and religious communities, as well as individual victims of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
Germany for its full cooperation and openness throughout the visit and in the preparatory 
stages. He also wishes to convey his appreciation to the different civil society organizations 
that cooperated with him throughout the visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Demographic, ethnic and religious composition 
</b></p>
<p>4. According to the Federal Statistical Office, Germany had a population of around 
82.2 million as of 31 December 2007. However, Germany faces negative population growth 
rates. From 2006 to 2007, the population declined by about 97,000, or 0.1 per cent.1 The 
foreign-born population amounted to 8.8 per cent of the total population, or around 7.2 
million persons. People of Turkish descent make up the largest group of foreign-born 
individuals, with over 1.7 million inhabitants.2 
</p>
<p>5. Official data is not available concerning the ethnic background of the population. 
Many interlocutors within Germany highlighted the fact that there is general scepticism in 
the country regarding the gathering of ethnically disaggregated data in view of the insidious 
use of such type of data during the period of National Socialism. 
</p>
<p>6. The religious composition of the population is predominantly Christian: 34 per cent 
of the population is Protestant and 34 per cent Roman Catholic. Muslims make up around 
3.7 per cent of the German population. A large segment, 28.3 per cent of the population, 
consists of atheists, unaffiliated or other religious groups.

 These figures reflect the number of foreign-born individuals legally residing in Germany. The total 
</p>
<p>number of individuals, including undocumented migrants, is substantially larger. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>7. At the international level, Germany is a State party to the core international human 
rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. However, Germany is not 
a party to the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of their Families. 
</p>
<p>8. At the regional level, Germany has ratified the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter, the 
Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the 
European Convention on Nationality. Germany has yet to ratify Protocol No. 12 to the 
European Convention on Human Rights on general non-discrimination and the Convention 
for the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at the Local Level. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with authorities from the 
executive, legislative and judiciary branches, both at the federal and local levels of 
government, in order to obtain their views concerning racism and xenophobia in Germany, 
the adequacy of the existing legal framework and the programmes and policies adopted by 
the authorities to fight these problems. Additionally, meetings with independent 
institutions, civil society organizations, associations representing minority groups, religious 
communities and individual victims of discrimination were organized. 
</p>
<p>10. In order to better assess the main challenges that lie ahead in the fight against racism 
in Germany, the Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the authorities some key 
concerns expressed by civil society and independent institutions. In this regard, he aimed to 
better understand the response of the Government to those challenges and, in addition, how 
the authorities identified existing problems and devised solutions thereto. The conclusions 
in this report are based on these rich exchanges with interlocutors in Germany and his own 
analysis of the literature. 
</p>
<p>11. Chapter III of this report analyses the legal and institutional framework adopted by 
Germany to combat racism. Chapter IV addresses a number of key areas in the fight against 
racism, presenting the views shared with the Special Rapporteur both by Government 
officials and civil society representatives. This is followed in chapter V by an analysis of 
the situation by the Special Rapporteur and in chapter VI by his recommendations to the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional and criminal provisions 
</b></p>
<p>12. A general equal treatment clause is contained in article 3 of the Basic Law of the 
Federal Republic of Germany, which declares that &#8220;all persons shall be equal before the 
law&#8221; and that &#8220;no person shall be favoured or disfavoured because of sex, parentage, race, 
language, homeland and origin, faith, or religious or political opinions. No person shall be 
disfavoured because of disability&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The Criminal Code contains more specific prohibitions with regard to racism. In 
particular, section 130 labelled &#8220;Agitation of the People&#8221; contains robust provisions against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>whomever &#8220;incites hatred against segments of the population or calls for violent or arbitrary 
measures against them&#8221;, including through the dissemination of writings and broadcasts. 
Section 130.3 also provides for criminal sanctions against approval or denial of acts 
committed under the rule of National Socialism, which can be punished with imprisonment 
of up to five years. Applicable in the framework of article 4.4 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Criminal Code 
also contains a prohibition on the activities of parties and organizations declared to be 
unconstitutional (sections 84 and 85), the propaganda of unconstitutional organizations 
(section 86) and the use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations (section 86a). 
</p><p>14. With regard to racist crimes, section 46 of the Criminal Code establishes the 
principles that should be taken into account to determine punishment for criminal offences. 
These include a general reference to the &#8220;motives and aims of the perpetrator&#8221;, but no 
specific reference to racist motivations is included (see paragraphs 32&#8211;35 below for a 
discussion on this question). 
</p>
<p><b> B. The General Equal Treatment Act 
</b></p>
<p>15. In 2006, the General Equal Treatment Act (<i>Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz</i>) 
was enacted by parliament, coming into force on 18 August 2006. The Act is in fact a 
transposition into German law of some key European Union (EU) anti-discrimination 
directives. As section 1 of the Act states, its purpose &#8220;is to prevent or stop discrimination on 
the grounds of race or ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual 
orientation&#8221;.3 It prohibits discrimination on these grounds in a variety of areas, including 
employment, vocational training, membership or involvement in workers&#8217; and employers&#8217; 
organizations, social protection, health care, education and housing. In this regard, the Act 
is an important milestone in offering specific protection to vulnerable groups in Germany, 
creating a particular set of rights that can be pursued through the courts and making more 
specific the general equal treatment provision contained in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>16. The Act also addresses the question of affirmative action in its section 5 entitled 
Positive Action, which provides that &#8220;unequal treatment shall only be permissible where 
suitable and appropriate measures are adopted to prevent or compensate for disadvantages 
arising on any of the grounds referred to under Section 1 occurred&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. According to various accounts, the enactment of the Act was a controversial process 
because of the concern, mostly of the private sector, that it would lead to increasing 
bureaucracy, particularly in relation to employment discrimination. It demanded therefore 
that political capital be invested by Government authorities to ensure its approval. While 
the fears expressed regarding the implications of the Act were shown not to be realistic, 
many interlocutors confirmed that there remains a degree of reluctance on the part of many 
actors to fully accept the provisions of the Act. 
</p>
<p>18. Civil society organizations pointed out that at present there is, to their knowledge, 
little resort to the Act by victims of discrimination, due primarily to lack of awareness of 
the law. In addition, the lack of data collection on racial discrimination by most public 
agencies also contributes to the difficulty in providing solid evidence of structural 
discrimination. Many organizations also highlighted the fact that there is no tradition of 
strategic litigation in Germany, therefore only a limited number of racial discrimination 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 The General Equal Treatment Act does not include language and nationality as protected grounds, as 
</p>
<p>recommended by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) in its general 
policy recommendation No. 7 on national legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination. See 
ECRI, Fourth Monitoring Report on Germany, published on 26 May 2009, para. 25. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>cases reach the higher level of the judiciary. In his meeting with the Constitutional Court, 
the Special Rapporteur received confirmation that there are very few cases on 
discrimination, and even fewer on racial discrimination, that reach that level of judicial 
review. The main consequence of this state of affairs is slow progress in the interpretation 
of the law by the higher levels of the judiciary, the lack of a victim-centred approach, and a 
greater degree of flexibility for lower-level judges to disregard anti-racism provisions that 
are not explicitly spelled out in the legislative framework. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency 
</b></p>
<p>19. An important component of the General Equal Treatment Act was the creation of a 
Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency within the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior 
Citizens, Women and Youth. While the Agency is functionally dependent on the Ministry 
and its head is appointed by the Government, the Act describes the Agency as &#8220;independent 
in the execution of its duties and only subject to the law&#8221;. 
</p><p>20. The main mandate of the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency is to receive 
complaints from any person who believes he or she has been discriminated against on the 
grounds provided in the General Equal Treatment Act. The Agency is then mandated to 
&#8220;give independent assistance&#8221; to such persons, in particular by (a) providing information on 
claims and possible legal action; (b) arranging for advice to be provided by another 
authority; and (c) endeavouring to achieve an out-of-court settlement. The Agency 
therefore does not work as a quasi-legal complaint mechanism, as it is not empowered to 
bring about formal discrimination complaints against persons or institutions thought to have 
engaged in discriminatory behaviour. Contrary to similar bodies in other European 
countries, the Agency has more of an information and counselling mandate than one of 
providing legal support. 
</p>
<p>21. The Agency has dealt with a limited number of cases of discrimination based on 
race or ethnicity. From August 2006 to December 2008, 26.2 per cent of cases addressed by 
the Agency were on discrimination based on disability, 24.8 per cent on discrimination on 
the grounds of gender and 19.7 on discrimination based on age. Only 14.5 per cent of cases 
involved discrimination on grounds of race or ethnicity and 2.8 per cent on grounds of 
religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur met with the Head of the Agency, who emphasized that, of 
the 14.5 per cent of cases on racial discrimination, a large number are related to cases of 
mobbing at the workplace, discrimination in admission to night clubs and discrimination in 
the rental of housing. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the approach of the 
Agency is to rely on a mediation role between the alleged victim and the perpetrator of 
discrimination in order to find a mutually acceptable settlement. The Head of the Agency 
expressed satisfaction with this mandate, which in her view facilitates a successful 
resolution to many of the conflicts brought to its attention.  
</p>
<p>23. Civil society organizations underscored the fact that the Agency has a weak 
mandate, including the incapacity to take up cases, even for strategic litigation. 
Furthermore, the Agency lacks adequate human and financial resources to fully implement 
its mandate, employing around 20 full-time staff. The lack of regional or local structures, 
including field offices, is also seen as posing a major obstacle for victims of discrimination 
in relying on the Agency. Many organizations also pointed out that the Agency has not 
been proactive in fulfilling its role, such as by carrying out in-depth research on racism, 
collecting data or undertaking paired testing to assess discrimination in employment and 
housing. Finally, the issue of independence of the Agency was addressed by many 
interlocutors, who expressed discomfort with the fact that the Head of the Agency is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>appointed by a Ministry and that the Agency may be overly responsive to the majority in 
parliament. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The National Integration Plan 
</b></p>
<p>24. In July 2006, the German Chancellor convened a high-level integration summit, 
gathering representatives of civil society and migrant communities, as well as 
representatives of the Federal Government, the <i>L&#228;nder</i> and municipalities to discuss ways 
of addressing the question of migration in Germany and propose concrete actions in this 
area. The proposals put forward at the summit were integrated into a National Integration 
Plan, formally introduced in 2007. Most of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors 
recognized that the summit and the Plan fostered a paradigm shift in the way the question 
of migration was addressed in Germany, as it recognized openly for the first time that 
Germany is a country of migration. 
</p>
<p>25. The National Integration Plan brought together for the first time an array of actors 
dealing with this question: the Federal Government, the <i>L&#228;nder</i>, local authorities, migrants, 
institutions and organizations from science, media, culture, sports, trade and industry, trade 
unions, and religious groups. According to many authorities, the Plan recognizes 
integration as creating responsibilities not only for migrants, but also for the host society 
and the Government. It outlined a number of actions that would support the goal of 
promoting integration, including the creation of integration courses for foreigners,4 
promoting German education at an early age, securing quality education and professional 
training, etc.  
</p>
<p>26. Despite the general recognition that integration should be a two-way process 
involving both migrants and German society, a number of civil society organizations have 
pointed out that the debate so far has focused solely on the &#8220;responsibility&#8221; of migrants to 
integrate, a term which in many instances is interchangeably used to mean assimilation. 
According to many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors, similarly to the provisions of 
the National Action Plan against Racism, the question of broader socio-economic structures 
that enable a proper integration of migrants has generally been avoided. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The National Action Plan against Racism 
</b></p>
<p>27. In line with the provisions of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
Germany has prepared a National Action Plan against Racism covering a range of actions 
to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Plan 
draws on a number of existing programmes, including &#8220;Competent for Democracy &#8211; 
Advisory Networks to Oppose Right-Wing Extremism&#8221; and &#8220;XENOS &#8211; Integration and 
Diversity&#8221;. According to the authorities, the Plan is intended to be a comprehensive aid to 
prevent and protect against violence and discrimination by clearly demonstrating that 
neither policymakers, the judicial system nor the society at large are willing to accept or 
tolerate such phenomena.  
</p>
<p>28. Many civil society organizations pointed out that the National Action Plan against 
Racism has a narrow focus on right-wing extremism and is overly concentrated on the role 
of political parties, while almost entirely avoiding the key issue of indirect and structural 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 Integration courses were in fact already initiated in 2005 with the introduction of the new Residence 
</p>
<p>Act. This concept was subsequently expanded and improved with the introduction of the National 
Integration Plan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>discrimination against persons with a migration background. These interlocutors noted that 
the Plan does not propose any reform in key areas that directly contribute to the socio-
economic exclusion of migrants, such as the role of the education system in promoting 
equal opportunities, or the question of discrimination in areas such as housing and 
employment. A more comprehensive criticism of the National Action Plan against Racism 
voiced by civil society is that it has not managed to shift anti-racism actions in Germany 
from project-oriented actions to taking a structural approach to the problem.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Law enforcement and right-wing extremism  
</b></p>
<p>29. The Federal Ministry of Interior provided some relevant figures to the Special 
Rapporteur with regard to right-wing extremism. Officials noted that there are about 30,000 
right-wing extremists in the country at present, 4,800 of which are believed to be neo-
Nazis, in nearly 160 associations. Apart from these organized groups, according to the 
Ministry some 9,500 persons are believed to be ready to engage in racist violence. 
Furthermore, around 13,000 extremists are organized in extreme right-wing political 
parties. While civil society organizations estimated that these figures are much lower than 
the real number of extremists in Germany, the figures nevertheless show that extreme right-
wing ideologies, including neo-Nazism, are still active and abundant in the country. 
</p>
<p>30. The question of right-wing racist organizations, including neo-Nazi movements, was 
also addressed by authorities in the Ministry of Interior. Government officials explained 
that over the past 20 years, more than 30 racist organizations have been banned. Some of 
these organizations continue to operate under different names, requiring legal procedures to 
be re-initiated. However, the Special Rapporteur noted a high level of awareness insofar as 
curbing the activities of such organizations is concerned. Officials explained that 
proceedings to ban political parties are more complex due to the additional constitutional 
protection afforded to such parties. In particular, the question of previous proceedings taken 
against the National Democratic Party (NPD) was addressed. In view of the failure of 
previous attempts to ban the NPD, the authorities explained that they would only initiate 
such a procedure if there were credible enough evidence for a lawsuit to be successful.  
</p>
<p>31. With regard to racial profiling, minority associations and non-governmental 
organizations expressed concern regarding the widespread perception that in the aftermath 
of 11 September 2001, the police engaged in racial and religious profiling against certain 
groups, including people of African descent, Arabs and Muslims. Officials at the Ministry 
of Interior emphasized that police searches have to be motivated by a prior suspicion, and 
that police officers cannot rely on subjective notions, such as the ethnic or religious 
background of individuals, as grounds for suspicion. They further emphasized that these 
principles are the subject of extensive training for police cadets. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Hate crimes 
</b></p>
<p>32. Existing criminal legislation on hate crimes is contained in section 46 of the 
Criminal Code, which provides for the consideration of the &#8220;motives and aims of the 
perpetrator&#8221; when investigating and adjudicating on criminal acts. The concept of racist 
hate crimes is thus not formally defined in the legislation. However, a peak in the number 
of cases which could be classified as hate crimes in the late 1990s and 2000 prompted the 
authorities to review the system of registration of hate crimes. In this new classification </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>scheme that came into force in 2001, hate crimes are generally viewed through the lens of 
&#8220;politically motivated crimes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Government that the German police 
use the following existing classification scheme for politically motivated crimes: right-wing 
politically motivated crimes, left-wing politically motivated crimes, politically motivated 
crimes committed by foreigners, and other politically motivated crimes. Furthermore, the 
Government indicated that of the 31,801 crimes registered as politically motivated crimes, 
4,757 were qualified as hate crimes (4,358 of which were classified as right-wing politically 
motivated crimes, 127 as left-wing politically motivated crimes, 112 as politically 
motivated crimes committed by foreigners, and 160 as other politically motivated crimes). 
</p><p>34. The application of the classification scheme used by the police with regard to hate 
crimes shows that a great majority of them are considered as right-wing politically 
motivated crimes. As pointed out by many civil society organizations, a narrow 
understanding of racism still permeates many public institutions in Germany. In this 
approach, racist crimes are viewed primarily as a product of right-wing extremism. The 
European Commission against Racism and Intolerance also emphasized that less obviously 
extreme manifestations of racism tend to be neglected as such in the criminal process, and 
that members of visible minorities feel that only offenders who are identifiably members or 
sympathizers of right-wing extremist groups are likely to be pinpointed in the criminal 
justice system as authors of racist acts, with the result that some racist offences are not 
treated as such at all.5  
</p>
<p>35. Apart from the conceptual flaws involved in this understanding of racism, civil 
society interlocutors pointed to the practical problems that this approach generates. In 
particular, the Special Rapporteur was informed that because of the association in practice 
of hate crimes to right-wing extremism, only crimes perpetrated by individuals known to be 
affiliated to an extreme-right wing movement will generally be characterized as a hate 
crime. Many other offences perpetrated by individuals who are not known to be right-wing 
extremists are not reported as hate crimes, but rather as bodily injuries.  
</p><p>36. The Special Rapporteur wishes to make reference to a tragic event that took place 
just after the conclusion of his visit to Germany, which is yet another reminder of the 
persistence of racism in the country and the need for robust action to curb it. On 1 July 
2009, just after the Special Rapporteur concluded his visit to Germany, Marwa Al-Sherbini, 
a 32-year-old pregnant Egyptian pharmacist died after being stabbed at least 16 times in a 
courtroom in Dresden.6 Ms. Al-Sherbini was in the courtroom to testify in a case against 
her attacker, who had previously been fined for uttering racial slurs against Ms. Al-
Sherbini, calling her an &#8220;Islamist&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221;. Ms. Al-Sherbini&#8217;s husband, a genetic 
research scientist, was also seriously wounded in the incident as the police mistook him for 
the attacker and shot him in the leg. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the judgement 
of 11 November 2009 by which the criminal chamber of the regional court of Dresden 
sentenced the attacker to life imprisonment for the xenophobic murder of Ms. Al-Sherbini 
and for the attempted murder of her husband.

<p>GE.10-11624 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Education 
</b></p>
<p>37. Due to the federal system of government in Germany, responsibility for education 
lies with the <i>L&#228;nder</i>. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the Federal 
Government works in close cooperation with the <i>L&#228;nder</i> in the realm of educational 
policies, including in the framework of the education summit held in Dresden in 2008. The 
Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction some of the measures adopted at the education 
summit, including the commitment to invest in language competence among children with a 
migration background and to increase public spending on education and research to 10 per 
cent of GDP by 2015. 
</p>
<p>38. Officials at the Ministry of Education and Research noted that, insofar as primary 
and secondary education is concerned, in the majority of <i>L&#228;nder</i> the residential status of 
parents is not taken into account for the admission of students. This measure aims to ensure 
that all children of immigrants have a chance to obtain proper education. They further 
pointed out that the education of children with a migration background was one of the 
central topics of the National Education Report prepared by the Ministry. The National 
Integration Summit also addressed this same question at length and outlined over 400 
measures to improve access to education for children and youth with a migration 
background. 
</p>
<p>39. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur visited some educational projects that 
are addressing some of the main challenges related to the integration of children with a 
migration background. These projects highlighted the need for comprehensive measures, 
starting at the preschool level and continuing through secondary and university education. 
In particular, promoting language competence among preschool children with a migration 
background has been seen as one of the factors that can have a long-term impact on the 
performance of these children in the school system. 
</p>
<p>40. In his discussions with civil society representatives, the Special Rapporteur noted 
that one of their central complaints is the impression, particularly held by minority 
communities, that for children of migrants the educational system is not conducive to good 
performance leading to university-level qualification. In particular, the Programme for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) studies has shown that there is a high correlation 
between migration background and school performance in Germany. The three-tiered 
system of German education, with early selection into separate levels of education, creates 
a bias against students whose mother tongue is not German. The Special Rapporteur 
believes that the overrepresentation of minority students in the lower school stratum is an 
indication of the problems in the three-tiered model. The Special Rapporteur also notes that 
the same finding was reached in 2006, when the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
education visited the country and recommended that the Government reconsider its 
multitrack school system (A/HRC/4/29/Add.3). The Special Rapporteur notes that existing 
experience in this area, such as in Hamburg, has proved successful and could provide 
lessons for education reform. 
</p>
<p>41. Civil society organizations also pointed out that a key challenge for persons with a 
migration background is to receive recognition for university diplomas obtained abroad. 
Whereas recognition of diplomas for individuals coming from other European Union 
members is generally straightforward, many non-European migrants who come to Germany 
with previously obtained qualifications in their home countries find it difficult to have their 
degrees formally recognized. The Special Rapporteur notes that these difficulties in 
diploma recognition have a direct impact on the integration of migrants in the workforce 
and this has a negative impact on the economy. Officials at the Ministry of Education and 
Research agreed that the question of recognition of diplomas was problematic but pointed 
to an initiative that they expected would be adopted in September 2009 by the parliament to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>facilitate recognition of qualifications that are similar to German qualifications. The Special 
Rapporteur also took note of the intention of the authorities to further improve the 
recognition of diplomas by introducing a certificate based on the Lisbon Convention.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>42. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s meetings with civil society representatives, 
discrimination in housing was highlighted as one of the major problems faced by migrant 
communities. Across the country, many interlocutors pointed out that this form of 
discrimination is prevalent with landlords who are generally reluctant to rent housing units 
to persons with a migration background. The Special Rapporteur notes that this behaviour 
is often very hard to prove, as it occurs silently, when landlords inform the prospective 
tenant that the dwelling &#8220;is no longer available&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur wishes to note that across the world, discrimination in the 
area of housing is one of the key factors that contribute to the process of ghettoization, 
where immigrants unable to find housing are forced to settle in certain &#8220;minority areas&#8221;. 
The Special Rapporteur noted that this process of ghettoization also occurs across 
Germany. In particular, he wishes to point out that the formation of ghettos creates 
additional barriers to the integration of migrants, particularly with regard to language 
proficiency. It has also fostered the image of migrant communities as being &#8220;secluded&#8221; and 
&#8220;unwilling&#8221; to integrate. In this regard, fighting discrimination in the domain of housing is 
a key responsibility of the Government to ensure better integration of migrants into society. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to the enforcement of legislation for non-discrimination in housing, the 
Special Rapporteur recalls that one of the major problems is the production of evidence that 
would be valid in a court of law. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur believes that the 
assessment of discrimination in housing should be seen as a comprehensive set of 
obligations, in relation to which the State has a proactive role to play. He makes reference, 
in particular, to techniques such as paired testing, whereby public agencies or independent 
institutions compare the responses of landlords to prospective tenants of different 
backgrounds, bringing enforcement actions against those landlords who are found to be 
discriminating.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that one of the provisions of the General 
Equal Treatment Act formally allows for different treatment on the grounds of race or 
ethnic origin under section 19.3, which states that &#8220;in the case of rental of housing, a 
difference of treatment shall not be deemed to be discrimination where they serve to create 
and maintain stable social structures regarding inhabitants and balanced settlement 
structures, as well as balanced economic, social and cultural conditions&#8221;. The Special 
Rapporteur raised this provision with a number of interlocutors, many of whom were 
unaware of such an exception. Some authorities explained that the original purpose of this 
provision was to allow for affirmative action aimed at encouraging more integrated 
neighbourhoods. In any circumstance, this broad provision allowing for legal 
discrimination is detrimental to any possible affirmative action efforts, particularly in a 
domain as sensitive and problematic as discrimination in housing. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>46. In his meeting with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of the projects and policies that are currently being implemented 
in Germany to address problems of discrimination in employment. According to Ministry 
officials, the main problem Germany currently faces is not necessarily discrimination in the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>workplace, but rather discrimination in hiring practices. This problem affects in particular 
young people with a migration background, who are subject to high unemployment rates. 
</p><p>47. The authorities have been relying on a two-pronged strategy to address this question. 
On the one hand, a number of actions have been developed to promote professional training 
of young people with a migration background, such as through apprenticeships. Officials 
emphasized that in view of the projected population decline in the country over the next 
decades, a qualified workforce composed of people with migration backgrounds will be 
essential to the sustainability of the German economy. On the other hand, the Government 
has also focused on developing actions to promote tolerance and respect for diversity in the 
workplace and among young people. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was briefed 
about a large-scale programme called &#8220;XENOS - Integration and Diversity&#8221;, which 
supports action against racism, discrimination and xenophobia in the interface between 
school, training and professional life.  
</p>
<p>48. As mentioned above, following his contacts with civil society organizations and 
associations representing migrant communities, the Special Rapporteur noted that a key 
problem faced by persons with a migration background is the recognition of diplomas 
obtained in their own countries. Some key areas such as medicine are particularly 
problematic. Interlocutors at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs recognize 
the problem and noted that this issue is being resolved at the regional level through EU 
standards. They also recognize that non-EU migrants in certain professions face 
considerable obstacles in obtaining equivalencies for their diplomas, which generally 
prevents them from integrating into the labour market in areas in which they are qualified.  
</p>
<p><b> F. The situation of refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, the main institution dealing with 
these questions at the federal level, was substantively restructured after the adoption of the 
Immigration Law. In his meeting with the Director of the Office, the Special Rapporteur 
was informed of a variety of strategies devised by the Office to promote the integration of 
migrants in Germany and of ongoing statistics regarding the processing of asylum claims. 
The Director noted that around one third of all asylum claims are processed within two 
months and roughly 60 per cent are processed within six months. He noted that in general 
the claims that are delayed for more than six months are those that go to appeal through the 
court system.  
</p>
<p>50. The Director also pointed out some key challenges that are presently being 
addressed. In particular, he highlighted the need for intercultural competencies, particularly 
among civil servants dealing directly with migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. To meet 
this challenge, the Office invests in language and cultural sensitivity training for its staff. In 
addition, the Director pointed out to the need to ensure that the integration policy is 
designed to tap the existing potential of migrants. He highlighted the difficulties of 
recognition of foreign diplomas, which hinders their integration into the labour market. 
</p>
<p>51. With regard to the issue of housing conditions of refugees and asylum-seekers, the 
Director noted that the provision of housing is managed at the level of the <i>L&#228;nder</i>. The 
<i>L&#228;nder</i> are also responsible for the education of refugees and asylum-seekers and therefore 
different rules apply throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>52. Civil society interlocutors recognized the importance of the enactment of the new 
German Residence Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2005. The Act introduced for 
the first time mandatory integration measures for refugees and immigrants holding fixed-
term residence permits, including language classes and an orientation class, which are both </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>conducted by certified private language schools, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and welfare organizations. 
</p>
<p>53. While recognizing the importance of the Act, civil society organizations also pointed 
out that a number of problems still remain. With regard to the education of asylum-seeking 
children, some of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors noted that due to the obligation of 
these children to stay with their parents in special accommodation centres, some may face 
practical problems in attending classes. Since certain reception centres are located in remote 
areas far away from towns or villages with the necessary infrastructure, it is physically 
difficult for these children to get to a school. In addition, the overall living conditions in 
these accommodation centres may not always be appropriate for children, and their parents 
may face problems in financing extra costs for school material, as they only receive a small 
amount of pocket money. Asylum-seeking children and their parents may also not always 
be informed by the school authorities that they have the right and the duty to attend school. 
</p>
<p>54. The question of accommodation of asylum-seekers was also found to be problematic 
in some of the <i>L&#228;nder</i>. Civil society interlocutors noted that the accommodation situation 
varies widely across the different <i>L&#228;nder</i>, with asylum-seekers allowed to live in flats in 
some parts of the country or confined to reception centres in others. NGOs pointed out that 
placing asylum-seekers in collective accommodation is often counterproductive to the goal 
of integration, as they exclude refugees from virtually any contact with German society.  
</p>
<p><b> G. The situation of specific communities 
</b></p>
<p>55. Throughout the mission, the Special Rapporteur carried out extensive meetings with 
communities that face specific challenges in Germany, including the Jewish, Roma, Sinti, 
Arab and Muslim communities and people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>56. Representatives of the Jewish community generally expressed their recognition that 
Germany had put in place robust structures to ensure that the rights of its Jewish citizens 
are fully protected and that the tragic experience of the Jewish people during the Holocaust 
be constantly remembered. In particular, Jewish leaders highlighted the important work that 
has been carried out in terms of remembrance of the past, but also in supporting the 
flourishing of an active Jewish community at present. The Jewish community noted that 
some concerns regarding anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism remain. In particular, 
certain hate crimes like the desecration of Jewish cemeteries continue to take place, 
indicating that some small groups within German society still harbour an exclusionary and 
anti-Semitic ideology. 
</p>
<p>57. The Roma and Sinti community expressed similar views with regard to the progress 
achieved since the Second World War. They emphasized that there is a general recognition 
among the German public of the history of Roma and Sinti suffering during the Holocaust 
and noted a commitment on the part of public institutions to ensure that the memory of the 
Roma and Sinti people is preserved. However, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors 
pointed to widespread discrimination that still continues, particularly through stereotyping 
by the media and the public at large, as well as attempts to associate individuals of Roma 
and Sinti origin with criminal behaviour. Roma and Sinti leaders also noted concern 
regarding the dissemination of hate messages over the Internet, including direct incitement 
to racial hatred and violence. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur also met with a number of members of the Arab and Muslim 
communities and visited mosques, as well as cultural centres. According to official figures, 
there are approximately 4 million Muslims living in Germany, half of whom are not 
German citizens and the majority of whom are of Turkish origin. The Special Rapporteur 
noted that many Muslims, due both to their religious affiliation and ethnicity, face </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>discrimination in many aspects of their life. In particular, a large number of Muslim 
residents live in ghettoized neighbourhoods, with few opportunities to interact with German 
society at large. Although ghettoization may at times be voluntary, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that discrimination in housing has a substantial impact in creating these ethnically or 
religiously segregated communities (see section D above). It should be noted in addition 
that the overlap of social status with religious affiliation and ethnicity further compounds 
the difficulties faced by these communities as far as integration is concerned. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also noted with concern that discrimination against Muslims 
increased substantially after 11 September 2001, with widespread stigmatization 
associating Muslims and terrorism. This directly affects Muslims in many aspects of their 
life, including the school system and the workplace. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
of some innovative strategies to try to foster better understanding between Muslim 
communities and State institutions, particularly the police, in order to build better common 
understanding and trust. However many Muslims voiced concern that relations between the 
Muslim communities and State institutions, in particular the police, are predominantly 
focused on security issues. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur also received information concerning the prohibition 
introduced by many <i>L&#228;nder</i> regarding the wearing of religious symbols by schoolteachers. 
None of these laws exclusively address the headscarf, but rather focus on the need to 
promote &#8220;religious neutrality&#8221;. However, the Special Rapporteur noted that some of these 
laws may have a discriminatory effect on Muslim women and often engage in double 
standards, particularly with the introduction of some forms of exemption granted to the 
wearers of Christian symbols.<b>7</b> In addition, these laws may also have the effect of further 
decreasing the number of qualified Muslim teachers in public schools, thus making it more 
difficult to promote cultural awareness among pupils. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that in order to address some of the 
challenges faced by the Muslim community, the Federal Ministry of Interior set up the 
German Conference on Islam, which brings together civil society representatives, religious 
leaders, representatives at the federal level, the <i>L&#228;nder</i> and municipalities, as well as 
scholars and academics. According to the authorities, the Conference aims to promote 
inclusive and constructive forms of dialogue, and to ensure better integration of Muslims in 
Germany. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Analysis and assessment of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>62. The Special Rapporteur observed some very positive trends within German society 
and political institutions regarding issues of racism. He would like to make reference to 
three key areas of progress in the fight against racism: (a) the reform of the legal and 
institutional framework to prevent discrimination; (b) the shift in Germany&#8217;s approach 
towards recognizing the contribution of migrant communities in the country; and (c) the 
wide array of grass-roots projects to fight racism and promote integration. 
63. The Special Rapporteur noted with satisfaction that a number of important measures 
had been taken in Germany since the visit of his predecessor in 1997. In particular, he 
welcomes the efforts of the Government to reform the legal and institutional framework to

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>combat all forms of discrimination, through the enactment of the General Equal Treatment 
Act, transposing a number of EU directives, and the establishment of the Federal Anti-
Discrimination Agency. The Special Rapporteur considers that these legislative measures 
were important steps in creating a more robust framework to protect the victims of 
discrimination. Apart from creating justiciable rights, the enactment of the General Equal 
Treatment Act and the establishment of the Anti-Discrimination Agency also have an 
important symbolic role, demonstrating to society that racism and discrimination are 
unlawful and that such practices carry swift consequences. 
</p>
<p>64. Beyond these legislative reforms, the Special Rapporteur was particularly pleased to 
detect a change in the mindset of authorities at the highest levels, starting with the 
Chancellor, in recognizing that Germany is today a country of immigration. Such 
statements were not common only a few years ago, including when the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor visited Germany in 1997. This groundbreaking change in rhetoric 
and mindset has been well received by migrant communities, who previously felt that their 
decades-long contributions to Germany were not properly recognized by the population and 
the Government. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, these statements reflect a commitment 
from the authorities to address underlying challenges stemming from migration and to 
devise a new approach for the integration of migrants in German society, including through 
the National Integration Plan. While a number of challenges remain in the continuation of 
the fight against racism in Germany, the Special Rapporteur believes that the recognition of 
the place of migrants at the heart of German society is a step in the right direction towards 
addressing the root causes of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance. 
</p>
<p>65. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was able to visit a wide array of projects 
that are being implemented at the grass-roots level across Germany. He was positively 
impressed with the innovative approaches that lie behind many of these projects, which 
directly contribute to addressing the root causes of racism and promote real integration, 
particularly for children and adolescents. Such projects are generally implemented in 
partnership with active civil society organizations and often supported by the federal or 
local governments, including through public funds. While preserving independence and 
civil society leadership in these actions, the Special Rapporteur believes that the key 
challenge at present is to integrate these actions into a broader, national strategy to create 
adequate structures for the integration of racial or ethnic minorities in Germany. 
</p>
<p>66. Despite the important progress achieved in the country since the visit of the former 
Special Rapporteur in 1997, particularly the reforms undertaken in the past three years, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to point out a number of existing challenges that need to be met 
in order to further improve the framework to fight all forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance in Germany. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that one of the central problems in furthering 
the fight against racism in Germany is the narrow understanding of racism in practice that 
for many years prevailed within society at large. Due to Germany&#8217;s historical experience, 
racism has traditionally been equated with extremist right-wing ideology and violence. This 
has posed a number of practical problems, such as a tendency to predominantly characterize 
as hate crimes those acts perpetrated by members of extreme right-wing groups, which 
results in many such acts being addressed solely as bodily injuries. While the challenge of 
eradicating such practices obviously remains relevant, the understanding of racism needs to 
be broadened in practice to take into account the changes that have occurred in Germany 
over the past half century, including the arrival of a large number of migrants of different 
cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur believes 
that the question of racism should also be approached from the standpoint of structures and 
institutions that facilitate the integration of such migrants into German society and that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>provide them with the necessary skills to allow them and future generations to prosper. The 
new approach devised by the Government with regard to the integration of migrants 
recognizes the need for a broad and comprehensive understanding of racism. However, 
such understanding has yet to fully permeate all relevant institutions, in particular the 
police, immigration services and the courts, which are key in implementing anti-
discrimination provisions. The fight against racism requires not only that attention be paid 
to the most extreme and violent manifestations of this phenomenon, but also a 
comprehensive strategy that addresses the various forms of serious discrimination that 
individuals face in their daily lives. 
</p>
<p>68. Due to Germany&#8217;s federal structure, the Special Rapporteur believes that the second 
key challenge for the realization of anti-racism commitments in Germany is to successfully 
involve the <i>L&#228;nder</i> and municipal administrations, where the real focus of political power 
often lies. Despite the range of federal laws and programmes, as well as international 
human rights commitments, it is at the local level that the real implementation of anti-
discrimination provisions takes place. Unless local administrations transpose federal laws 
into local ordinances and guidelines, a core problem will continue to exist in the fight 
against racism. In this regard, the next phase of the struggle against racism in German 
society is to ensure that local administrations have effective legal and institutional 
frameworks that respond to the many challenges of the problem of racism. 
</p>
<p>69. With regard to the General Equal Treatment Act, the Special Rapporteur recalls the 
negative impact of the exception contained in the Act which allows for discrimination in 
the rental of housing in order &#8220;to create and maintain stable social structures&#8221; (see 
paragraph 45 above). The Special Rapporteur noted that discrimination in housing is still a 
pervasive phenomenon in Germany, directly contributing to the creation of virtually 
segregated neighbourhoods in some large cities and having spillover effects in areas such as 
education and health care (see paragraphs 53&#8211;54 above). In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that the Act should be reformed so that this exception may be 
eliminated. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur also noted the need to strengthen the Federal Anti-
Discrimination Agency, transforming it into the key institutional actor that will contribute 
to the eradication of racism in the country. Most of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors 
pointed out that the Agency has yet to become a relevant actor in the fight against racism. 
They highlighted the shortcomings in human and financial resources at the disposal of the 
Agency, which had fewer than 20 full-time professional staff at the time of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s visit. More importantly, the limited mandate of the Agency to carry out 
investigations and its inability to initiate legal proceedings, or provide legal support to 
victims, were highlighted as a major obstacle to its effectiveness. While the institutional 
design of independent anti-discrimination bodies varies in different legal systems, the 
Special Rapporteur is convinced that the effectiveness of such agencies is directly related to 
the level of legal support they offer to victims and to the capacity to bring legal action 
against individuals or institutions which are believed to engage in discriminatory practices. 
Without a robust mandate, the equal treatment provisions contained in national legislation 
will not have a concrete effect on the lives of those who are or could be victims of 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur also noted that despite the recent reforms in the anti-
discrimination framework in Germany, limited awareness exists among the general public, 
including victims, regarding both the General Equal Treatment Act and the Federal Anti-
Discrimination Agency. Victims often do not understand that they can resort to federal law 
when they are discriminated against. Better information and awareness-raising campaigns, 
including in minority languages, would contribute to better knowledge of existing 
legislation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to highlight the need to address the 
comprehensive socio-economic structures that may positively affect the integration of 
foreigners. Direct and indirect discrimination in areas such as housing, employment and 
education have contributed to the exclusion of persons with a migration background, 
leading them to live in ghettoized communities and be seen by the public at large as 
&#8220;unwilling&#8221; to integrate. 
</p>
<p>73. While the importance of addressing new forms of racism and discrimination cannot 
be overstated, the Special Rapporteur also calls attention to the need to address more 
traditional manifestations of racism in the country. In particular, despite the high level of 
awareness within German society of the danger posed to the very foundations of the 
democratic system by right-wing extremism, radical right-wing groups continue to exist, 
particularly youth organizations and nationalist political parties. Parties like the NPD have 
seats in local parliaments and town councils. Although there is a commendable reluctance 
from mainstream parties to collaborate with the NPD or allow it to join coalitions, the NPD 
is still involved and vocal in political debates, including on sensitive questions like 
immigration. While this phenomenon is more prevalent in the east, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to emphasize that these groups and parties are active nationwide. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the situation of refugees and asylum-
seekers in Germany. While he acknowledges that Germany has generally been an open 
country in accepting refugees and asylum-seekers, the Special Rapporteur notes that some 
major concerns were brought to his attention regarding the living conditions of these 
groups. In particular, the condition of reception centres for asylum-seekers was considered 
to be deplorable in some areas. Some reception centres are situated far from large urban 
areas, making it difficult for children to get access to quality education. The Special 
Rapporteur also noted that while most asylum claims are processed within three months, a 
number of cases continue for a longer period, sometimes years, with asylum-seekers being 
confined to reception centres for the duration of the process. The Special Rapporteur is also 
concerned about the limited freedom of movement granted to refugees, who often cannot 
leave their own districts. This limitation also prevents them from seeking employment or 
education away from the locations where they are hosted, contributing to the perpetuation 
of their poor socio-economic status. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur noted during the mission that, as a consequence of 
naturalization rules in Germany, persons with a migration background have been 
underrepresented in the political process, both as voters and as representatives. Such 
underrepresentation has a major impact on the power of such communities to influence 
policymaking and to have a say in the decisions taken in their local communities, as well as 
at the federal level. Many migrant communities have also pointed to what they consider to 
be an unfair practice, whereby European Union citizens who have resided in Germany for 
more than six months are allowed to vote in local elections, whereas foreign citizens who 
have resided in the country for many years are not granted a similar right. Granting 
migrants who have lived in Germany for a certain period of time the right to vote in local 
elections would not only improve their representation in local political institutions, but also 
increase the sense of ownership of these communities over the political process and 
government decisions. 
</p>
<p>76. Despite all the efforts undertaken by the German Government to bring about the 
integration of its migrant communities, the Special Rapporteur notes that such communities 
are still underrepresented in public life, particularly in the civil service. Some central State 
institutions such as the police and the courts have very few members who are from a 
migration background. Similarly, in the media and the private sector such persons are very 
underrepresented. Representation and visibility of minorities are key to ensuring their 
proper integration into German society. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the fact that, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11624 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>in accordance with the &#8220;Charter for Diversity&#8221; supported by all Federal Government 
ministries and agencies, specific measures aimed at increasing the number of persons with a 
migration background in public life are being implemented. While he is encouraged by 
these initiatives, he believes that more comprehensive efforts need to be made, including 
through the adoption of legally binding frameworks, in order to ensure an adequate 
representation of persons with a migration background in State institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
  On the legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The concept of racism both in the legislative framework and in practice 
be expanded beyond a focus on right-wing extremism and towards a comprehensive 
understanding of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in 
line with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Federal Government work alongside the governments of the <i>L&#228;nder</i> 
and the municipal administrations in order to ensure that Germany&#8217;s international 
obligations to fight racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
are implemented at lower levels of government, where many of the competences to 
promote equal treatment truly lie; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency be provided with the human 
and financial resources necessary for it to be present in all 16 <i>L&#228;nder</i>. In addition, its 
mandate should be made more robust, allowing it to investigate complaints brought to 
its attention and to bring proceedings before the courts. Finally, the Agency should be 
empowered to conduct <i>proprio motu</i> investigations, including in areas such as 
employment and housing discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government undertake awareness-raising campaigns in order to 
inform the public about anti-discrimination legislation and the institutional 
framework; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The National Action Plan against Racism be strengthened through the 
involvement of civil society and associations representing migrants. In particular, the 
Action Plan should focus on structural discrimination, legislative reforms and the 
need to strengthen enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Government continue to make use of sections 84 and 85 of the 
Criminal Code and Article 4 (b) of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination in order to declare illegal and prohibit 
organizations which promote and incite racial discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On law enforcement and hate crimes 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that an explicit reference to racism as an 
aggravating circumstance in crimes be added under section 46 of the Criminal Code. 
In addition, the Government should develop additional training for police officers, 
prosecutors and judges on the identification and characterization of racist hate 
crimes, extending the existing training programmes provided by the German Judicial 
Academy. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-11624 
</p>
<p><b>  On the role of the media 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the media engage in an autonomous 
and independent discussion on its role in eliminating prejudice and ensuring that 
there is no perpetuation of stereotypes regarding minority communities. In particular, 
media outlets, in cooperation with universities, should seriously engage in enhanced 
professional training for their professionals, ensuring high standards of conduct and 
sensitivity concerning issues related to racism. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government continue its efforts to implement the recommendations 
presented by the Special Rapporteur on the right to education following his visit to 
Germany in 2006. In particular, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government engage in a profound reflection on how to address the underperformance 
of children with a migration background; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) An appropriate scheme be put in place to ensure that diplomas obtained 
abroad, particularly outside the European Union, are properly recognized so that the 
holders of such diplomas may present themselves to the job market on a competitive 
basis; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The General Equal Treatment Act be amended in order to eliminate the 
exception granted to landlords, allowing them to discriminate in order to &#8220;create and 
maintain stable social structures regarding inhabitants and balanced settlement 
structures, as well as balanced economic, social and cultural conditions&#8221;. While this 
provision may have been created to promote integration, its broad nature can be 
detrimental to such efforts by in effect allowing for discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the wearing of religious symbols 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Restrictions to the wearing of religious symbols should not lead to either overt 
discrimination or camouflaged differentiation depending on the religion or belief 
involved, and exceptions to the prohibition of wearing religious symbols should not be 
tailored to the predominant or incumbent religion or belief.</b>8<b> The Special Rapporteur 
therefore recommends that a review be undertaken of the existing legislation in 
several <i>L&#228;nder</i> which prohibits the wearing of religious symbols by public 
schoolteachers and may have a discriminatory effect on Muslim women. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On refugees and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the Government ensure that 
asylum-seekers&#8217; applications are processed in a short period of time and that 
reception centres for asylum-seekers provide them with reasonable living conditions, 
including access to education and health services. Freedom of movement should be 
ensured while asylum claim applications are pending or when refugee status has been 
granted. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government examine the 
current conditions of reception centres for asylum-seekers in order to ensure that such 
centres provide dignified accommodation and ensure that the economic, social and 
cultural rights of asylum-seekers are respected.

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.2

<p>GE.10-11624 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>In light of article 5 (e) (iv) of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur recommends that all 
unaccompanied minors and separated children between the ages 16 and 18 are 
provided with youth-specific accommodation and protection measures as enshrined in 
section 42 of the Youth Welfare Act. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the representation of persons with a migration background in public institutions 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government consider 
recognizing the right of migrants who have resided in Germany for a reasonable 
period of time to vote in local elections, thus improving the representation of these 
communities in city councils and other municipal bodies. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>As provided by article 1.4 of the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends 
that special measures be taken to ensure an adequate representation of persons with a 
migration background in State institutions &#8211; particularly in the areas of employment, 
education, in political institutions and the civil administration. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government make reference to 
the progress in implementing these recommendations in its future periodic reports to 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, as well as in its national 
reports to the universal periodic review. </b></p>
