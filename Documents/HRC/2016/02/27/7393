<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/34 
</p>
<p>on combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, 
</p>
<p>incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief. In 
</p>
<p>paragraph 12 of the resolution, the Council requested the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare and submit to the Council, at its twenty-eighth 
</p>
<p>session, a comprehensive follow-up report with elaborated conclusions based upon 
</p>
<p>information provided by States on the efforts and measures taken by them for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the action plan outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the resolution, as well 
</p>
<p>as their views on potential follow-up measures for further improvement of the 
</p>
<p>implementation of that plan.  
</p>
<p>2. The report contains a summary of the information received from 15 States; the 
</p>
<p>original texts of the contributions can be consulted in the files of the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Information received from Member States 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Argentina  
</b></p>
<p>3. Article 14 of the Constitution of Argentina states that all inhabitants of the nation 
</p>
<p>enjoy the right to profess their religion freely, in accordance with the law. A Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court ruling, effective since 1994, provides that treaties prevail over national laws and 
</p>
<p>some human rights treaties have constitutional status. Argentina recognizes the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion as enshrined in article 3 of the American Declaration of the Rights and 
</p>
<p>Duties of Man and article 12 of the American Convention on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>4. The National Registry of Religions has registered more than 2,500 officially 
</p>
<p>recognized beliefs and religions, and ensures the promotion and protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>confessional communities.  
</p>
<p>5. The National Plan against Discrimination, based on the Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action, has been approved and provides for extensive national consultations 
</p>
<p>in terms of development and implementation processes.  
</p>
<p>6. In 2012, the National Institute against Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism 
</p>
<p>(INADI) launched the Programme on Religious Diversity and Beliefs and the Forum for 
</p>
<p>Religious Diversity and Beliefs. The main objective of the latter is to approach diversity 
</p>
<p>and non-discrimination from a human rights perspective and to address issues relevant to 
</p>
<p>religious communities. A series of awareness-raising materials are currently being 
</p>
<p>developed to promote dialogue and public awareness about the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and belief. 
</p>
<p>7. In December 2011, INADI launched the Centre for Research, Development and 
</p>
<p>Training on Cultural, Religious and Ethnic Diversity (DIVERSIA). Since its creation, 
</p>
<p>DIVERSIA has conducted various training sessions, seminars and other activities aimed at 
</p>
<p>promoting cultural diversity. 
</p>
<p>8. INADI is mandated to consider complaints by individuals and members of civil 
</p>
<p>society on grounds of discrimination, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. </p>


<p><b>  Australia 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Department of Social Services works to foster a domestic environment of 
</p>
<p>religious tolerance, peace and respect. It funds grants for Diversity and Social Cohesion 
</p>
<p>projects, which promote local awareness and understanding within and between 
</p>
<p>communities through common dialogues and goals, and supports the National Anti-Racism 
</p>
<p>Strategy of the Australian Human Rights Commission and the National Anti-Racism 
</p>
<p>Partnership. 
</p>
<p>10. Through the network of Multicultural Community Liaison Officers, the Department 
</p>
<p>of Social Services engages with communities on the ground. Multicultural Community 
</p>
<p>Liaison Officers focus on creating collaborative relationships and community networks and 
</p>
<p>providing information and &#8220;messaging&#8221;. Officers also work with multicultural communities 
</p>
<p>to identify and help address potential drivers of social conflict and division in diverse areas. 
</p>
<p>This helps to inform strategies that strengthen social cohesion, including the identification 
</p>
<p>of priority needs and locations.  
</p>
<p>11. Advisory bodies and various government departments convene regular interfaith 
</p>
<p>dialogues and initiatives involving religious and community leaders and interfaith experts. 
</p>
<p>The Government protects and promotes religious rights and freedoms through the criminal 
</p>
<p>and civil legislative framework and by actively engaging with the communities and their 
</p>
<p>leaders.  
</p>
<p>12. Through the Attorney-General&#8217;s Department, Australia engages and works with a 
</p>
<p>wide range of community groups and organizations to build resilience to violent extremism, 
</p>
<p>as well as groups that promote radicalization to violent extremism.  
</p>
<p>13. A range of materials have been published that provide guidance on assisting 
</p>
<p>vulnerable persons, including youths, to move away from ideologies that promote the use of 
</p>
<p>violence to achieve social change. The guidance emphasizes that everyone has the right to 
</p>
<p>express their beliefs and group interests openly, but that a willingness to use or support the 
</p>
<p>use of violence to achieve political, religious or ideological goals is unlawful (see 
</p>
<p>www.livingsafetogether.gov.au). 
</p>
<p>14. Strong vilification laws are in place, such as those found in the Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination Act 1975, which strike a balance between the right to freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>and freedom from racial discrimination and racial vilification. There are strong domestic 
</p>
<p>criminal laws against urging violence, including between religious and cultural groups. 
</p>
<p>Where there is a basis for suspecting that activities of individuals or groups are of security 
</p>
<p>concern, they are reviewed and investigated by relevant law enforcement and security 
</p>
<p>authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan  
</b></p>
<p>15. The State Committee on Religious Associations of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
</p>
<p>outlined several measures taken during 2014 in Baku and other regions aimed at anchoring 
</p>
<p>in law the rights and freedoms of all confessions represented in the country. Such measures 
</p>
<p>were taken with a view to combating religious intolerance and violence, eliminating 
</p>
<p>situations causing aggressive and extremist behaviour, minimizing religious fanaticism, and 
</p>
<p>to facilitating the coexistence of the followers of different faiths around common 
</p>
<p>religious/moral values. 
</p>
<p>16. During 2014, two-day regional conferences were held in the cities of Ismayilli, 
</p>
<p>Guba, Sheki and Barda, at which prominent speakers delivered speeches and discussions 
</p>
<p>were held around key themes.  </p>


<p>17. Within the framework of &#8220;peace month&#8221;, which is held annually from 21 August to 
</p>
<p>21 September, the Committee organized several awareness-raising meetings in the cities of 
</p>
<p>Zagatala, Goychay and Lankaran, attended by representatives of various sectors of society, 
</p>
<p>on the promotion of peace and human rights and religious tolerance. A mini-football 
</p>
<p>tournament, for the Cup of Tolerance, was held in April&#8211;May 2014 among religious 
</p>
<p>communities. Teams of the different confessions, as well as representatives of the Muslim, 
</p>
<p>Christian and Jewish communities, participated in the tournament.  
</p>
<p>18. Significant funds were allocated to the Development of Religious Culture 
</p>
<p>Foundation with the aim of strengthening the promotion of religious culture, tolerance and 
</p>
<p>interreligious and intercultural dialogue, and the Baku International Centre for 
</p>
<p>Multiculturalism was established. Under an order of the Cabinet of Ministers, funds were 
</p>
<p>allocated to religious communities.  
</p>
<p>19. The Tolerance Network of Religious Communities, an electronic network, was 
</p>
<p>established; Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities demonstrating social activeness 
</p>
<p>participate in the network. Twenty religious communities have been provided with 
</p>
<p>computers in order to improve the functioning of communities in social life with a view to 
</p>
<p>promoting universal values, strengthening the principle of intercommunal networking and 
</p>
<p>mutual cooperation, and providing technical education to religious communities. Five joint 
</p>
<p>projects aimed at resolving social problems by involving religious communities of different 
</p>
<p>beliefs have already been supported.  
</p>
<p><b>  El Salvador  
</b></p>
<p>20. The right of everyone to freely profess a religion or belief is enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. Article 3 provides that all persons are equal before the law and in their 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of civil rights and that no restrictions based on nationality, race, sex or religion 
</p>
<p>may be established. 
</p>
<p>21. Any officer, employee, agent or public authority denying individuals rights under 
</p>
<p>the Constitution on grounds of nationality, race, sex, religion or other status, or otherwise, 
</p>
<p>shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years and disqualification from office 
</p>
<p>or employment for the same period (art. 292 of the Penal Code). 
</p>
<p>22. The State recognizes the diversity of religions, faiths and churches, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with article 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees the free exercise of all religions, 
</p>
<p>without limitation other than by morality and public order. In accordance with articles 3 and 
</p>
<p>25 of the Constitution, initiatives have been promoted to build and strengthen a culture of 
</p>
<p>peace, respect and tolerance among the Salvadoran population.  
</p>
<p>23. On 29 September 2014, the National Council for Citizen Security and Coexistence 
</p>
<p>was created to provide a forum where proposals and solutions to insecurity and violence 
</p>
<p>existing in the country can be addressed. Representatives of the Catholic Church, the 
</p>
<p>Lutheran Church, the Anglican Church, the Evangelical Church, business associations, the 
</p>
<p>Attorney General&#8217;s Office (Fiscal General de la Rep&#8206;&#250;blica), the Association of 
</p>
<p>Municipalities of the Republic of El Salvador (COMURES), various government portfolios, 
</p>
<p>political parties and the media participate in the forum. 
</p>
<p>24. Actions violating an individual&#8217;s freedom of religion include impairing, interrupting 
</p>
<p>or disrupting the free exercise of religion; making public declarations against beliefs; and 
</p>
<p>destroying religious objects. Such offences are to be punished by imprisonment for six 
</p>
<p>months to two years. The sanctions of imprisonment are greater if the offence is committed 
</p>
<p>with publicity and/or repeatedly (art. 296 of the Penal Code). There is no record of cases 
</p>
<p>brought or prosecuted for reasons of intolerance, stigmatization or discrimination on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of religious practices or beliefs. </p>


<p>25. Catholic, Episcopal Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed Calvinist, Baptist, Baha&#8217;i, 
</p>
<p>Buddhist, Jewish and Muslim leaders have joined the El Salvador affiliate of Religions for 
</p>
<p>Peace, with a view to coordinating and collaborating on joint actions. 
</p>
<p>26. Religiously motivated violence is prevented by the State, and article 7 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution prohibits the existence of armed groups of a political, religious or union 
</p>
<p>nature.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to education, the State ensures access and equality for all people, as set 
</p>
<p>out in article 58 of the Constitution. Public schools are secular, while most private schools 
</p>
<p>are of Christian denomination, but all educational institutions operate freely and must meet 
</p>
<p>the operational requirements set by the Ministry of Education. 
</p>
<p><b>  France 
</b></p>
<p>28. France stated that an interministerial committee against racism and anti-Semitism 
</p>
<p>(DILCRA) was charged with proposing and following the development of a national policy 
</p>
<p>against racism and anti-Semitism. The policy provides for awareness-raising activities and 
</p>
<p>training among diverse sectors of the public (State authorities, victims and Internet users) 
</p>
<p>focused on combating stereotypes and prejudice in order to prevent racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>29. The initial and continuing training of public authorities was identified as a specific 
</p>
<p>task. As of 2015, all of the approximately 60,000 new representatives of the State will 
</p>
<p>benefit from an obligatory awareness-raising training programme. Supervisors will train 
</p>
<p>and mobilize their staff through seminars and training modules, in which the supervisors 
</p>
<p>have already participated. DILCRA is working with ministers of the interior at the 
</p>
<p>department level and ministers of education and ecology on this policy. Teacher training 
</p>
<p>institutions (<i>&#233;coles sup&#233;rieures du professorat et de l</i>&#8217;<i>&#233;ducation</i>) have also been mobilized 
</p>
<p>to ensure implementation of the national training policy. 
</p>
<p>30. France said that it was convinced of the fundamental importance of raising 
</p>
<p>awareness among young people; an &#8220;educational continuum&#8221; targeting them would be put 
</p>
<p>in place in schools and universities. As of 2015, in order to prevent stereotyping and 
</p>
<p>discrimination, awareness-raising programmes will be integrated into a national common 
</p>
<p>set of teaching materials focused on secular values. The training will include elements on 
</p>
<p>citizenship and cultural and historical heritage, and pedagogical tools aimed at fighting 
</p>
<p>racial hatred. A DILCRA working group will also work on creating linkages between 
</p>
<p>cultural establishments and school groups.  
</p>
<p>31. Practical tools for use in the world of sports, for youth and for use in popular 
</p>
<p>education have been designed. Several projects have been undertaken in the past months, 
</p>
<p>including a legal guide on the fight against &#8220;incivility&#8221;, violence and discrimination in 
</p>
<p>sports; a teaching kit entitled &#8220;Toward sports without violence &#8230;&#8221; aimed at preventing 
</p>
<p>racism, issued in 2014; a guide on good practices against racism and anti-Semitism; and a 
</p>
<p>history book on racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia in sports in France during the 
</p>
<p>twentieth century, prepared by the Comit&#233; d&#8217;histoire des minist&#232;res charg&#233;s de la Jeunesse 
</p>
<p>et des Sports. Under this national policy innovative teaching and pedagogical actions will 
</p>
<p>be undertaken by associations on the ground.  
</p>
<p><b>  Germany 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Federal Government actively supports networking, democratic consciousness 
</p>
<p>and participation, education, and the promotion of civic engagement through the Forum 
</p>
<p>against Racism; the government-funded programme entitled &#8220;Cohesion through </p>


<p>participation&#8221;; the Federal Agency for Civic Education (Bundeszentrale f&#252;r politische 
</p>
<p>Bildung); and the Alliance for Democracy and Tolerance. 
</p>
<p>33. The Federal Ministry of the Interior has, for many years, successfully promoted 
</p>
<p>Christian-Jewish cooperation and interreligious and intercultural dialogue between 
</p>
<p>Christians and Jews, in recent years expanding the dialogue to a trialogue at the 
</p>
<p>international level with Muslims. In 2006, the German Islam Conference was launched to 
</p>
<p>establish a permanent communication process between the German state (Federal 
</p>
<p>Government, Federal L&#228;nder, municipalities) and the representatives of Muslims living in 
</p>
<p>Germany (see www.deutsche-islam-konferenz.de).  
</p>
<p>34. The Federal Minister of the Interior delivered a speech on the occasion of the Day of 
</p>
<p>Action against Hatred and Violence, which was organized by Muslim associations in 10 
</p>
<p>cities all over Germany; activities marking the Day were held on 19 September 2014 after 
</p>
<p>Friday prayers, and included sit-ins and peace prayers. In addition, in 2014, the Federal 
</p>
<p>Ministry of the Interior funded projects on interreligious and intercultural dialogue. 
</p>
<p>35. In Germany, offences involving discrimination against persons based on religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, in particular violent offences, are recorded separately and analysed as hate crimes, 
</p>
<p>under the heading of politically motivated crime. Germany stated that approximately 90 per 
</p>
<p>cent of those offences had been attributed to right-wing-oriented and politically motivated 
</p>
<p>crime. In accordance with the criminal law, in cases of hate crimes involving contempt for 
</p>
<p>other human beings, which includes discrimination or violence based on religion or faith, 
</p>
<p>the courts generally issue stricter sentences; if the crime entailed murder, courts consider 
</p>
<p>the offender to have acted on base motives (sect. 211 of the Criminal Code). Specific forms 
</p>
<p>of hate crime involving religious aspects are also punishable, depending on the individual 
</p>
<p>case, as incitement to hatred (sect. 130 of the Criminal Code), as the defamation of 
</p>
<p>religious associations (sect. 166 of the Criminal Code) or as insults (sect. 185 of the 
</p>
<p>German Criminal Code), if the offence was targeted at individuals. According to the Police 
</p>
<p>Crime Statistics for 2012, 2,506 cases of incitement to hatred and 47 cases of defamation of 
</p>
<p>religious associations were reported in 2012, with the resolution rates being 63.8 per cent 
</p>
<p>and 44.7 per cent, respectively. Insults with a religious aspect are recorded under the 
</p>
<p>subheading &#8220;religion&#8221;, provided that an application for criminal prosecution is filed. 
</p>
<p>36. Police work to combat hate crimes includes systematically prosecuting hate crimes 
</p>
<p>as offences against State security and recording them separately; cooperating with 
</p>
<p>counselling bodies and supporting projects, associations and institutions providing 
</p>
<p>assistance to victims; undertaking differentiated analysis of the number of cases nationally, 
</p>
<p>in order to elaborate potential prevention measures; and cataloguing measures to combat 
</p>
<p>politically motivated crime in order to perceive, record and combat relevant offences in a 
</p>
<p>more targeted manner. The police take regular preventive measures, such as stepping up 
</p>
<p>physical protection or police controls with regard to especially vulnerable locations, for 
</p>
<p>example, Jewish cemeteries. Germany stated that the Federal Council (Bundesrat) had 
</p>
<p>decided to initiate procedures before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban a right-wing 
</p>
<p>extremist party, with the active support of the Federal Government. 
</p>
<p>37. In 2011, the Federal Ministry of the Interior launched the Security Partnership 
</p>
<p>Initiative, a body comprised of representatives of the Federal Government, the L&#228;nder, 
</p>
<p>security authorities and Muslims, aimed at increasing public awareness of the problem of 
</p>
<p>radicalization of young people, to initiate projects and to provide financial support for 
</p>
<p>successful projects carried out by Muslims and security authorities at the local level (see 
</p>
<p>www.initiative-sicherheitspartnerschaft.de). </p>


<p><b>  Greece 
</b></p>
<p>38. In October 2014, Law 4301, a new law on the organization of the legal form of 
</p>
<p>religious communities in Greece, was adopted by the Hellenic Parliament. The concept of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;religious legal person&#8221; was legislated in Greece for the first time, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>attributing the appropriate legal form to religious communities and regulating the issue of 
</p>
<p>their organization. Thus, the fundamental right to religious freedom has been strengthened, 
</p>
<p>and the collective expression of religious beliefs of all members of religious communities 
</p>
<p>has been facilitated. 
</p>
<p>39. European Union Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of November 2008 
</p>
<p>has been implemented through Law 4285/2014 (amendment of Law 927/1979) on 
</p>
<p>combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal 
</p>
<p>law. Articles 1 and 2 of Law 4285/2014 provide for sanctions against anyone who publicly 
</p>
<p>incites to actions creating discrimination, hatred or violence against a group of persons or a 
</p>
<p>member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent, national or 
</p>
<p>ethnic origin, sexual orientation or disability, jeopardizing public order.  
</p>
<p>40. Sanctions are also prescribed for those who incite such actions resulting in the 
</p>
<p>commission of a crime. The same sanctions are provided for anyone who publicly 
</p>
<p>condones, trivializes or denies war crimes, crimes of genocide or crimes against humanity, 
</p>
<p>including the Holocaust and crimes of Nazism, that have been recognized in decisions of 
</p>
<p>international courts or by the Hellenic Parliament. Moreover, sanctions for the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned offences are provided vis-&#224;-vis public servants. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>41. Article 44 of the Irish Constitution specifically protects religious freedom and the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression of convictions and opinions. The law also provides for 
</p>
<p>strong protection against discrimination on nine grounds, including religious belief, through 
</p>
<p>the Employment Equality Acts, which cover discrimination in the workplace, and the Equal 
</p>
<p>Status Acts, which provide for protection against discrimination in the provision of goods 
</p>
<p>and services. The legislation is designed to promote equality, prohibit discrimination &#8212; 
</p>
<p>direct, indirect and by association &#8212; and victimization, and allows for positive action 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure full equality. Irish legislation also provides for remedies for those who 
</p>
<p>have suffered discrimination.  
</p>
<p>42. The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, makes it an offence, inter alia, to 
</p>
<p>use words, publish or distribute written material, or broadcast any visual images or sounds 
</p>
<p>that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended to or, having regard to all the 
</p>
<p>circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.  
</p>
<p>43. Where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage or public order offences 
</p>
<p>are committed against a person based on their religion or belief, the offences are prosecuted 
</p>
<p>as generic offences through the wider criminal law, but judges are required to take such 
</p>
<p>aggravating factors into account at sentencing. 
</p>
<p>44. In 2012, the Government established the Convention on the Constitution, which 
</p>
<p>published its sixth report in January 2014, in which it recommended that a referendum 
</p>
<p>should be held with a view to removing the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>The Government&#8217;s response was presented to the D&#225;il (in the Irish Parliament) in October 
</p>
<p>2014 and the referendum will take place at an appropriate date to be decided by the 
</p>
<p>Government after the necessary consultations have been completed and the required 
</p>
<p>legislation has been prepared. A vote in favour of removing the offence of blasphemy from 
</p>
<p>the Constitution would permit removing the legislative provision for the offence.  </p>


<p>45. The Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration in Ireland is designed to cherish the 
</p>
<p>memory of all of the victims of the Holocaust and to provide lessons from the past. The 
</p>
<p>inclusion of all victim groups is fundamental to the commemoration, and education about 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitism and all forms of intolerance is important. The Holocaust Educational Trust 
</p>
<p>Ireland advises and assists the Government with organizing the annual commemoration 
</p>
<p>with the involvement of the Department of Justice and Equality (through the Office for the 
</p>
<p>Promotion of Migrant Integration), Dublin City Council, Dublin Maccabi Charitable Trust 
</p>
<p>and the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland. 
</p>
<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Constitution provides specific protection for freedom of conscience and 
</p>
<p>religious experience, taking into consideration private, collective and institutional aspects 
</p>
<p>(arts. 2, 3, 7, 8 and 19). In accordance with article 3, the non-discrimination principle 
</p>
<p>constitutes one of the main pillars of the basic security system. The Government has created 
</p>
<p>comprehensive legislation by translating both European Union Directive 2000/43/EC and 
</p>
<p>European Union Directive 2000/78/EC in order to prohibit all forms of discrimination 
</p>
<p>based on race or ethnic origin, in any area or sector, both private and public, and to regulate 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation as regards employment and occupation.  
</p>
<p>47. Italy has developed a regulatory reference framework to combat hate crimes by 
</p>
<p>adopting measures to support potential victims of discriminatory actions and conduct and 
</p>
<p>by means of a system of penalties. The legislation provides for the punishment of 
</p>
<p>organizations, associations, movements or groups that have among their aims incitement to 
</p>
<p>discrimination or to violence motivated by racial, ethnic or religious reasons. It sets out 
</p>
<p>aggravating circumstances for all crimes committed on the ground of discrimination or 
</p>
<p>racial hatred. By law, judicial authorities have to verify any existence of criminal content in 
</p>
<p>documents, speeches and programmes made by political representatives.  
</p>
<p>48. The Office of Studies and Institutional Relations under the Presidency of the 
</p>
<p>Council of Ministers is in continuous contact with and cooperates with the national 
</p>
<p>organization of the Jewish community, mainly regarding issues related to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the <i>intesa</i>1 and problems of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>49. Since 2010, the Committee for Italian Islam has focused on issues of integration and 
</p>
<p>the exercise of civil rights. It has issued position papers, endorsed by the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior, on the Islamic veil and places and ministries of worship. The National Office 
</p>
<p>against Racial Discrimination (UNAR), established at the Department for Equal 
</p>
<p>Opportunities under the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and operating as a national 
</p>
<p>equality body, is entrusted by law with the promotion of equality and the eradication of 
</p>
<p>discrimination; to that end, it assists victims and monitors discriminatory phenomena in 
</p>
<p>Italy.  
</p>
<p>50. The Observatory for Security against Discriminatory Acts (OSCAD), established in 
</p>
<p>2010 in response to the demand for security from potential victims of discrimination, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A special agreement between the Government and a religious confession, which provides, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>for the autonomy and independence of a denomination and for issues fundamental for believers and 
</p>
<p>religious practices. Such agreements generally include provisions for spiritual assistance in collective 
</p>
<p>institutions; education; recognition of civil marriages; fiscal treatment and financial relations between 
</p>
<p>the State and the religious denomination; protection of places of worship and cultural and historical 
</p>
<p>assets; guarantees regarding cultural identity; free exercise of worship;  religious festivities; and the 
</p>
<p>organization and management of religious confessions. </p>


<p>adopts a comprehensive approach, including the intervention of police forces to prevent and 
</p>
<p>repress hate crimes.  
</p>
<p>51. The Government of Italy stated that it was fully committed to promoting 
</p>
<p>interreligious dialogue and to preventing and resolving situations of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violation of the right to religious freedom by local governments, in particular concerning 
</p>
<p>the burial of non-Catholics and the construction of places of worship. In order to fight all 
</p>
<p>forms of religious discrimination and societal prejudice, particularly against Jewish and 
</p>
<p>Muslim communities, the Government continues, inter alia, to host meetings to increase 
</p>
<p>educational awareness and interreligious dialogue, while prominent religious and 
</p>
<p>government officials encourage mutual understanding. In recent years, the Ministry of the 
</p>
<p>Interior funded several projects to promote interfaith dialogue within the European 
</p>
<p>Integration Fund framework.  
</p>
<p>52. Italy indicated that many training activities, including human rights education for all 
</p>
<p>law enforcement agencies, had been introduced. The School of Civil Administration offers 
</p>
<p>training courses to law enforcement officials on issues related to anti-Semitism and the 
</p>
<p>Holocaust. Several central and local administrations organized initiatives aimed at raising 
</p>
<p>public awareness.  
</p>
<p><b>  Norway 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion is responsible for 
</p>
<p>coordinating integration policies for immigrants and their children, to ensure that national 
</p>
<p>policies in various fields function in unison and contribute towards achieving the goals of 
</p>
<p>equal rights and duties. Dialogue and cooperation between different religious and &#8220;life 
</p>
<p>stance&#8221; (non-religious) communities can foster mutual understanding and achieve respect 
</p>
<p>and appreciation for both differences and common values. Financial grants have been 
</p>
<p>provided for the Council for Religious and Life Stance Communities, the Christian Council 
</p>
<p>of Norway and the Islamic Council of Norway. 
</p>
<p>54. Authorities have a developed a system to prevent religiously motivated hate crimes, 
</p>
<p>which involves municipal units, local police, political parties and civil society. Police 
</p>
<p>councils and services for the coordination of local crime prevention have been set up in 
</p>
<p>more than 300 municipalities.  
</p>
<p>55. In 2014, the Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion funded the 
</p>
<p>Norwegian campaign entitled &#8220;Young people combating hate speech online&#8221;, as part of the 
</p>
<p>European No Hate Speech Movement. The campaign is aimed at combating discrimination, 
</p>
<p>harassment and hate speech on the Internet, and at supporting young people and groups in 
</p>
<p>society who can be especially subjected to it.  
</p>
<p>56. Norway stated that section 135 a of the Criminal Code criminalized the uttering of 
</p>
<p>discriminatory or hateful statements, which were defined as threatening or insulting anyone, 
</p>
<p>or inciting hatred or persecution of or contempt for anyone because of his or her skin 
</p>
<p>colour, national or ethnic origin, religion or life stance, or homosexuality, lifestyle or 
</p>
<p>orientation.  
</p>
<p>57. The Government has an action plan against radicalization and violent extremism. 
</p>
<p>Among its 30 measures, a project is to be launched to prevent hate rhetoric and 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitudes on the Internet. Oslo police have set up a special hate-crime unit. 
</p>
<p>Other measures taken to improve the response to hate crimes are police officer training 
</p>
<p>involving non-governmental organizations and regular round tables with civil society to 
</p>
<p>establish dialogue and cooperation.  </p>


<p>58. Since 2012, the Government has also funded a project for the prevention of anti-
</p>
<p>Semitism, racism and undemocratic attitudes (DEMBRA), led by the Centre for Studies of 
</p>
<p>the Holocaust and Religious Minorities, in cooperation with the European Wergeland 
</p>
<p>Centre and the University of Oslo. The Ministry of Education and Research commissioned 
</p>
<p>a study on how indigenous peoples and national, ethnic and religious minorities are 
</p>
<p>described, and how questions related to immigration and cultural diversity, anti-Semitism, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia, racism, extremism, terrorism and radicalization are discussed, in textbooks for 
</p>
<p>schools. The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training launched a guide on 
</p>
<p>national minorities for staff in kindergartens and schools in 2014. 
</p>
<p>59. The anti-discrimination act prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p>and requires public authorities to make active, targeted and systematic efforts to promote 
</p>
<p>equality irrespective of ethnicity, religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>60. The State and the municipalities have a financial responsibility for the Church of 
</p>
<p>Norway. For several decades, other religious and life stance communities have had a 
</p>
<p>statutory right to claim an annual financial grant per member of the community from both 
</p>
<p>the State and the municipalities. The grants scheme secures equal financial treatment of all 
</p>
<p>religious and life stance communities in Norway. About 700 such communities, including 
</p>
<p>Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and humanistic communities, receive financial 
</p>
<p>grants under the scheme.  
</p>
<p>61. Norway noted that no allegations had been made with regard to racial profiling. 
</p>
<p><b>  Spain 
</b></p>
<p>62. In Spain, four key developments and activities were carried out to implement the 
</p>
<p>action plan outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 of Council resolution 25/34. The Advisory 
</p>
<p>Commission on Religious Practice (CALR) was modified by Royal Decree 932/2013 in 
</p>
<p>order to enhance the presence of religious groups in the Commission and to enrich the 
</p>
<p>space and dialogue of confessions within the Commission. New measures have been 
</p>
<p>created to improve knowledge of the situation of religious freedom in Spain and, therefore, 
</p>
<p>of religious groups, including the preparation and submission of an annual report to the 
</p>
<p>Government on the situation of the right to religious freedom in Spain, and the collection of 
</p>
<p>information on action by the public administration related to the development and exercise 
</p>
<p>of the right to religious freedom, thus strengthening the ability of CALR to obtain 
</p>
<p>information on situations that can affect religious groups and believers and to raise its 
</p>
<p>conclusions with government authorities. Specific working groups study and analyse issues 
</p>
<p>affecting religious groups with a view to finding out more about their situation and 
</p>
<p>identifying joint solutions, alternatives or initiatives to improve social life. 
</p>
<p>63. Spain participates in the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre for 
</p>
<p>Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue, located in Vienna, which seeks to enable, 
</p>
<p>empower and encourage dialogue among followers of different religions and cultures 
</p>
<p>around the world. In November 2013, a government delegation from Spain participated in 
</p>
<p>the international conference entitled &#8220;The image of the other&#8221; aimed at implementing best 
</p>
<p>practices in interreligious and intercultural education developed in the Euro-Mediterranean 
</p>
<p>region. 
</p>
<p>64. The Observatory for Religious Pluralism in Spain developed a knowledge transfer 
</p>
<p>tool underpinned by an agreement among the Ministry of Justice, the Spanish Federation of 
</p>
<p>Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP) and the Pluralism and Coexistence Foundation for 
</p>
<p>public management of religious diversity. The Observatory produces management guides 
</p>
<p>and serves as a reference portal for religious groups and communities and confessions, </p>


<p>researchers and the general public. The European Commission designated the Observatory 
</p>
<p>as a good practice in combating religious intolerance (see www.observatorioreligion.es).  
</p>
<p>65. The Pluralism and Coexistence Foundation developed a training plan related to the 
</p>
<p>leadership and management of religious organizations and groups. Its general objectives are 
</p>
<p>to increase knowledge of the regulatory framework concerning freedom of conscience and 
</p>
<p>religion in Spain and of the management procedures necessary for the constitution and 
</p>
<p>functioning of religious entities and their places of worship, and to improve the dialogue 
</p>
<p>between religious entities and municipal authorities. The Foundation collaborates with 
</p>
<p>various municipal authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Syrian Arab Republic 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Syrian Arab Republic indicated that media discussions and talk shows to raise 
</p>
<p>awareness about religious values and the risks associated with hatred and incitement had 
</p>
<p>been broadcast in the country.  
</p>
<p>67. Networks and dialogues in which all religious leaders, as well as politicians and 
</p>
<p>academics, take part have been established. The national educational curriculum is used to 
</p>
<p>maintain moderate religious values and to encourage tolerance domestically, and a new e-
</p>
<p>school project was established to promote opportunities for students to have access to and 
</p>
<p>follow Ministry of Education curricula. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that, 
</p>
<p>unfortunately, given the current conflict situation, &#8220;books and leaflets were introduced by 
</p>
<p>terrorist groups&#8221; to promote &#8220;<i>takhfiris</i>&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>68. The Government reported that it was aware of the dangerous role the media could 
</p>
<p>play in the promotion of incitement, noting the use of media to promote fatwas that justified 
</p>
<p>terrorism and sexual slavery, and that incited discrimination, violence and destruction of the 
</p>
<p>religious sites of others and the killing of minorities.  
</p>
<p>69. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that a new mechanism had been adopted to 
</p>
<p>decrease tensions among specific religious groups, tensions that had not previously existed 
</p>
<p>in the country. The Ministry of Religious Affairs has adopted a mechanism that enables it 
</p>
<p>to oversee all religious groups, achieve equality among them and integrate them in the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s activities and planning. The role of the Ministry of National Reconciliation is to 
</p>
<p>protect Syrian society, especially during the ongoing conflict, and support has been 
</p>
<p>provided to religious leaders, particularly through consultation with them. The Union of 
</p>
<p>Scholars of Bilad al-Sham (the Levant) was assigned to promote moderate religious values 
</p>
<p>and improve understanding between all sects and schools of thought. Meetings between 
</p>
<p>Muslim and Christian leaders and joint training and seminars have been organized to 
</p>
<p>promote tolerance and equality in all components of Syrian society. 
</p>
<p>70. Religious freedom is encouraged through the enhancement of the capacity of 
</p>
<p>individuals of different religions to profess their religion. The Syrian Constitution 
</p>
<p>guarantees the right to practise all religious beliefs and the social diversity of the Syrian 
</p>
<p>society as a national heritage which serves to improve national unity. Freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>applies equally to all citizens in the enjoyment of rights and obligations and guarantees the 
</p>
<p>right to contribute to economic, social and cultural life, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>71. The Syrian Arab Republic stated that the phenomenon of religious profiling was 
</p>
<p>non-existent in the country; however, existing laws, such as the Penal Code and the 
</p>
<p>Military Penal Code, were in place to combat it.  
</p>
<p>72. The Syrian Arab Republic suggested actions to address issues of incitement to racial, 
</p>
<p>national and religious hatred, including the following: (a) use the Rabat Plan of Action on 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement </p>


<p>to discrimination, hostility or violence as a framework to combat incitement to hatred; (b) 
</p>
<p>promote tolerance in the educational system in order to combat discrimination in the 
</p>
<p>educational system; (c) promote the depoliticization of religion; (d) continue dialogues at 
</p>
<p>all levels and between countries as a way to &#8220;guarantee the specificity of all nations&#8221;; and 
</p>
<p>(e) adopt mechanisms to hold accountable those countries that have jurisdiction over 
</p>
<p>individuals and organizations that incite religious intolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Turkey 
</b></p>
<p>73. Freedom of religion and conscience is guaranteed by the Constitution and relevant 
</p>
<p>legislation. Minority rights in Turkey are regulated in accordance with the Treaty of 
</p>
<p>Lausanne, under which Turkish citizens belonging to non-Muslim minorities fall within the 
</p>
<p>scope of the term &#8220;minority&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>74. A number of foreign clergy have been registered in Turkey to serve in places of 
</p>
<p>worship with the relevant working permit. There are 387 places of worship belonging to 
</p>
<p>non-Muslim communities, including 87 churches run by foreigners residing in Turkey. 
</p>
<p>Non-Muslim places of worship are administered by their own associations or foundations 
</p>
<p>and property rights regarding places of worship rest with the real or legal persons who 
</p>
<p>founded them. A decree amending the Law on Foundations was published in August 2011, 
</p>
<p>improving the situation of non-Muslim community foundations regarding the registration of 
</p>
<p>their property.  
</p>
<p>75. On 13 May 2010, the Office of the Prime Minister issued a circular confirming that 
</p>
<p>all Turkish citizens, independent of their religious communities, constitute an inseparable 
</p>
<p>part of Turkey, and urging all related government institutions and offices to act with the 
</p>
<p>utmost diligence for the elimination of problems encountered by non-Muslim minorities. 
</p>
<p>76. Positive steps continued to be taken in favour of different faith groups in the areas of 
</p>
<p>education and culture. The Ministry of National Education reviews course materials 
</p>
<p>annually to remove connotations that might be perceived as discriminatory by different 
</p>
<p>faith groups. Pursuant to a request from Assyrian citizens, the Ankara 13th Administrative 
</p>
<p>Court has ruled that Assyrian language courses can be delivered along with the curriculum 
</p>
<p>of the Ministry of Education on certain days or during certain hours of the week in a 
</p>
<p>preschool to be opened under a community foundation. 
</p>
<p>77. Permission was granted to a Greek minority school in G&#246;k&#231;eada to reopen in the 
</p>
<p>academic year 2013/14, following the demand of the Greek community.  
</p>
<p>78. Since 28 February 2012, newspapers belonging to minorities, as defined in the 
</p>
<p>Treaty of Lausanne, have been allowed to publish official advertisements upon written 
</p>
<p>application. 
</p>
<p>79. The &#8220;democratization package&#8221; of September 2013 brought about significant 
</p>
<p>improvements in the area of freedom of religion and conscience, as the ban on women 
</p>
<p>wearing headscarves in public service was lifted and sanctions for preventing persons from 
</p>
<p>individual worship and fulfilling requirements of religious beliefs were introduced in the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Penal Code. Lifestyle is protected by law and, for the first time, hate crimes are 
</p>
<p>punishable under the Code.  
</p>
<p>80. The title of article 122 of the Turkish Penal Code was changed from 
</p>
<p>&#8220;discrimination&#8221; to &#8220;hatred and discrimination&#8221; within the framework of Law No. 6529 of 
</p>
<p>2 March 2014, and the penalty for the offence has been increased. Article 216 of the 
</p>
<p>Turkish Penal Code regulates the prevention of incitement to social, racial, religious or 
</p>
<p>regional enmity or hatred. In addition, under article 115 of the Code the act of hindering the 
</p>
<p>exercise of freedom of belief, thought and conviction is punishable, while article 153 </p>


<p>penalizes acts of damage to places of worship, such as churches and mosques, and the 
</p>
<p>property used in such places, and to cemeteries and the facilities and protective structures 
</p>
<p>thereof.  
</p>
<p>81. Turkey cited a number of other laws and regulations that prohibit discrimination on 
</p>
<p>the basis of race, language, sex, religion, political opinion, nationality or social origin.  
</p>
<p><b>  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>82. The United Kingdom outlined key legislation to protect victims and tackle 
</p>
<p>offenders, including provisions setting out specific offences relating to stirring up hatred on 
</p>
<p>the grounds of race, religion, belief and sexual orientation (under Part III and Part IIIA of 
</p>
<p>the Public Order Act 1986 as amended); separate racially and religiously aggravated 
</p>
<p>offences, which carry a higher maximum penalty than non-aggravated offences (under the 
</p>
<p>Crime and Disorder Act 1998); and powers for the courts to increase the sentence of an 
</p>
<p>offender convicted of a crime where hostility towards the victim is based on several 
</p>
<p>grounds, to reflect the seriousness of hate crime (Criminal Justice Act 2003). 
</p>
<p>83. In March 2012, a cross-Government action plan was published in England to tackle 
</p>
<p>hate crime, bringing together the work of a wide range of departments and agencies to: 
</p>
<p>prevent hate crime; increase reporting and victims&#8217; access to support; and improve the 
</p>
<p>operational response to hate crimes. It includes specific work programmes to tackle anti-
</p>
<p>Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred and actions to better engage with disabled and 
</p>
<p>transgender persons, Gypsy, Traveller and Roma communities and new migrants and to 
</p>
<p>tackle racism, homophobia and transphobia in sports.  
</p>
<p>84. Recently, a review of actions to tackle hate crime was conducted. Close cooperation 
</p>
<p>with a wide range of voluntary sector and community representatives, front-line 
</p>
<p>organizations and the Government&#8217;s Independent Advisory Group on Hate Crime is 
</p>
<p>ongoing, which provides insight into the day-to-day experience of hate crime.  
</p>
<p>85. In that context, one of the challenges that have continued to evolve is the task of 
</p>
<p>removing hate material from mass media channels such as the Internet, while protecting 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression. The Government is working with the police and the Independent 
</p>
<p>Advisory Group on Hate Crime to build relationships with leading social media providers 
</p>
<p>and to improve their response to offensive and illegal hate-related content online, including 
</p>
<p>through support to the international working group of the Inter-Parliamentary Coalition for 
</p>
<p>Combating Antisemitism, to find collaborative solutions to reduce the harm caused by 
</p>
<p>hatred on the Internet.  
</p>
<p>86. With regard to anti-Muslim hatred, police forces across the country work together 
</p>
<p>with Muslim communities and organizations to provide reassurance, security measures and 
</p>
<p>safety advice. In some areas 24-hour police patrols are in place to safeguard high-profile 
</p>
<p>premises. The United Kingdom outlined a number of projects under way, including: (a) the 
</p>
<p>first cross-Government working group on anti-Muslim hatred; (b) the launch of Tell 
</p>
<p>MAMA, the first third-party reporting service to record incidents and support victims of 
</p>
<p>anti-Muslim hatred; (c) the hosting of the first Srebrenica Memorial Day in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom; (d) support from the Department of Communities and Local Government for 
</p>
<p>social media workshops aimed at countering hatred online in Birmingham and Leeds, 
</p>
<p>following two initial workshops held in London and Manchester; and (e) a number of road 
</p>
<p>shows held by the Department of Communities and Local Government around the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom in March and April 2014 to promote the work of integration and combat anti-
</p>
<p>Muslim hatred, and to engage with the communities to find out what more the Government 
</p>
<p>can do. </p>


<p>87. With regard to anti-Semitism, the United Kingdom continues to be a strong 
</p>
<p>supporter of work in international organizations to combat anti-Semitism. It plays a leading 
</p>
<p>role in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) activities in 
</p>
<p>relation to the Berlin Declaration to combat hate crime, including anti-Semitic hate crime, 
</p>
<p>and was represented at ministerial level at the OSCE conference in November 2014 
</p>
<p>marking the tenth anniversary of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>88. With the London Jewish Cultural Centre, the United Kingdom organized two 
</p>
<p>seminars for journalists on how to report sensitively on difficult issues without fuelling 
</p>
<p>anti-Semitism. 
</p>
<p>89. The United Kingdom is the Chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance 
</p>
<p>Alliance, which is working on a new multi-year work programme for all member States to 
</p>
<p>improve the ways in which they teach, research and commemorate the Holocaust. The new 
</p>
<p>work programme gives priority to the study of the killing sites across Europe, renewed 
</p>
<p>efforts to open up closed public and private archives, wider dissemination of good practice 
</p>
<p>in Holocaust teaching in schools and the raising of the profile of Holocaust remembrance 
</p>
<p>days.  
</p>
<p><b>  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Constitutional prohibition on the establishment of a religion by the Government, 
</p>
<p>along with protections for freedoms of speech and association, as well as further protection 
</p>
<p>of those freedoms for all individuals, have contributed to combating intolerance and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons on the basis of religion or belief. The United States of 
</p>
<p>America stated that robust protections on freedoms of expression, religion, association and 
</p>
<p>assembly formed the basis for pluralism in the United States and for the ability of members 
</p>
<p>of all religious communities and non-religious communities to participate fully in society 
</p>
<p>and to contribute openly on an equal footing. (See www.justice.gov/crt/spec_topics/ 
</p>
<p>religiousdiscrimination/). 
</p>
<p>91. At the Department of Justice, the Special Counsel for Religious Discrimination 
</p>
<p>coordinated legal cases involving religion-based discrimination among the various sections 
</p>
<p>of the Civil Rights Division and oversaw outreach efforts to religious communities. The 
</p>
<p>Division has actively enforced the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 
</p>
<p>2000, which protects houses of worship from discriminatory or unjustifiably burdensome 
</p>
<p>zoning regulation. The efforts of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the 
</p>
<p>Civil Rights Division have also included outreach to affected communities, Commission 
</p>
<p>guidance, fact sheets, question and answer documents for employers, and enforcement 
</p>
<p>efforts by both agencies. 
</p>
<p>92. The Community Relations Service at the Department of Justice works on 
</p>
<p>engagement with members of diverse communities, encouraging the creation of 
</p>
<p>collaborative networks and creating mechanisms to work with different communities with 
</p>
<p>regard to potential areas of conflict. The Service has created a set of &#8220;best practices&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>address hate crimes and has worked directly with hundreds of rural, suburban and urban 
</p>
<p>governments to help eliminate racial distrust and polarization and provide assistance to 
</p>
<p>bring together law enforcement agencies and members of minority neighbourhoods. It also 
</p>
<p>created a law enforcement roll-call video entitled <i>The First Three to Five Seconds</i>, which 
</p>
<p>helps police officers reduce tension by differentiating between threats and cultural norms in 
</p>
<p>non-crisis situations. 
</p>
<p>93. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the Department of Homeland 
</p>
<p>Security also conducts public outreach and engagement initiatives with groups, including 
</p>
<p>American Arab, Muslim, Sikh, Somali, South Asian and Middle Eastern communities, such </p>


<p>as conducting regular community leader round tables in eight cities and youth round tables 
</p>
<p>around the country. Training is also provided for law enforcement personnel and 
</p>
<p>intelligence analysts, where topics of discussion include addressing misconceptions and 
</p>
<p>stereotypes of Islam and Muslims, a how-to guide for community interaction, effective 
</p>
<p>policing that actively prohibits racial or ethnic profiling, and federal approaches to 
</p>
<p>engagement and outreach.  
</p>
<p>94. The President and other senior government officials have spoken out against 
</p>
<p>intolerance. The United States sponsors and encourages interfaith dialogue.  
</p>
<p>95. The United States also engages in international efforts to foster a global dialogue. It 
</p>
<p>hosted an expert-level meeting on implementing Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 in 
</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. in December 2011, developed a country-to-country workshop 
</p>
<p>programme to explore best practices in implementing the resolution during 2013 in Bosnia 
</p>
<p>and Herzegovina, Greece and Indonesia, and planned additional programmes in 2014. 
</p>
<p>96. On potential further follow-up measures, the United States stressed the importance 
</p>
<p>of encouraging States to implement the steps outlined in resolution 25/34. Implementation 
</p>
<p>meetings on best practices were helpful to that effort; such meetings should be focused on 
</p>
<p>concrete steps outlined in the text and involve domestic officials charged with 
</p>
<p>implementing government policies on those issues. The United States stated that &#8220;meetings 
</p>
<p>that seek to explore issues beyond implementation of the text, or which do not include 
</p>
<p>experts, will distract from implementation efforts and will fail in addressing the concerns 
</p>
<p>set forth in the resolution text&#8221;. It also noted the importance of involving civil society in 
</p>
<p>implementation efforts. Reporting to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the implementation of the steps outlined in the resolution 
</p>
<p>was an important measure of progress, and States should be encouraged to contribute to 
</p>
<p>such reporting. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities undertaken by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>97. OHCHR continued to work on follow-up to the Rabat Plan of Action and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 and its successor resolutions, 
</p>
<p>including 25/34, as well as similar resolutions of the General Assembly, at<b> </b>the national and 
</p>
<p>international levels. The Office organized events to consider issues related to combating 
</p>
<p>religious intolerance. For instance, it held a panel discussion for the International Day of 
</p>
<p>Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust on 28 January 2014 in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>In September 2013, a database on best practices that includes pertinent information on 
</p>
<p>incitement to national, racial or religious hatred was launched.  
</p>
<p>98. In terms of technical assistance, specific thematic events were organized in Belarus 
</p>
<p>and Tunisia. In cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme and the 
</p>
<p>Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a seminar entitled &#8220;Combating incitement to hatred, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance in cyberspace&#8221; was held in Minsk on 2 and 3 September 
</p>
<p>2014. The seminar considered national and international efforts to combat incitement to 
</p>
<p>hatred, xenophobia and related intolerance on the Internet, and the role of national and 
</p>
<p>international media in combating hate speech, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>99. In Tunis, from 16 to 18 October 2014, OHCHR and the United Nations Educational, 
</p>
<p>Scientific and Cultural Organization jointly held a regional workshop on the role of civil 
</p>
<p>society and media in promoting tolerance and diversity in the Middle East and North 
</p>
<p>African&#8206; region, in the light of the Rabat Plan of Action. Participants in the workshop 
</p>
<p>suggested concrete steps towards the establishment of an effective regional civil society 
</p>
<p>partnership against incitement to hatred, which could develop into a structured coalition in </p>


<p>the future. Focal points from each of the participating countries agreed to begin working 
</p>
<p>together on the modalities of the establishment of a regional coalition. 
</p>
<p>100. A conference on combating religious intolerance is planned for 2015, to contribute 
</p>
<p>to the practical implementation of Human Rights Council and General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolutions on combating intolerance, negative stereotyping, stigmatization, discrimination, 
</p>
<p>incitement to violence and violence against persons, based on religion or belief, aimed at 
</p>
<p>increasing practical exchange and dialogue on issues of freedom of religion and belief by 
</p>
<p>Governments and other actors.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>received 15 replies to the note verbale sent pursuant to paragraph 12 of Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council resolution 25/34, in which the Council invited submissions from 
</b></p>
<p><b>Member States. Responding States reported broadly on their efforts in relation to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions contained in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the resolution. The High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p><b>invites States to consider requesting more focused submissions on a limited number or 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific provisions of the resolution. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The information provided by States on their efforts and measures for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the action plan outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the above-
</b></p>
<p><b>mentioned resolution indicates that the steps taken by States are largely policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>oriented or legal in nature, with many enshrining protection against discrimination on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the basis of religion or belief in national constitutions, criminal codes and civil laws 
</b></p>
<p><b>and regulations.  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>A number of States are working to address hate crimes at the domestic level. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Advocacy of incitement to hatred is for the most part criminalized and often 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibited on several grounds, including religion or belief. It was also noted that 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting freedom of expression and opinion was important to ensuring equality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>countering religious intolerance.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Extremism and radicalization, often leading to hate crimes and violence, were 
</b></p>
<p><b>being addressed through social cohesion and integration programmes and police and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security responses, often coupled with regular engagement and interaction with grass-
</b></p>
<p><b>roots communities and young people, and data gathering and monitoring. A number 
</b></p>
<p><b>of States have governmental strategies or plans in place to address issues of extremism 
</b></p>
<p><b>and radicalization.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Almost all of the States that contributed information provide for a channel or 
</b></p>
<p><b>some form of communication and consultation between religious groups and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and government authorities. Numerous practical examples were cited of 
</b></p>
<p><b>established networks, communication bodies and/or forums between State institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and religious groups or communities, with some focused on policing and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>matters and others serving as general forums of exchange. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Intolerance, stigmatization, negative stereotyping and discrimination, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, are addressed also through public awareness-raising campaigns and 
</b></p>
<p><b>educational measures. States also fund local and national projects aimed at promoting 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building, social cohesion and interfaith dialogue and increasing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of religious groups and communities.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Most States reported that there was religious freedom and pluralism 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestically and that members of religious groups and communities were able to 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifest their religion and contribute openly and on an equal footing in society. </b></p>


<p><b>Religious freedom is often guaranteed at the constitutional level, and in accordance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with domestic law. Several responses referred to the domestic legal frameworks, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsequent amendments improving them, that allowed the practice of </b>one&#8217;s<b> religion 
</b></p>
<p><b>and provided for the functioning and management of religious communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Training on human rights, tolerance, anti-discrimination and the prevention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>stereotypes is provided for government officials and public functionaries, especially in 
</b></p>
<p><b>law enforcement, police and security services, in some countries. Some respondents 
</b></p>
<p><b>noted that no issues of religious profiling had been identified domestically. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Some States undertake national and international initiatives to combat 
</b></p>
<p><b>incitement to hatred, xenophobia and related intolerance on the Internet, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the role of the media in combating hate speech, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p><b>intolerance, including on the Internet. The Internet was generally identified as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>medium for hate speech. However, it is also used as a means to tackle issues associated 
</b></p>
<p><b>with discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, as it presents a forum for 
</b></p>
<p><b>exchange, expression, dialogue, education, knowledge-management and information-
</b></p>
<p><b>sharing between and among networks, security officials and communities. 
</b></p>
