<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on 
their activities (see Appendix).   
</p>
<p>2.  At the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures, held in Geneva from 23 to 
27 June 2008, mandate holders supported the periodic issuance of a joint communications  
report to prevent inconsistencies among mandate holders reporting on the same 
communications to the Council; avoid duplication and rationalize documentation; allow the 
examination of cross-cutting human rights issues; and ensure that the content of 
communications and any follow-up would feed into the universal periodic review process 
more effectively (A/HRC/10/24, para 34-35). In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of 
special procedures mandate holders decided that a joint communications report would be 
prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with this decision being reconfirmed by the 
seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 2010. Mandate holders decided that 
the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27).  
</p>
<p>3. The Outcome document of the review of the work and functioning of the Human 
Rights Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 24, 29 and 60). 
</p>
<p>4.  The report strengthens transparency, efficiency and reduces documentation and 
related costs. Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other 
entity are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks.  
</p>
<p>5. Communications are reproduced in the language in which they were sent.  Replies 
received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are included with translations into English, where 
available.  
</p>
<p>6. This report covers all urgent appeals and letters of allegations sent by special 
procedures mandate holders between 1 December 2010 and 31 May 2011 and all replies 
received between 1 February 2011 and 31 July 2011.  
</p>
<p>7. The report also includes replies received between 1 February and 31 July 2011, 
relating to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 December 
</p><p>2010. Some of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the 
respective State.  
</p>
<p>8. In addition, as a transitional measure, the report also includes all communications 
sent and replies received by six mandates reporting to the eighteenth session of the Council, 
since they submitted their last communications reports individually to the fifteenth session 
of the Council in September 2010. This is to ensure full coverage given that the reporting 
period of this joint communications report is shorter than earlier reporting periods for 
individual mandates reporting to September sessions of the Council. The following 
mandates are concerned: Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia; 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples; Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries; Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery; Special Rapporteur on 
the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; and Special Rapporteur on the 
adverse effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes.  
</p>
<p>9. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint </p>


<p>urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates.  It does not contain other types 
of communications issued by these mandates, processed according to their own distinctive 
procedures, which will continue to be reported exclusively in the annual reports of these 
two working groups. 
</p>
<p>10. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of concerned individuals who were 
subject to victim protection measures are mentioned only when the concerned individual 
has expressively consented or requested to include his or her name in the public report. In 
the original communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the 
Government concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been blackened 
out in State replies to preserve the presumption of their innocence. 
</p>
<p>11. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent over a six-month period, between 
1 December 2010 and 31 May 2011, and responses received in relation to these 
communications until 31 July 2011.   </p>

<p><b>Alleged assassination attempt of the head of the Associa&#231;&#227;o dos Homens do Mar &#8211; 
AHOMAR</b>. According to the information received, on 31 July 2010, Mr Alexandre Anderson 
de Souza and his wife, Ms. Daize Menezes de Souza, survived an apparent assassination 
attempt by two armed individuals. Mr de Souza is the head of AHOMAR, an organisation 
which aims to defend the rights of fisher folk in Rio de Janeiro, in particular those affected by 
the construction of a gas pipeline for the company Petrobras, which AHOMAR opposed. The 
alleged assassination attempt in July 2010 against Mr. Anderson de Souza followed the 
killing on 22 May 2009 of Mr. Paulos Santos Sousa, former Treasurer of AHOMAR. 
Reportedly, prior to this killing, other members of AHOMAR had received death threats. 
Furthermore, it was reported that Mr. Anderson de Souza had survived a previous 
assassination attempt on 1 May 2009.

<p><b>Alleged torture and ill-treatment by Iraqi security forces.</b> According to the information 
received, there was extensive abuse of detainees by Iraqi security forces over a five-year 
period between 2004 and 2009, documented by forces of the United States of America. The 
information also suggests that such acts were conducted with impunity. Thousands of Iraqi 
nationals who had been detained by US forces were handed over from US to Iraqi custody 
between early 2009 and July 2010 under a November 2008 US-Iraq agreement that allegedly 
contains no provisions for safeguarding the detainees&#8217; physical and mental integrity after the 
transfer. It is alleged that tens of thousands of detainees had been held by Iraqi authorities 
without trial.

<p><b>Alleged discrimination against an LGBTI lobby group.</b> According to the information 
received, on 16 November 2010 the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-
FLAG), was refused permission to hold a meeting regarding LGBTI issues and human rights 
at the Jamaica Pegasus hotel in Kingston. Reportedly, the Executive Director of J-FLAG was 
informed via a telephone call from the hotel&#8217;s Director of Sales and Marketing that due to the 
nature of the work carried out by J-FLAG, the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel was unwilling to allow 
the meeting to take place on its premises. It is alleged that this marked a change in policy on 
the part of the hotel, which had previously hosted groups including LGBTI persons. J-FLAG 
was the subject of an earlier communication (see E/CN.4/2005/101/Add.1, para 342).

<p><b>Alleged judicial harassment of human rights activist.</b> According to the information 
received, Mr. Oleg Orlov, chairman of human rights organization Memorial, was on 6 
October 2009 found guilty of libel by the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow after having 
indicated his belief that Mr. Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, or his 
administration, was responsible for the murder of Ms. Natalia Estemirova, the head of 
Memorial&#8217;s office in Grozny. Mr. Kadyrov subsequently lodged an administrative complaint 
against Mr. Orlov, claiming that the statement had damaged his &#8220;honour and dignity&#8221;. Having 
been found guilty, it is reported that Mr. Orlov was ordered to retract the statement and pay a 
personal fine of 20,000 rubles. Mr. Orlov was subsequently charged with the criminal offence 
of libel. Mr. Orlov was the subject of an earlier communication (see A/HRC/7/3/Add.1, para

<p><b>Alleged attack against members of LGBTI organizations.</b> According to the information 
received, on 20 November 2010, Insight organized a candlelight vigil, film exhibition and 
discussion on transgender issues, in cooperation with the Visual Cultural Centre, to promote 
the Transgender Day of Remembrance held in memory of those killed due to anti-transgender 
violence in Ukraine. While the film was being screened, a group of ten men wearing masks 
reportedly attempted to enter the Centre by force; however, they were denied entrance by the 
organizers of the event including Mr. Timur Lysenko, the coordinator of the transgender

<p><b>Alleged arbitrary detention and mistreatment</b>. According to the information received, Mr. 
Suleyman Barbakadze, Chair of the International Society of Meskhetian Turks, was arrested 
in the city Akhaltcikhe on 26 July 2010, and later charged with committing an economic-
related crime. On 28 July 2010, Mr. Barbakadze was reportedly transferred to Tbilisi where 
he was held in investigative detention. The office of the prosecutor and the court had 
reportedly rejected Mr. Barbakadze&#8217;s release on bail, despite the existing practice of release 
on bail for charges of economic-related crimes. Mr. Barbakadze&#8217;s relatives reportedly had no 
contact with him. It is further reported that charges brought against Mr. Barbakadze were 
reassessed to include new charges since the investigation reportedly failed to establish any 
evidence in connection with charges initially brought against him. Mr. Barbakadze&#8217;s health 
condition had reportedly deteriorated while in detention.

video footage allegedly shows the bodies of about nine men lying dead on the ground. It 
further depicts, what appear to be, members of the Sri Lankan Army shooting and killing at 
close range two bound and blind-folded men. The video footage also shows the naked bodies 
of several women and some of the soldiers are seen removing the clothes covering their 
bodies. The footage captures the faces of some of the perpetrators and shows someone in 
uniform recording the incident via a mobile phone. The video footage appears to document 
the same incident which was the subject of an earlier communication sent by the former 
Special Rapporteur, Mr. Philip Alston (see A/HRC/14/24/Add.1, page 255). However, the 
new footage is longer than the previous footage and runs for about 5 minutes and 25 seconds. 
It is alleged that the killings took place during military operations in or around Kilinoch.The 
Special Rapporteur conducted a technical assessment to establish the authenticity of the 
video, see A/HRC/17/28/Add.1, Appendix 1.

368 of the Criminal Code was amended, so that a &#8220;duty to report&#8221; applies to the crime of 
human trafficking and the crime of depriving personal freedom. The &#8220;duty to report&#8221; 
allegedly prevents NGOs and other service providers assisting trafficked persons from 
building a relationship of trust and confidence with trafficked persons.  Further, it allegedly 
discourages certain communities such as a migrant community from reporting possible cases 
of human trafficking to NGOs, as they may wish to avoid contact with the law enforcement 
authorities for reasons related to their immigrant status.

information received, Mr. Behrouz Sadegh-Khanjani, the Chair of the Pastoral Council of the 
Church of Iran, had been held in a security prison in Shiraz since June 2010 on charges of 
apostasy. In the period between his arrest and late November 2010 Pastor Khanjani was given 
access to his attorney only once. During most of his imprisonment he was held in solitary 
confinement. Mr. Yousef Nadarkhani, a 33-year-old member of the Church of Iran ministry 
and pastor in the northern city of Rasht, had been in prison in Lakan since 12 October 2009. 
On 21 and 22 September 2010, Mr. Nadarkhani was put on trial, found guilty and given a 
death sentence. An appeal was filed by Mr. Nadarkhani&#8217;s lawyer on 5 December 2010. Unless 
the appeal proves successful, Mr. Nadarkhani is to be executed by hanging for the crime of 
apostasy.

moharebeh (enmity against God). </b>According to the information received, Mr. Habibollah 
Latifi, a law student at Azad University, was arrested by security forces on 23 October 2007. 
During the investigation process he was allegedly subjected to torture. On 3 July 2008, the 
First Branch of the Sanandaj Revolutionary Court reportedly convicted and sentenced Mr. 
Latifi to the death penalty on the charge of moharebeh and other security-related crimes in 
connection with his membership of and activities on behalf of the Kurdish Independent Life 
Party. The Appeals Court in Sanandaj subsequently confirmed the ruling. Mr. Latifi&#8217;s 
execution was reportedly scheduled on 26 December 2010, and had been halted since then. 
On 26 December, members of Mr. Latifi&#8217;s family were reportedly arrested, without being 
informed of the charge(s) against them. Mr. Latifi was the subject of an earlier 
communication (see A/HRC/14/24/Add.1, page 131).

in May 2010, Mr. Bradley E. Manning, born in 1987, a United States (U.S.) Private First 
Class Army Soldier, was arrested by agents of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation 
Command. He was held in pre-trial detention in a military jail at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait for 
two months before he was transferred to the U.S. Marine Corps Brig in Quantico, Virginia. In 
July 2010, Mr. Manning was reportedly charged with the unauthorized disclosure of U.S. 
classified information to WikiLeaks. Mr. Manning had reportedly been confined to his cell for 
twenty-three hours a day since his arrest in May 2010. The prolonged period of isolated 
confinement is believed to have been imposed in an effort to coerce him into &#8220;cooperation&#8221; 
with the authorities. In follow-up to this communication, the Special Rapporteur held several 
discussions with the United States Government and requested a private and unmonitored 
meeting with Mr. Manning to access his conditions of detention. On 4 February 2011 the 
Special Raporteur sent a follow-up letter regarding the case. He also issued press statements 
detailing his engagement with the United States.

used by the Arizona Snowbowl Resort Limited Partnership to operate a commercial project

<p><b>Alleged pattern of impunity regarding the deaths of lawyers and human rights activists. 
</b></p>
<p>According to the information received, Mr. Sergei Magnitsky was counsel for a foreign 
investment firm known as Hermitage Capital Management. In 2008, Mr. Magnitsky 
voluntarily provided testimony accusing the Russian Interior Ministry and other state officials 
of stealing about 230 million US dollars from the State budget. On 24 November 2008, Mr. 
Magnitsky was reportedly arrested and charged with tax evasion. Allegedly, he was not 
brought before a court of law but was kept in pre-trial detention for 11 months. While in 
custody he allegedly developed pancreatitis and he was denied medical treatment. On 16 
November 2009, he died in custody. The Russian State Investigative Committee announced 
that there would be a formal criminal investigation into his death. The mandate holders kindly 
requested as well to receive information on the status of the investigation and prosecution of 
the cases concerning the deaths of Ms. Natalya Estemirova, Ms. Zarema Sadulaeva, Mr. Alik 
Dzhabrailov and Ms. Anna Politkovskaya, who had been subject to earlier communications.

Shazad Kamran, who provides moral, legal and financial support for people convicted of 
blasphemy, reportedly received death threats. There have been death threats to other activists 
and lawyers, including Ms. Asma Jahangir, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association 
and former UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. Ms. Sherbano Taseer, 
daughter of the late Mr. Salman Taseer, has reportedly received death threats. On 8 December

<p><b>Alleged enforced disappearance</b>. According to the information received, Mr. Mohamed 
Abdo, born on 27 January 1984, resident in Alexandria, was arrested on 5 January 2011 at his 
home and subsequently disappeared. According to witnesses, State Security Intelligence (SSI) 
agents in civilian clothes allegedly abducted Mr. Abdo from his home and transferred him to 
an unknown location. Witnesses also report that SSI agents reportedly searched the victim&#8217;s 
house without presenting a judicial order and confiscated some personal items. It is alleged 
that Mr. Abdo&#8217;s arrest and consequent disappearance may be linked to his alleged 
participation in a church bombing attack in Alexandria against the Coptic minority, on the 
night of 31 December 2010. The fate and whereabouts of Mr. Abdo remained unknown.

received, on 22 December 2010, Mr Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, Chair of the Sudan Social 
Development Organization (SUDO), was summoned to the court in Khartoum and 
subsequently arrested and taken to the Gereif Prison. The judge was allegedly ordered to 
render a new judgment after the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) had in April 2010 
appealed his acquittal on 15 March 2010. Reports received indicate that no new evidence was 
presented and no judicial process took place. Reportedly, the judge sentenced Mr Mudawi to 
one-year imprisonment and a fine for financial mismanagement. Mr Mudawi had previously 
been charged with financial mismanagement, but was acquitted. On 5 March 2009, SUDO 
reportedly received notification by the HAC that it had been closed down. Subsequently, 
security forces allegedly raided SUDO headquarters in Nyala confiscating laptops, desktops 
and various papers. Moreover, all bank accounts and financial assets of the organization were

<p><b>Allegation that Bedouin people are being removed from their traditional lands.</b> 
According to the information received, land policy in Israel has failed to recognize Bedouin 
legal entitlement to their traditional lands in the Negev. Around half of the Negev Bedouins 
live in so-called &#8220;unrecognized villages&#8221;, which allegedly lack basic services such as running 
water, electricity, waste removal, telephone lines, paved roads, schools and health facilities. 
Bedouins in these villages have experienced ongoing demolitions of their homes and villages 
in the Negev by Israeli authorities. The Government has created seven urban towns and 
moved Bedouin from the &#8220;unrecognized villages&#8221; to these towns. The people in these towns 
reportedly rank at the bottom of all social and economic indicators, and suffer from the 
highest unemployment rates and income levels in Israel. Bedouins reportedly cannot live in 
their traditional manner in these urban areas. The Israel Land Administration reportedly had 
plans to create several new villages or towns for the Bedouins. See the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
observations on this case in A/HRC/18/35/Add.1.

however, all their efforts were declined on technical grounds. The authorities had reportedly 
argued that they will only register one official Muslim community; however, as other Muslim 
groups also exist in the Republic of Moldova (Tuhanteli Tatar, Tatar Community Ideli, etc.), 
the authorities&#8217; argument would mean that none of them could be registered as long as there is 
plurality of Muslim groups. The Ministry of Justice had also reportedly refused to register a 
Falun Gong group.

hospital in Manama, where he died. On 15 February, people reportedly gathered at the gates 
of the hospital as his body was transferred to the cemetery. Riot police reportedly used tear 
gas and shotguns to disperse the crowd. Consequently, Mr. Fadhel Salman al-Matrook, aged 
32, was severely injured and died later in hospital. On 17 February 2011, peaceful 
demonstrators gathered at Pearl Roundabout, in the centre of Manama were reportedly 
attacked by security forces. At least four people were allegedly killed: Mr. Issa Abdel Hassan,

<p><b>Alleged harassment and attacks against the Ahmadiyyah community</b>. According to the 
information received, on 6 February 2011, over 1,000 armed people stormed the house of an 
Ahmadiyyah community leader in Umbulan village in West Java. Three members of the 
community, Mr. Adi Mulyadi (24 years old), Mr. Roni (34) and Mr. Tarno (33), were 
allegedly beaten and stoned to death. Mr. Ferdiaz (30) and Mr. Deden Sujana (45) were 
stabbed, Mr. Bebi (45) received a serious injury to his head and Mr. Masihudin was stripped 
naked and beaten. The attackers reportedly destroyed the house and vehicles parked around it. 
This follows an incident on 5 February, when the house of the local Ahmadiyyah leader Mr. 
Ismail Suparman was attacked. On 28 January 2011, an Ahmadiyyah congregation was 
reportedly evacuated following an attack on the congregation in the Makassar mosque, in the 
capital of South Sulawesi. The minister for security reportedly reminded Ahmadiyyah 
members of the joint ministerial decree of 9 June 2008, which instructs adherents of the 
Indonesian Ahmadiyyah Congregation, as long as they claim to be Muslims, to stop the 
spreading of the belief that there is another prophet after Muhammad.

According to the information received, on 25 December 2010, Turkish Cypriot authorities 
interrupted the service taking place in the Church of Saint Sinesios in Rizokarpaso, forced the 
congregation out of the church and subsequently sealed it. Reportedly, the Church is one of 
seven religious sites in the area where religious services can be performed without advance 
permission. The same day, Turkish Cypriot authorities reportedly refused permission for the 
performance of Christmas mass in the Church of the Holy Trinity (Ayia Triada) in the nearby 
village of Yialoussa. On 4 February 2011, Christian worshippers on the Karpas peninsula 
were allegedly banned from holding evening masses. Reportedly, a new procedure had been 
introduced by the Turkish Cypriot authorities, requiring that all religious celebrations (apart 
from those on Sundays) in the village churches seek permission with at least 30 days advance 
notice.

and reducing downstream flows. The Lower Omo River Valley is populated by some 500,000 
people belonging to diverse indigenous peoples. Competition over land and resources has 
resulted in periodic conflicts among these groups. In addition to its importance for subsistence

<p><b>Alleged failure to recognize and respect native customary land rights</b>. According to the 
information received, the Kayan indigenous community of the Long Teran Kanan village in 
Tinjar, Miri, Sarawak had been involved in a legal dispute over their land for 12 years. The 
Miri High Court allegedly ruled in favour of the community on 31 March 2010. One of the 
defendants, IOI Pelita Plantation Sdn. Bhd., appealed the judgment and had allegedly not 
respected the court order in the interim, continuing palm oil operations in the community. The 
village&#8217;s crops have reportedly been bulldozed and planted with oil palms, destroying the 
Kayan people&#8217;s traditional livelihoods and threatening their right to food. This case is 
reportedly emblematic of the over 200 cases before the Sarawak courts relating to indigenous 
communities&#8217; ability to exercise their native customary rights over their lands, upon which 
they depend for fishing, hunting or farming, and which are essential to their cultural survival.

have been mass expulsions by Angolan authorities of migrants, seemingly largely targeted at 
those involved in informal diamond mining in Northern Angola. While some of the deportees 
did not have legal residence in Angola, others reportedly possessed residence permits. It is 
alleged that persons expelled from Angola have been victims of serious human rights 
violations committed by Angolan law enforcement and security officials in the expulsion 
process. These include sexual violence, torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment. It is further reported that most of the expelled persons from Angola were forcibly 
returned to the DRC.

<p><b>Alleged surveillance of human rights organization.</b> According to the information received, 
the activities of Odhikar, a human rights organization based in Dhaka and its Secretary 
Advocate, Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, had been increasingly monitored by the Bangladeshi 
authorities since October 2010. This allegedly followed the submission by the organization of 
various project proposals to the national NGO Affairs Bureau. An official from the NGO 
Affairs Bureau reportedly warned Odhikar staff to exercise caution while travelling, and to be 
aware that a legal case may be brought against them by the authorities. The offices of Odhikar 
had reportedly been frequently visited by officials from the Bangladeshi Police Special 
Branch and National Security Intelligence agents. The authorities had also reportedly made 
repeated phone calls to the offices of Odhikar inquiring about the work carried out, as well 
demanding information on the location of staff members. After the engagement with the UPR 
process, Odhikar was threatened and harassed by Government officials of different levels and 
authorities increased the monitoring of its activities.  Odhikar was the subject of an earlier 
communication (see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1 para 211).

<p><b>Alleged violation of due process rights and guarantees in the conduct of criminal 
proceedings in relation to the June 2010 violence</b>. According to the information received, 
the alleged unfairness of trials, unequal treatment in the administration of justice and 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment have exacerbated tensions among ethnic communities, 
in particular among ethnic Uzbeks. Investigations and trials had reportedly mainly been 
conducted against ethnic Uzbeks, allegedly failing to uphold due process rights and 
procedural guarantees. From 27 August 2010 to 31 December 2010, 46 cases of torture and 
ill-treatment and 93 cases of arbitrary detention or unlawful arrest were reportedly 
documented. On 26 October, a decision rendered by Osh City Court reportedly stated that Mr. 
Farruh Gapirov had been beaten and forced to confess to the crime of which he was accused. 
On 10 November, the Court of Appeal sentenced Mr. Azimjan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek 
human rights defender, to life imprisonment. On 26 January 2011, the Supreme Court 
commenced the review of the case. Mr. Askarov was reportedly in need of urgent medical 
attention and treatment for injuries likely to have resulted from torture. Mr. Askarov was the 
subject of earlier communications (see A/HRC/16/44/Add.1, paras 1422, 1449 and 1465). His 
lawyer, Mr. Nurbek Toktakunov, was also the subject of an earlier communication (see

generated severe pain and left him almost immobilized. From August 2008 to March 2009, 
the local hospital prescribed him morphine, which significantly reduced his pain. In 
September 2009, Mr. Malinovsky again developed persistent and severe pain that prevented 
him from engaging in any daily activity. However, the only pain medications Mr. Malinovsky 
could take were over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which 
were insufficiently potent to control his pain. Mr. Malinovsky and his spouse repeatedly 
asked for adequate pain medication but doctors allegedly refused to provide it. The chief 
doctor of the Svyatoshinsky clinic held an ad-hoc meeting of physicians on 21 January 2010, 
during which they concluded that stronger medications should be provided. No action was 
reportedly taken to this effect.

carrying out a fact finding mission accompanied by Mr. Ajay Singh and Mr. Rishi Milind

occurred in Tarmetla, Morpalli, Timapuran and the surrounding villages between 11 and 16

Government launched new guidelines according to which immigration detention should be 
used for the shortest practicable period and asylum seekers should only be held in detention 
while their health, identity and security checks are conducted. However, these guidelines are 
reportedly yet to be implemented. Allegedly, there are no possibilities to challenge the 
legality of the detention in a court.

April 2011, Ms. Ni Yulan, human rights defender, and her husband, Mr. Dong Jiqin, were 
taken into police custody from their room at the Yu Xin Gong Hotel, Beijing, where they had 
been living. They were allegedly detained for &#8220;creating a disturbance&#8221; and held at the

<p><b>Alleged torture and death of Falun Gong detainees.</b> According to the information received, 
on 21 February 2011, Jiamusi prison set up a &quot;Strict Management Team&quot; to increase the 
&#8220;transformation rate&#8221; among detained Falun Gong practitioners. Nine practitioners, including 
Mr. Qin Yueming, Mr. Yu Yungang and Mr. Liu Chuanjiang were taken to the section. They 
were reportedly under constant pressure to renounce Falun Gong. Mr. Qin Yueming, 47 years 
old, was reportedly arrested in April 2002 and sentenced to ten years imprisonment. On 25 
February 2011, two inmates allegedly inserted a tube into Mr. Qin&#8217;s mouth and poured milk 
and salt down the tube. He reportedly gave out cries during the process. The prison doctor 
indicated that the reason for Mr. Qin&#8217;s suffering could be that the feeding tube was inserted 
into his lung rather than his stomach. Reportedly, Mr. Qin died on the morning of 26 
February. Mr. Qin&#8217;s family reportedly found bruises and purple marks all over his body. Mr. 
Yu Yungang, 48 years old, was reportedly arrested in February 2009 and sentenced to eight 
years imprisonment. On 1 March 2011, Mr. Yu allegedly passed out as a result of torture. He 
was then sent to hospital and underwent surgery on his skull. On 3 March he underwent 
another emergency treatment. On 5 March, several officers reportedly surrounded the ICU. 
Mr. Yu&#8217;s family reportedly realized his death when the officers were about to carry his body 
away. Mr. Liu Chuanjiang, 55 years old, was reportedly arrested on 26 July 2008. On 21 
February 2011, Mr. Liu was allegedly tortured, and his condition deteriorated quickly. Prison 
personnel were reportedly hesitant to send Mr. Liu to hospital. He was first taken back to 
ward No. 3, then sent to the prison hospital. On 8 March, Mr. Liu died in the hospital. On 10 
March, his family was allegedly forced by the authorities to approve his cremation.

<p>Health <b>Alleged adverse consequences of the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act of 
2008.</b> According to the information received, despite the prohibition of a compulsory HIV 
testing, the abovementioned Act allows for mandatory testing without prior consent under 
certain circumstances. The Act allegedly also allows the results of an HIV test to be released 
to a spouse or sexual partner. The Act&#8217;s provision to criminalize HIV transmission on the 
basis of intent reportedly fails to distinguish between mala fide and negligent transmissions. It 
is further alleged that the Act could undermine HIV prevention and treatment efforts by 
discouraging people from getting tested, and could make women more vulnerable to 
persecution than men as the former could also be charged for HIV transmission to their 
children. Given the HIV-related stigma and discrimination, it is alleged that criminal 
sanctions could be directed disproportionately against those who are socially and/or 
economically marginalized.

<p><b>Alleged ban to broadcast a documentary film on LGBT rights</b>. According to the 
information received, on 17 May 2011, the Chisinau Appeals Court, following an appeal filed 
by the Moldovan Orthodox Church, banned the airing by the state broadcaster Moldova 1 of 
the documentary film entitled &#8220;Human Rights on Screen: The Rights of Sexual Minorities&#8221;. 
Reportedly, conservative forces had earlier set the state broadcaster Moldova 1 under pressure 
not to show the documentary, forcing a repeated hearing on the matter by Moldova 1&#8217;s 
Observatory Council. The Observatory Council reportedly ruled that, according to the Audio 
Visual Code, the state television is obliged to present &#8220;a plurality of views&#8221; and therefore it 
would show the film in question, thus upholding its own decision on the same matter of 22 
December 2010.

2003, X, a 14 year-old boy was alone at home with his brother. Two policemen reportedly 
came to the house and took X to the Cojusna Police Station where he was interrogated in the 
absence of his parents. The police accused him of having stolen money and valuables from a 
house in the village. They asked X to sign a confession and threatened to kill him if he did 
not. X denied the accusations and refused to sign. A police officer allegedly beat him with a 
rubber stick, demanding that he sign the confession. When X was released, his mother took 
him to the &quot;Ignatenco&quot; Children's Hospital in Chisinau, where he was hospitalized for over 
one week. X's mother informed the Prosecutor's Office of the incident, but was told that the 
policemen's behaviour was legal and that the allegation of torture was untrue.

Levinec were sentenced to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment and sent to penal colony 29.4. The 
Penitentiary Department of the Ministry of Justice reportedly warned them that their 
assassination was planned by a group of prisoners. On 19 April 2003, 100 prisoners reportedly 
penetrated the premises where the brothers were held and severely beat them up. Allegedly, 
the prison administration facilitated the attack by leaving the doors between the &#8220;zones&#8221; of the 
prison unguarded. Reportedly, no guards were present. On 12 June the brothers were 
transferred to colony 29.15. On 6 September a large number of convicts again reportedly 
attacked the brothers, resulting in serious injuries to them. Again the personnel did not 
intervene. Reportedly, in either incident, no steps had been taken to identify and punish the 
perpetrators.

<p><b>Allegation that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act facilitates impunity</b>. According to 
the information received, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA), is 
applicable in &#8220;disturbed areas&#8221;, including large parts of the Northeast region of India as well 
as in Jammu and Kashmir, where a variant of the Act was reportedly brought into force in 
1990. The AFSPA reportedly empowers security forces not only to arrest and enter property 
without warrant but also gives them power to shoot to kill in circumstances where members of 
the security forces are not necessarily at imminent risk. Allegedly, the Act facilitates impunity 
by preventing any person from starting legal action against any members of the armed forces 
for anything done under the Act, or purported to be done under the Act, without permission of 
the Central Government. A summary of this case was published in 2006 (see 
E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.1, page 75).

<p><b>Alleged exploitation of and systematic discrimination against migrant workers from 
Myanmar</b>. According to the information received, there are approximately two to four 
million migrant workers in Thailand, many of whom are from Myanmar and who entered 
Thailand without proper documentation.  On 21 June 2003, the Governments of Thailand and 
Myanmar reportedly established a nationality verification scheme in order to enable irregular 
migrants from Myanmar to register and obtain legal status in Thailand, and to have access to 
the same wage and other labour benefits as Thai workers.  The scheme reportedly caused 
significant confusion in migrant communities. Allegedly, migrant communities from 
Myanmar had not been provided with sufficient information about the process, especially in 
their native languages. Furthermore, migrant workers in Thailand are reportedly often 
exploited by their employers and deprived of access to mechanisms for the protection of 
labour rights. Migrant workers from Myanmar are reportedly denied access to the Social 
Security Office Workmen&#8217;s Compensation Fund in the event of workplace accidents.

migrants to benefit from the extension, they would need to submit their nationality 
verification forms by 28 February 2010 and also renew their work permits by that time to be 
able to stay in the country. The Government would give permission for this group of workers 
to work temporarily in Thailand, but only on the condition that every worker must complete 
the nationality verification process before 28 February 2012. Migrant workers from Myanmar 
would need to return to their country to complete the nationality verification process, and for 
many, this had created anxiety amid fears of harassment and extortion by Myanmar officials.

was allegedly sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment by the Criminal Court of Y. in 
Algeria. In November 2007, the Algerian Government produced the extradition request before 
U.K. authorities. Mr. X. had reportedly received a number of death threats. In June 2009, the 
City of Westminister Magistrates&#8217; Court considered Mr.X.&#8217;s extradition case and determined 
that were he to be extradited to Algeria he would face a real risk of being ill-treated.  
Notwithstanding this, the court indicated it would be satisfied by the diplomatic assurances 
provided by Algeria. On 5 March 2010, the U.K. Border Agency refused Mr. X.&#8217;s asylum 
claim. On 23 March, Mr. X. lodged an appeal. On 25 March, he was notified that although his 
asylum appeal was pending, the Secretary of State would be considering that his case be heard 
by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The SIAC deals with appeals 
against decisions made by the Home Office to deport, or exclude, someone from the U.K. on 
national security grounds, or for other public interest reasons.

Mr. Khalilov&#8217;s health had reportedly deteriorated since his detention and he had been 
suffering from severe spinal hernia, which could paralyze him if not treated urgently. In early 
May, a medical report stating the urgent need for treatment and comprehensive medical 
examination was allegedly submitted to the City Prosecutor of Bishkek and presented to the 
Government, but reportedly no action had been taken.

<p><b>Alleged detentions and torture and ill-treatment of ethnic Uzbeks.</b> According to the 
information received, since the violence erupted in June 2010 in the south of the Kyrgyz 
Republic, a large number of detentions had taken place in the context of daily raids in Uzbek 
neighborhoods, without arrest warrants, and usually carried out by military and police 
officers. Most families had not been informed of where their relatives were taken upon arrest, 
leaving them without news of their whereabouts for hours or even days. Once detained, the 
victims were reportedly taken either to police stations or to detention centres, including the 
Osh City Police Department, Osh Province Police Department, local police precincts and the 
National Security Service, where they were reportedly subjected to torture and ill-treatment. 
On 11 July, one man died following his release, reportedly as a result of the ill-treatment 
received during his detention.

including non-payment of wages and confiscation of passports, thereby restricting the 
workers&#8217; freedom of movement, access to medical care, and their right to effective remedies. 
Reports suggest that the sponsorship (&#8220;kafala&#8221;) system, which ties migrant workers&#8217; residency 
permits to their employers, is one of the root causes of such abuses. In addition, the Labour 
Courts are allegedly slow and cumbersome, which makes it difficult for migrants with limited 
resources to obtain effective remedies.

migrants</b>. According to the information received, approximately 300,000 reported migrant 
workers failed to enter the nationality verification (NV) process by the extended deadline of 
31 March 2010, and an estimated 1 million unregistered migrant workers were ineligible for 
the NV process. These migrant workers are deemed as migrants with irregular status and 
particularly vulnerable to arbitrary arrest, violence, abuse, discrimination and exploitation by 
the police, military and immigration officers. Reportedly, Maung Kyi, an irregular migrant 
worker from Myanmar who was arrested on 5 August 2008, was severely beaten by the police 
officers. On 8 March 2010, two young sisters from Myanmar, Nyo Nyo San, 20 years old, and 
Myint Myint San, 12 years old, reportedly drowned while trying to escape a police raid of 
their living quarters near Klong Cork Mu. This pattern of arbitrary arrest, violence, abuse and 
exploitation of migrants had reportedly been exacerbated by the Prime Minister&#8217;s order of 2 
June 2010 issued to set up a Special Centre to Suppress, Arrest and Prosecute Alien Workers 
Who Are Working Underground (No.125/1223). The NV process was the subject of earlier

Tihar, New Delhi since April 2007. Their case was the subject of an earlier communication 
(see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, para 100). Since their arrival in Central Jail Tihar in April 2007, five 
female MFI members who were pregnant at the time of their arrest have given birth to five 
children. Reportedly, medical staff treated the pregnant women inhumanly. During a medical 
checkup in Deen Dayal Hospital, it was found that two of the MFI women had cysts in their 
ovaries. While surgery was recommended, the Senior Medical Officer refused this. On 28 
January 2010, the Indian Government rejected the applications made on behalf of the MFI 
detainees for political asylum and subsequently all criminal charges against them were 
reportedly withdrawn. The MFI members continued to be held in custody pending a decision 
by the courts on whether their deportation to Pakistan would be lawful. Mr. Iqbal Shahi had 
suffered from fits and there was neither medical care in the prison nor had he been referred to 
outside physicians. He had been diagnosed with a tumor in his brain; however, reportedly no 
medical help had been forthcoming. Mr. Muhammad Ashfaque, a diabetic, had suffered from 
an illness affecting his backbone. Mr. Abdul Waheed underwent heart bypass surgery before 
his arrest and had been suffering from acute heart-related illnesses. Mr. Abdul Rashid, a 
diabetic, had not been allowed to visit an Outpatient Department. Ms. Kulsoom Khan suffered 
from fever in May 2007. The prison authorities gave her medication that did not help and the 
prison staff allegedly beat her. She was then sent to Deen Dayal Hospital where she was 
reportedly given electric shocks. Eleven MFI children remained in detention in Central Jail 
Tihar. However, the prison authorities did not have the required medication for children and 
the detained children had been given adults&#8217; medication instead.

<p><b>Alleged sentencing of a journalist and a blogger.</b> According to the information received, on 
27 September 2010, Mr. Isa Saharkhiz, a pro-reform movement journalist, was sentenced to 
three years in prison, a five-year ban on political and journalistic activities, and a one-year

<p>Education <b>Alleged negative impact of the Israeli blockade on the school system in the Gaza Strip.</b> 
According to the information received, in June 2007 the Israeli Government imposed a 
blockade on the Gaza Strip, generally only permitting items it defined as humanitarian into 
Gaza. In June 2010, the Israeli Government announced that it would &#8220;ease&#8221; the blockade, 
allowing additional consumable items entry into Gaza. However, construction materials 
continued to remain banned for import. Due to the blockade, UNRWA had been unable to 
build a single school in Gaza in over three years. At the same time, the student population in 
UNRWA schools had risen dramatically. Furthermore, some 217 schools, including 36 
UNRWA schools and 60 kindergartens, were reportedly damaged during the Israeli military&#8217;s 
&#8220;Operation Cast Lead,&#8221; between 28 December 2008 and 19 January 2009. Most schools 
function on double shift and an estimated 40,000 Palestinian refugee children had been unable 
to attend UNRWA schools due to lack of space and schools. As of September 2010, UNRWA 
had received approval from the Government of Israel to proceed with the building of only 
eight out of the 100 schools required to meet the demand.

<p><b>Alleged abuse and exploitation of migrant domestic workers.</b> According to the information 
received, there are more than 660,000 migrant domestic workers in Kuwait, mostly from Asia 
and Africa, of whom the majority are women. Once in Kuwait, these workers find themselves 
vulnerable to abuse in a system that leaves them with almost no effective legal protection. 
Common complaints of migrant domestic workers are nonpayment of salaries, excessively 
long working hours without rest, and incidents of physical and sexual abuse. Migrant 
domestic workers are reportedly often denied adequate food and medical care. Allegedly, 
employers often confiscate passports of migrant domestic workers and use the passports as a 
method of control by refusing to return them when workers tried to leave their employers.  In 
addition, it is reported that the legal framework and institutions in Kuwait are inadequate to 
address these violations of human rights of migrant domestic workers.

systematic use of torture and other ill-treatment by Coalition, Iraqi and private security 
officials; and, in most cases, failed to intervene to prevent and/or investigate hundreds of 
reports of systematic abuse and torture.  Allegedly, US forces acting under &#8220;fragmentary 
orders,&#8221; &#8220;Frago 242&#8221; and &#8220;Frago 039&#8221; were required to make no intervention in cases of 
abuse and/or torture involving Iraqis if the US troops were not initially involved. The orders 
also required US forces to report abuse to the US command but not to conduct any further 
investigation or take any further action to stop abuse or torture unless instructed to do so by 
higher order. Furthermore, thousands of Iraqi nationals who had been detained by US forces 
were reportedly handed over from US to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and July 2010 
under a November 2008 US-Iraq agreement that contains no provisions for safeguarding the 
detainees&#8217; physical and mental integrity after the transfer.

<p><b> C. Communications sent before the period covered by this report, by mandates reporting to the eighteenth 
session of the Council, and related replies  
</b></p>
<p>14. As a transitional measure, given that the reporting period of this joint communications report is shorter than earlier reporting 
periods for individual mandates reporting to September sessions of the Council, the following communications are included to 
ensure that all State responses and communications of special procedures mandates reporting to the eighteenth session of the 
Council are covered since they last reported individually to the fifteenth session. They relate to the following mandates: the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia; the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples; the Working 
Group on the use of mercenaries; the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery; the Special Rapporteur on the adverse 
effects of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes and .the Special Rapporteur on the human right 
to safe drinking water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>15. Covered are State responses received by these mandates before 1 February 2011, but after the cut-off date of their last 
communcations report &#8211; usually 15 Augsut 2010 &#8211; so that they could not be reflected in respective communication reports 
submitted to the fifteenth session of the Council in September 2010. The same applies to communications sent by these mandates 
after the cut-off date of their last communications report - usually 15 June 2010 - and 1 December 2010, the start of the regular 
reporting period of this joint communications report. Copies of the full text of the communications sent and Government replies 
received can be accessed from the electronic version of this report available on the website of the Human Rights Council. Some 
names of individuals or other information haves been rendered anonymous or otherwise unidentifiable.

<p>Mercenaries <b>Alleged connection to the facilitation of recruitment of mercenaries</b>. According to the 
information received, Mr. Luis Posada Carriles was connected to the planning of the downing of 
a Douglas DC-8 of Cubana de Aviaci&#243;n, on 6 October 1976, and connected to the facilitation of 
recruitment of mercenaries involved in this act. Reportedly, there are indications of several 
linkages between Mr. Posada Carriles, the Cuban-American National Foundation, and various 
individuals connected to a series of attacks and bombings. Several indications also point to Mr. 
Posada Carriles as having been a primary instrument and protagonist of mercenarism in a policy 
of violence, terrorism and violation of human rights in the Americas. Reportedly, Mr. Posada 
Carriles had been held in custody on immigration charges in the United States of America, and 
released in May 2007 without having been charged on grounds of terrorism.

<p><b>Alleged water and sanitation crisis in Gaza.</b> According to the information received, about 
10,000 people in Gaza do not have access to the water network, and 900,000 people only have 
irregular access to water. The sewage treatment plants are reportedly in disrepair, leading to 
discharge of untreated or only partially treated wastewater directly into the Mediterranean Sea. 
According to reports, the quality of water in Gaza is very poor. Reportedly, water and sewage 
infrastructure which were attacked during the Israeli offensive in 2008/2009, had not been 
repaired. The delay had been attributed to Israel&#8217;s refusal to allow the necessary materials to be 
brought into Gaza to undertake the repairs. The blockade had also led to the gradual deterioration 
of water and sewage services more generally.

Provisional Detention Centre in Cariacica (Centro de Deten&#231;&#227;o Provis&#243;ria de Cariacica), is 
overcrowded, and the inmates are held in containers which have been converted into cells by 
opening three very small barred windows on each side. Reportedly, there is no sewage system, 
and the water supply for drinking and washing is inadequate, as detainees only have access to 
water for a few minutes every couple of hours. Furthermore, detainees are reportedly locked up 
throughout the day, even during the summer months, facing extremely hot temperatures. A man 
called &#8220;Adoterivo&#8221;, who suffered from hypertension, reportedly died due to the lack of medical 
attention and the poor conditions in the containers. In addition to the physical conditions at the 
Provisional Detention Centre in Cariacica, detainees have allegedly been regularly threatened or 
subjected to violence, including with rubber and lead bullets, as well as pepper and tear gas.

<p><b>Alleged sale of children for forced labour in mines.</b> According to the information received, an 
estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers from Nepal and Bangladesh work at the so-called &#8220;rat 
mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya State, India. In most cases, the children are allegedly 
purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining 
mafia in Meghalaya. The working conditions at the mines are allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, 
cruel and inhuman. Deaths of children due to the unsafe working conditions are reportedly 
common, and often remain unreported. The children reportedly live in huts made with plastic 
sheets and there is a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. Allegedly, girls are 
also often bought by the mine owners and subject to sexual exploitation. There is also 
information suggesting that some children are trafficked further from the mines to other places 
for sexual exploitation.

<p><b>Alleged sale of children for forced labour in mines</b>. According to the information received, an 
estimated 70,000 bonded child labourers from Nepal and Bangladesh work at the so-called &#8220;rat 
mines&#8221; of Jaintia Hills, Meghalaya State, India. In most cases, the children are allegedly 
purchased by middlemen or abducted or sold by gangs in Nepal and Bangladesh to the mining 
mafia in Meghalaya. The working conditions at the mines are allegedly hazardous, unhygienic, 
cruel and inhuman. Deaths of children due to the unsafe working conditions are reportedly 
common, and often remain unreported. The children reportedly live in huts made with plastic 
sheets and there is a lack of safe drinking water and proper sewage system. Allegedly, girls are 
also often bought by the mine owners and subject to sexual exploitation. There is also 
information suggesting that some children are trafficked further from the mines to other places 
for sexual exploitation. Reportedly, there is a lack of interventions in this matter by the State 
Government.

<p><b>Alleged death during deportation involving private security company</b>. According to the 
information received, Mr. Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan national who was being deported from 
the UK, died 50 minutes after having boarded British Airways flight 77 at Heathrow airport on 
13 October 2010. Mr. Mubenga was allegedly sitting at the rear of the aircraft, surrounded by 
three guards working for the private security company G4S, which had been contracted by the 
UK Border Agency to escort deportees. Mr. Mubenga was reportedly resisting his deportation, 
while the guards were forcing him on his seat, one man on top of him, which made it difficult for 
him to breathe. Allegedly, the confrontation lasted around 10 minutes before Mr. Mubenga 
became silent and was no longer breathing.

evitar que la Comisi&#243;n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) u otra entidad realice obras tendentes a la 
construcci&#243;n de este proyecto hidroel&#233;ctrico. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, a pesar de las resoluciones 
judiciales, el Congreso Federal (C&#225;mara de Diputados) habr&#237;a previsto la autorizaci&#243;n del 
presupuesto para la construcci&#243;n de esta presa hidroel&#233;ctrica. El director de la CFE habr&#237;a
