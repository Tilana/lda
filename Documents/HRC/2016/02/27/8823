<p><b>  Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced 
Persons</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, annex) 
stipulate in principle 6 that &#8220;displacement shall last no longer than required by the 
circumstances&#8221;. Drawing on existing international law, the right of internally displaced 
persons to a durable solution is articulated in principles 28&#8211;30.  
</p>
<p> The Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons set out in this 
report is organized around four questions. 
</p>
<p> Question 1. What is a durable solution for internally displaced persons? 
 The specific needs and human rights concerns of internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
do not automatically disappear when a conflict or natural disaster ends. Nor do they fade 
away when people initially find safety from ongoing conflict or disaster. Rather, the 
displaced &#8212; whether they return to their homes, settle elsewhere in the country or try to 
integrate locally &#8212; usually face continuing problems, requiring support until they achieve a 
durable solution to their displacement. 
</p>
<p> A durable solution is achieved when internally displaced persons no longer have any 
specific assistance and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and can enjoy 
their human rights without discrimination on account of their displacement. It can be 
</p>
<p>

<p> * Late submission.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p>achieved through: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable reintegration at the place of origin (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;return&#8221;) 
&#8226; Sustainable local integration in areas where internally displaced persons take refuge 
</p>
<p>(local integration) 
&#8226; Sustainable integration in another part of the country (settlement elsewhere in the 
</p>
<p>country) 
 The search for any of these durable solutions for IDPs should be understood as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A gradual, often long-term process of reducing displacement-specific needs and 
ensuring the enjoyment of human rights without discrimination 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A complex process that addresses human rights, humanitarian, development, 
reconstruction and peacebuilding challenges 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A process requiring the coordinated and timely engagement of different actors 
</p>
<p> Question 2. What key principles should guide the search for durable solutions? 
&#8226; The primary responsibility to provide durable solutions for IDPs needs to be 
</p>
<p>assumed by the national authorities. International humanitarian and development 
actors have complementary roles. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The authorities concerned should grant and facilitate rapid and unimpeded access to 
humanitarian and development actors that assist internally displaced persons in 
achieving a durable solution. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The needs, rights and legitimate interests of internally displaced persons should be 
the primary considerations guiding all policies and decisions on durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; All relevant actors need to respect the right of internally displaced persons to make 
an informed and voluntary choice on what durable solution to pursue and to 
participate in the planning and management of durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; An internally displaced person&#8217;s choice of local integration or settlement elsewhere 
in the country, in the absence of the option to return, must not be regarded as a 
renunciation of his/her right to return should that choice later become feasible. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Under no circumstances should internally displaced persons be encouraged or 
compelled to return or relocate to areas where their life, safety, liberty or health 
would be at risk. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Internally displaced persons seeking a durable solution must not be subject to 
discrimination for reasons related to their displacement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Likewise, populations and communities that (re-)integrate internally displaced 
persons and whose needs may be comparable, must not be neglected in comparison 
to the displaced. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Internally displaced persons who have achieved a durable solution continue to be 
protected by international human rights and, where applicable, humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p> Question 3. How should a rights-based process to support a durable solution be 
organized? 
</p>
<p> National and local authorities, humanitarian and development actors need to work 
together to effectively support internally displaced persons and set up a rights-based 
process so that: 
</p>
<p> (a) Internally displaced persons are in a position to make an informed and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>voluntary decision on the durable solution they would like to pursue; 
</p>
<p> (b) They participate in the planning and management of the durable solution so 
that their needs and rights are considered in recovery and development strategies; 
</p>
<p> (c) They have safe, unimpeded and timely access to all actors supporting the 
achievement of durable solutions including non-governmental and international 
humanitarian or development actors; 
</p>
<p> (d) They have access to effective mechanisms that monitor the process and the 
conditions on the ground; and, 
</p>
<p> (e) In situations of displacement resulting from conflict or violence, they are at 
least indirectly involved in peace processes and peacebuilding efforts and such efforts 
reinforce durable solutions<i>;</i> 
</p>
<p> Processes to support a durable solution should be inclusive and involve, on the basis 
of full equality, all parts of the displaced population, including women, children (in 
accordance with their age and level of maturity), persons with special needs and persons 
who are potentially marginalized. 
</p>
<p> Question 4. What criteria determine to what extent a durable solution has been 
achieved? 
</p>
<p> A number of criteria determine to what extent a durable solution has been achieved. 
Internally displaced persons who have achieved a durable solution will enjoy without 
discrimination: 
</p>
<p> (a) Long-term safety, security and freedom of movement; 
 (b) An adequate standard of living, including at a minimum access to adequate 
food, water, housing, health care and basic education; 
</p>
<p> (c) Access to employment and livelihoods; 
 (d) Access to effective mechanisms that restore their housing, land and property 
or provide them with compensation. 
</p>
<p> In a number of contexts, it will also be necessary for internally displaced persons to 
benefit, without discrimination, from the following to achieve a durable solution: 
</p>
<p> (a) Access to and replacement of personal and other documentation; 
 (b) Voluntary reunification with family members separated during displacement; 
 (c) Participation in public affairs at all levels on an equal basis with the resident 
population; 
</p>
<p> (d) Effective remedies for displacement-related violations, including access to 
justice, reparations and information about the causes of violations.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Displacement is a life-changing event. While the often traumatic experience of 
displacement cannot be undone, internally displaced persons (IDPs) need to be able to 
resume a normal life by achieving a durable solution. As articulated in principle 28 of the 
Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,1 IDPs have a right to a durable solution and 
often need assistance in their efforts. Guiding Principles 28&#8211;30 set out the rights of IDPs to 
durable solutions, the responsibilities of national authorities, and the role of humanitarian 
and development actors to assist durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>2. Principle 28 recognizes that the competent authorities have the primary duty and 
responsibility to establish conditions, as well as provide the means, which allow IDPs to 
return voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, 
or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the country. Securing durable solutions for the 
internally displaced is also in the State&#8217;s best interests. Leaving IDPs in continued 
marginalization without the prospect of a durable solution may become an obstacle to long-
term peace, stability, recovery and reconstruction in post-crisis countries. Facilitating 
durable solutions requires that all stakeholders, including national and local authorities, 
humanitarian and development actors, work together, identify the right strategies and 
activities to assist IDPs in this process, and set criteria that will help to determine to what 
extent a durable solution has been achieved. 
</p>
<p>3. The present Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons aims 
to provide clarity on the concept of a durable solution and provides general guidance on 
how to achieve it. This version of the Framework builds on a pilot version released in 2007, 
which the Inter-Agency Standing Committee welcomed and suggested be field-tested. The 
Framework was revised and finalized in 2009, taking into account valuable feedback from 
the field on the pilot version and subsequent drafts.  
</p>
<p>4. The revision process was led by the Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights of internally displaced persons working in close cooperation with the Cluster 
Working Group on Early Recovery and the Protection Cluster Working Group, in particular 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Development 
Programme, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the International 
Organization for Migration, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the United 
Nations Environment Programme and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. 
Support was also provided by the Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement.2  
</p>
<p><b>  Purpose and scope of this Framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. The purpose of this Framework is: (a) to foster a better understanding of the concept 
of durable solutions for the internally displaced; (b) provide general guidance on the 
process and conditions necessary for achieving a durable solution; and (c) assist in 
determining to what extent a durable solution has been achieved.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (E/CN.4/1998/53/Add.2, annex) are based upon, 
</p>
<p>reflect and are consistent with international human rights and humanitarian law. They have been 
recognized by the 2005 World Summit, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly as &#8220;an 
important framework for the protection of internally displaced persons&#8221; (Assembly resolution 60/1, 
para. 132; resolution 62/153 para. 10; resolution 64/162, para. 11; Council resolution 6/32, para. 5). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The pilot version of this Framework was also based on input from the Institute for the Study of 
</p>
<p>International Migration at Georgetown University. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p>6. The Framework aims to provide guidance for achieving durable solutions following 
internal displacement in the context of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, 
violations of human rights, and natural or human-made disasters.3 Being of a generic 
character, the Framework needs to be applied in light of the specific situation and context. 
It is complementary to more detailed operational guidelines adopted by humanitarian and 
development actors or national and local authorities.  
</p>
<p>7. The Framework primarily aims to help international and non-governmental actors to 
better assist Governments dealing with humanitarian and development challenges resulting 
from internal displacement. The Framework may also be useful for Governments of 
countries affected by internal displacement, who have the primary duty and responsibility 
to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to IDPs, as well as for other stakeholders 
namely donors and IDPs themselves.4  </p>
<p><b> II. What is a durable solution for internally displaced persons? 
</b>8. A durable solution is achieved when former IDPs no longer have specific assistance 
and protection needs that are linked to their displacement and such persons can enjoy their 
human rights without discrimination resulting from their displacement. 
</p>
<p>9. A durable solution can be achieved through:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sustainable reintegration at the place of origin (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;return&#8221;) 
&#8226; Sustainable local integration in areas where internally displaced persons take refuge 
</p>
<p>(local integration) 
&#8226; Sustainable integration in another part of the country (settlement elsewhere in the 
</p>
<p>country) 
</p><p>10. The resolution of the immediate cause of displacement, e.g. because a peace 
agreement has been concluded or because floodwaters have receded, may create 
opportunities for finding durable solutions. However, it is usually not sufficient in and by 
itself to create a durable solution. Mere physical movement, namely returning to one&#8217;s 
home or place of habitual residence, moving to another part of the country or choosing to 
integrate locally, often does not amount to a durable solution either (in particular after 
conflict).5 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Situations may of course overlap, in particular where disaster-induced displacement occurs in the 
</p>
<p>context of complex emergencies. It is also increasingly evident that climate change exacerbates 
natural disasters and related displacement, even if not all disaster-induced displacement is related to 
climate change. While this framework may provide some general guidance with regard to 
development-induced displacement, existing special guidelines on resettlement should be consulted. 
See, in particular, World Bank, Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12, December 
2001); Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-
based Evictions and Displacement (A/HRC/4/18, 2007); Asian Development Bank, Policy on 
Involuntary Resettlement, 1996. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 In some situations, the Framework may also be relevant for de facto authorities controlling territory, 
</p>
<p>whose acts are classified under international law as acts of the State to the extent that such authorities 
are in fact exercising elements of governmental authority in the absence or default of the official 
authorities, and in circumstances which call for the exercise of such authority. See article 9, Draft 
Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted by the International 
Law Commission at its fifty-third session and commended to the attention of Governments by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 56/83. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 In some places IDPs are registered for the purpose of providing them with assistance (e.g. food aid). 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>11. Whatever the cause of internal displacement, or the option chosen by IDPs for their 
durable solution, IDPs will commonly continue to have residual needs and human rights 
concerns linked to their displacement. For example, IDPs who have physically returned to 
their place of origin may find that they are unable to rebuild destroyed houses or reclaim 
their land, because the disaster that displaced them has made the land unsafe for habitation 
or the land is now occupied by others. Persons opting for local integration may not find a 
job or a dwelling to rent because of discrimination against IDPs by the resident population 
or authorities. Those who settle elsewhere in the country may require humanitarian, 
developmental and financial assistance until they are able to access livelihoods, education 
and health services in their new location. 
</p>
<p>12. Also, durable solutions must not be exclusively understood as a return to one&#8217;s 
former home and a re-establishment of the status quo before displacement. An IDP can find 
a durable solution away from his or her former home if that person&#8217;s displacement-specific 
needs are met and the person can enjoy his or her rights without displacement-specific 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>13. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution may still face needs or human rights 
concerns that are not displacement-specific, e.g. when IDPs return or relocate to an area 
that was neglected and impoverished even before their displacement or where the wider 
population faces the same challenges as IDPs participate in elections or other public affairs. 
</p>
<p>14. It is therefore important to determine whether the remaining needs or human rights 
concerns are related to the fact of having been displaced. The following criteria can help 
determine whether an IDP need or human rights concern is displacement-specific: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need or human rights concern is the consequence of events causing 
displacement or resulting from displacement. Examples: An IDP lost her birth 
certificate during flight or evacuation and needs a replacement document. A 
returning IDP cannot make a living because those who violently displaced him still 
occupy his agricultural land. An adolescent IDP girl placed with a host family is at 
risk of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need or human rights concern results from the displaced person&#8217;s absence from 
his or her home. For example, a returning IDP needs food aid until the next harvest 
season because she could not cultivate her land because of displacement. Or, an IDP 
who resettled to another area is not on the voter registry because he was not present 
when the census took place. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need or human rights concern is related to conditions in areas of return, local 
integration or settlement elsewhere in the country that pose an obstacle to the IDPs 
being able to choose a durable solution. For example, IDPs who fled natural disaster 
cannot safely return to a flood-prone area until the authorities put in place dams or 
other appropriate disaster risk reduction measures. Or, there is a need to demobilize 
and disarm combatants, punish perpetrators and promote community reconciliation 
to allow a displaced minority to safely return. Or, IDPs are offered to relocate to a 
remote area, where no public services or adequate livelihood opportunities exist. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>The fact that they no longer require such assistance and can be deregistered for that purpose does not 
necessarily mean they have found a durable solution. From the perspective of international law, 
internal displacement is a factual state and, unlike in refugee law, there is nothing like a legal &#8220;IDP 
Status&#8221;. IDP registration can be useful if registration is tied to specific and concrete goals, namely the 
provision of specific assistance. IDP registration or deregistration does not add to or take away from 
the persons rights under international law, including the right to a durable solution. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The need or human rights concern is a consequence of a problem disproportionally 
affecting IDPs, in particular if the problem results from discrimination. For example, 
IDPs trying to integrate locally cannot find jobs despite a high level of employment 
among the resident population. Other IDPs become targets of hate crimes when 
trying to settle in certain areas. 
</p>
<p><b>  A gradual and complex process 
</b></p>
<p>15. Securing a truly durable solution is often a long-term process of gradually 
diminishing displacement-specific needs, while ensuring that IDPs enjoy their rights 
without discrimination related to their displacement. A solution may become durable only 
years, or even decades, after the physical movement to the place of origin or place of 
settlement has taken place, or the decision to locally integrate has been made.  
</p>
<p>16. It is a complex process that involves multiple challenges: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A human rights challenge: finding durable solutions is about restoring the human 
rights of IDPs who have been affected by their being displaced, including their 
rights to security, property, housing, education, health and livelihoods. This may 
entail the right to reparation, justice, truth and closure for past injustices through 
transitional justice or other appropriate measures.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A humanitarian challenge: in the course of achieving durable solutions, IDPs often 
have continuing humanitarian needs. They may need temporary shelter until 
destroyed houses are rebuilt, food rations until the first crops are available, or 
emergency health services until the health system has been re-established. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; A development challenge: achieving durable solutions entails addressing key 
development challenges that are also identified by the Millennium Development 
Goals. These include providing access to livelihoods, education and health care in 
areas of return, local integration or other settlement areas; helping to establish or re-
establish local governance structures and the rule of law, and rebuilding houses and 
infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A peacebuilding or reconstruction challenge: achieving durable solutions after 
conflict, generalized violence and, in some cases, large-scale natural or human-made 
disasters may not be possible without local or even national political, economic and 
social stabilization.  
</p>
<p><b>  A process requiring the coordinated and timely engagement of different actors 
</b></p>
<p>17. The range of actors that can support durable solutions, including national and local 
authorities as well as humanitarian, development, human rights and international political 
actors,6 need to work together from the beginning of the process.  
</p>
<p>18. Humanitarian and development actors both have a role to play in supporting durable 
solutions. Effective coordination between humanitarian and development actors and the 
authorities is essential.<b> </b>National coordination structures such as a commission that 
convenes relevant authorities and their international and non-governmental humanitarian 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 International bodies such as regional organizations, the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission or 
</p>
<p>peacekeeping and political missions, may have an important role to play in some contexts. To date, 
the Peacebuilding Commission has developed, in close cooperation with the Governments concerned, 
peacebuilding strategies on several countries emerging from conflict, and some of them address 
durable solutions for IDPs. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>and development partners can ensure the effective distribution of responsibilities, ensuring 
a coherent and comprehensive strategy.  
</p>
<p>19. In this context, it is important to stress that development actors should assume their 
responsibility for and engage in early recovery7 and recovery strategies and activities that 
assist the authorities in addressing the needs and concerns of IDPs and can be carried over 
into longer-term development programming. Experience shows that early recovery is 
crucial. Investment in early-recovery expedites the achievement of durable solutions, 
avoids protracted displacement, stimulates spontaneous recovery activities within the 
affected population, including host and receiving communities, and helps prevent renewed 
displacement. Among early recovery priorities relevant for durable solutions are the re-
establishment of local governance structures, State protection institutions (police, local 
courts, etc.) and the most basic services (schools, basic health care, water and sanitation) &#8211; 
or where these already exist, their adaption to the specific needs of IDPs. It is also 
important that early recovery efforts provide individual IDPs with immediate and tangible 
assistance to re-establish their livelihoods and such programmes should be initiated already 
as part of the humanitarian response.  
</p>
<p>20. Donors supporting durable solutions should be prepared to provide funds for early 
recovery programmes, which often receive insufficient attention even though they fulfil a 
life-sustaining and peacebuilding function.  
</p>
<p><b> III. What key principles should guide the search for durable 
solutions? 
</b>21. The Guiding Principles, and the international legal framework (international human 
rights law and, where applicable, international humanitarian law) from which they are 
drawn, set out the rights and responsibilities that must be respected in the search for durable 
solutions. All strategies and activities aimed at supporting the search for durable solutions 
have to be based upon these rights and responsibilities:  
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a) The primary responsibility to provide durable solutions for IDPs and ensure 
their protection and assistance needs to be assumed by the national authorities.8 Whilst the 
operationalization of this responsibility may vary depending on the context, in practical 
terms, the national authorities need to ensure at a minimum that the necessary legal and/or 
policy frameworks are in place to secure the rights of IDPs, to establish effective 
government structures to coordinate the national and local response, to facilitate provision 
of humanitarian and development assistance, and to ensure that adequate funding, through 
national budgets as well as international aid, is allocated to support the process;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>(b) National and local authorities should grant international humanitarian and 
development actors, in the exercise of their respective mandates, rapid and unimpeded 
access to assist IDPs in finding a durable solution.9 Although the primary responsibility to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 The concept of early recovery has been defined as the application of development principles to 
</p>
<p>humanitarian situations in order to stabilize local and national capacities from further deterioration so 
that they can provide the foundation for full recovery and stimulate spontaneous recovery activities 
within the affected population. Stabilizing and using these capacities in turn reduces the amount of 
humanitarian support required. See UNDP, Policy on Early Recovery (22 August 2008), at 1.1. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 See Guiding Principle 28 (1). De facto authorities that established effective control over territory have 
</p>
<p>similar responsibilities without this implying legal recognition.

<p> (c) The rights, needs and legitimate interests of IDPs should be the primary 
considerations guiding all policies and decisions relating to internal displacement and 
durable solutions.<b> </b>Durable solutions are often linked to important issues of territorial 
integrity, sovereignty and security. Nevertheless, considerations based on the needs and 
vulnerabilities of IDPs and informed by international human rights standards should guide 
laws and policies on internal displacement at all times; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(d) All relevant actors need to respect that IDPs have a right to make an informed 
and voluntary decision on what durable solution to pursue.10 They also have the right to 
participate in the planning and management of durable solutions strategies and 
programmes.11 IDPs determine, in light of the specific circumstances of their situation, 
whether to pursue return, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country. There is 
no hierarchy among different types of durable solutions. A peace agreement may contain a 
policy of preference for one durable solution, but even in these cases the principle of 
freedom of movement remains valid and individual choices must be respected and 
supported. National and local authorities and humanitarian and development actors should 
base their durable solution programming on the actual preferences of IDPs and work 
towards providing them with a meaningful and realistic choice of durable solutions;  
</p>
<p><b> </b>(e) A person opting for local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country in 
the absence of a prospect of return does not lose the right to return once return<b> </b>becomes 
feasible. Exercising the right to choose a durable solution requires that different options 
(return, local integration, settlement elsewhere) are available. IDPs, who have no prospect 
of return in the foreseeable future (e.g. due to unresolved territorial disputes or because a 
disaster has rendered land uninhabitable), will often choose to integrate locally for the time 
being while retaining the prospect of an eventual return. Supporting IDPs in normalizing 
their living situation at the site of displacement (helping them to find employment, their 
own home, etc.) does not exclude the right to return. Rather, such support contributes to 
avoiding protracted displacement, enhances self-sufficiency and places IDPs in a stronger 
position to voluntarily return to their former homes at a later point. The decision to 
integrate locally or settle elsewhere in the country on a more permanent basis, even though 
return is feasible, does not preclude the person&#8217;s freedom to later choose to move 
elsewhere, including to his/her original home; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> </b>Under no circumstances should IDPs be encouraged or compelled to return or 
relocate to areas where their life, safety, liberty or health would be at risk.12 Policymakers 
often grapple with the question as to when conditions are conducive to begin assisting 
returns, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country. This issue must not be 
confused with the question when a durable solution has been achieved. Practically 
speaking, not all conditions for durable solutions need to be in place for humanitarian or 
development actors or national and local authorities to begin assisting IDP return or 
settlement. However, even when return, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the 
country are entirely voluntary, they should not be promoted if they endanger the life, safety, 
liberty or health of IDPs or if a minimum standard of agreeable living conditions bearing in

 This right emanates from the right to freedom of movement and residence guaranteed by article 13 (1)

<p>of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is also implicit in Guiding Principle 28. See below,

 According to Guiding Principle 15 (d), IDPs have &#8220;The right to be protected against forcible return to 
</p>
<p>or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, liberty and/or health would be at risk.&#8221; </p>

</b></p>
<p>mind local conditions cannot be ensured.13 It is crucial to have constant monitoring, 
including independent monitoring, of conditions in return/relocation areas. Conditions at 
the site of displacement that may push IDPs to accept unsafe return or relocation also need 
to be monitored; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(g) IDPs who return, integrate locally or settle elsewhere in the country must not 
be subject to discrimination, in particular for reasons related to their displacement.14 Non-
discrimination is a cross-cutting principle that should guide the process of supporting a 
durable solution and the assessment to what extent a durable solution has been achieved. 
IDPs should neither be discriminated against on the basis of their displacement nor on 
grounds of their race, religion, gender, language, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, disability, age, marital and family status, nationality, or other status; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(h) Similarly, populations and communities that (re)integrate IDPs and whose 
needs may be comparable should not be neglected. The arrival and integration of IDPs will 
likely place a considerable burden on existing community services and resources. Ensuring 
a community-based approach that addresses the needs of IDPs and those receiving them 
may mitigate risks of tensions between the two populations, and support a more effective 
integration or reintegration of IDPs; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(i) IDPs continue to be protected by national and international human rights, 
and, where applicable, international humanitarian law, even after they have achieved a 
durable solution.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. How should a rights-based process to support durable 
solutions be organized? 
</b>22. Humanitarian and development actors, working closely with national and local 
authorities, should adopt a rights-based approach to supporting durable solutions that places 
IDPs at the centre of the process. IDPs should be the primary actors in the process of 
finding the durable solution of their choice (and they generally are).15 A rights-based 
approach should ensure that: 
</p>
<p> (a) IDPs are in a position to make a voluntary and informed choice on what 
durable solution they would like to pursue; 
</p>
<p> (b) IDPs participate in the planning and management of durable solutions, so that 
recovery and development strategies address their rights and needs;  
</p>
<p> (c) IDPs have access to humanitarian and development actors;  
  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 Usually returns should only be encouraged if there is a prospect of a durable solution. Temporary 
</p>
<p>returns without the prospect of a durable solution can be used as a protection strategy in exceptional 
circumstances, namely where return would pose a lesser risk than continued presence at the site of 
displacement. 
</p>
<p>  Humanitarian actors also grapple with the dilemma of whether to assist IDPs who spontaneously 
return or relocate even though they have been informed that conditions are not safe. In some 
scenarios, it might be appropriate to assist IDPs if this decreases the risks they face, while strictly 
abstaining from promoting such unsafe return or relocation. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 Guiding Principle 29 (1) states that &#8220;Internally displaced persons who have returned to their homes or 
</p>
<p>places of habitual residence or who have resettled in another part of the country shall not be 
discriminated against as a result of their having been displaced. They shall have the right to 
participate fully and equally in public affairs at all levels and have equal access to public services.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 In a number of cases, IDPs will pursue durable solutions spontaneously outside any planned 
</p>
<p>processes. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p> (d) IDPs have access to effective monitoring mechanisms; and  
 (e) In cases of displacement caused by conflict or violence, peace processes and 
peacebuilding involve IDPs and reinforce durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>23. These five objectives derive from the rights and responsibilities set out in section III. 
This section will explain in general terms what it takes to achieve them, without providing 
the detailed guidance of an operational manual. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Voluntary and informed choice of a location for a durable solution  
</b></p>
<p>24. National and local authorities, humanitarian and development actors need to provide 
IDPs with all the information they require to choose a durable solution, while also ensuring 
that IDPs can exercise this choice without coercion. 
</p>
<p>25. Relevant information has to reach all parts of the IDP population, including women, 
children (in accordance with their age and maturity), persons with special needs and 
persons who are potentially marginalized (e.g. minority groups among the IDP population). 
The information has to be provided in a language and format understood by the IDPs, 
including those who are not literate. Where IDPs are in urban areas or dispersed, special 
efforts will be needed to ensure that they receive notice of consultations and information. 
At a minimum, the information conveyed should include:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Assessments of the general situation in the community of origin or potential areas of 
local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country, including the political 
situation, safety and security, freedom of movement, amnesties or legal guarantees, 
the human rights situation, legal and other mechanisms to protect the rights of 
women, children, youth, minorities, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and the 
type and duration of assistance available to them. The assessments should include a 
realistic account of the risks of renewed displacement in potential areas of return, 
local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country and objective information on 
the existing protection and (disaster) risk reduction mechanisms in place. 
Information should be provided on the mechanisms put in place to ensure smooth 
(re)integration within the resident population.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The procedures for returning, integrating locally or settling elsewhere in the country, 
including information on reintegration packages, administrative regulations, and 
documentation requirements. In the case of return or settlement elsewhere in the 
country, IDPs will require practical information such as what items they can take 
with them, available transport, and arrangements for those with special needs. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The conditions in places of return, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the 
country, including degrees of destruction, access to housing, land, livelihoods, 
landmine risks, employment and other economic opportunities; availability of public 
services (public transport, health care, education, means of communication, etc.); 
conditions of buildings and infrastructure for schools, health clinics, roads, bridges 
and sanitation systems; and assistance available from national, international and 
private actors. 
</p>
<p>26. Providing information through community assemblies involving men, women and 
children of a certain age and maturity (or small but inclusive groups of representatives 
where large assemblies are not possible) may be one effective way to convey information 
directly to all IDPs and thereby avoid privileging certain individuals. Public announcements 
through accessible mass media (e.g. radio) are particularly useful, in particular where IDP 
populations are dispersed, difficult to access or pursue durable solutions spontaneously. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>27. To the extent possible, arrangements should be made for IDP representatives to visit 
and assess conditions for return or settlement elsewhere in the country. These &#8220;go and see&#8221; 
visits should include all parts of the IDP population, including women, children of a certain 
age and level of maturity, persons with special needs and persons who are potentially 
marginalized. The visits should include opportunities for consultation with populations 
residing in these areas to identify issues that may create conflict and the means to resolve 
them. Development and humanitarian actors should support national and local authorities in 
developing the capacity to adequately inform IDPs.  
</p>
<p>28. IDPs have to be given the opportunity to voluntarily choose a durable solution. In 
principle, a voluntary choice is based on an individual decision. However, in many settings 
it is acceptable and appropriate in the local context to have decision-making by family or by 
community. In such cases, women, children (in accordance with their age and level of 
maturity) and persons belonging to groups who have special needs or are potentially 
marginalized need to be fully included. Moreover, there should be individual support 
options for adults who have valid reasons to choose a different type of durable solution than 
their family or community (e.g. people who are too traumatized or vulnerable to return or 
others who would like to finish their education). The best interests of the child should be 
the primary consideration guiding durable solutions for children. The perspectives of 
children need to be heard and their views given due weight in accordance with their age and 
maturity. 
</p>
<p>29. No coercion must be used to induce or prevent return, local integration or settlement 
elsewhere in the country.16 Coercion includes not only physical force, restrictions on 
freedom of movement, harassment or intimidation, but also tacit forms of coercion such as 
providing erroneous and deliberately misleading information, making assistance conditional 
on specific choices, setting arbitrary time limits to end assistance or closing IDP camps, 
collective centres, transitional shelters and other facilities before the minimum conditions 
conducive for returns, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country17 are in place. 
</p>
<p>30. IDPs also have to have a meaningful choice, which is often linked to the availability 
of assistance. In principle, recovery and reconstruction efforts should focus on the type of 
durable solutions that IDPs wish to seek. Selective assistance for a particular solution or 
incentives tied to a particular durable solution are only acceptable if they are based on 
objective and serious reasons. Investments in return areas may, for instance, be favoured if 
return has been accepted as a priority option in a peace agreement. One can also imagine a 
situation in which a group of IDPs cannot safely return to a flood-prone area, yet their local 
integration would overwhelm the local absorption capacity, so that the authorities give 
priority to supporting their settlement in the country. Relevant factors that may call for 
favouring certain locations for durable solutions over others include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The wishes of a majority of IDPs 
&#8226; Priorities identified in a peace agreement that takes into account IDPs&#8217; rights, needs 
</p>
<p>and legitimate interests18 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The local absorption capacity for integrating IDPs in areas of return, local 
integration or settlement elsewhere in the country 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
 Guiding Principle 28 emphasizes that IDPs should be able &#8220;to return voluntarily, in safety and with 
</p>
<p>dignity, to their homes or places of habitual residence, or to resettle voluntarily in another part of the 
country&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>

<p>&#8226; Differences between areas with regard to security and available protection 
mechanisms, including disaster risks 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Differences between areas with regard to the availability of natural resources,

services

<p>&#8226; Environmental sustainability of the durable solution envisaged19  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The overall cost of supporting different options, bearing in mind available resources 
and pledged donor funds 
</p>
<p>31. There may be exceptional situations where the choice of a durable solution can be 
restricted because conditions are too unsafe to permit returns or settlement in a specific 
location. Freedom of movement and residence is a fundamental human right, but it can be 
restricted in narrowly defined circumstances. IDP return or settlement elsewhere in the 
country may be prohibited where IDPs would still face serious risks to their life or health 
despite the best efforts of the authorities to protect them. Recurrent disasters, for instance, 
may make an area uninhabitable or seriously unsafe, even if all necessary and reasonable 
disaster risk reduction measures were to be adopted. Or the demining of a certain terrain 
might prove to be so difficult and costly that it might not be reasonable when compared 
with other post-conflict needs.  
</p>
<p>32. In situations of displacement resulting from serious violations of human rights, in 
particular ethnic cleansing, the authorities are under a strict obligation to protect IDPs from 
further violations and returns may not permanently be prohibited. 
</p>
<p>33. Measures prohibiting or effectively denying freedom of movement and residence 
may only be imposed on the basis of law. Restrictions on settlement choices may only be 
instituted as a last resort and only as long as absolutely necessary to protect those affected 
from serious risks to their life, physical integrity or health. They must be applied without 
discrimination. IDPs must be informed and consulted in advance of imposing the 
restriction, including where evacuations are to become permanent relocations. The 
alternative settlement area provided to IDPs should offer comparable living conditions, 
livelihood opportunities and public services. Decisions must be communicated to IDPs in a 
language and format they can understand.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation of internally displaced persons in the planning and 
management of durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>34. IDPs must be consulted and participate extensively in the planning and management 
of the processes supporting a durable solution.20 All parts of the IDP population, including 
women, children (according to their age and maturity), persons with special needs and 
persons who are potentially marginalized, must be fully included. Local communities that 
receive IDPs and other affected populations also need to be consulted.  
</p>
<p>35. Processes to involve IDPs should respect existing social structures, forms of 
organization and decision-making processes within IDP communities, provided and to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19
 Where larger numbers of IDPs seek a durable solution in a particular area this has an impact on the 
</p>
<p>local environment and natural resource base. Durable solutions can be negatively affected by 
environmental degradation and resource depletion leading to a crisis in long-term viability or creating 
a potential cause of conflict between IDPs and host communities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 See Guiding Principle 28 and para. 21 (d) above. For guidance on the methodology see, for instance, 
</p>
<p><i>The UNHCR Tool for Participatory Assessments in Operations </i>(2006). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>extent that this does not prevent women, children (in accordance with their age and 
maturity), persons with special needs and persons who are potentially marginalized from 
being involved on the basis of full equality. Community meetings, social and other service 
delivery, feeding centres, skills training and income generating programmes, and other 
environments in which the displaced gather can be used to ensure the full participation of 
IDPs in the planning and management of durable solutions. The involvement of civil 
society in outreach efforts, round-table discussions involving different stakeholders or 
facilitated dialogues between government officials and communities may help ensure 
broader participation of IDPs and other affected populations and can help reduce stigma 
and prejudice that IDPs may encounter. IDPs who have spontaneously sought a durable 
solution also need to be consulted about continuing assistance or protection needs. 
</p>
<p>36. Special efforts also need to be made to consult IDPs on general legislative and 
policy proposals affecting their rights, legitimate interests and prospects to achieve a 
durable solution, e.g. laws on reconciliation and transitional justice or policies on disaster 
risk reduction. 
</p>
<p>37. The assessed needs and rights of all parts of the IDP population, including women, 
children, persons with special needs and persons who are potentially marginalized, need to 
be addressed in recovery and development strategies. In some cases it may be appropriate 
to elaborate IDP-specific strategies for recovery or development and corresponding legal 
frameworks. National and local authorities have the responsibility to take the lead in 
recovery and development processes. They should establish their leading role by setting 
priorities in the allocation of the budget at their disposal.  
</p>
<p>38. Needs assessments and consultations with IDPs as well as with communities that 
have to integrate or reintegrate the displaced are essential to ensure that the specific needs 
and rights of IDPs are taken into account and that the efforts undertaken reinforce existing 
coping strategies of the displaced population.  
</p>
<p>39. In some situations, it may be appropriate to develop a displacement-specific 
strategy. This may be a national strategy, a strategy limited to certain displacement-affected 
areas or even a regional strategy that is jointly developed by several countries. In other 
cases, it may be appropriate to integrate the specific needs and rights of IDPs into general 
recovery or development strategies targeting a given area. Considerations for determining 
whether an IDP-specific or an area-based approach is more appropriate include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; What is the proportion of IDPs among the overall affected population? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are there gross disparities between the situation of IDPs and the resident population 
in areas of return, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the country?  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are the primary recovery or development concerns linked to internal displacement? 
To what extent do IDPs have needs that are different from those of the general 
population? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; How would an IDP-specific approach, as opposed to an area-based approach, impact 
on reconciliation and the relationship between IDPs and the resident population? 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Are IDPs still in protracted displacement, while the general population has moved 
from recovery to development? 
</p>
<p>40. IDP-specific strategies should also take into account the needs of resident 
populations who share the burdens of displacement. These include host communities and 
host families that took in and supported displaced families as well as communities that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p>receive IDPs who return, locally integrate or settle elsewhere in the country.21 Distinctions 
between groups of IDPs (e.g. IDP groups from different waves of conflict or IDPs who fled 
natural disaster as against those who fled conflict) must not be made unless the groups have 
different needs.22 All efforts should be made to ensure that IDPs receive reintegration 
support that is comparable to that provided to returning refugees and demobilized 
combatants to the extent that these groups have comparable needs.  
</p>
<p>41. A coordination mechanism, ideally one that builds upon existing coordination 
structures, should be set up to coordinate the implementation of the strategy and ensure that 
early-recovery efforts are carried over into long-term recovery, development and 
reconstruction programming.  
</p>
<p>42. In the case of disasters, it is important that post-disaster recovery and reconstruction 
plans also take into account specific needs of IDPs, which may differ from those of other 
affected populations. IDPs should participate in the design phase of such plans in 
accordance with the principles outlined above. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to actors supporting durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>43. National authorities should grant and facilitate safe, unimpeded and timely access to 
non-governmental and international humanitarian and development actors assisting IDPs to 
return, locally integrate or settle elsewhere in the country. International and national 
humanitarian and development organizations have an important role to play in assisting 
durable solutions. Access must not be arbitrarily denied, particularly when the authorities 
are unable or unwilling to provide the required humanitarian and integration or 
reintegration assistance themselves. 23 
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to effective monitoring  
</b></p>
<p>44. National and local authorities, humanitarian and development actors should set up 
effective mechanisms to monitor the process of supporting durable solutions and 
determining what remains to be done to achieve a durable solution.<b> </b>Monitoring helps to 
ensure that conditions on the ground comply with this Framework and the international 
human rights standards upon which it is based, in particular with regard to safety, security 
and voluntary returns. Assessments should also include a gender analysis and take into 
account persons who have special needs or might be marginalized within the displaced 
population. Credible complaint mechanisms for IDPs and other affected populations can 
ensure that concerns can be brought to the immediate attention of the responsible national 
or local authorities. 
</p>
<p>45. In order to provide an objective and transparent basis for monitoring, the criteria set 
out in this Framework24 should be translated into indicators that are sensitive to the local 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 See also above, para. 21 (h). The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons refers in this context to &#8220;displacement affected communities&#8221; to 
underscore that internal displacement has repercussions that extend beyond IDPs and calls for the 
provision of assistance to a broader spectrum of beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>22
 Processes to register IDPs in order to give them access to reintegration support or special legal 
</p>
<p>processes (e.g. property restitution) must be inclusive and not arbitrarily exclude displaced 
populations that fall under the descriptive definition provided by principle 2 of the Guiding 
Principles. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 See Guiding Principles 25 and 30. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 See below, paras. 53&#8211;105. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/21/Add.4

</b></p>
<p>context. The indicators should be developed in close cooperation between the authorities, 
humanitarian and development actors and after consultation with IDP communities. While 
it will often not be feasible to obtain reliable and disaggregated data in post-crisis 
situations, indicators can be based on data derived from surveys using small but 
representative population samples or assessments based on a qualitative methodology 
(focus group interviews, etc.) and carried out by independent experts. Provided that 
disaggregated data is obtainable, indicators should be devised so as to show differences 
within the IDP population based on sex, age, ethnicity and other relevant categories. 
</p>
<p>46. International monitoring bodies, national human rights institutions, non-
governmental organizations and other independent observers should enjoy free and 
unimpeded access to areas of IDP return or settlement and to individual IDPs.25 Scrutiny by 
independent actors complements the efforts of national and local authorities and 
humanitarian and development actors in monitoring their own work. Independent 
mechanisms should ensure the transparency of their work through public reporting. The 
scope of the monitoring work should be determined in memoranda of understanding signed 
by national and local authorities and the monitoring institution. 
</p>
<p>47. In situations of displacement resulting from conflict and generalized violence, it also 
needs to be ensured that peace processes and peacebuilding involve IDPs and reinforce 
durable solutions. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Peace processes and peacebuilding must involve internally displaced 
persons and reinforce durable solutions 
</b></p>
<p>48. Where relevant, IDPs should participate in peace processes. Their rights, needs and 
legitimate interests need to be addressed in peace agreements and peacebuilding strategies 
emerging from these processes, which often predetermine whether and how durable 
solutions will be ensured. At the same time, durable solutions for IDPs may be a key 
element in building a lasting peace. Humanitarian and development actors have to analyse 
the linkages between conflict and displacement to understand how peace processes can 
strengthen the potential for durable solutions (and vice versa). 
</p><p>49. All parts of the IDP population, including women, children (in accordance with their 
age and maturity), persons with special needs and persons who are potentially 
marginalized, should be involved in peace processes. IDPs should also be actively involved 
in the formulation and implementation of peacebuilding strategies.26 If direct participation 
of IDPs in the peace negotiations is not possible or desirable, their indirect participation 
should be ensured. Humanitarian and development actors have an important role to play in 
advocating for the participation of IDPs and assisting their effective participation, including 
through training, community development and other appropriate means.  
</p>
<p>50. Durable solutions should be a specific goal of peace agreements. Where a close 
relationship exists between conflict and displacement, the peace agreement should 
effectively address the specific needs and rights of IDPs, including: 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 See Guiding Principle 30: &#8220;All authorities concerned shall grant and facilitate for international

<p>humanitarian organizations and other appropriate actors, in the exercise of their respective mandates, 
rapid and unimpeded access to internally displaced persons to assist in their return or resettlement and 
reintegration.&#8221;

<p>&#8226; Use clear and consistent definitions pertaining to internal displacement 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Incorporate displacement-specific rights and protections that reflect the needs and 
legitimate interests of IDPs 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Specify the roles and obligations of relevant actors with regard to IDPs  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Address the implementation process, including the participation of IDPs 
</p>
<p>52. Beyond or in the absence of a formal peace process, community reconciliation and 
confidence-building mechanisms are often necessary, in particular where IDPs and the 
resident population or different groups within the IDP population are seen as having been 
associated with opposing sides in the conflict, but now live side by side. In addition, 
conflict resolution mechanisms may be needed to resolve disputes that occur when IDPs 
seek to integrate or reintegrate into communities where there is competition over scarce 
resources, such as land or livelihood opportunities.27  
</p>
<p><b> V. What criteria determine to what extent a durable solution 
has been achieved? 
</b>53. The following eight criteria may be used to determine to what extent a durable 
solution has been achieved: (a) safety and security; (b) adequate standard of living; (c) 
access to livelihoods; (d) restoration of housing, land and property; (e) access to 
documentation; (f) family reunification; (g) participation in public affairs; and (h) access to 
effective remedies and justice.  
54. It will be necessary to apply the criteria bearing in mind the specific situation and 
context. Moreover, these criteria are interlinked and overlap (e.g. the restoration of land has 
a positive effect on livelihoods and an adequate standard of living). As noted above, 
underpinning all of the eight criteria is the principle of non-discrimination &#8211; that IDPs are 
not discriminated against, neither on the basis of their displacement nor on other grounds.28  
</p>
<p>55. Given the complexities and challenges of many displacement situations, these 
criteria often mark an ideal that may be difficult to achieve in the medium term. The criteria 
should therefore be seen as benchmarks for measuring progress made towards achieving 
durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 Competition over resources is also typical for post-disaster situations and there is often a need for 
</p>
<p>conflict resolution mechanisms in such situations as well.

</b></p>
<p><b> A. Long-term safety and security  
</b></p>
<p>56. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution enjoy physical safety and security on the 
basis of effective protection by national and local authorities. This includes protection from 
those threats which caused the initial displacement or may cause renewed displacement. 
The protection of IDPs who have achieved a durable solution must not be less effective 
than the protection provided to populations or areas of the country not affected by 
displacement.  
</p>
<p>57. While absolute safety and security may often not be achievable, IDPs must not be 
the subject of attacks, harassment, intimidation, persecution or any other form of punitive 
action upon return to their home communities or settlement elsewhere in the country. In 
addition, they must be protected from landmines, unexploded ordinances, small arms or 
other violence. Displacement and its social consequences also render women, boys and 
girls more vulnerable to exploitation, intrafamily violence or sexual violence, which must 
be addressed.  
</p>
<p>58. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution also enjoy freedom of movement. They 
can freely leave their areas of settlement and return and come back. While certain 
movement restrictions to protect essential interests or the freedoms of others may be 
imposed on a temporary basis (e.g. curfews in tense security considerations), they must not 
be discriminatory or arbitrary. For example, travel restrictions that apply only to IDPs or 
the specific areas in which they live but not to the resident population would generally pose 
a serious obstacle to IDPs achieving durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>59. In the case of return to or settlement in disaster-prone areas, disaster risk reduction 
measures (early warning, preparedness, mitigation and adaptation) have been implemented 
to minimize, to the extent possible and reasonable, risks stemming from natural or human-
made hazards. In many cases, it is not enough to rebuild the status quo before displacement 
since it offered insufficient protection. Instead, the national and local authorities and donors 
should be ready to make substantial investments to &#8220;build back better&#8221;. National and local 
authorities will need to take measures to reduce the vulnerability of IDPs and the general 
population from recurrent natural hazards or secondary hazards.  
</p>
<p>60. Efforts to promote the sustainable use of livelihoods and safeguard the environment 
(e.g. reforestation programmes) can help prevent natural hazards from becoming human-
made disasters. </p>
<p>61. Permanent relocation of IDPs to another area offering comparable living conditions 
may be required as a last resort, where minimum safety cannot be achieved, even if all 
necessary and reasonable disaster risk reduction measures are taken.29  
</p>
<p>62. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution have full and non-discriminatory access 
to national and local protection mechanisms, including police, courts, national human rights 
institutions and national disaster management services. The primary responsibility for 
ensuring that IDPs do not face dangers to their physical safety and security rests with 
national and local authorities. They have to provide protection to the displaced, especially 
by addressing their particular protection needs. Although law enforcement and judicial 
systems in rural areas, or in countries in transition from conflict or severely affected by 
disasters may not yet be sufficiently developed or re-established, it is important that IDPs 
have the same level of access as the resident population in the area to national and local 
protection mechanisms. The establishment or reconstruction of effective courts and police

</p>
<p>in areas of return, settlement elsewhere in the country or local integration should be 
considered a priority. 
</p>
<p>63. Countries that experienced conflict or major natural disasters may temporarily need 
assistance from the international community in establishing safety and security. A gradual 
handover process, at the end of which national and local authorities assume full 
responsibility for protection, promotes durable protection. Protection that depends on the 
continued presence of international actors, namely peacekeeping forces, without a handover 
strategy is generally not durable. 
</p>
<p>64. Depending on the type of displacement, the local context and obtainable data, it 
would be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards achieving safety 
and security:30 </p>
<p>&#8226; Level of clearance of mines and unexploded ordinance on main roads, living areas 
and cultivatable land in sites of IDP return or settlement elsewhere in the country. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Degree of reduction of checkpoints or other special security measures.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; That IDPs face no discriminatory or arbitrary restrictions of their freedom of 
movement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Progress made in disarming, demobilizing and reintegrating former combatants. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Number of police stations and courts as well as trained police and judicial personnel 
deployed in IDP return or settlement areas compared to the national average or the 
local situation before displacement. The degree of access by IDPs to police and 
judiciary compared to the resident population. Frequency of police patrolling in IDP 
areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Number of reported acts of violence or intimidation targeting IDPs on the basis of 
their IDP or minority status. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Prevalence of violent crimes suffered by IDPs compared to crimes suffered by the 
resident population, the situation before displacement or the national average (as 
appropriate). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Degree of continuation of spontaneous and voluntary returns to specific areas. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reduction of the number of persons facing risks emanating from natural hazards. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Measures taken to reduce future disaster risks. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Safety and security perceptions of IDPs seeking a durable solution.31 
</p>
<p><b> B. Enjoyment of an adequate standard of living without discrimination 
</b>65. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution enjoy, without discrimination, an 
adequate standard of living, including at a minimum shelter, health care, food, water and 
other means of survival. An adequate standard of living requires that at a basic minimum 
IDPs have adequate access, on a sustainable basis, to: 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 These indicators are examples. Depending on the actual situation, some of them may be relevant 
</p>
<p>while others are not. Users of this Framework also have to decide to what extent the quantitative data 
that some of the indicators require can be reasonably obtained. See in this regard also above, para. 45. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 How IDP communities themselves perceive safety and security can help determine whether protection 
</p>
<p>is effective, bearing in mind, however, that long-term exposure to violence and insecurity may have 
shifted perceptions of acceptable threat levels. </p>

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Essential food and potable water 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Basic shelter and housing 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Essential medical services, including post-sexual assault care and other reproductive 
health care 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sanitation 
</p>
<p>&#8226; At least primary school education32  
</p>
<p>66. In this context, adequacy means that these minimum goods and services are:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Available to the affected population in sufficient quantity and quality bearing in 
mind the local context. For instance, housing units may have to be reconstructed or 
newly constructed for IDPs seeking a durable solution, including where they locally 
integrate, settle elsewhere in the country or return, but did not have property prior to 
displacement. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accessible, i.e. the goods and services: (a) are granted without discrimination to all 
in need; (b) are within safe and easy reach and can be physically and financially 
accessed by everyone, including vulnerable and marginalized groups; and (c) are 
known to the beneficiaries. For instance, if essential food and potable water cannot 
be provided due to environmental degradation or soil contamination after a disaster, 
an adequate standard of living cannot be ensured. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Acceptable, i.e. the goods and services are culturally appropriate and sensitive to 
gender and age. Indigenous or nomadic people, for instance, often have special 
cultural traditions when it comes to food or housing.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adaptable, i.e. goods and services are provided in ways flexible enough to adapt to 
the changing needs of IDPs.33  
</p>
<p>67. National and local authorities have the principal responsibility to ensure that these 
core needs are met and must make the requisite budget allocations. They should also call 
upon humanitarian and development actors to assist in addressing these concerns where 
State resources are insufficient. 
</p>
<p>68. IDPs who have achieved durable solutions can access public services, including 
education, health care, social housing and other welfare measures, on the same basis as 
members of the resident population with comparable needs.  
</p>
<p>69. Where there are large disparities between displacement-affected areas and other 
parts of the country (which could be a source of renewed tension and displacement) 
tangible commitments on the part of the authorities and partners should be made to 
progressively realize the economic, social and cultural rights of both IDPs and other

<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has taken the view that a minimum core 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the 
rights is incumbent upon every State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights: &#8220;Thus, for example, a State party in which any significant number of individuals is 
deprived of essential foodstuffs, of essential primary health care, of basic shelter and housing, or of 
the most basic forms of education is, prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations under the 
Covenant.&#8221; See CESC, general comment No. 3 (1990), para. 10.

<p>affected populations. In many cases, it is necessary to &#8220;build back better&#8221; and address root 
causes of displacement to ensure that solutions are durable.  
</p>
<p>70. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards an adequate standard 
of living: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Assistance programmes in place to provide IDPs with essential food, potable water, 
basic shelter and essential health care 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Estimated number of IDPs who are malnourished or homeless 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDPs who do not have access to essential food, potable water, basic 
shelter or essential health care compared to the resident population, the situation 
before displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDP children with access to at least primary education in adequate 
conditions and quality, compared to the resident population, the situation before 
displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; No legal or administrative obstacles preventing IDP children from going to school 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rates of IDP children whose education was interrupted by displacement and who 
resume schooling 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDPs living in overcrowded housing/shelter, compared to the resident 
population, the situation before displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; IDPs do not face specific obstacles to access public services, assistance or 
remittances from abroad compared to local residents with comparable needs  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to livelihoods and employment 
</b></p>
<p>71. IDPs who found a durable solution also have access to employment and livelihoods. 
Employment and livelihoods available to IDPs must allow them to fulfil at least their core 
socio-economic needs,34 in particular where these are not guaranteed by public welfare 
programmes.  
</p>
<p>72. Beyond this, access to livelihoods is a relative measure. Reintegration often occurs 
in circumstances of fragile economies and high unemployment affecting the entire 
population, including IDPs. It will not always be possible for all IDPs to gain employment 
or regain their previous livelihoods. However, IDPs must not face obstacles that prevent 
them from accessing employment and livelihoods on the same basis as residents (e.g. where 
IDPs are relocated to a remote area without affordable transportation to local labour 
markets).  
</p><p>73. There might be a need for positive preferential measures to help IDPs acquire new 
professional knowledge, adapt to new livelihoods and acquire new skills (for instance, 
where IDPs from a rural area locally integrate into an urban environment or where IDPs 
were excluded from the labour market for a long time). There is a particular obligation to 
provide alternative livelihood opportunities for IDPs who are being forcibly relocated by 
the authorities from high-risk areas.35

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-10049 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>74. Opportunities that IDPs had during displacement should be preserved to the extent 
possible. When displacement lasts over long periods of time or involves a rural to urban 
transition, it often alters the social dynamic within IDP communities. Women and young 
adults may have access to education or employment opportunities that were not available in 
their area of origin.  
</p>
<p>75. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards employment and 
livelihoods: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; There are no legal or administrative obstacles to IDP employment or economic 
activity that the resident population does not face 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unemployment among IDPs compared to the resident population, the situation 
before displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Types and conditions of employment of the IDP population compared to the non-
displaced population, including rates of informal-market employment and access to 
labour law standards, such as the minimum wage, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Poverty levels among IDPs compared to the resident population, the situation before 
displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p><b> D. Effective and accessible mechanisms to restore housing, land and 
property 
</b></p>
<p>76. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution have access to effective mechanisms for 
timely restitution of their housing, land and property, regardless of whether they return or 
opt to integrate locally or settle elsewhere in the country.36 These standards apply not only 
to all residential, agricultural and commercial property, but also to lease and tenancy 
agreements. The right to restitution or compensation extends to all displaced persons &#8212; 
including men, women and children &#8212; who have lost ownership, tenancy rights or other 
access entitlements to their housing, land and property, whether they have formal or 
informal titles or rights on the basis of mere uncontested use or occupation (e.g. people 
arbitrarily displaced from informal settlements). It also includes people who stand to inherit 
property from deceased family members (e.g. orphans). People with a special attachment to 
their land such as indigenous peoples require special attention. 
</p>
<p>77. The process through which restitution of housing, land and property and related 
compensation is carried out can be complex and time-consuming. It is not necessary for this 
process to be fully concluded before IDPs can be said to have found a durable solution. The 
determining factor is that they have access to an effective and accessible mechanism for 
property restitution and compensation (including, where needed, free legal assistance) and 
are able to reside safely and securely during the interim. In some cases it may be 
appropriate to establish special restitution and compensation mechanisms (e.g. a Land 
Claims Commission) while in others, existing institutions, including traditional property 
dispute mechanisms, may have the capacity to handle the caseload effectively and 
impartially.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>36
 Guiding Principle 29 (2) spells out the responsibilities of competent authorities regarding property 
</p>
<p>restitution and compensation.

</p>

<p><b>24</b> GE.10-10049 
</p>
<p>78. Addressing housing, land and property rights issues requires a comprehensive 
perspective.<b> </b>In principle, restitution is the preferred remedy. But in some cases it may be 
more equitable, after weighing different interests, to compensate the displaced owner 
instead of restoring his or her property. Appropriate solutions should be found for persons 
whose tenancy rights have been compromised in the course of displacement. Alternative 
solutions should be found for temporary occupants of IDP property who face eviction in the 
course of property restitution, in particular if they are displaced persons themselves and 
occupy the property in good faith (e.g. negotiated tenancy agreements between occupants 
and IDP owners). 
79. Problems that women and children may face in obtaining recognition of their 
ownership or access to property need special attention, particularly where there are legal 
barriers to women or children inheriting property. Claims of particularly vulnerable groups 
of IDPs (e.g. families with many children or IDPs living in dilapidated collective centres) 
should be processed as a priority. 
</p>
<p>80. National laws need to be examined and, where necessary, revised to ensure that 
IDPs do not lose property rights on the basis of an unfair application of legal provisions on 
abandoned property or adverse possession. Finally, efforts should be made to ensure that 
restitution decisions in favour of IDPs are systematically enforced, with care taken to 
guarantee the safety, security and reintegration of IDPs after they repossess their housing, 
land or property. It must be ensured that returnees without property rights as well as IDPs 
who locally integrate or resettle to areas where they do not own property still have access to 
basic shelter and housing.37 
</p>
<p>81. IDPs who want to return to houses that have been destroyed have the possibility of 
having them rebuilt or, where this is impossible, to be provided with an alternative. In some 
cases, the authorities will have a legal obligation to rebuild the house because they are 
responsible for the destruction (for instance, where houses were destroyed during a military 
operation that violated international humanitarian law or due to a disaster because of the 
authorities&#8217; failure to adopt necessary and reasonable disaster risk reduction measures). In 
other cases, there is no obligation in a legal sense, but returnees still have to have their 
houses reconstructed to achieve a durable solution that provides an adequate standard of 
living.38 
</p>
<p>82. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards the protection of 
housing, land and property rights: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existence of effective and accessible mechanisms to resolve housing, land and 
property disputes relevant to displacement and steps taken to overcome the most 
common challenges to implementing housing, land and property rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDP land and property claims resolved and enforced; number of 
remaining claims; and estimated time required to resolve the remaining claims 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDPs remaining without adequate housing, reduction in this 
percentage over time and comparison with the percentage for the resident population 
or the national average, as appropriate39

</p>
<p>&#8226; IDPs have access to support programmes (including access to credits) to restore or 
improve housing, land or property on the same basis as the resident population 
</p>
<p>83. In a number of contexts, it will also be necessary to look at the following four 
criteria to determinate to what extent IDPs have achieved a durable solution. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to personal and other documentation without discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>84. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution have access to personal and other 
documentation necessary to access public services, reclaim property and possessions, vote 
or pursue other purposes linked to durable solutions.41 During the course of displacement, 
people often lose documents necessary for the enjoyment and exercise of their legal rights, 
such as passports, personal identification documents, birth certificates, marriage 
certificates, voter identification cards, title deeds, school records and professional or 
academic certificates or social security cards. In other cases, IDPs may have never had 
documents or their documents were not recognized and this becomes a particular problem 
during their search for durable solutions (e.g. where an urban IDP who wants to integrate 
locally cannot apply for a job without a birth certificate or national ID card).  
</p><p>85. The competent national or local authorities need to facilitate the issuance of new 
documents or the replacement of documents lost in the course of displacement, without 
imposing unreasonable conditions, such as requiring the return to one&#8217;s area of habitual 
residence in order to obtain documents. Women and men have equal rights to obtain 
documents and women have the right to have documents issued in their own names.42 
Separated and unaccompanied children also need to be provided with their own documents. 
</p>
<p>86. Where control over territory is divided, practical solutions for documentation need 
to be found. National authorities, for instance, may recognize papers provided by de facto 
authorities as prima facie factual proof of personal status without this implying legal 
recognition of the entities providing the papers. 
</p>
<p>87. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards ensuring access to 
documentation: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; IDP women and men face no legal or administrative obstacles to obtain 
(replacement) birth certificates, national ID cards, voter identification cards or other 
personal documents relevant to the context 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mechanisms to replace documents are accessible and affordable bearing in mind the 
local context 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>40
 This indicator is also relevant for the previous subsection (adequate standard of living). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>41
 A right to documentation is axiomatic to other human rights such as the rights to recognition before 
</p>
<p>the law (art. 6, Universal Declaration), registration immediately after birth (art. 7, CRC), property and 
housing (arts. 17 and 25, Universal Declaration), education (art. 26, Universal Declaration), etc. See 
also Guiding Principle 20 (2). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42
 Guiding Principle 20 (3) states: &#8220;Women and men shall have equal rights to obtain such necessary 
</p>
<p>documents and shall have the right to have such documentation issued in their own names.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDPs without birth certificates, national ID cards or other personal 
documents relevant to the local context compared to the resident population, the 
situation before displacement or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mutual acceptance by Governments and de facto authorities of papers where control 
over territory is divided 
</p>
<p><b> F. Family reunification 
</b></p>
<p>88. IDPs who wish to reunite with family members from whom they were separated 
have been able to do so and can seek a durable solution together. Families separated by 
displacement should be reunited as quickly as possible, particularly when children, older 
persons or other vulnerable persons are involved. Where control over territory is divided, 
national and de facto authorities should cooperate pragmatically (e.g. through humanitarian 
actors or other impartial intermediaries) to allow for family reunification despite obstacles 
such as closed boundary lines. 
</p>
<p>89. For unaccompanied or separated children, family reunification<b> </b>will generally be in 
their best interests. However, prior to supporting reunification, an assessment needs to be 
made as to whether it exposes or is likely to expose the child to exploitation, abuse or 
neglect. This assessment should be based, inter alia, on information already verified by the 
competent national or local authorities. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
reunification exposes or is likely to expose the child to risks, a best-interest determination is 
required as to whether family reunification is indeed in the child&#8217;s best interest. The 
authorities are responsible to provide protection until the child&#8217;s family is found. 
</p>
<p>90. Appropriate tracing is to be undertaken at the earliest possible time to establish the 
fate and whereabouts of missing relatives and to inform the next of kin of progress made in 
the investigation and the results obtained. In some cases, it may be impossible, despite the 
best efforts of the competent authorities and humanitarian actors, to find missing relatives. 
In these situations it may become necessary to establish special legal procedures to provide 
the next of kin with accelerated access to pensions and family property and to formalize or 
legalize care arrangements for unaccompanied and separated children that avoid, whenever 
possible, placing them in institutions. 
</p>
<p>91. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards family reunification: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Mechanisms have been put in place to reunite separated family members. No 
movement restrictions prevent family reunification. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of internally displaced children or other dependent persons who have 
not yet been reunited with their families. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of persons without access to property/pensions due to a missing family 
member or other provider. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The number of unaccompanied and separated internally displaced children for whom 
a best-interest determination is needed but has not been conducted.

<p><b> G. Participation in public affairs without discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>92. IDPs who have achieved a durable solution are able to exercise the right to 
participate in public affairs at all levels on the same basis as the resident population and </p>

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>without discrimination owing to their displacement.43 This includes the right to associate 
freely and participate equally in community affairs, to vote and to stand for election, as well 
as the right to work in all sectors of public service. In many cases this requires special 
measures to be implemented before return, local integration or settlement elsewhere in the 
country. Where large numbers of IDPs have not returned, it may be necessary to carry out 
voter registration and education programmes in IDP sites, to make provisions for absentee 
ballots or set up special polling stations.  
</p>
<p>93. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards participation in public 
affairs: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; IDPs face no legal or administrative obstacles not faced by the resident population 
that prevent them from voting, being elected or working in public service 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The percentage of adult IDPs eligible and registered to vote in comparison to the 
resident population or the national average, as appropriate 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The percentage of adult IDPs participating in elections held in comparison to the 
resident population or the national average 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The percentage of IDPs among public servants and elected officials in comparison to 
the percentage of IDPs in the overall population 
</p>
<p><b> H. Access to effective remedies and justice</b>44<b> 
</b>94. IDPs who have been victims of violations of international human rights or 
humanitarian law, including arbitrary displacement45 must have full and non-discriminatory 
access to effective remedies and access to justice, including, where appropriate, access to 
existing transitional justice mechanisms, reparations and information on the causes of 
violations. 
</p>
<p>95. All victims of violations of international human rights and grave breaches of 
international humanitarian law have a right to an effective remedy46 and, of course, IDPs 
are no different in this regard. Effective remedies include equal and effective access to 
justice; adequate, effective and prompt reparation for harm suffered; and access to relevant 
information concerning violations and reparation mechanisms.47 
</p>
<p>96. Securing effective remedies for violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law which caused displacement, or which occurred during displacement, may 
have a major impact on prospects for durable solutions for IDPs. Failure to secure effective 
remedies for such violations may cause risks of further displacement, impede reconciliation 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>43
 Guiding Principle 29 (1) specifies that internally displaced persons &#8220;shall have the right to participate 
</p>
<p>fully and equally in public affairs at all levels&#8221; upon their return or resettlement. IDPs also have this 
right while displaced (see Guiding Principle 22 (d)). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>44
 See also paragraphs 76&#8211;82 on the restitution of housing, land and property. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>45
 Guiding Principle 6 sets out the right to be protected against arbitrary displacement and provides a 
</p>
<p>non-exhaustive list of cases of arbitrary displacement. 
 
</p>
<p>46
 See International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art. 2, para. 3, and Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, art. 8. While international humanitarian treaty law does not set out the right, it is 
recognized by the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for 
Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of 
International Humanitarian Law, adopted and recommended to Member States by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 60/147.

<p>processes, create a prolonged sense of injustice or prejudice among IDPs, and thereby 
undermine the achievement of durable solutions. Thus, securing justice for IDPs is an 
essential component of long-term peace and stability.  
</p>
<p>97. In some situations, it is therefore necessary in order to achieve durable solutions to 
formally address past violations by holding perpetrators accountable, providing victims 
with reparations in a formal sense (including compensation) and/or providing information 
on the causes of displacement. This would be particularly important in cases where IDPs 
became victims of war crimes or crimes against humanity, where they remain at risk from 
the perpetrators of violations or abuse, or where they themselves feel that formal justice 
must be done to enable them to physically, socially and emotionally overcome their 
displacement experience. 
</p>
<p>98. Reparation may include: restitution that aims at restoring the situation prior to 
arbitrary displacement; compensation for economically assessable damage; rehabilitation 
(including medical and psychological care); and satisfaction, which needs to be given 
insofar as the violation cannot be made good by restitution or compensation48 and can take 
the shape of public acknowledgement of violations, official apologies, or judicial action 
against individual perpetrators.49 Reparations must adequately address the specific 
violations of rights suffered by IDPs with due attention paid to their nature, seriousness, 
scale and pattern. In some cases, simple, administrative and non-bureaucratic procedures 
(e.g. standardized compensation amounts for different types of lost assets) might be more 
appropriate than overly complex systems.  
</p>
<p>99. Humanitarian and development assistance received during or after displacement 
does not amount to compensation, although its fair and equitable allocation can contribute 
to community reconciliation and conflict prevention. There are a variety of ways to 
establish the causes of displacement, including through truth commissions. Restrictions on 
amnesties for international crimes imposed by national or international law must be 
respected at all times. 
</p>
<p>100. In cases of disasters or non-State actors committing serious crimes, the authorities 
may still incur responsibility for having failed to provide adequate protection. In other 
cases, non-State actors committed crimes against IDPs despite the authorities&#8217; best efforts 
to protect them. Even in such cases, the authorities still need to take all possible steps, in 
accordance with due process guarantees and other human rights obligations, to ensure that 
perpetrators are held accountable and provide reparations. This may call for innovative 
measures, e.g. seizing and redistributing the assets of perpetrators who gained large 
personal profit from arbitrarily displacing others or requiring local perpetrators to help IDPs 
rebuild their destroyed houses and related infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>101. IDPs, including women, children (according to their age and maturity) and people 
who have special needs or are potentially marginalized, need to be fully informed about 
existing remedies and should be involved in their design, implementation and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>102. Information on existing remedies should be disseminated in a language and format 
IDPs can understand. Relevant institutions should be geographically, culturally and 
economically accessible. Mechanisms to provide remedies must be simple enough to allow 
access to all victims, regardless of education, social status, gender, age, etc. and take into

<p>consideration the specific obstacles IDPs face, such as loss of documentation, trauma and 
fear of further victimization. Mechanisms must also be conflict-sensitive and designed to 
avoid creating divisions among the victim population or reinforcing existing social and 
economic inequalities.  
</p>
<p>103. Involving IDPs also contributes to providing a greater sense of justice and dignity 
and helps in redressing the relationship between the victims and the State. 
</p>
<p>104. While national and local authorities have the primary duty and responsibility to 
provide IDPs with effective remedies for violations suffered, they may require support from 
international actors. Humanitarian and development actors may have an important role to 
play in advocating for access to justice and effective remedies, assisting States in meeting 
their obligations, training IDPs on their rights and assisting IDPs in appropriately 
participating in the design and implementation of relevant measures. It is important that 
actors undertake a careful analysis of the type, nature and patterns of violations that took 
place, the local political and social context and the particular aspirations of IDPs and other 
victims.  
</p>
<p>105. Depending on the type of displacement, local context and obtainable data, it would 
be useful to consider the following as indicators of progress towards reparation: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existence of accessible mechanisms that have the legal mandate and factual capacity 
to provide IDPs with effective remedies for violations suffered, including violations 
committed by non-State actors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Percentage of IDPs who consider that the violations suffered have been effectively 
remedied and a sense of justice restored 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Number or percentage of identified cases of displacement-related serious human 
rights violations or grave breaches of humanitarian law that result in effective and 
adequate reparation
