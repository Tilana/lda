<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also </i>the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>further </i>all relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, in particular its 
</p>
<p>resolutions on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 26/17 of 26 
</p>
<p>June 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in which Member States 
</p>
<p>resolved to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, would be able 
</p>
<p>to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys would have equal 
</p>
<p>access to all levels of education, in accordance with the Education for All agenda and 
</p>
<p>education-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the work carried out by all relevant organs, bodies and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the United Nations system within their respective mandates, in particular 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, as well as the efforts of organizations and civil society to promote 
</p>
<p>girls&#8217; enjoyment of the right to education, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific    
</p>
<p>and Cultural Organization, none of the Education for All goals will be achieved globally by 
</p>
<p>2015, despite the advances achieved over the past decade,  
</p>

<p><i>Deeply</i> <i>concerned</i> <i>also</i> that, despite progress in recent years, many girls continue to 
</p>
<p>suffer severe disadvantage and exclusion in education systems throughout their lives, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly</i> <i>condemning</i> attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions 
</p>
<p>as such, their students and staff, and recognizing the negative impact that such attacks can 
</p>
<p>have on the realization of the right to education, in particular of girls,  
</p>
<p><i>Strongly</i> <i>condemning also</i> attacks on and abductions of girls because they attend or 
</p>
<p>wish to attend school, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the equal right of every child to education without discrimination of any 
</p>
<p>kind, and noting the discrimination often faced by girls,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-ninth session, a panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>realizing the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl with a view to sharing 
</p>
<p>lessons learned and best practices in this regard; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>organize the panel and to liaise with States, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes, relevant special procedures, civil society, including relevant children&#8217;s and 
youth organizations, national human rights institutions and other relevant stakeholders with 
</p>
<p>a view to ensuring their participation in and contribution to the panel discussion;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the 
</p>
<p>panel discussion and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its thirtieth session.
