<p> The report recommends that States consider developing comprehensive witness 
protection programmes covering all types of crimes. However, witness protection within 
the framework of criminal procedures relating to gross human rights violations or serious 
violations of international humanitarian law requires certain particular elements. In that 
regard, the development of a normative framework based on existing legal obligations to 
enhance common standards and best practices may be useful.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/12 of 12 
October 2009 entitled &#8220;Right to the truth&#8221;, in which the Council requested &#8220;the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report, to be 
presented to the Council at its fifteenth session, on the basis of information, including from 
States, on programmes and other measures for the protection of witnesses implemented 
within the framework of criminal procedures related to gross violations of human rights and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law&#8221;. The aim of the report is &#8220;to determine 
the need to develop common standards and promote best practices that would serve as 
guidelines to States in protecting witnesses and others concerned with providing 
cooperation in trials for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. This report is prepared on the basis of information received from several member 
States,1 namely: Albania, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, El 
Salvador, Finland, Greece, Guatemala, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Mexico, Montenegro, 
Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Qatar, Russian Federation, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, 
Ukraine and Uruguay. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also 
used information received from other sources, including special procedures mechanisms of 
the Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 
the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the International Criminal Court, the 
Special Court for Sierra Leone, United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund, the field presence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and non-governmental organisations such as the Redress Trust. The report also notes 
the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous report on the right to the truth, which addresses various 
aspects of the protection of witnesses and other persons involved in trials relating to gross 
human rights violations.2 
</p>
<p>3. Without appropriate provisions for the protection of witnesses and victims, 
including their physical and psychological integrity, privacy, and dignity, their reputation 
and even their lives may be at risk as a consequence of their connection to judicial or non-
judicial proceedings. Securing the testimony of witnesses and victims is essential to 
ensuring that victims obtain justice and the right to know the truth, that those responsible 
for human rights violations and other crimes are held to account, and that potential abusers 
are deterred. 
</p>
<p>4. Section one of the report reviews various international legal provisions on States&#8217; 
obligations to protect witnesses, victims and others concerned, and discusses relevant 
judicial practice and jurisprudence. Section two discusses various witness protection 
measures and programmes available at the international and national levels. Enabling 
witnesses to come forward to collaborate with justice systems safely requires at least two 
sets of mechanisms: 1) measures and procedures put in place by the investigating 
authorities and courts while investigating crimes or taking testimony in the courtroom; 2) 
protection measures and safeguards provided before, during and after judicial proceedings 
by formal witness protection programmes. This report discusses both sets of mechanisms. 
Section three explains the key elements that are essential for establishing an effective

<p>witness protection programme, while good practices and relevant standards are discussed 
throughout the report.  
</p>
<p>5. The conclusion of the report affirms that considerable policies, legal provisions and 
draft programmes on the protection of witnesses, victims and others involved in criminal 
proceedings against organized crime have been developed. Practice at international 
tribunals and courts shed some light on the protection of witnesses, victims and others 
involved in trials of crimes under their jurisdictions, more specifically crimes relating to 
gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
However, there are few examples of witness protection programmes operating at the 
national level, which relate to trials for gross human rights violations and serious violations 
of international humanitarian law. The report recommends that States consider developing 
comprehensive witness protection programmes covering all types of crimes. Protecting 
witnesses in trials relating to gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law may require certain particular elements. In that regard, the 
development of best practices and common standards would be useful. Witness protection 
measures should be consistent with the principles of the right to fair trial, and should be an 
integral part of the justice sector strategy. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Protection of witnesses, victims and others concerned under 
international law and jurisprudence 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. While the importance of witness protection in combating organized crime has been 
widely recognized since the 1970s, its key role of protecting witnesses and victims of gross 
human rights violations or serious violations of international humanitarian law is often 
underestimated, overlooked or ignored by governments and international bodies alike. The 
first step in developing or improving witness protection programmes is to acknowledge that 
witness protection is not a favour to witnesses, but rather a duty for States.  
</p>
<p>7. Victims and witnesses are human beings with the right to protection under all human 
rights instruments and they do not lose the right to such protection simply by being 
involved in a judicial or non-judicial proceeding, either as victim or witness. States, 
however, have the obligation to adopt specific measures to protect the rights of victims and 
witnesses. A close review of the key human rights treaties and other key instruments 
reveals few, but clear and unambiguous references to the right of victims and witnesses to 
be protected from threats and reprisals, and to have their inherent dignity in the pursuit of 
justice respected. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights refers to &#8220;respect 
for the inherent dignity of human persons&#8221;3 and states that &#8220;no one shall be subjected to 
arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, or correspondence, or to 
unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.&#8221;4 In accordance with the Covenant, States 
have a general obligation to undertake necessary steps &#8220;to adopt such laws or other 
measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant.&#8221;5

<p>8. Regional human rights treaties, such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights,6 the American Convention on Human Rights7 and the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms8 do not contain explicit mention of 
States&#8217; obligation to adopt specific measures to protect witnesses.  
</p>
<p>9. However, within the framework of international human rights law, the United 
Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment,9 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women,10 the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance11 
and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography12 make clear reference to States&#8217; 
obligation to adopt specific measures to protect witnesses and victims.  
</p>
<p>10. References to the obligation to protect victims and witnesses can also be found in 
several key human rights instruments, such as the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice 
for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power,13 the Principles on the Effective Investigation 
and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (Istanbul Protocol),14 the updated Set of Principles for the Protection and 
Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity,15 and the Basic Principles

International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian

</p>
<p><b> B. International criminal law framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. References to the protection of victims and witnesses can also be found in 
international law related to transnational organized crime. The United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime17 and its two protocols, namely the Protocol to 
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,18 
and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air,19 address the 
protection of victims and witnesses of organized crimes.

<p>12. Witnesses&#8217; and victims&#8217; right to protection occupies a prominent place in recent 
international criminal practice and procedure. Ensuring that witnesses can testify in a safe 
and secure environment is crucial for the implementation of the mandates of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 
statutes and rules of the Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the Tribunal for Rwanda and 
the International Criminal Court contain provisions for the protection of witnesses and 
victims participating in proceedings.20 Similarly, the statutes and rules of the Special Court 
for Sierra Leone (SCSL)21 and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia 
(ECCC)22 contain provisions for the protection of victims and witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Practice and jurisprudence at the international and regional levels  
</b>13. The practice and jurisprudence of international and regional human rights bodies, as 
well as international tribunals and courts demonstrate that the protection of witnesses and 
victims is the cornerstone on which combating impunity, providing justice and ensuring 
effective remedy rest.23  
</p>
<p>14. In the case of <i>Rajapakse</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Sri Lanka</i>, the Human Rights Committee interpreted 
article 9, paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as 
encompassing the right to protection in order to ensure the enjoyment of the right to 
security. The Human Rights Committee ruled that the State had violated article 9, 
paragraph 1 of the Covenant since it had failed to take adequate action to ensure that the 
author was and continues to be protected from threats issued by police officers since filing 
his petition in his fundamental rights case.&#8221;24 In this case, the State did not provide witness 
protection, and the complainant went into hiding out of fear of reprisals. The Human Rights 
Committee observed that article 9 does not allow a State party to ignore threats to the 
personal security of non-detained persons subject to its jurisdiction. The Human Rights 
Committee concluded that the State party was obliged &#8220;to take effective measures to ensure 
that the author is protected from threats and/or intimidation with respect to the proceedings&#8221; 
and &#8220;to ensure that similar violations do not occur in the future.&#8221;25 The Human Rights 
Committee made similar observations in other cases and emphasized that the right to 
security does not only apply to &#8220;formal deprivation of liberty&#8221; by way of arrest or 
detention, and that States are &#8220;under an obligation to take reasonable and appropriate 
measures&#8221; to protect individuals whose lives have been threatened.26

</p>
<p>15. The European Court of Human Rights identifies the right to protection as part of the 
right to life. In <i>Kili&#231; v. Turkey</i>,27 the Court observed that there is a &#8220;positive obligation on 
the authorities to protect an individual or individuals whose life is at risk from the criminal 
acts of another individual and a State must take positive operational measures when the 
authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and 
immediate risk to the life of an identified individual or individuals from the criminal acts of 
a third party.&#8221; In some cases, the Court dealt directly with the intimidation of victims and 
witnesses in the context of interference with article 34 (formerly article 25) of the European 
Convention on Human Rights which sets out the right of individual petition, and requires 
the contracting parties to &#8220;undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this 
right.&#8221;28  
</p>
<p>16. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has similarly addressed protection as a 
prerequisite for the fulfilment of other rights, including the right to be heard,29 and the right 
to an effective recourse.30 The Court has ruled that failure to provide protection to victims 
and witnesses impedes effective access to justice under articles 1.1, 8 and 25 in both 
criminal and civil proceedings. In <i>La</i> <i>Rochela Massacre v. Colombia</i>, the Court articulated 
the integral connection between the obligation to investigate, within the framework of the 
guarantees of due process, the right to the truth, the right to justice, and the protection of all 
those involved in the criminal proceedings.31  
</p>
<p>17. Similarly, in <i>Kawas-Fernandez v. Honduras</i>, the Court held that by failing to 
provide protection to the witnesses, the State had &#8220;not guaranteed true right to justice for 
the relatives of the deceased victim.&#8221;32 In addressing protection within the context of 
articles 1.1, 8 and 25, the Court not only emphasized the obligation of the State to provide 
protection, but also considered protection as a necessary condition for the effective 
enjoyment of the right to participate and to be heard.33 In a number of cases at the Inter-
American Court of Human Rights, protection measures have also been seen as the 
fulfilment of the right to a remedy through the guarantee of non-repetition, and as part of 
reparation awards.34  
</p>
<p>18. Practice and jurisprudence of international ad hoc criminal tribunals, special hybrid 
courts and the International Criminal Court have also emphasized the importance of 
protecting the individuals who are involved in the investigation and prosecution of cases 
within their jurisdiction. For example, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal 
Court recently ruled that protection should, in principle, be available to anyone put at risk 
by the investigation of the Prosecutor, and noted that &#8220;the specific provisions of the Statute 
and the Rules for the protection not only of witnesses, victims and members of their 
families, but also other persons at risk on account of the activities of the Court, are

<p>indicative of an overarching concern to ensure that persons are not unjustifiably exposed to 
risk through the activities of the Court.&#8221;35 
</p>
<p><b> III. Programmes and measures for protecting witnesses and 
victims 
</b></p>
<p>19. At this early stage, it should be emphasised that witness and victim protection 
cannot be viewed in isolation, but must rather be considered a crucial part of a 
comprehensive system designed to effectively investigate and prosecute perpetrators of 
human rights violations. Protection measures will be ineffective if other parts of the 
criminal justice system do not function well. Every step of the process, from investigation 
through to conviction and punishment, should be analysed to identify ways in which 
witnesses are placed at risk, and potential reforms designed to limit those risks.36  
</p>
<p><b> A. Protection of witnesses at the investigation phase 
</b></p>
<p>20. At the investigation phase, there are some basic measures that should be considered 
for the protection of witnesses and victims, whether such investigations are pursued in a 
formal criminal investigation or are conducted by quasi- or non-judicial mechanisms. 
Already at the investigation phase there can be problematic disclosures of identities. When 
this risk is foreseen by witnesses, they may simply choose not to communicate with 
investigators. Safeguarding the identity of a witness at the early stage enhances the 
potential to safely obtaining testimony at a trial without resorting to a formal witness-
protection programme.  
</p>
<p>21. For example, the new Criminal Procedure Code of the Republic of Croatia (2009) 
reinforced witness protection during the investigation procedure. Similarly, the question of 
witness protection at the investigation phase is regulated by the Qatar Code of Criminal 
Procedure. In Switzerland, the law requires the authorities to protect the victim&#8217;s person at 
all stages of the criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>22. The role played by prosecutors or state attorneys in the criminal justice system may 
also lead to real or perceived risks that may prevent the safe cooperation of witnesses. 
Prosecutors and state attorneys responsible for investigation should also consider adequate 
measures to ensure the protection of witnesses and victims.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Courtroom measures for the protection of witnesses and victims  
</b></p>
<p>23. To encourage and facilitate the cooperation of witnesses, and to ensure that 
witnesses can testify free of intimidation or fear for their life, a series of legal protective 
procedural measures are used by the courts. These measures may include, but are not 
limited to the following: giving testimony outside the courtroom by closed-circuit 
television, or out of view of persons capable of creating an intimidating atmosphere, from 
behind a screen, for example; having one or more persons (other than the accused or his 
main counsel) removed from the courtroom for the entire duration or part of the trial; 
testifying under a pseudonym; imposing a publication ban in order to prevent publication,

</p>
<p>dissemination or transmission of any information that might reveal the identity of a victim 
or witness; appointing counsel to conduct cross-examination when the accused is acting as 
his or her own counsel; allowing victims under 18 to testify in the presence of a support 
person. Such courtroom procedures or similar special methods of participation in court 
proceedings have been introduced in many States, such as in Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, El 
Salvador, Finland, Japan, Latvia, Montenegro, Panama and Slovakia.  
</p>
<p>24. At international tribunals or courts, the scope of application of the courtroom 
measures and their legal effect are generally considered by pre-trial or trial chambers. Such 
protection may include measures for safeguarding the privacy of victims and witnesses, 
provided that these measures are consistent with the rights of the accused.37  
</p>
<p><b> C. Formal witness protection programmes 
</b></p>
<p>25. Witness and victim protection programmes are formal systems designed to provide a 
full range of physical protection, psychological support and other assistance to 
beneficiaries. A best-practice study, prepared by the UNODC,38 indicated that formal 
witness protection programmes first came to prominence in the United States of America as 
a legally sanctioned procedure to be used in conjunction with a programme for dismantling 
organized crime. In 1970, the Organized Crime Control Act empowered the United States 
Attorney General to provide for the security of witnesses who had agreed to testify 
truthfully in cases involving organized crime and other serious crimes.  
</p>
<p>26. Today, witness protection is viewed as crucial in combating organized crimes. 
Several countries worldwide have established such specialized programmes. States have 
included protection provisions in their constitutions,39 penal codes, or specific witness 
protection laws. The following are examples of national witness protection programmes 
reported by States. 
</p>
<p>27. In Argentina, the National Directorate for the Protection of Witnesses and Persons 
under Investigation40 is responsible for protecting complainants and witnesses in criminal 
trials relating to human rights violations at the federal level. The National Directorate&#8217;s 
programme takes action at the request of the judicial authorities in federal investigations of 
kidnappings, terrorist acts or acts relating to the law on narcotics. In exceptional cases, the 
Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights may include other cases, for example, cases 
relating to organized crime or institutional violence, or cases for which the political interest 
or importance makes such action advisable. The programme may also include cases 
provided for in the Act on Preventing and Punishing Human Trafficking and Assisting its 
Victims. 
</p>
<p>28. Decree No. 606/98 established the Truth and Justice Programme which is currently 
under the direction of the Ministry of Justice, Security and Human Rights. One of the 
objectives of this programme is to strengthen the mechanisms and procedures for the 
support, protection and safety of witnesses, victims, lawyers and judicial officials involved

 For example, subsection V, paragraph 2, of section C, article 20 of the Political Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Mexico states that &#8220;The Public Prosecution Service shall guarantee the protection of victims,

<p>in court cases or investigations concerning crimes against humanity, as well as their 
relatives. Recently, the National Plan for the Support and Assistance of Complainants, 
Victims and Witnesses of State Terrorism of the Office of the Secretary for Human Rights, 
has been transferred to the authority of the Truth and Justice Programme. 
</p>
<p>29. In Bulgaria, the Protection of Individuals at Risk in Relation to the Criminal 
Proceedings Act (2004) established new, extra procedural arrangements for the protection 
of individuals whose testimony, explanations or information are of material importance for 
criminal proceedings. Under this system, protection is provided by a Protection Board. The 
programmes cover the following measures: (i) personal physical protection, (ii) property 
protection, (iii) provisional accommodation in a safe location, (iv) change of place of 
residence, workplace or educational establishment, or placement in another facility for 
service of a sentence, (v) complete change of identity.  
</p><p>30. In Croatia, the Witness Protection Act (2003) regulates the requirements and 
proceedings for the provision of protection and aid to persons who have been put at risk on 
account of their statements in criminal proceedings, as well as persons close to them. The 
Act prescribes protection, aid and physical protection measures provided to witnesses and 
victims of crime outside the courtroom. The witness protection programme is implemented 
by the Department of Witness Protection of the Ministry of Interior.  
</p>
<p>31. In Cyprus, the Law for the Protection of Witnesses, adopted in 2001, defines the 
types of witnesses requiring assistance, the measures that can be adopted for the protection 
of witnesses, and the Plan for the Protection of Witnesses and Collaborators of Justice 
which is executed under the supervision of the Attorney General. The Plan includes 
protection of the witness and his/her family with security guard and/or security escort, 
relocation of witness and his/her family to another city or village, and confidentiality 
concerning his/her whereabouts, relocation abroad, change of identity, special arrangement 
for the detention of collaborators of justice.  
32. In El Salvador, the Section for the Protection of Witnesses, Judges and Victims was 
created within the National Civil Police Unit for the Protection of Persons of Importance in 
August 1997, with a mandate to provide full protection to witnesses and their families. 
However, over time, it became obvious that a witness protection programme was needed 
and that it should be underpinned by a formal legal framework. Accordingly, legislation on 
the protection of victims and witnesses was drafted in 1998. It envisaged procedures such 
as change of identity with issuance of authentic documents, and relocation, including to a 
place of residence outside the country. In 2005, the Office of the Attorney General recorded 
12 murders of witnesses who were providing information at trial. Before the creation of the 
programme, witness protection had been the responsibility of the National Civil Police, 
although it did not receive any specific budgetary allocation for that purpose. Witnesses 
testifying under a plea-bargain agreement (<i>testigos criteriados</i>) lived at National Civil 
Police headquarters in special cell &#8220;homes&#8221; shared with others in similar situations. Public 
safety has been a priority for several administrations in El Salvador. With a view to 
reducing crime rates, which were rising in a climate of impunity, born of intimidation and 
fear, the Government decided to create a special programme to protect victims and 
witnesses. On 25 May 2006, the Witness and Expert Witness Protection Scheme was 
reformed. The scheme established under the Criminal Code was superseded by the Victim 
and Witness Protection Act, which entered into force on 22 September 2006, and the 
Victim and Witness Protection Programme was established. The implementing regulations 
for the Victim and Witness Protection Act were adopted in October 2007. 
</p>
<p>33.  In Montenegro, the Law on Witness Protection regulates the conditions and the 
procedures for providing protection and assistance to the witness outside the court. Such 
protection is provided with the consent of the witness or persons close to him or her. The 
witness protection programmes are implemented by a commission which comprises a judge </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-15173 
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court, a deputy of the Supreme State Prosecutor, and the Head of the 
Protection Unit.  
</p>
<p>34.  In Paraguay, Law 1562/00 establishing the Public Prosecution Service contains a 
specific provision on witness protection. According to article 10 of the Act, &#8220;the Public 
Prosecution Service shall protect persons who, by collaborating with the administration of 
justice, run the risk of incurring some form of injury, especially in the case of punishable 
acts connected with organized crime or related to abuse of authority or violations of human 
rights. To that end, it shall run a permanent protection programme for witnesses, victims 
and its own officials.&#8221; Policies and programmes on witness protection are implemented 
through the Witness and Victim Care Centre which runs nine facilities.  
</p>
<p>35. In Uruguay, the President of the Republic, in consultation with the Minister of the 
Interior, issued a decree in 2000 authorizing the implementation of a programme to protect 
witnesses and informants giving evidence on alleged offences.  
</p>
<p>36. In Romania, the Ministry of Administration and Interior established the National 
Witness Protection Office in 2002. This Office coordinates the activities of the General 
Inspectorate units of the Romanian Police involved in witness protection, and manages the 
necessary funds for developing the witness protection programme. It also maintains and 
implements various protection and assistance measures.  
</p>
<p>37. In Switzerland, 26 federal entities (cantons) are currently responsible for the 
protection of witnesses. All the cantonal codes of criminal procedure regulate witness 
protection. The Federal Code of Criminal Procedure (Systematic Compendium (SC) 312.0), 
which regulates proceedings at the level of the Confederation, also contains provisions 
aimed at protecting witnesses when they give testimony. A standardized federal code of 
criminal procedure is due to enter into force on 1 January 2011. It will contain more 
detailed measures concerning the protection of witnesses.  
</p>
<p>38. In Trinidad and Tobago, the Justice Protection Act 2000 provides for the 
establishment of the agencies that comprise Trinidad and Tobago Justice Protection 
Program, which include an administrative centre, an investigative agency and a protection 
agency.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Inter-State cooperation and regional initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>39. Inter-State cooperation and assistance are normally based on the principle of 
reciprocity. Countries that are willing to accept relocated witnesses from other countries 
expect to have their own vulnerable witnesses accepted in other countries as well. Various 
countries with witness protection programmes contemplate such a possibility. For instance, 
the Witness Protection Acts of Canada and South Africa allow the respective responsible 
authorities to enter into reciprocal agreements with foreign Governments to admit foreign 
nationals into the witness protection programme.41 Witness protection is provided on a cost-
recovery basis. This type of arrangement would be of enormous interest for states pursuing 
strategies to fight impunity. Other forms of cooperation could be envisaged, such as the 
exchange of best practices, particularly given the novelty of the field, exchange programs 
for members of witness protection agencies, information-sharing and training programmes.  
</p>
<p>40. Though a State&#8217;s priority should be to strengthen its domestic system first, it could 
also bring the issue of witness protection to the international and/or regional forum. For 
example, the Nordic countries have established a working group which work towards

<p>common standards, and cooperate in specific areas. The agreement on cooperation in 
protecting victims and witnesses among the Baltic States was developed in 2000. The 
Central America Integration System has developed the Covenant for the Protection of 
Victims, Witnesses, Experts and Other Participants in the Criminal Investigation and 
Prosecution, Particularly in Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime. Europol coordinates a 
European Liaison Network that is made up of the heads of specialist witness protection 
units. It has drafted the Basic principles in the European Union police cooperation in the 
field of witness protection, focusing on relocation issues. 
</p>
<p>41. To date, most inter-state and regional cooperation in witness protection seems to 
occur in the context of fighting organized crime, terrorism and corruption. This practice 
could also be meaningful in the context of national or international prosecutions or 
investigations for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Key elements of a witness protection programme within the 
framework of criminal procedures related to gross human 
rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Issues to be addressed in the law  
</b></p>
<p>42. UNODC good-practices report discusses key elements of witness protection 
programmes involving organized crime, including the legal framework for setting up such 
programmes.42 The specific nature of witness protection must be carefully examined when 
considering investigation and prosecution of gross violations of human rights and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. In the context of prosecutions dealing with 
organized crime, witnesses often include system insiders. The opposite is almost invariably 
true for witnesses of human rights violations, who are mainly victims of such crimes. The 
Special Court for Sierra Leone, for example, reported that 60 per cent of witnesses admitted 
to its witness and victim protection program were victims, 3 per cent child soldiers, 6 per 
cent international experts and 31 per cent insiders.43  
</p>
<p>43. Key elements of a legal framework for witness and victim protection are discussed 
in the paragraphs below, with focus on the specific needs of witness protection programmes 
in trials related to gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b> (i) A comprehensive system 
</b>44. The first decision to be made is whether to build a comprehensive programme, or, 
taking into account the specificities of human rights violations, a separate program for such 
cases. It would be highly desirable to establish a comprehensive program which can then be 
articulated in such a way as to take into account specificities. There are mainly two reasons 
to support such choice: 1) in order to make efficient use of State resources, it would be 
preferable to create one institution to deal with all witness protection needs; 2) a

Witnesses</i>, 2008. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-15173 
</p>
<p>comprehensive program would be less controversial and more appealing to a broader 
spectrum of actors within society.  
</p>
<p><b> (ii) Participants 
</b>45. The definition of &#8220;witness&#8221; may differ according to the legal system under review. 
Witnesses can be classified into three main categories: a) justice collaborators; b) victim-
witnesses; c) innocent bystanders. Practice generally limits admission to witness protection 
to witnesses and members of their family or persons close to them. Some countries also 
admit other categories of people whose link to a criminal case may put their lives in danger, 
such as judges, prosecutors, undercover agents, intermediaries and interpreters.  
46. A witness protection programme should be designed to protect individuals who 
cooperate with national and international extraordinary accountability mechanisms, 
including those of quasi- and/or non-judicial nature, such as human rights and truth 
commissions and commissions of inquiry.44 For example, Kenya&#8217;s Witness Protection Law 
provides for, among others, persons &#8220;who need protection from a threat or risk which exists 
on account of his being a crucial witness in a prosecution or inquiry held before a court, 
commission or tribunal outside Kenya.&#8221;45  
</p>
<p><b> (iii) Placement of the programme 
</b> 47. There are many options regarding the state structure under which a witness 
protection programme should be placed, including the Police Department, Office of the 
Prosecutor/Attorney General, Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary, a joint commission 
comprising various institutions or an independent authority. While some States establish 
witness protection programmes as units within the police force, that approach is not 
appropriate or less effective for programmes designed to facilitate cases against State 
agents involved in human rights abuses.46  
</p>
<p>48. In 2009, the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement on witness 
protection in which she recommended that &#8220;a system of witness protection independent 
from State mechanisms may be better suited to inspire the confidence and trust of all those 
concerned. Such a system could be funded by the State, but not closely controlled by the 
machinery of State organs.&#8221;47 Kenya has recently amended its Witness Protection Law, and 
established an independent witness protection authority.48  
</p>
<p>49. Another option would be to appoint officials from key institutions of the criminal 
justice system to a committee responsible for administering or overseeing the programme. 
In Italy, for example, decisions on admission to the witness protection programme are taken 
by a central commission comprised of the Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of the 
Interior, two judges or prosecutors, and five relevant experts.49 Another option may be to 
assign a special dedicated unit to work exclusively on human rights and international crime

</b></p>
<p>cases. In Argentina, a new witness protection bill proposes the establishment of a dedicated 
unit to address witness protection issues relating to trials for crimes against humanity.50  
</p>
<p>50. No matter the placement of the witness protection agency, the law should ensure that 
the witness protection body enjoys full organizational and financial independence in the 
exercise of its functions. 
</p>
<p><b> (iv) Staff selection and vetting process 
</b>51. The law should explicitly indicate the process for selecting staff to work in the 
agency, which should be based on strict criteria of competence and integrity. A broader 
vetting process may also enhance the security of witnesses, and would be important 
particularly in post-conflict situations where the State takes the initiative to deal effectively 
with past abuses of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> (v) Eligible crimes 
</b>52. The law should identify the crimes for which witness protection measures should be 
envisaged. Such crimes should include all gross violations of human rights and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law, since perpetrators of such violations may be in 
official positions which allow them to harm or intimidate witnesses.51  
</p>
<p><b> (vi) Mandate to protect and assist 
</b>53. The mandate of the agency should include protection, in the form of provision of 
physical security, and necessary assistance, such as psychological, medical and legal 
assistance, which witnesses may need. These two aspects are inter-related, and an approach 
excessively focused on physical security has been found to alienate witnesses. At the same 
time, the distinction between protection and assistance should not be blurred, and witness 
protection agencies should establish separate sub-entities to deal with each aspect, so that 
witnesses know exactly where to go to address their needs.  
</p>
<p>54. Witness protection programmes in many States often limit their programmes to 
relocation and change of identity, leaving other measures to ordinary police services, while 
the laws of some States contain an exhaustive list of protection measures available, from 
concealment of the identity of the witness in judicial acts prior to the trial to change of 
identity and relocation. Indeed, a broad range of measures is necessary if the programme is 
to protect witnesses of human rights violations, who are usually not inclined to accept 
measures which radically alter their lives, such as relocation. Moreover, witnesses&#8217; mistrust 
of regular security services, particularly in a post-conflict society, renders it preferable for a 
specialized agency to take charge of all witness protection measures. However, the law 
should be more explicit in providing for perpetrator-focused protection measures, including 
the investigation of threats, control of the activities of the accused who is not in detention, 
and other mechanisms to prevent and neutralize the threat, whenever possible, rather than 
shield the witness.

 Human Rights Council resolution 12/12 (A/HRC/RES/12/12) encourages States to provide effective 
</p>
<p>protection to witnesses of all human rights violations. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-15173 
</p>
<p><b> (vii) Relocation 
</b>55. Relocation should be considered as a last resort measure in a witness protection 
programme. In such a case, international cooperation and formal agreements between the 
requesting State or organization and the proposed accepting State must be concluded.52 
</p>
<p><b> (viii) Procedure and criteria for admission/exit 
</b>56. The law should specify very clearly the procedure and criteria for admitting &#8212; or 
refusing admission to &#8212; a person in the programme. Regarding admission criteria, those 
indicated in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Draft Model Law on Witness 
Protection may be considered.53 Usual criteria include seriousness of the crime, public 
interest in the prosecution of the facts limited to the legal tradition involved, importance of 
the witness&#8217; testimony, ability of the person to adapt to the programme and its measures, 
among others. In human rights cases, the profile and history of the alleged perpetrators 
must also be considered. 
</p>
<p><b> (ix) Agreement between programme and witness 
</b>57. The law should provide for the signing of an agreement between the programme and 
the witness. Such agreement should contain all the rights and obligations of the witness, 
and the conditions for exiting the programme. The conclusion of a clear agreement would 
contribute to creating a climate of trust between the parties. 
</p>
<p><b> (x) Appeal process 
</b>58. The law should provide for the possibility of appeal with regard to the administrative 
decisions of the programme. While the need for confidentiality, which may be invoked to 
justify the absence of an appeal process, is understandable, the decisions of the witness 
protection body have a significant impact on the lives of witnesses, and they should be 
allowed to have their case heard by a different authority. A fair appeal process would 
contribute to dispelling the perception of arbitrariness with regard to the decisions of the 
witness protection body. Various positive examples support this proposal. In South Africa, 
for example, any person who feels aggrieved by any decision of the Witness Protection 
authority may apply to the Minister of Justice to review the decision or steps concerned.54 
In Kenya, the Witness Protection Law provides for the establishment of a Witness 
Protection Appeals Tribunal.55 
</p>
<p><b> (xi) Threat assessment and investigation 
</b>59. The law should clearly specify the body responsible for the threat assessment 
process. A multi-disciplinary team, with strong investigative capacity, should be established 
within the agency to deal specifically with threat assessment and investigation.  
</p>
<p><b> (xii) Reporting obligations 
</b>60. Best practices indicate that an annual report of the witness protection programme 
should be submitted to a higher authority, usually the Parliament, in a manner that does not 
prejudice the effectiveness and security of the witness protection agency and its activities.56

<p>Such reporting obligations ensure accountability and a measure of control on the activities 
of the agency by democratic institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>    (xiii) Role of civil society and other institutions 
</b>61. The law should acknowledge the enormous contribution that civil society can make, 
particularly in providing assistance to witnesses. Cooperation and coordination with civil 
society organizations should be explicitly provided for in the law. Such activities should be 
strengthened and funded. Other institutions, such as national human rights institutions, 
could also provide valuable assistance.57 
</p>
<p><b> B. Special measures for child witnesses and victims of sexual and gender-
based violence 
</b></p>
<p>62. Child witnesses and victims of sexual and gender-based violence require especially 
sensitive treatment due to the particular trauma and alienation that they may have 
suffered.58 The law should provide for such special measures. The witness protection 
agency should have the authority to engage specialized personnel and establish specific 
procedures to deal with these vulnerable witnesses. Several United Nations documents 
could be useful to legislators and policy-makers in ensuring that the law reflects their 
needs.59 Moreover, judges should regularly make use of special in-court protection 
measures to protect particularly vulnerable categories of witnesses, applying less restrictive 
criteria than in ordinary circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Some key operational issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Funding 
</b>63. The cost associated with setting up and operating a witness protection programme 
may be a deterrent to countries. Budgets differ from State to State,60 depending on living 
costs, population size, crimes rates and other factors, and cost variations also result from 
several factors, including law enforcement activities, individual circumstances of the 
witness to be relocated, needs and safety of their family and close friends. However, cost 
must be weighed against benefits, which include combating impunity, strengthening rule of 
law and democracy, shorter investigation, more efficient prosecution, thus ensuring justice 
and integrity of the justice system. Even in absolute figures, witness protection is usually a 
small percentage of the total police or judicial budget in States where such programmes 
exist.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>57
 UNODC Draft Model Law states as follows: &#8220;In implementing the Program, the Protection Authority 
</p>
<p>may enter into agreements with individuals, the private sector, private institutions and non-
governmental organizations to make use of their services.&#8221;

the programme, such as for equipment and premises, relocation costs, staff salaries and 
other remunerations and benefits, travel expenses, allowances for witnesses and 
psychological assessments and counselling. Adequate and regular funding should be 
provided by state budgets to ensure the programme&#8217;s sustainability and the availability of 
resources for the duration of protection. In some cases, government budgets make fixed 
yearly allocations to their protection programmes. Special funds should be earmarked for 
emergency use, for example, an unforeseen increase in the number of witnesses entering the 
programme. At the regional level, the establishment of joint funds to help finance a witness 
protection programme and promote cross-broader cooperation could be considered.61

<p><b> (ii) Training capacity 
</b>65. Although the witness protection mandate may be unified at the national level in one 
institution, many actors will continue to be involved in witness protection. Judges and 
prosecutors may not have adequate knowledge on how to handle vulnerable witnesses, or 
assistants (of judges and prosecutors) taking witnesses&#8217; initial statements may also lack 
basic training. The witness protection agency should create a strong training and capacity-
building unit to keep its staff abreast of developments in the field, but also to train those 
persons who come into contact with vulnerable witnesses. Such training activities could 
gradually be integrated into the curricula of national judicial training institutions and 
involve, among others, Bar Associations.

<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>66. <b>Witness protection should start long before a trial is conducted. In fact, 
measures taken during the first stages of investigation play a crucial role for the 
protection of witnesses. Failure to adopt effective measures to protect witnesses at the 
investigative stage and in prosecutorial arrangements, and thereby give them reason 
to trust that their safety will be ensured during the process, may result in many cases 
against perpetrators of human rights never reaching trial stage.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Traditionally, formal witness protection programmes have a mandate to ensure 
the preservation of evidence contained in witnesses&#8217; statements or anticipated 
testimonies and to offer protection in order to facilitate witness participation in 
judicial proceedings. In the specific context of trials for human rights violations, 
witness protection needs to be understood differently. First of all, witnesses to human 
rights violations are frequently victims of the crimes to which they testify, rather than 
co-perpetrators or former associates of the accused perpetrators. Secondly, human 
rights crimes are perpetrated by State actors or individuals associated with State or 
State-like powers. In some cases, individuals who subsequently occupy State positions, 
such as rebel leaders or their associates, are alleged perpetrators. They are individuals 
who are or have been in a position of power and can exert considerable influence. As 
such, the witnesses testifying against them are particularly vulnerable. States 
therefore have additional obligations towards victims and witnesses in such cases, and 
traditional witness protection programmes are usually not designed to meet those 
particular needs.

<p><b>against organized crime has been noted. Indeed, practice at international tribunals 
has shed some light on the protection of witnesses, victims and others involved in trials 
for crimes related to gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law. However, there are few examples of witness 
protection programmes operating at the national level in respect of trials involving 
human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>States need to consider developing comprehensive witness protection 
programmes covering all types of crimes, including gross human rights violations and 
serious violations of international humanitarian law. Furthermore, witness protection 
in human rights trials requires some particular elements. In this regard, the 
development of a normative framework based on existing legal obligations aimed at 
enhancing common standards and best practices may be useful. The objective is to 
serve as guidance to States in protecting witnesses and others concerned with 
providing cooperation in trials for gross human rights violations and serious 
violations of international humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The protection of witnesses should be considered from the initial police 
investigation through to the actual trial. In this regard, capacity-building of police, 
prosecutor and judicial institutions is needed, and the integrity and public credibility 
of these institutions must be ensured. In short, a justice sector strategy must be 
developed, of which witness protection is an important part. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The effectiveness of witness protection methods should be ensured through the 
provision of adequate financial, technical and political support for programmes at the 
national level. The Human Rights Council can play an important role in conveying 
this message. The expertise of regional institutions should also be taken into 
consideration in finding ways of international collaboration.
