<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Human Rights Council resolution 6/36 of 14 December 2007 established the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary expert mechanism to 
assist the Council in the implementation of its mandate, by providing it with thematic 
expertise on the rights of indigenous peoples in the manner and form requested by the 
Council.  The resolution states that the thematic expertise will focus mainly on studies and 
research-based advice, and that the mechanism may suggest proposals to the Council for 
its consideration and approval, within the scope of its work, as set out by the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Adoption of the progress report on the study on indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making, and

</p>
<p><b> III. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its third session in Geneva 
from 12 to 16 July 2010. The members who participated in the session were Catherine Odimba </p>


<p>Kombe (Democratic Republic of Congo), Jannie Lasimbang (Malaysia), John B. Henriksen 
(Norway), Jos&#233; Carlos Morales Morales (Costa Rica) and Jos&#233; Mencio Molintas (Philippines).  
</p>
<p>15. The participants in the session of the Expert Mechanism included representatives of Member 
States, the Holy See, six United Nations organizations and programmes, national human rights 
institutions (NHRIs) and a large number of indigenous delegates and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs). Approximately 500 participants were accredited to the session (see annex I).  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, James Anaya, the Chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues, Carlos Mamani, and the representative of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations, Tegegn Melakou, participated in the session.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda  A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/1) and the 
annotated agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/1/Add.1) as prepared by OHCHR, the advanced version of 
the progress report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
making (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/2), prepared by the Expert Mechanism, and the OHCHR 
contribution to the progress report (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/4).  
</p>
<p>18. In addition, the report of the United Nations seminar on treaties, agreements and other 
constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples was introduced and made 
available to participants (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/5).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>19. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur, Jannie Lasimbang, opened the third session 
of the Expert Mechanism and gave the floor to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights,  who delivered an opening speech. 
</p>
<p>20. In her statement, the High Commissioner highlighted the fact that support for the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples continues to expand. She welcomed the 
endorsement of the Declaration by New Zealand earlier this year, which, together with the 
endorsement by Australia in 2009, further strengthens its role as a shared tool and 
framework for action both at the international and national level. She recalled that 
indigenous peoples continue to face discrimination and violations of their right to land 
and, all too often, to the fundamental right to life, and that in the search for solutions, 
expert guidance is always crucial. In this regard, the Expert Mechanism can play a key role 
by providing sound and constructive thematic expertise, studies and research-based advice 
to the Human Rights Council. She encouraged all stakeholders present to put to active use 
the results of the first study of the Expert Mechanism devoted to the right to education. 
She also stressed that the current thematic focus of the Expert Mechanism - the right to 
participate in decision-making - is a topic of paramount importance and called for the 
active participation of States, indigenous peoples and others concerned in the finalization 
of the study. The High Commissioner congratulated the five members of the Expert 
Mechanism for the way in which they have carried out their work, and for launching this 
new body in an exemplary manner through their sound and constructive approach. 
</p>
<p>21. In his opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council welcomed the 
fact that the Expert Mechanism has been able to build a constructive approach in the 
implementation of its mandate, always aiming to achieve concrete results and engaging 
constructively with the Human Rights Council. He also recalled that the Council will be </p>


<p>reviewing its work and functioning pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and 
welcomed any input or contribution from the Expert Mechanism on the review. 
</p>
<p>22. In his remarks on behalf of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations Mr. Melakou welcomed the beneficiaries of the Fund and expressed support 
for the proposal to expand the mandate of the Fund to cover the treaty bodies and sessions 
of the Human Rights Council. He also thanked those who have been contributing to the 
Fund and appealed for more contributions in view of the decline in the amount received 
last year. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>23. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism invited the 
members to nominate a Chairperson-Rapporteur for its third session. Ms Odimba Kombe 
announced that the members had decided, by consensus, to nominate Mr. Morales Morales 
and Mr. Mencio Molintas as Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson-Rapporteur 
respectively. Thereafter, the outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur declared the two members 
elected by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>24. In his statement, the new Chairperson-Rapporteur, welcomed all observers, 
including the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people, as well as the Chair of the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues. He also thanked the High Commissioner for her presence and the 
support provided by her Office. He then recalled that the mandate given by the Human 
Rights Council to the Expert Mechanism is to provide thematic expertise to the Council on 
the rights of indigenous peoples. He further highlighted that the Expert Mechanism, given 
its thematic mandate, offers a forum for discussing the content and scope of the provisions 
of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>25. The Chairperson then indicated that the main agenda items to be discussed during 
the third session of the Expert Mechanism, namely the study on indigenous peoples and 
the right to participate in decision-making, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, and the proposals to be submitted to the Council for its consideration and 
approval. With regard to the study, he welcomed all the written contributions made by 
States, indigenous peoples, NHRIs, NGOs, universities and United Nations agencies. He 
emphasized that these contributions were extremely useful in the preparation of the 
progress report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
making, to be submitted to the Council at its fifteenth session.  
</p>
<p>26. The Chairperson also highlighted the intersessional activities of the Expert 
Mechanism, in particular the collaboration with the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people, and recognized the support and cooperation of OHCHR in 
this context. Referring to the practice of the first two sessions and recalling that the Expert 
Mechanism does not have the mandate to address country situations or allegations of 
human rights violations, he welcomed the arrangements made during the session for 
indigenous representatives to have parallel meetings with the Special Rapporteur, 
providing the possibility to submit information related to allegations of human rights 
violations, in accordance with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>27. Finally, he concluded by inviting all participants to contribute to the third session of 
the Expert Mechanism in a spirit of collaboration and dialogue, in order to ensure 
productive and successful discussions that contribute to the promotion and protection of 
the rights of indigenous peoples.  </p>


<p><b> E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>28. The agenda of the session (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/1) was adopted. Following the 
adoption of the agenda and programme of work for the third session, the Chairperson-
Rapporteur opened agenda item 3. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in 
decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited Mr. Henriksen, member of the Expert 
Mechanism and one of the two principal co-authors of the progress report, to introduce the 
first part of the advanced progress report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right 
to participate in decision-making. Mr. Henriksen stressed that one of the main concerns of 
indigenous peoples around the world is that they have limited and, in some cases, no 
opportunities to effectively determine priorities for their own development, and participate 
in decision-making processes affecting their rights and lives. He thanked the Human 
Rights Council for authorizing the Expert Mechanism to undertake a study on the right to 
participate in decision-making, following a related proposal by the Expert Mechanism, and 
for the very constructive and positive working relationship between the Expert Mechanism 
and the Council  
</p>
<p>30. Mr. Henriksen emphasized that the study provides an opportunity for the 
Mechanism to elaborate on the right to participation, and to start to look into many 
interrelated concepts and comprehensive sets of provisions and standards, that are 
interlinked with the right to participation, such as the right to self-determination, the 
principle of free, prior and informed consent and the right to be consulted. He welcomed 
the fact that a significantly larger number of contributions were received in relation to the 
current study, compared with what was received when the Mechanism prepared its first 
study and stressed the importance of the seminar co-organized by the Asia Indigenous 
Peoples Pact and the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs in Chiang Mai, 
Thailand, as well as the technical workshop organized by OHCHR to contribute to the 
preparation of the study. However, as many indigenous peoples still have great difficulties 
in communicating with the Mechanism, additional ways of communicating with 
indigenous peoples and communities are needed in order to ensure their inclusion in its 
work. 
</p>
<p>31. In his comments on the substance of the progress report, Mr. Henriksen underlined 
that international human rights provisions of general applicability refer to the right to 
participation in both general and specific forms. He also noted that International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries contains a number of fundamentally important provisions on the 
right of indigenous peoples to participation and is grounded in the recognition of the 
aspirations of indigenous peoples to exercise control over their own institutions, ways of 
life and economic development, and to maintain and develop their identities, languages 
and religions within the framework of the State in which they live. 
</p>
<p>32. Mr. Henriksen noted that for the purpose of the study, the Expert Mechanism 
distinguishes between the internal-decision making processes and institutions of 
indigenous peoples and external decision-making processes which affect them, i.e. where 
those other than indigenous peoples themselves are taking decisions. This distinction has 
generally been applied throughout the entire progress report, as the members of the 
Mechanism feel that this corresponds with the underlying logic of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. </p>


<p>33. Mr Henriksen further noted that while the current version of the progress report 
does not specifically elaborate on the element of &#8220;consent&#8221; in the principle of free, prior 
and informed consent, the members of the Mechanism will address this issue in the final 
study. However, he emphasized that the principle of free, prior and informed consent must 
be interpreted and understood in light of the fact that contemporary international human 
rights law affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination and this will 
have implications for how the requirement of &#8220;consent&#8221; is understood.  
</p>
<p>34. Mr. Henriksen recalled that the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
contains more than 20 provisions affirming either their right to participate in external 
decision-making, or their right to develop and maintain their own decision-making 
institutions. This underscores the fact that the right to participation of indigenous peoples 
is a core principle and right under international human rights law. He concluded by saying 
that, while some progress has been made, there remains an urgent need to foster more 
inclusive participation in governance through initiatives that strengthen the capacity of 
governments to be more responsive to indigenous peoples, and the capacity of indigenous 
peoples to claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>35. The Chairperson-Rapporteur then invited Ms. Lasimbang, member of the Expert 
Mechanism and the other principal co-author of the progress report, to introduce the 
remaining two chapters relating to (a) the internal decision-making processes and 
institutions of indigenous peoples, and (b) participation in decision-making mechanisms 
linked to both State and relevant non-State institutions and processes affecting indigenous 
peoples. Ms. Lasimbang noted that it is difficult to cover the characteristics of the internal 
decision-making processes and institutions of indigenous peoples globally, in view of the 
diversity of situations in which indigenous peoples find themselves. The report however 
tries to capture the principles of decision-making processes upheld by indigenous societies 
in both traditional and contemporary settings.  
</p>
<p>36. In her overview, Ms. Lasimbang stressed that with the guidance of indigenous laws 
and dispute-resolution procedures, decisions are generally reached through inclusive and 
participatory processes. She noted that the structures of traditional decision-making 
institutions vary, but that generally there is a council responsible for administering matters 
in order to maintain peace and cohesiveness. 
</p>
<p>37. Ms. Lasimbang mentioned that one concern for traditional decision-making 
institutions is the influence of contemporary structures that has led to the council of elders 
falling into disuse. Changes in traditional leadership and representation have had a 
negative impact on the internal decision-making systems of indigenous peoples and many 
have lost confidence in their own institutions. Nevertheless, indigenous communities 
continue to maintain and adapt decision-making processes and institutions in dynamic 
ways, and traditional decision-making systems operate in parallel to other governance 
systems in indigenous communities today. There may be interference because of differing 
development perspectives between States and indigenous peoples and such interference is 
manifested in the limited jurisdiction of indigenous institutions to decide on matters 
concerning communal land and resources, and divisions and conflicts, particularly where 
indigenous models of development and thinking are not respected or understood.  
</p>
<p>38. As regards &#8220;external&#8221; decision-making or participation by indigenous peoples in 
mechanisms linked to both State and relevant non-State institutions and processes 
affecting indigenous peoples, Ms. Lasimbang said the topics in themselves are broad 
enough to be individual thematic studies. They include participation in electoral politics, 
parliamentary processes, State-created bodies, non-governmental associations, 
implementation of free, prior and informed consent related to development projects, as 
well as participation in regional and international forums and processes. She said that in 
preparing the report, the Expert Mechanism faced the burden of capturing the diverse ways </p>


<p>in which indigenous peoples engage State and non-State actors, particularly challenges in 
asserting the right to participate in decision-making processes that are usually outside their 
control. Ms. Lasimbang underscored, inter alia, that parliamentary representation is both 
practically and symbolically particularly important for indigenous communities. 
Parliamentary representation has improved over recent years because of increasing 
political awareness of indigenous peoples or of special measures. However, she also 
pointed to many challenges, including the lack of leadership influence enjoyed by 
indigenous representatives.  
</p>
<p>39. Ms. Lasimbang further noted that indigenous peoples worldwide are struggling to 
maintain control over their lands and many decisions connected to development projects 
drastically affecting indigenous peoples rights are taken without consultation or 
implementation of the principles of free prior and informed consent. Many non-political 
associations are formed to advance indigenous interests at both local and international 
forums but challenges in gaining recognition from States and ensuring full and effective 
participation in such forums persist. She concluded that while there are a number of 
positive steps that have been taken regarding indigenous participation in external decision-
making processes, progress is not uniform and still requires serious attention. A gap exists 
between formal legislative intent and the implementation of those rights in practice. 
</p>
<p>40. After the presentation, the Chairperson-Rapporteur invited other participants to 
comment on the draft progress report and to provide concrete suggestions to improve it 
under agenda item 3. Several States, including Australia, Burkina Faso, Denmark, Finland, 
Guatemala, Mexico, New Zealand and Norway, took the floor commending the Expert 
Mechanism for its progress report, which they saw as a good basis for the preparation of 
the final study. A number of States provided information on the state of implementation of 
the right to participate in decision-making in their respective countries and made proposals 
as to further development of the study, including through additional examples of positive 
practices that exist at different levels of decision-making.  
</p>
<p>41. Mr. Mamani, Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues commended the 
progress report by stressing the key importance of the right to participate in decision-
making in the realization of the collective and individual rights of indigenous peoples. Mr. 
Mamani recommended that the Expert Mechanism consider in further detail the challenges 
for the realization of the rights of indigenous peoples, in particular in relation to 
participatory and decision-making mechanisms. He further provided information on the 
work of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples, in particular in relation to the issue 
of development with culture and identity, linked to articles 3 and 32 of the Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He went on to comment on the achievements made in 
terms of indigenous peoples participating in bodies in the United Nations through such 
bodies as the Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum. He also referred to the 
development of policies and participative mechanisms in various intergovernmental 
institutions. Despite these positive developments, the Chairperson of the Permanent Forum 
stressed that progress is still needed, in particular in achieving meaningful participation 
through well established consultative mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people noted that the progress report of the Expert Mechanism 
aptly identifies relevant provisions of various international instruments, including the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, ILO Convention No. 169, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as regional human rights 
instruments, including the American Convention on Human Rights. In this regard he 
recalled that a number of basic human rights principles underpin the right to participation 
and inform its content. Without being exhaustive, these include the right to self-</p>


<p>determination, the right to equality, the right to culture and the right to property. He stated 
that in his work as Special Rapporteur he has seen that for indigenous peoples, a lack of 
participation in the design and delivery of programmes that affect them can undermine the 
effective enjoyment of other key rights, such as the right to education and the right to 
health. 
</p>
<p>43. Several indigenous representatives commended the Expert Mechanism for the 
progress report. At the same time, they made a number of proposals as to the issues to be 
addressed further in the preparation of the final study, including further reflection on the 
principle of free, prior and informed consent and on the achievements and challenges faced 
by indigenous peoples in international forums. 
</p>
<p>44. In the concluding discussion, Mr. Henriksen thanked observers for their very 
valuable comments and suggestions aimed at improving the study. He said that while only 
the most pressing adjustments could be made in the progress report, the members of the 
Mechanism would continue to work on other issues, and that concerns could be dealt with 
in the context of the final study, which will be developed before the fourth session of the 
Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>45. He further noted that the discussions on the draft progress report demonstrated that 
the right to participation is of crucial importance in relation to the full spectrum of matters 
that affect the lives of indigenous peoples, and that this right forms the fundamental basis 
for the enjoyment of the full range of human rights. Mr. Henriksen welcomed the fact that 
there seemed to be broad agreement that the distinction between internal and external 
decision-making is a useful approach when elaborating on the right to participate in 
decision-making of indigenous peoples. He stressed that the Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples establishes a good balance between the right to autonomy and self-
government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs of indigenous peoples and 
their participation in the society at large. In response to a direct question from a 
governmental delegation, Mr. Henriksen elaborated on why the Declaration in his view 
should not be perceived as promoting the isolation of indigenous peoples and 
communities. Mr. Henriksen also welcomed the suggestion that the study should also 
address the issue of constitutional arrangements for the protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, including their right to participate in decision-making, as well as 
suggestions to expand the content of chapter II, section D of the report. </p>
<p>46. Ms. Lasimbang commented on the requests to collect case studies and good 
practices on matters relating to indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
making, and recalled that those that had already been received and referenced in footnotes 
in the progress report were available on the OHCHR website linked to the documentation 
of the progress report. She stated that it would not be possible to go into the details of any 
additional case studies and good practices received in the course of finalizing the report, 
but the experts would consider including additional references to relevant submissions and 
also make these available on the website. She also noted the request to refer explicitly to 
pastoral and nomadic peoples and to issues on militarization in the context of participation 
in decision-making and urged experts on these subjects to make written submissions. 
</p>
<p>47. She further noted that the experts will endeavour to capture the rich discussion with 
regard to free, prior and informed consent and agreed that the current scope of the progress 
report is very limited in this respect.  There is also a need to take into account comments 
by several speakers that decision-making within international institutions and platforms 
that affect peoples&#8217; lives should be examined further.  In this respect, she noted the 
concerns expressed about certain consensus-based decision-making frameworks, as well as 
the references to the Arctic Council as a good example for intergovernmental processes.  </p>


<p><b> V. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>48. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the discussion under the agenda item on the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by recalling that the purpose of the 
discussion is not to list violations or to monitor the implementation of the Declaration, 
which the Expert Mechanism is not mandated to do. Rather, the aim of the discussion is to 
identify positive practices and challenges in the use of the Declaration at the local, regional 
and international level. In this context, he also welcomed contributions concerning the 
follow-up to the first study on the right to education and on how the study has helped 
efforts to improve the implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>49. Several government delegations made interventions under this agenda item, 
highlighting achievements in the implementation of the principles of the Declaration, and 
also providing a number of examples of efforts to raise awareness of the Declaration, 
including through its publication and distribution in local languages. Many governments 
highlighted the importance of the Declaration and the chance to have a specific discussion 
on it in the context of the Expert Mechanism session was welcomed by a number of 
speakers. There were also specific examples of the way in which the first study by the 
Expert Mechanism on the right to education has been considered at the national level in 
the context of the formulation of policies and practices concerning indigenous peoples and 
education. 
</p>
<p>50. Many representatives of indigenous delegations welcomed the discussion on the 
Declaration and the endorsement of the Declaration by their respective governments. 
Many speakers commended the fact that those States that voted against the Declaration 
have changed or are reassessing their positions and that the role of the Declaration is 
therefore strengthening further. Several positive examples of the use of Declaration in the 
domestic context were provided, but various obstacles in the implementation of the 
principles of the Declaration were also highlighted by several speakers, including issues 
related to the recognition of indigenous peoples. Many speakers called for enhanced 
implementation by the authorities and others concerned and stressed the need to step up 
awareness-raising and training on the Declaration. A number of speakers stressed the role 
of the NHRIs in supporting the implementation of the Declaration and welcomed the 
recent activities of OHCHR aimed at further encouraging the engagement of NHRIs in this 
area.  
</p>
<p>51. Proposals were also made with regard to the future work of the Expert Mechanism, 
including a proposal for a compilation and analysis of the growing jurisprudence related to 
the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur put forward a proposal to enhance the implementation of 
the Declaration, calling for training, seminars and conferences at national and local levels 
to bring together State officials and indigenous leaders to develop strategies and initiatives 
for implementation. He also stated that States should engage in comprehensive reviews of 
their existing legislation and administrative programmes to identify where they may be 
incompatible with the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>53. The Chair of the Permanent Forum recalled that the Expert Mechanism, the Special 
Rapporteur and the Permanent Forum are the three United Nations mechanisms dealing 
specifically with indigenous issues and recommended that they continue to have regular 
meetings to strengthen their collaboration and the coordination of their work in promoting 
the rights of indigenous peoples. In relation to the support to the Declaration, he 
commended the recent developments toward universal endorsement while acknowledging 
the existing challenges for the effective implementation of the Declaration. He further </p>


<p>mentioned some positive developments, such as the recent exchange of experience 
between indigenous experts, State representatives and United Nations bodies that took 
place with the support of the Permanent Forum and the ILO.   
</p>
<p>54. The report on the second seminar on treaties, agreements and other constructive 
arrangements between States and indigenous peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2010/5), and 
recommendations contained therein was presented by OHCHR and the co-Rapporteurs of 
the seminar, Wilton Littlechild and Andrea Carmen in light of its relevance for the 
implementation of article 37 and other pertinent provisions of the Declaration. The 
seminar took place in the traditional lands of the Maskwac&#238;s Cree peoples in Hobbema, 
Canada, from 14 to 17 November 2006. 
</p>
<p>55. In concluding the discussion, Mr. Henriksen reflected on numerous aspects of the 
debate under agenda item 4. With reference to the final report on the study on treaties, 
agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous 
populations, developed within the framework of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1999/20, he expressed 
disagreement with the views of the former Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission 
who in his final report expressed the view that groups in African and Asian States claiming 
to be indigenous should be analysed in other United Nations forums than those that are 
concerned with the problems of indigenous peoples.2 Mr. Henriksen referred to the fact 
that a number of Asian and African States recognize the existence of indigenous peoples 
within their territories. He underlined that he was not of the view that every group 
claiming to be indigenous should be recognized as such, but that every case should be 
considered on its merits. Mr. Henriksen expressed his agreement with the calls to make the 
Declaration more accessible to people at the national and local levels, including through 
translation into national, local and indigenous languages. He also welcomed the fact that 
the discussion demonstrated that in addition to problems and challenges the Mechanism is 
in a position to welcome information about positive achievements.  
</p>
<p>56. Ms. Lasimbang stressed the importance of engaging NHRIs in the implementation 
of the Declaration and welcomed statements by indigenous peoples that demonstrated 
positive initiatives to understand the aspirations of indigenous peoples themselves. Such 
initiatives were critical, not only in bridging the existing gaps but also to show how these 
rights can be implemented in the context of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>57. Ms. Odimba Kombe also made concluding remarks under agenda item 4, 
highlighting the fact that despite the challenges that still exist for the effective 
implementation of the Declaration, some positive developments were presented during the 
discussion, including the efforts made by Member States and indigenous peoples to take 
into account in their activities and policies the study on the right to education prepared by 
the Expert Mechanism. For instance, she mentioned the consultation with aboriginal 
peoples undertaken by the Government of Australia on the new national plan for 
education.  
</p>
<p>58. Mr. Mencio Molintas welcomed the fact that support for the Declaration is 
expanding further, including in New Zealand, and he expressed the hope that the ongoing 
consideration of this issue in the Unites States of America and in Canada will soon result 
in the endorsement of the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 E/CN.4/Sub.2/1999/20, paragraph 90. </p>


<p><b> VI. Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism opened the discussion on 
proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council, recalling Council resolution 6/36. 
He further noted that for the first time the Expert Mechanism had decided to open this 
agenda item for a general discussion. He indicated that the decision was made in order to 
provide an opportunity for observers to share ideas and suggestions on the proposals that 
the Expert Mechanism could submit to the Council, at its fifteenth session.  
</p>
<p>60. A number of observers made recommendation for issues to be included in the 
proposals to be submitted by the Expert Mechanism. These included recommendations for 
thematic issues to be taken up in the future but also a number of recommendations 
concerning follow-up to the first and second studies undertaken by the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Adoption of the report and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>61. At the final meeting of its third session, the Expert Mechanism adopted the 
progress report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-
making and several proposals, contained in chapter II above. All proposals were adopted 
by consensus by the members of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>62. In addition, the members of the Expert Mechanism adopted a provisional agenda 
for the fourth session of the Expert Mechanism, as contained in annex II. </p>
