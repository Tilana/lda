Description of acquisition:
On 1 October 2015, Threat Protect Australia Limited acquired 100% of the ordinary share 
capital and voting rights in Chipla Holdings Pty Ltd (“Monitoring Excellence”).
Monitoring Excellence is a security services provider which has in excess of 10,000 clients 
as  of  acquisition  date.  The  security  control  room  of  Monitoring  Excellence  was  closed 
during  the  period  and  its  clients  were  combined  with  Threat  Protect’s  in  our  A1  graded 
security  control  room.  This  has  improved  the  quality  of  the  service  to  Monitoring 
Excellence  customers  as  well  as  reduced  the  group’s  costs  through  economies  of  scale 
which is part of Threat Protect’s core strategy.
