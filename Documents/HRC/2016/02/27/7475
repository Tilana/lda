<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Special procedures are mandated by the Human Rights Council to report to it on 
their activities (see Appendix). 
</p><p>2.  In 2009, the sixteenth annual meeting of special procedures mandate holders decided 
that a joint communications report would be prepared (cf. A/HRC/12/47, para 24-26), with 
this decision being reconfirmed by the seventeenth annual meeting of special procedures in 
2010 in order to avoid duplication, rationalize documentation, allow examination of cross 
cutting issues and ensure that the content of communications and any follow-up would feed 
into the universal periodic review mechanism more effectively. Mandate holders decided 
that the report should contain summaries of communications, and statistical information 
(A/HRC/15/44, para. 26-27). 
3. The Outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council calls on the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to maintain 
information on special procedures in a comprehensive and easily accessible manner, and 
encourages the use of modern information technology to reduce the circulation of paper 
(A/HRC/RES/16/21, Annex, para. 29 and 60). 
4.  Short summaries of allegations communicated to the respective State or other entity 
are included in the report, and the communications sent and responses received are 
accessible electronically through hyperlinks. Communications are reproduced in the 
language in which they were sent.  Replies received in Arabic, Chinese or Russian are 
included with translations into English, where available. 
</p>
<p>5. This report covers all urgent appeals, letters of allegations and other letters sent by 
special procedures mandate holders between 1 March and 31 May 2014 and replies 
received between 1 May and 31 July 2014. Communications sent before 1 March 2014 are 
reported in A/HRC/26/21, A/HRC/25/74, A/HRC/24/21, A/HRC/23/51, A/HRC/22/67, 
A/HRC/22/67 corr.1 and corr.2, A/HRC/21/49, A/HRC/20/30, A/HRC/19/44 and 
A/HRC/18/51 respectively. 
</p>
<p>6. The report also includes replies received between 1 May and 31 July 2014, relating 
to communications sent by special procedures mandate holders before 1 March 2014. Some 
of these replies supplement information communicated earlier by the respective State. 
</p>
<p>7. The present report contains urgent appeals sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and joint 
urgent appeals sent by them together with other mandates. It does not contain other types of 
communications issued by these mandates, which are processed according to their own 
distinctive procedures, and are reported in the annual reports of these two working groups. 
</p>
<p>8. The names of some alleged victims have been obscured in order to protect their 
privacy and prevent further victimization. Names of victims who would otherwise have 
their identities protected are mentioned only when the concerned individual has expressly 
consented or requested to have his or her name in the public report. In the original 
communications, the full names of the alleged victims were provided to the Government 
concerned. Names of alleged perpetrators have systematically been darkened in State 
replies to preserve the presumption of innocence. 
</p>
<p>9. In preparing the statistics included in this report, uniform reporting periods have 
been used, reflecting all communications sent between 1 March and 31 May 2014, and 
responses received in relation to these communications up to 31 July 2014. </p>

<p>Alleged denial of medical treatment while in detention of a human rights defender. 
According to the information received, Ms. Cao Shunli has been denied medical 
treatment for a liver condition since she was detained on 14 September 2013. As a 
consequence, Ms. Cao&#8217;s health has deteriorated dramatically. She is currently in the 
309 Military Hospital and is on life support. Furthermore, a number of her friends, 
who have tried to visit her at the hospital, have been taken into custody. Grave 
concerns are expressed that Ms. Cao&#8217;s detention and subsequent deteriorating health 
might be related to her legitimate and peaceful work on the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review, including advocacy about civil society 
participation in the process. Ms. Cao has been the subject of previous communications 
sent on 17 July 2013, see A/HRC/25/74, case no. CHN 6/2013, 1 October 2013, see 
A/HRC/25/74, case no. CHN 11/2013, and 14 November 2013, see A/HRC/25/74,

<p>Allegations on disproportional measures taken against media enterprises and the arrest 
of journalists in Bangladesh. According to the information received, the Daily Inqilab 
newspaper was raided on 16 January 2014 by the police, leading to a halt of its 
printing activities and the arrest of three of its journalists, Messrs&#8217; Ahmed Atiq, 
Rabiulla Robi and Rafiq Mohammad. On 20 February 2014, their request for bail was 
accepted. Earlier, on 9 January, Mr. Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, editor of the 
Bangladeshi newspaper Weekly Blitz, was sentenced to seven years in detention after 
being convicted of harming the country&#8217;s interests. Similar worrying cases were also 
reported last year. In April 2013, the newspaper Amar Desh printing press was raided 
and sealed by police and Mr. Mahmudur Rahman, its editor, arrested. In May 2013, 
the Diganta and Islamic TV channels had their broadcasting signals suspended on 
charges of inciting religious extremism and causing social unrest.

<p>Alleged arbitrary arrest and detention of three human rights activists. According to the 
information received, on 13 March 2014, Ms. Balendran Jayakumari, a human rights 
activist working on the issue of enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka, and her 13-
year-old daughter, were arrested in Kilinochchi by soldiers on suspicion of sheltering 
a fugitive. A 16-day detention order was subsequently issued against Ms. Jayakumari 
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), and her daughter was handed to a 
childcare institution. Ms. Jayakumari was reportedly physically assaulted by the 
soldiers. On 16 March, Mr. Ruki Fernando and Rev. Praveen Omi, two human rights 
defenders, were arrested by officers from the Terrorist Investigation Division in 
Kilinochchi while looking into the arrests that were made on 13 March. They were 
detained and questioned under the PTA and afterwards transferred to Vavunia, and 
then Colombo, for further questioning. On 19 March, both men were released without 
condition. Reportedly, the police announced that Mr. Fernando, and possibly Rev. 
Praveen Omi, will be the subject of further investigations. Serious concerns are 
expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Jayakumari, Mr. Fernando and Rev. 
Praveen Omi may be linked to their legitimate human rights activities.

<p>Allegations of reprisals on State television against 24 civil society organizations for 
submitting a report to the Human Rights Council. According to the information 
received, on 6 March 2014 at 9 p.m., in its English News Bulletin, the State controlled 
Sri Lanka Rupavahini (TV) Corporation accused 24 civil society organizations of 
having issued the &#8216;Joint Civil Society Memorandum to the Human Rights Council and 
the International Community&#8217;. As the news item was read, the full names and pictures 
of the leaders of nine of these organizations were shown on the screen along with the 
names of the civil society organizations that they were affiliated with. Grave concern 
is expressed that the 24 NGOs might have been targeted due to their legitimate 
interaction with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms. Further 
concerns are expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of the 
persons whose names were listed in the News Bulletin. Concerns are also expressed 
with regards to the use of media to defame human rights defenders in Sri Lanka.

<p>Alleged forced eviction of the residents of the Con Dau village, near Da Nang city, in 
Central Viet Nam. According to the information received, in 2007, the local 
government of Da Nang city announced a plan to expropriate the Con Dau village. 
The land was leased to a private company to build an eco-resort. Compensation was 
poor and the request of the parishioners to be resettled near their church was rejected 
twice. By 2013, hundreds of residents had moved under threats and harassment or 
after their homes had been forcefully demolished. The company stopped its project 
and began selling its land use rights by lots to private buyers. On 7 March 2014, the 
local government of Da Nang city gave a deadline to a remaining hundred households 
to give up their land and move out by 15 April 2014. Concerns are expressed that the 
forced eviction of the residents of Con Dau violates international human rights 
standards and seriously disrupts the cultural and religious life of the community.

<p>Alleged denial of medical treatment by prison authorities of a blogger who has been 
imprisoned since 2010. According to the information received, Mr. Mohammed Reza 
Pourshajari, also known by his pen name Siamak Mehr, faces a very high risk of 
dying in detention after having had a heart attack and suffering from prostate disease, 
kidney stones, high sugar levels, disc problems, breathing problems and high blood 
pressure. Mr. Pourshajari has reportedly been denied access to life-saving medical 
treatment including heart surgery and prison authorities have allegedly prevented 
doctors from performing an angiogram requested by prison doctors and also denied 
his request for furlough to seek medical assistance outside prison. Prison physicians 
have reportedly determined that he is not fit to serve his sentence and is in urgent need 
of specialized medical treatment. Mr. Pourshajari was the subject of an earlier 
communication sent on 10 July 2013, see A/HRC/25/74, case no. IRN 11/2013.

conditions. On17 and 18 February 2014, protests violently escalated in the Manus 
Island Regional Processing Centre. The G4S security guards (the private company 
providing security at the detention facility) allegedly responded with excessive use of 
force when protests escalated.  It is alleged that the Papua New Guinea police 
responded with gun fire. This left one man dead and at least 53 asylum seekers 
injured. The Manus Island Regional Processing Centre is a closed detention centre 
which was set up pursuant to the adoption of the Regional Resettlement Arrangement 
in 2013 between Australia and Papua New Guinea.

<p>Alleged threats made against a human rights defender during the Human Rights 
Council session. According to the information received, on 21 March 2014, Mr. 
Visuvalingam Kirupaharan, the General Secretary of Tamil Human Rights Centre, 
attended a side-event about human rights in Sri Lanka at the Human Rights Council 
where he actively participated in a debate. After the side-event, Mr. Kirupaharan was 
told by a journalist that if he returned to Sri Lanka, he would &#8220;be imprisoned or face 
consequences&#8221;. The journalist further threatened Mr. Kirupaharan that pictures of him 
would be published in newspapers in Sri Lanka. Concerns are expressed at the use of 
the media in Sri Lanka in defaming individuals who legitimately interact with the 
United Nations and its human rights mechanisms. Serious concern is expressed at 
these new acts of intimidation against Mr. Kirupaharan, which seem to form part of a 
campaign against him. Mr. Kirupaharan was the subject of an earlier communication 
sent on 11 August 2011, see A/HRC/19/44, case no. LKA 3/2011.

<p>Alleged restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and opinion in the context 
of political debate and electoral processes in Turkey. According to the information 
received, on 20 March 2014, authorities blocked access to microblogging through 
Twitter and threatened to block access to other social media sites and Youtube, 
allegedly due to the publication of information criticizing the Government, in the 
context of Municipal elections which took place on 30 March. Reportedly, despite a 
temporary injunction decision on 26 March by an administrative court in Ankara 
ordering the telecommunication authorities to restore access to Twitter, the website 
remained blocked. It is also alleged that national legislation, namely Law No. 5651 
(2007) and Law 6518 (2014), imposes undue restrictions to internet access and the 
right to freedom of expression and opinion.

<p>Alleged risk of violation of the right to a remedy. According to the information 
received, Mr. Taha Yaseen Arraq Rashid, Mr. Asa&#8217;ad Hamza Hanfoosh Al-Zuba&#8217;e 
and Mr. Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, were prevented from travelling to the 
U.S. to participate in their lawsuit against a private military contractor concerning 
alleged torture and ill-treatment at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. The three men were all granted 
visas to travel to the U.S. on a flight scheduled for 15 March 2013, but were informed 
right before departure that the U.S. authorities would not permit them to board the 
flight. The three men risked the dismissal of their case if they were unable to appear 
for deposition in the U.S. The case was subsequently dismissed in June 2013 on the 
basis that the court did not have jurisdiction as the alleged abuses occurred overseas. 
Concerns are raised at the risk of violation of the right to a remedy due to the three 
men being prohibited from boarding their flight to participate in their lawsuit and at 
the subsequent dismissal of their case. Further questions are raised concerning the 
court decision on which the case dismissal was based. An earlier communication 
dated 31 May 2013 was transmitted to the U.S. Government to which no response was 
received.

women and children, were arrested by the Perak&#8217;s Islamic Religious Affairs 
Department and the police, while they attended the commemoration of a religious

on, and persecution of members of, the Shi&#8217;a Muslim community in Malaysia, which 
has been allegedly ongoing since adoption of a 1996 fatwa by the Fatwa Committee of 
the National Council for Islamic Affairs that describes Shi&#8217;ism as a &#8220;deviant 
ideology&#8221;.

interrogated about their sexuality. Reportedly, the police have not investigated these

<p>Alleged torture and ill-treatment of a minor, use of confessions extracted under duress

According to the information received, on 23 July 2012, Mr. X, a national of Bahrain, 
born in 1997, was arrested by security forces of the Ministry of Interior following 
clashes in Bilad al-Qadeem. Mr. X was 15 years old at the time of his arrest. During 
interrogation, he was reportedly blindfolded, handcuffed and forced to lie on the floor 
without moving, sitting or sleeping. It is alleged that the security officers were trying 
to extract a confession from Mr. X. Subsequently, it is reported that the criminal court 
relied on evidence that had been extracted under duress and refused to investigate the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment as petitioned by Mr. X&#8217;s lawyer. On 4 April 
2013, the court sentenced Mr. X to 10 years imprisonment for burning a police 
vehicle. It is further reported that Mr. X is currently detained in Jaw prison and does 
not have access to the medical treatment and physiotherapy that he needs for medical 
conditions he suffers from.

According to the information received, Mr. Ali Chebeishat and Mr. Sayed Khaled 
Mousawi, both members of the Ahwazi Arab minority community in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, are at risk of imminent execution. After their arrest on 10 November 
2012 along with Mr. Salman Chayan, both individuals were sentenced to death by the 
Ahwaz Revolutionary Court on charges of Moharebeh (enmity against God) for their 
alleged roles in the explosions of a gas pipeline and a train transporting oil in October 
2012, which is not in violation of the most serious crimes provision under 
international law. All three defendants were reportedly held in incommunicado 
detention, tortured and forced to confess, as well as denied access to a lawyer. On 18 
March 2014, their families were reportedly informed about the defendants&#8217; transfer 
from Dezful Prison to an undisclosed location, in preparation for their executions.

interrogated and his passport and mobile phone were confiscated. Mr. Pham Chi 
Dung&#8217;s passport has still not been returned to him. Serious concern is expressed at 
apparent restrictions, including the imposition of travel bans, being carried out against 
citizens and human rights defenders seeking to engage in public affairs and 
communicate with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms.

<p>The communication addresses the situation surrounding the decision of the 
Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 22 October 2013 ordering the 
quashing of the verdicts in the cases of ten individuals convicted of war crimes against 
civilians and genocide, following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights 
(ECtHR) in the case of Maktouf and Damjanovic vs. Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Concerns are raised as to the legal developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
following the domestic application of this ECtHR judgement, specifically about the 
following issues: 1) the apparent automatic application of the aforementioned ECtHR 
judgment in at least a dozen cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina in contravention of the 
actual ruling of the same judgment; 2) the release of the defendants, guilty of genocide 
and war crimes against civilians, without remand pending re-trial, and its impact on 
the protection of victims from violence, re-victimization and intimidation; and 3) the 
lack of a comprehensive transitional justice strategy to complement the criminal 
justice process in the country.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution of a migrant worker in violation of international 
human rights law. According to the information received, Ms. Satinah Binti Jumadi 
Ahmad, a 41-year-old migrant worker from Indonesia, is at risk of imminent 
execution in Saudi Arabia. She was reportedly sentenced to death in 2010 for the 
murder of her employer. The defendant claimed however that the killing had occurred 
in self-defence and after months of abuse by her employer. It is unclear to what extent 
the circumstances surrounding the killing committed by Ms. Ahmad were considered 
during the trial against her. Ms. Ahmad is reported to risk execution as of 3 April 
2014, if compensation is not paid to the family of the employer. Reportedly, the death 
penalty is used disproportionately against foreign nationals in Saudi Arabia.

<p>Alleged arrest and detention of a lawyer and a magazine editor for exercising their 
legitimate rights to freedom of expression. According to the information received, Mr. 
Thulani Maseko, a prominent human rights lawyer, was arrested on 17 March 2014, 
and Mr. Bheki Makhubu, editor of The Nation magazine, was arrested on 18 March 
</p><p>2014. Both men were charged with &#8220;contempt of court&#8221; for allegedly authoring 
articles published in the Nation questioning the circumstances and rationale of a case 
pending before the High Court and raising concerns about the judiciary. On 18 March, 
Messrs&#8217; Maseko and Makhubu were remanded into custody by the Chief Justice, and 
on 25 March and 1 April, the High Court reportedly prolonged their detention pending 
trial for another 7 days. Mr. Maseko was the subject of an earlier communisation sent

<p>Alleged beatings of three Maasai pastoralists of Sukenya Village, an area subject to 
ongoing dispute regarding access. According to the information received, Sukenya 
Farm constitutes the ancestral territory of Maasai pastoralists from both Sukenya and 
Mondorosi villages. The land has been traditionally used by these pastoralists for 
grazing livestock, accessing important water sources and for moving between villages 
and sub-villages. Since 2006, the Maasai have not been able to access this land and 
resources freely as Sukenya Farm&#8217;s leasehold was sold by Tanzania Breweries 
Limited (TBL) to Tanzania Conservation Limited (TCL) for tourism purposes. TCL is 
owned by a locally incorporated company called Thomson Safaris Company (TSC). 
Thomson Safaris is a subsidiary of Wineland-Thomson Adventures Inc. based in 
Boston, United States of America. It is alleged that in the past years, agents and 
employees including private security guards of Thomson Safaris have been exerting 
pressure on Maasai pastoralists to leave the Sukenya Farm area. Maasai pastoralists 
are alleged to have been subjected to forcible evictions, beatings (including Munjaa 
son of Musa, Kendo son of Maiwa, and Naboye Ngukwo of Sukenya Village), and 
arrests and detentions when they have attempted to access Sukenya Farm.

<p>Allegations of intimidation and reprisals against the daughter of a pro-democracy 
activist prior to the scheduled adoption of the report of the second Universal Periodic 
Review of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. According to the information received, on 
18 March 2014, Ms. Ti-Anna Wang made a presentation under Agenda Item 4 of the 
25th session of the Human Rights Council, regarding the situation of human rights in 
China and the specific case of her father, Dr. Wang Bingzhang, founder of the 
overseas Chinese democratic movement. The following day, at approximately 5:00 
p.m., prior to the UPR of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, an individual wearing a 
non-governmental organization badge from the China Association for Preservation 
and Development of Tibetan Culture took photographs of Ms. Ti-Anna Wang, her 
computer screen and her belongings. Concerns are expressed that intimidation and 
reprisals against Ms. Ti-Anna Wang might be related to her legitimate activities in 
interacting with the United Nations and its human rights mechanisms.

<p>Alleged declaration a British journalist, filmmaker and Co-Director of InformAction

to the information received, on 12 March 2014, Ms. Lucy Elizabeth Hannan&#8217;s 
presence in Kenya was declared &#8220;contrary to national interest&#8221; by the High Court of 
Kenya. Ms. Hannan has been living and working in Kenya for the past 18 years. The 
reason given was that &#8220;confidential security reports indicate that (she) has been 
engaged in subversive activities against the Kenyan Government&#8221;. Furthermore, when 
Ms. Hannan first informally sought to know the reason why her work permit was 
being delayed, immigration officials reportedly told her that it was because of her 
work with Mr. Maina Kiai, Kenyan human rights defender, Co-Director of the human 
rights organization InformAction and United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights 
to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. Serious concerns are expressed 
that the harassment of Ms. Hannan appears to be linked to her peaceful and legitimate 
activities advocating for social justice in Kenya alongside Mr. Maina Kiai.

<p>Alleged harassment and intimidation of a human rights defender and his family. 
According to the information received, Mr. Nasrullah Baloch, Chairman of Voice for 
Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), was followed by individuals believed to belong to 
the Pakistani security forces when he attended a hearing at the Supreme Court in 
Islamabad. On 28 October 2013, Mr. Baloch&#8217;s brother was reportedly beaten and 
threatened by individuals from State intelligence agencies. It is further reported that in 
November 2013, Mr. Baloch&#8217;s younger brother was allegedly threatened by personnel 
of State intelligence agencies. Furthermore, a few days after the visit of the Working 
Group on enforced or involuntary disappearances to Pakistan, which took place in 
September 2012, Mr. Baloch and the Vice Chairman of the VBMP reportedly were 
threatened.

received, Vita Food Factory and Natural Fruit Factory have confiscated migrant

the information received, Dr. Wang, a pro-democracy activist and founder of the 
overseas Chinese democratic movement, has had three strokes while in detention. He 
also suffers from severe hay fever, phlebitis and asthma. Furthermore, his mental 
health and psychological well-being have deteriorated dramatically. Allegedly, Dr. 
Wang is only allowed one family visit a month for 30 minutes. However, for the past 
years, Dr. Wang&#8217;s wife, daughter and sister, who are all Canadian citizens, have 
allegedly not been able to obtain visas to travel to China to visit him. It is also alleged 
that the letters his family has sent to him have either been censored or confiscated.

<p>Concerns over the pejorative connotations of the mascot of the Washington Redskins 
football team. According to the information received, the term &#8220;redskins&#8221; is a hurtful 
reminder for many of the long history of mistreatment of Native American people in 
the United States of America. The term &#8220;redskin&#8221; for many is inextricably linked to a 
history of suffering and dispossession, and should be understood to be a pejorative 
and disparaging term that fails to respect and honour the historical and cultural legacy 
of the Native Americans in the United States.

<p>Alleged death threats against a human rights journalist. According to the information 
received, Mr. Yafez Hasanov has received threats against his life via a Facebook 
group that was set up in February 2014 in connection with his work. On 24 February 
2014, Mr. Hasanov submitted an official complaint to the Minister of Internal Affairs 
of Azerbaijan and to the Chief Prosecutor, requesting that these most recent threats be 
investigated. On 20 March 2014, Mr. Hasanov received an anonymous telephone call 
and was warned that he would be killed if he did not stop his work. Grave concern is 
expressed that the death threats are related to his work reporting on human rights 
violations and corruption.

<p>Allegations of prosecution of two human rights defenders. According to the 
information received, on 4 January 2014, Gujarat Crime Branch officials reportedly 
filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Ms. Teesta Setalvad, Secretary of the 
Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), and Mr. Javed Anand, a civil rights activist and 
editor of the magazine Communalism Combat, claiming that they had embezzled 
funds of INR 15,000,000 (approximately USD 251,000) which had been assigned to 
the construction of a memorial for the 2002 Gulbarg Society Massacre. Grave concern 
is expressed that the criminal charges brought against Ms. Setalvad and Mr. Anand are 
due to their peaceful work promoting the human rights of the victims of the Gulbarg 
Society Massacre. Ms. Setalvad was the subject of a previous communication sent on 
28 March 2011, see A/HRC/18/51/Corr.1, case no. IND 5/2011.

the millions of Biafrans killed during the Biafra-Nigeria war. However, they were not 
able to obtain permission from the authorities to hold the rally because IPB members

<p>Alleged undue restrictions of the right to freedom of association as contained in the

human rights norms and standards governing freedom of association. These provisions 
include restrictive definitions of local and international non-governmental 
organizations; an overly bureaucratic and politicized registration procedure; unclear 
criteria for examination of registration applications; an unnecessary requirement to 
renew registration certificates every five years; and undue barriers to the activities of 
unregistered organizations.

According to the information received, Ms. Rayhaneh Jabbari is at risk of imminent 
execution by hanging after being convicted of murdering Mr. Morteza Abdolali 
Sarbandi, a physician and member of the Iranian intelligence services, who allegedly 
attempted to rape her on 7 July 2007. Ms. Jabbari was arrested on 8 July 2007 and has 
since then been held in Evin prison in Tehran. She was allegedly tortured until she 
confessed to the murder. During the trial against her, the defendant reportedly claimed 
that the killing occurred in self-defence. Ms. Jabbari was reportedly not allowed to be 
assisted by a lawyer of her own choosing. The first-instance court sentenced her to 
death, which was later upheld by the Supreme Court.

political activist, was arrested in Hamad town by agents of the Ministry of Interior. 
During his arrest, Mr. al-Arab was allegedly blindfolded and severely beaten. He was 
then taken to the public prosecutor&#8217;s office where the prosecutor allegedly threatened 
him with more torture if he did not confess to the charges brought against him. It was 
reported that during his detention and interrogation at the Criminal Investigation 
Department, Mr. al-Arab was severely tortured in order to obtain a confession. Mr. al-
Arab has not been medically examined and continues to suffer from extreme pain. Mr. 
al-Arab allegedly remained in incommunicado detention from 9 to 21 January 2014, 
and for one month, did not have access to family visits or his lawyer. Furthermore, it 
is reported that although his lawyer was able to attend the court proceedings, Mr. al-
Arab was never brought before the court in person.

Movement, is currently being detained in the Bahrain State Prison. Mr. Mushaima&#8217;s 
health condition has significantly deteriorated, and despite the advice from a medical

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention, prosecution and death penalty imposed due to practice of 
religion and in contravention of international law. According to the information 
received, on 7 March 2013, Mr. Sawan Masih was detained and accused of insulting 
the Prophet Mohammed. On 27 March 2014, he was sentenced to death on charges of 
blasphemy, which does not constitute a most serious crime under international law. 
Mr. Masih was also ordered to pay a fine of 200,000 Pakistani rupees. The defendant 
repeatedly denied the charges, asserting that the false accusation was made as a result 
of a property dispute. Serious concern is expressed that the arrest and death sentence 
imposed against Mr. Masih may be part of what appears to be a growing trend of 
misuse of blasphemy legal provisions for personal reasons as well as their unfair and 
disproportionate application against members of minority groups, particularly 
religious minorities.

<p>Alleged arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and lack of access to medical treatment 
while in detention of a blogger and human rights defender. According to the 
information received, on 17 March 2014, Mr. Osama Al-Najjar was arrested without a 
warrant and transferred to a State Security secret detention centre where he was 
interrogated and tortured for about four days. Mr. Al-Najjar, who had undergone 
recent surgery, reportedly suffered from severe haemorrhaging for which he did not 
receive immediate treatment. Shortly before his transfer to Al-Wathba prison on 21 
March, Mr. Al-Najjar was allegedly transferred to a military hospital where he 
received medical care. Since then he has reportedly not received further medical 
treatment. It is reported that he did not have access to a lawyer. Serious concerns are 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Al-Najjar and that his 
arrest and detention may be related to his legitimate activities as a human rights 
defender and his cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers. Mr. Al-Najjar is the son of Mr. Hossain Al-Najjar, one of the 94 
persons tried in the so-called &#8220;UAE 94&#8221; case, who was the subject of two previous

administrative detention on 20 September 2013 and released on 5 October 2013. 
While in detention, Mr. Tillaev was reportedly tortured. On 2 January 2014, Mr. 
Tillaev was arrested on the basis of an allegedly invalid arrest warrant. Grave concern 
is expressed at the severity of this sentence, the reports of torture while in detention, 
and the alleged lack of due process. Mr. Tillaev is a founding member of the Union of 
Independent Trade Unions, which works in support of labour migrants.

<p>Alleged religiously-motivated discrimination against the most senior religious leader 
of the Shi&#8217;a Muslim community. According to the information received, on 12 April 
2014, Bahraini security officers raided Mr. Hussain Mirza Abdelbaqi Najati&#8217;s office 
and home. On 15 April 2014, Mr. Najati complied with the order to report to the Head 
of the National Security agency, who interrogated and ordered him to leave the 
Kingdom of Bahrain for Iraq within 48 hours. He also requested Mr. Najati to hand 
over his Bahraini passport, as his citizenship had been revoked. Reportedly, Mr. 
Najati was warned that failure to comply would result in his possible arrest together 
with his young son. Concern is raised that targeting the most senior and influential 
Shi&#8217;a religious figure in the Kingdom of Bahrain may amount to intimidation and thus 
discrimination against the entire Shi&#8217;a Muslim community in the country. Mr. Najati 
is one of 31 individuals, whose Bahraini citizenship was revoked on 7 November 
2012 by the decision of the Ministry of Interior, and who were the subject of a 
communication sent on 29 November 2012, see A/HRC/22/67/Corr.2, case no. BHR

<p>Alleged arrest, detention, sentencing and ill-treatment while in detention of human 
rights defenders, in particular bloggers. According to the information received, on 11 
September 2013, Mr. Ngo Hao was sentenced to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment and 5 years&#8217; 
probation for publishing online articles promoting human rights. Allegedly, his health 
in detention has severely deteriorated as a result of hard labour and lack of adequate 
healthcare. Mr. Le Quoc Quan was arrested on 27 December 2012, and the charges of 
&#8220;tax evasion&#8221; against him were upheld on 18 February 2014 and he is reportedly 
denied access to legal counsel, books and religious guidance. Mr. Le Quoc Quan was 
the subject of a previous communication sent on 14 January 2013, see A/HRC/23/51, 
case no. VNM 1/2013. Grave concern is expressed regarding the deteriorating health 
condition of Mr. Ngo Hao in detention and the use of legislation to restrict the space 
for the promotion and defence of human rights and freedom of opinion and expression 
in Viet Nam, particularly online.

According to the information received, on 29 October 2013, Mr. Al-Khair, the 
founder and Director of Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia (MHRSA), was 
sentenced to three months&#8217; imprisonment on charges relating to the establishment of

<p>Allegations of the use of defamation laws, in particular the Computer Crimes Act, to 
restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression of two journalists. According to 
the information received, on 18 December 2013, Mr. Alan Morison and Ms. Chutima 
Sidasathian who had been investigating and reporting on the situation of the Rohingya 
people in Thailand, in particular denouncing the Thai military&#8217;s alleged involvement 
in pushbacks of the Rohingya boat people to the sea, were charged with damaging the 
Navy&#8217;s reputation and for breaching the Computer Crimes Act. On 17 April 2014, 
they were formally charged with defamation and violation of Section 14 of the 
Computer Crimes Act.  Reportedly, they could face up to seven years of imprisonment 
and/or fines amounting to 100,000 baht (about 3,000 USD) if found guilty. Mr. 
Morison and Ms. Sidasathian are due to appear in Court for another preliminary 
hearing on 26 May 2014. Concern is expressed at the proportionality of restrictions on 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in particular with regard to conformity 
with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).

<p>Allegations of the violent dispersal of a demonstration in Jayapura, West Papua, on 2 
April 2014, and the arrest and torture of two student demonstrators. According to the 
information received, a demonstration was held at Cenderawasih University 
(UNCEN) in Waena on 2 April to call for the release of 76 Papuan political prisoners, 
the opening of democratic space, and access for journalists and researchers, and 
United Nations observers to West Papua. The demonstration was allegedly interrupted 
by the Jayapura Crowd Control police. Two of the demonstrators, Mr. Alfares Kapisa 
and Mr. Yali Wenda, attempted to negotiate with the police officers and were 
reportedly subsequently arrested, beaten and detained at the Jayapura police station. 
They were released the following day. Mr. Alfares Kapisa and Mr. Yali Wenda have 
allegedly not been able to obtain a medical report following their arrest and have not 
received any compensation for the injuries they sustained.

<p>Alegaciones de abuso de poder por parte del Tribunal de Honor del Colegio de 
Abogados y Notarios de Guatemala que suspendi&#243; a una jueza del ejercicio de la 
profesi&#243;n de abogada por un a&#241;o. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Tribunal de Honor 
inform&#243; el 4 de abril de 2014 a la Jueza Yassmin Barrios que iba a ser sancionada 
pecuniariamente, amonestada y suspendida en el ejercicio de su profesi&#243;n de abogada 
por un a&#241;o por haber supuestamente cometido una falta grave durante el juicio contra 
el Sr. Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt y el Sr. Jos&#233; Mauricio Rodr&#237;guez S&#225;nchez por genocidio y 
delitos contra los deberes de humanidad. Se informa que el abogado que habr&#237;a 
presentado la denuncia ante el Tribunal de Honor era uno de los defensores del 
imputado Rodr&#237;guez S&#225;nchez. Se alega que el Tribunal de Honor actu&#243; fuera de su 
competencia y que el &#243;rgano legalmente competente para evaluar las actuaciones de 
los jueces e imponerles las sanciones disciplinarias, la Junta de Disciplina Judicial, ya 
hab&#237;a desestimado la misma denuncia. Se expresa profunda preocupaci&#243;n ante la 
decisi&#243;n emitida por el Tribunal de Honor que se enmarca en un contexto de ataques, 
amenazas e intimidaci&#243;n que afecta a los operadores de justicia que luchan contra la 
impunidad de graves violaciones a los derechos humanos en Guatemala. La Jueza 
Barrios ya fue objeto de un llamamiento urgente previo en el cual se denunciaban 
supuestas amenazas e intimidaciones, enviada con fecha 30 de octubre de 2013, ver

&#8220;Ingrid&#8221; agravaron la situaci&#243;n de las comunidades al verse obligadas a beber agua 
insalubre. As&#237;mismo, la falta de asistencia m&#233;dica ha provocado que cinco personas

<p>Allegations of arrest and ill-treatment in detention of a human rights defender. 
According to the information received, Ms. Ge Zhihui participated in a training 
outside of China about the United Nations human rights mechanisms in early 2014. 
Ms. Zhihui was reportedly arrested at her home on 1 March 2014, and is currently 
detained in Fengtai District Detention Centre on charges of &#8220;illegal assembly&#8221;, 
&#8220;creating a disturbance&#8221; and &#8220;using cult to undermine implementation of the law&#8221;. 
Ms. Zhihui has reportedly been ill-treated in detention; she has been handcuffed and 
chained, denied permission to shower for twenty days and denied toilet breaks during 
her interrogations. She has reportedly been transferred to hospital on two occasions in 
relation to a brain infarct, anemia and kaliopenia due to her treatment in detention. 
Grave concern is expressed that her arrest and detention may be directly linked to her 
legitimate human rights activities and her participation in a training about the United 
Nations human rights mechanisms.

<p>Alleged ongoing criminal proceedings against a human rights defender. According to 
the information received, on 21 October 2013, Ms. Hendry, programme coordinator of 
Pusat KOMAS, appeared before the Majistret Court 6 in Kuala Lumpur following a 
complaint filed by the authorities against her under Section 6 (1)(b) of the Film 
Censorship Act (2002), for holding a screening of the documentary film &#8220;No Fire 
Zone: The Killing Field of Sri Lanka&#8221; on 3 July 2013. The criminal proceedings were 
subsequently stayed, pending Ms. Hendry&#8217;s constitutional challenge against some 
sections of the said Act. On 10 April 2014, the High Court dismissed the challenge, 
and on 15 April 2014, Ms. Hendry filed an appeal against this decision. However, her 
request to further stay the criminal proceedings against her pending the said appeal 
was rejected. A preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place on 16 May 2014. This 
case has already been the subject of two previous communications sent on 12 July 
2013, see A/HRC/25/74, case no. MYS 6/2013, and 26 September 2013, see 
A/HRC/25/74, case no. MYS 10/2013.

reference to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
and its due diligence framework. It urges the EBRD to clarify that it will refrain from 
financing projects that would result in human rights violations or have serious 
negative human rights impacts and provides suggestions as to how its draft policies 
could be improved.

<p>Alleged death of at least 132 children in the Thar desert, Tharparkar district, Sindh 
province as a result of malnutrition. According to the information received, severe and 
chronic food and water shortages due to drought and extreme poverty are the principal 
causes of death. The majority of victims reportedly belong to the minority Dalit 
community. Reports suggest that the crisis has been exacerbated by insufficient 
investment in healthcare facilities with long standing vacancies in Government run 
hospitals and health centres, as well as a lack of female doctors, limiting the provision 
of adequate medical services. Undue delays on the part of the authorities to react to 
the crisis have reportedly resulted in the Sindh provincial Government being accused 
by the Supreme Court of failing to fully report the facts, highlighting its failure to 
distribute sixty thousand bags of wheat flour allocated to the region in December 
</p><p>2013.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention of a human rights defender for his participation in a 
peaceful protest in 2009 calling for an end to discrimination against the Shi&#8217;a Muslim 
community, and for his reports of such discrimination. According to the information 
received, on 17 April 2014, the Specialized Court in Riyadh convicted Mr. Fadhel 
Maki Al Manasif, human rights activist and member of the Arab Institute for Human 
Rights, to 15 years imprisonment, a subsequent 15-year travel ban and a fine of 
100,000 Saudi Riyals (about 26,700 USD). The charges against Mr. Al Manasif 
included &#8220;breaking allegiance to the ruler&#8221;, &#8220;stirring sedition and sectarian division 
between citizens by inciting protests and marches&#8221;, &#8220;communicating with foreign 
media to harm the Government, its people and national unity&#8221; and &#8220;founding a banned 
association&#8221;. Mr. Al Manasif has reportedly appealed the decision of the Court, of 
which the final judgment is expected on 8 May 2014. Mr. Al Manasif was the subject 
of two earlier communications sent on 12 May 2011, see A/HRC/18/51, case no. SAU 
5/2011, and 12 July 2012, see A/HRC/22/67, case no. SAU 9/2012.

<p>Allegations of charges faced by three human rights defenders in the aftermath of the 
2013 presidential elections. According to the information received, on 16 December 
2013, Mr. Anar Mammadli and Mr. Bashir Suleymanli, respectively Chairman and 
Executive Director of the Azerbaijani Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies 
Centre (EMDSC), together with Mr. Elnur Mammadov, President of the Volunteers of 
International Cooperation Public Union, were interrogated by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office on suspicion of &#8220;business activity by an organization without registration&#8221;. 
Both organizations had denounced alleged widespread irregularities around the 
presidential elections of 9 October 2013. Their trial started on 21 April 2014. They 
face the following charges under the Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan: 
assignment or waste, illegal business, abusing official powers, evasion from payment 
of taxes and service forgery. The alleged targeting of EMDSC in the aftermath of the 
presidential elections of 2013 was the subject of one previous communication sent on 
26 November 2013, see A/HRC/25/74, case no. AZE 5/2013.

and Z (all below the age of 18) were arrested by ISF in separate incidents on 19 April, 
12 September and 7 November 2013 in the West Bank. All three children were 
accused of throwing stones and/or Molotov cocktails. During their detention at Beit 
Hamoshail (an Israeli military camp), Huwwara Interrogation and Detention Centre 
(south of Nablus) and Ari&#8217;el police station respectively, they were subjected to torture 
and ill-treatment, including solitary confinement, repeated beatings and being used as 
a human shield by ISF during confrontations with stone throwing youth. An Israeli 
soldier allegedly also extinguished a cigarette on the lips of one of the children. 
Furthermore, lawyers were not present during the interrogation of the children and 
none of them were informed of their rights. X was released after 21 days in Ofer 
military prison. Y and Z remain detained in Megiddo prison.

information received, on 26 March 2014, the Bill was submitted for public

reasons, but was still undergoing evaluations within the relevant departments of the 
Kyrgyz Republic&#8217;s Parliament. If adopted, the Bill would amend the Criminal Code, 
the Code of Administrative Responsibility, the Law on Peaceful Assembly, and the

<p>Alleged attempted killing and intimidation of a human rights defender. According to 
the information received, Ms. Nurainee Uma, a paralegal at the Muslim Attorney 
Center Foundation (MAC), was shot at by two unidentified individuals on a 
motorcycle. She managed to escape unharmed and reportedly filed a complaint at the 
Muang Yala police station the same evening. The following day, the police visited the 
scene of the attempted murder, however no further investigation of her case has taken 
place. Since Ms. Nurainee Uma started working for MAC in 2007, military officers 
have allegedly intimidated her and searched her house on a number of occasions. 
Grave concern is expressed that the attempted killing and intimidation of Ms. 
Nurainee Uma might be linked to her work documenting human rights violations in 
Thailand.

<p>Alleged prosecution and conviction of a domestic violence survivor, after she fired a 
warning shot into the ceiling, during an altercation with her abuser. According to the 
information received, Ms. Marissa Alexander, an African-American woman from 
Florida, was arrested on 1 August 2010, after shooting upward into the ceiling during 
an altercation with her abusive husband. Ms. Alexander reportedly had earlier 
obtained a court issued &#8220;Injunction for Protection&#8221; against her husband. It is reported 
that no one was injured from the shot fired by Ms. Alexander. She was nonetheless, 
charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon with no intent 
to harm. Subsequent to her sentencing, Ms. Alexander filed for appeal, and her retrial 
is scheduled for July 28, 2014. The State Attorney allegedly continues the prosecution 
of Ms. Alexander, and is now seeking 3 consecutive 20-year sentences.

<p>Allegations of intimidation and threats against a human rights defender and his family, 
and raid on the offices of the Human Rights Network for Democracy (HAND). 
According to the information received, on 11 February 2014, unknown individuals, 
presumably from the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), raided Mr. 
Suleiman&#8217;s family home in Khartoum and confiscated documents. On 11 March 2014, 
unknown individuals, presumably from the NISS, raided the office of HAND and 
confiscated laptops, documents and photos. Since these raids, Mr. Suleiman and his 
family have received threats through text messages and phone calls. Concern is 
expressed that the intimidation and threats directed towards Mr. Suleiman and his 
family might be related to his peaceful and legitimate work advocating for human 
rights in Sudan.

five year prison sentence on charges of &#8220;promotion or communication of a terrorist

treatment for her condition. Furthermore, the request for specialized treatment has 
been denied by the detention centre, despite her family&#8217;s offer to cover the costs. Ms. 
Alemu has also reportedly been threatened with solitary confinement and withdrawal 
of her right to study and access books. Moreover, she has been denied visits from her

<p>Allegations of imminent risk of desecration of an old Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; cemetery in Shiraz, Iran. 
According to the information received, at the end of April 2014, a land plot in Shiraz, 
where an old Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; cemetery is located, was turned into a construction site, possibly 
leading to the destruction of the cemetery. Reportedly, the cemetery is of religious and 
cultural value for local Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, and although it can no longer be used for burials, it 
remains a site for praying and for paying respect to the memory of the deceased. 
Numerous requests were made by the local Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community to spare the parts of the 
plot of land where the cemetery is located, either through letters or repeated visits to 
various authorities, to no avail. An administrative order to halt the construction work 
was issued by the local department on Planning of Town and Public Spaces, but it was 
ignored and construction work nevertheless began. Concerns are raised at a series of 
actions by the Iranian authorities, which appear to be motivated by religious 
discrimination against the Baha&#8217;i community through restricting their fundamental 
human rights to freedom of observance and practice of religion or belief.

<p>Alleged questioning at the airport and subsequent restriction of movement of two 
human rights defenders, and ongoing questioning of members of the Azerbaijani 
Institute for Peace and Democracy (AIPD). According to the information received, 
Mr. Rauf Mirkadyrov, a journalist working with AIPD, was deported from Turkey on 
19 April 2014 and charged with high treason and espionage on 21 April 2014. From 
28 to 29 April 2014, Ms. Leyla Yunus, Director of AIPD, and Mr. Arif Yunusov, 
Head of Conflict Studies of AIPD, were questioned and held at Baku airport, had their 
passports temporarily confiscated and were prevented from boarding their flight to 
Doha, Qatar and connecting flight to Brussels, Belgium to attend a human rights-
related event. After both individuals were released on 29 April 2014, the AIPD was 
searched, computers and documents were confiscated, and other staff members have 
since been questioned on a daily basis. No legal grounds have reportedly been 
provided for any of these actions. Concern is expressed at the harassment of members 
of AIPD and their families. Ms. Yunus was the subject of an earlier communication 
sent on 24 August 2011, see A/HRC/19/44, case no. AZE 2/2011.

<p>Alleged ban on the activities of a human rights movement. According to the 
information received, on 28 April 2014, the Cairo Court for Urgent Matters issued an 
Expedited Decision which included &#8220;a ban on activities held by the April 6 Youth 
Movement in the Arab Republic of Egypt, as well as a ban on any committee or 
organization that belongs to it or is derived from it or funded by it&#8221;. Concern is 
expressed that the ban of the April 6 Youth Movement may be related to their 
peaceful work in defending human rights and civil liberties in Egypt. The Head of the 
April 6 Youth Movement was the subject of two earlier communications sent on 3 
December 2013, see A/HRC/26/21, case no. EGY 16/2013, and 24 December 2013,

<p>Alleged excessive use of force and interference with the right to peaceful assembly. 
According to the information received, between 31 January and 7 February 2014, 
Israeli Defence Force soldiers and Border Police Officers on several occasions 
interfered, including through the use of force, with the peaceful protest camp erected 
in the abandoned village of Ein Hijleh in the Jordan Valley, in the West Bank, 
occupied Palestinian territory. Interference included obstructing people, food and 
medical supplies from reaching the camp. These interferences culminated in the 
forceful eviction of the protest camp in the early hours on 7 February 2014, and 
several protesters were injured as a result.

information received Ms. Meriam Ibrahim, a 27-year-old pregnant Sudanese woman,

<p>Alleged cuts to basic water supplies in Aleppo. According to the information received, 
approximately three million people have been affected by cuts to water supplies in 
Aleppo as of the beginning of May 2014. Hundreds of people in the city were 
reportedly forced to queue for long periods in front of mosques and other public 
spaces in order to fill containers with water, while many others resorted to taking 
unsafe water from the river. Reports indicate an increase in cases of gastroenteritis 
and acute diarrhoea. The cuts reportedly are a result of deliberate interference with the 
water supply by an armed opposition group, while other allegations suggest electricity 
supply cuts by the authorities may also be impeding supply. It is further alleged that 
since the beginning of May 2014, more stringent controls have been implemented by 
the authorities in relation to the delivery of relief efforts.

<p>Alleged deleterious consequences of the Government&#8217;s order directed at M&#233;decins 
Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) to suspend all of its activities in Myanmar, and of the attacks 
on humanitarian organizations resulting in termination of their operations in 
Myanmar&#8217;s Rakhine State. According to the information received, MSF was ordered 
to cease all of its activities on 26 February 2014, which will have devastating 
consequences on the enjoyment of the right to health, both by the ethnic Rakhine 
population and Rohingya communities. Following intimidation, violence and attacks 
targeting humanitarian organizations in Myanmar on 26 and 27 March, more than 300 
humanitarian and development staff were reportedly evacuated from Rakhine State. 
Despite claims by the Government that additional medical professionals would be 
dispatched to fill the vacuum in health services in Rakhine State, health provision still 
falls markedly short of needs.

<p>Alleged acts of reprisals against the head of the Buddhist Youth Movement in the 
form of arbitrary detention through house arrest. According to the information 
received, in March 2013, Mr. Le Cong Cau was threatened with prosecution for 
writing articles advocating human rights and supporting the Unified Buddhist Church 
of Vietnam. On 1 January 2014, Mr. Le Cong Cau was arrested and detained when 
boarding a plane for Ho Chi Minh City and placed under house arrest without written 
justification. On 11 February 2014, Mr. Le Cong Cau addressed an audio message to a 
side-event during the Human Rights Council session in Geneva before Viet Nam&#8217;s 
examination under the Universal Periodic Review. He remains under house arrest, and 
it is believed that his house arrest is related to his engagement with United Nations 
human rights mechanisms. Concern is expressed at Mr. Le Cong Cau&#8217;s arbitrary 
detainment due to his peaceful work promoting the rights of Buddhists in Vietnam.

Reform Project at the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights (CCHR). According to the 
information received, on 25 April 2014, Mr. Vann Sophath and his team visited the 
site of a land dispute case, to film a documentary about one of the concerned families, 
when he was intimidated by security guards. On 9 May 2014, Mr. Sophath&#8217;s filming 
on site was interrupted again when armed security guards threatened him and forced 
him off the site. One security guard took pictures of Mr. Sophath and his car&#8217;s number 
plate. Concern is expressed at the intimidation and threats of violence targeting Mr. 
Sophath while carrying out his peaceful work promoting and protecting the rights of 
the families on the disputed land.

<p>Allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention of a journalist and denial of medical care. 
According to the information received, Mr. Abdullah el-Shamy, a journalist for Al 
Jazeera, was apprehended on 14 August 2013 at Raba&#8217;a Square, Cairo. While he is 
accused of attempted murder, belonging to a terrorist organization, and harming 
national security, he has never been charged with any crime to date and remains in 
pre-trial detention. For the first seven months of his detention, Mr. el-Shamy 
effectively did not have access to a lawyer and while he submitted two requests for 
bail, one in October 2013 and one in March 2014, both of them were denied. Mr. al-
Shamy has been on hunger strike since 21 January 2014 to protest his pre-trial 
detention and suffers from acute anaemia and kidney dysfunction as a result. Although 
his health is in critical condition, he is being denied medical treatment and since 12 
May 2014, he remains in solitary confinement in Mazraet Unit of Tora prison. Mr. el-
Shamy was the subject of an earlier communication sent on 30 August 2013, see 
A/HRC/25/74, case no. EGY 13/2013.

<p>Alleged arrest and arbitrary detention of five Christian men for their religious beliefs. 
According to the information received, five Christian men set to be ordained in the 
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Asmara were arrested by security officers in Asmara, 
shortly after the public announcement of their ordination on 20 April 2014. 
Reportedly, they are detained at Police Station Number 2 in Asmara. Allegedly, the 
five men have not been formally charged and have not been brought before a judge. It 
is reported that family members are delivering food supplies and clothing but are not 
allowed to visit them. Representatives of the Church have also been denied access to 
the five men. The Evangelical Lutheran Church is one of the four officially 
recognized religions.

<p>Alleged violation of the human rights of persons living in poverty in the context of 
austerity measures. According to the information received, the Government has 
undertaken a combination of wide-ranging legal reforms and policy interventions 
designed to reduce public expenditure at the national and local level. A number of 
these measures were brought into effect through the Welfare Reform Act 2012. In 
January 2014, it was announced that austerity measures would continue between 2015 
and 2017, with a further &#163;12 billion to be cut from welfare expenditure.  Concerns are 
expressed that these measures could severely undermine minimum essential levels of 
economic and social rights (in particular the right to an adequate standard of living, 
the right to adequate housing, the right to food, and the right to social security) in 
certain circumstances. The interventions amount to retrogressive measures prohibited 
under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

<p>Alleged physical attack against a human rights lawyer by an official at the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. According to the information received, lawyer Ms. Dinara 
Turdumatova met with an investigator at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Osh on 1 
May 2014. During this meeting, she played a recording of her client&#8217;s interrogation at

Turdumatova was diagnosed with a wrist fracture and brain concussion. Ms. 
Turdumatova filed a complaint on 2 May 2014, and the Prosecutor&#8217;s office ordered a 
forensic examination on 6 May 2014.  Concern is expressed at the alleged threats

<p>Alleged threats made against and the killing of a human rights lawyer related to his 
legitimate work as a lawyer. According to the information received, Mr. Rashid 
Rehman, who was coordinator of the Punjab office of the Human Rights Commission 
of Pakistan, had been threatened in April 2014 in relation to his representation of a 
client on trial for blasphemy. On 7 May 2014, Mr. Rehman, together with a colleague 
and the client, were shot at by two unknown individuals in his office. Mr. Rehman 
died from the wounds he sustained, while the two other men survived the attack. 
Grave concern is expressed at the threats made against and killing of Mr. Rehman as it 
appears to be in connection with his peaceful work promoting and protecting human 
rights. Further concern is expressed regarding the physical integrity and safety of 
lawyers who work on blasphemy cases in Pakistan.

<p>Allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention of a Pakistani national. According to the 
information received, Mr. Mudassir Ali, a Pakistani businessman, was arrested by 
officers of the Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) in his office on 19 August 
</p><p>2013. On 23 September 2013, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to six 
months imprisonment and deportation to Pakistan. On appeal, his sentence was 
reduced to three months imprisonment and deportation. Despite having served his 
sentence in Hozel Job Prison, Mr. Ali is still detained in the said prison. The 
authorities allegedly continue to lay new charges against him in order to keep him in 
detention. Mr. Ali has not been informed of these new charges and is at risk of being 
summarily expelled from Bahrain to the United Arab Emirates.

<p>Allegations of the arrest and incommunicado detention of a human rights defender. 
According to the information received, Mr. Mohamed Salah Mohamed Abdelrhman, a 
student activist who has been actively involved in the mobilization of Sudanese 
citizens to promote and protect human rights and democracy, made a statement at the 
memorial of a fellow student activist who was killed during a student demonstration in 
Khartoum. In the statement, he named the National Intelligence and Security Service 
(NISS) agents who were responsible for the killing. Since then, his family home has 
been monitored and his younger brother was threatened. Mr. Abdelrhman was arrested 
on 20 March 2014 and released on 7 April 2014. On 12 May 2014, Mr. Abdelrhman 
was re-arrested by plain-clothed NISS agents and his family has not been informed of 
his whereabouts. Grave concern is expressed at Mr. Abdelrhman&#8217;s physical and 
psychological integrity while in detention.

<p>Alleged systematic persecution and discrimination against Shi&#8217;a Muslims in Malaysia. 
According to the information received, on 21 April 2014, Mr. Mohd Kamilzuhairi 
Abdul Aziz, a Shi&#8217;a religious cleric, was arrested by police during a peaceful religious 
meeting in Taman Sri Gombak. On 9 April 2014, a novel written by Mr. Mohd Faizal 
Musa was banned by the Ministry of Home Affairs in order to stop Shi&#8217;a propaganda. 
The ban appears to be imposed as a result of the 1996 fatwa issued by the National 
Council for Islamic Affairs, which declared Shi&#8217;a school of Islam as a deviant sect and 
any production, broadcast and distribution of any books, pamphlets, films and video 
deviating from the Sunni teaching as haram (forbidden).

<p>Alleged violent threats and intimidation carried out by the Israeli Defense Forces 
(IDF) against members of a human rights organization in Hebron, West Bank, 
occupied Palestinian territories. According to the information received, Youth Against 
Settlements (YAS) published a video online on 27 April 2014 of an altercation 
between an IDF soldier and two Palestinian youths. On 1 May 2014, the YAS centre 
was raided by around 20 heavily armed IDF soldiers, who reportedly threatened to 
shoot YAS members, including Mr. Issa Amro. On 2 May 2014, the IDF conducted 
military training at the YAS centre, following which IDF soldiers allegedly pointed 
their guns at YAS members. Serious concern is expressed at allegations of violent 
threats and intimidation targeting YAS members, including human rights defender 
Mr. Issa Amro, who was the subject of a previous communication sent on 2 August 
2013, see A/HRC/25/74, case no. ISR 7/2013.

<p>Allegations of the suspension of Constitutional guarantees, detention of senior 
political leaders and activists and the closure of multiple media outlets. According to 
the information received, on 22 May 2014, two days after the imposition of martial 
law, the Thai armed forces and police issued a statement, through the National 
Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), that they would assume control of the country. 
The NCPO reportedly issued 21 announcements and three orders, that, among others, 
suspended the Constitution, overturned the acting Government and bestowed all 
powers and responsibilities of the Prime Minister to the NCPO, ordered all radio and 
TV stations to stop broadcasting their regular programmes and prohibited political 
gatherings in any place of more than five people. Furthermore, the NCPO reportedly 
issued nine orders (as of 16:00 p.m., 26 May) to summon 231 individuals to the army 
base. Reportedly, most political leaders and activist summoned were transported to 
army camps in different locations in the Central region. Reportedly, family members 
have not been informed of their whereabouts.

Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, una gran proporci&#243;n de personas viviendo en extrema 
pobreza en Colombia se ha concentrado en asentamientos informales en zonas urbanas 
y perif&#233;ricas. En el asentamiento informal El Faro, en la ciudad de Medell&#237;n, los

servicios p&#250;blicos b&#225;sicos como agua y recolecci&#243;n de basura, a pesar de que muchos 
residentes pagan impuestos de propiedad. Los  derechos de los residentes a un nivel de 
vida adecuado, a una vivienda adecuada, al agua y al saneamiento, y al nivel m&#225;s alto 
posible de salud mental y f&#237;sica se ven amenazados.  El Municipio declar&#243; los 
territorios del barrio como inadecuadas para toda construcci&#243;n urbana, y anunci&#243; un 
proyecto para construir un tanque de almacenamiento de agua en dichos terrenos, 
requiriendo la relocaci&#243;n de 37 familias. Se expresa preocupaci&#243;n ante estas 
alegaciones.

<p>Alleged killing and systematic persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslim minorities in 
Pakistan. According to the information received, on 13 May 2014, Messrs. Khalil 
Ahmad, Ghulam Ahmad, Israr Ahmad and Mubashir Ahmad were arrested by police 
on blasphemy charges in Sharaqpur, Pakistan. While three of these individuals were 
released on bail, Mr. Khalil Ahmad was kept in detention, where he was shot dead by 
a visiting minor. It is unclear why the minor was allowed to visit Mr. Ahmad. On 26 
May 2014, Mr. Mehdi Ali Qamar, a US citizen, member of the Ahmadiyya Muslim 
community and a doctor on a humanitarian visit to Pakistan, was murdered in 
Rabwah, Pakistan. He was killed by two unknown men on motorbikes. Concerns are 
raised that the killing and persecution of these individuals may be related to their 
choice and peaceful practice of their religious beliefs.

<p>Allegations of arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of medical care in detention, 
torture and killing of a military judge. According to the information received, Mr. 
Naef Al Refai, born in 1973 in Damascus and a military judge of the Damascus 
Military Court, was apprehended by the Intelligence Services Branch in Al Kiswah 
district on 22 March 2013. In February 2014, he was reportedly sentenced to ten years 
of imprisonment for having &#8220;conspired to change the political system of the state&#8221; and 
for having released peaceful protesters &#8220;without consulting the Intelligence Services&#8221;. 
It is alleged that there was no trial, or that Mr. Al Refai was not informed about it, and 
was tried in absentia. At all stages of his detention and court proceedings, he had no 
access to a lawyer. Mr. Al Refai had no access to medical services, although his health 
conditions were seriously deteriorating. In May 2014, Mr. Al Refai died in detention, 
allegedly after having been subjected to torture and ill-treatment.

<p>Letter expressing concerns about increased reliance on deficit funding by the public 
sector in Zambia after the country&#8217;s debt was reduced through debt relief under the 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative in 2006. According to the information received, in November 2013, Zambia 
raised its external borrowing threshold significantly. Further, in April 2014, it placed 
2014 USD 1 billion of sovereign bonds on international financial markets. Concerns 
are raised that there is a danger that the country may fall into a debt trap again if 
caution is not exercised in relation to borrowing, especially foreign-currency 
denominated borrowing on non-concessional terms.

<p>Allegations concerning the increasing number of state-level regulations that restrict the 
religious freedoms of Native American prisoners. According to the information received, 
indigenous peoples in the United States face high rates of imprisonment with an 
approximate 29,700 Native Americans incarcerated in prisons across the country as of 
</p><p>2011. Reportedly, while in prison, a significant number of Native Americans rely upon 
their freedom to carry out traditional religious practices for rehabilitation purposes and as 
a means to maintain their identity as members of indigenous peoples. However, 
numerous recent regulations in state correctional facilities have allegedly restricted 
Native American prisoners from engaging in traditional religious practices and 
possessing religious items. It is further alleged that the majority of these regulations are 
modified or created without meaningful consultation with Native Americans beyond 
processes for general public comment.

<p>Alleged acts of reprisal, incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of 
human rights defenders for their cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives 
and mechanisms in the field of human rights. According to the information received, 
several individuals, including Messrs. Mazen Darwish, Hussayn Gharir, Hani Zitani, 
Abdelrahman Alhamade and Mansour Al-Omari, who were arrested in the context of the 
raid on the offices of the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) on 
16 February 2012, spent nine months in incommunicado detention while being refused 
access to medication. They have reportedly suffered torture and ill-treatment while in 
detention. Messrs. Alhamade and Al-Omari were reportedly released pending trial. 
Charges of promoting terrorist acts have been brought against all of them. It is believed 
that they relate to, and were motivated by, the SCM&#8217;s activities in defence of human 
rights, and that the SCM has been criticized as inciting international mechanisms to 
condemn Syria in response to its cooperation with various UN human rights 
mechanisms. Mr Khalil Matouk, a prominent human rights lawyer and Director of the 
Syrian Centre for Legal Studies and Research, at the time of writing reportedly 
remained in incommunicado detention with Mr Mohammed Thatha, a colleague. Mr 
Matouk has represented a number of human rights defenders legally and has submitted 
information to United Nations special procedures on these and other cases both before 
and after the start of the Syrian conflict. They were arrested on 2 October 2012 and Mr 
Matouk&#8217;s health has reportedly deteriorated to an alarming level. Previous 
communications have been sent on both cases dated 20 February 2012 (A/HRC/20/30), 
8 May 2012 (A/HRC/21/49), 2 November 2012 (A/HRC/22/67) and 13 May 2013

<p>Alleged attacks against the independence of the legal profession, in particular the 
alleged arrest, detention and launching of criminal proceedings against lawyers in the 
context of antiterrorism operations. According to information received, in November 
2011, 47 lawyers, three law office employees and one journalist were allegedly arrested 
in Turkey in the scope of an operation aimed at dismantling a supposed terrorist 
network. The lawyers were reportedly taken into custody in Istanbul for allegedly being 
&#8220;members&#8221; or &#8220;executives&#8221; of the &#8220;illegal organization&#8221; Kurdish Communities Union 
(KCK) and for acting as &#8220;messengers&#8221; for the elaboration of the organization&#8217;s 
strategies. Concerns are expressed that the arrests, charges and criminal proceedings 
brought against the lawyers are mainly linked to the contacts they had with their clients 
within the scope of their professional duties and the legitimate exercise of their 
profession. Similar concerns were expressed in two previous urgent appeals in 2011 and 
2012 (A/HRC/19/44 and A/HRC/20/30).

<p>Alleged excessive use and practices of prolonged solitary confinement, poor conditions 
of detention and retaliatory measures. According to the information received, from 8 
July 2013, hundreds of prisoners in the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation have been conducting a hunger strike in protest of being placed in solitary 
confinement and denied certain basic necessities. Allegedly, the protest is in response to 
inaction by prison officials after a negotiated agreement after a 20-day hunger strike in 
July 2011. The prisoners are protesting against being subjected to solitary confinement 
for over 22 hours a day, some prisoners have been enduring isolation for decades, with 
inadequate food rations and quality, and overly restrictive policies regarding hobby 
materials and family visits. Reportedly, there are concerns regarding retaliation against 
the strikers, by further restricting family visits and denying any opportunity to contact 
family over the phone. Reportedly, there are also threats being made by the Corrections 
Secretary to obtain a court order to begin force feeding the prisoners.

<p>Alleged denial of medical treatment and the use of shackles during the eventual medical 
treatment. According to the information received, Ms Lynne Stewart was convicted in 
2005 of providing material support to terrorists when she represented a client. In 2010, 
she was reportedly resentenced in light of a perjury charge to 10 years in prison. It is 
alleged that when she was imprisoned, her cancer had metastasized. She was scheduled 
for surgery within a week&#8217;s time. However, it is reported that she was denied the 
medical treatment until 18 months later, by which time the cancer had spread to her 
lymph nodes, shoulders, bones, and lungs. Allegedly the cancer is now stage 4 and has 
become terminal. It is also alleged that during her medical treatments for the cancer, she 
wasshackled to the bed with leg iron restraints, handcuffs and belly chains for no 
justifiable security reason.

<p>Allegations regarding the escalating violence and intimidation against journalists and 
the media in Egypt. According to the information received, Al Jazeera Egypt and six 
other TV channels were reportedly shut down by Egyptian authorities in the early hours 
of the military coup on 3 July 2013. It is alleged that the channels include at least three 
Islamist-run TV stations including one operated by the Muslim Brotherhood. On the 
same day Al-Jazeera&#8217;s office, specifically Al Jazeera&#8217;s Mubasher Misr channel, was 
reportedly raided by the security forces, and a number of staff members were detained. 
Concerns are raised regarding these attacks against Al Jazeera media group and the 
alleged arbitrary arrests and detention of Messrs Ayman Mohamed Gaballa, Abdelfattah 
Fayed, Ahmad Hassan, Mohammed Badr, Mohamad Salheh, Abdullah El-Shamy, and 
alleged killings of Messrs&#8217; Mick Deane, Ahmed Abdel Gawad, Mosab El-Shami Rassd,

<p>Allegations of gang-rape of a pregnant woman by seven men; and of threats and acts of

information received, on 17 August 2013, while returning home, Ms X was approached 
by a young individual who offered to accompany her to the village of Y, her hometown. 
Soon after she accepted, Ms X was forced to get in a mini-bus and was taken to a field 
outside the village of Y. Ms X was brutally gang-raped by 7 men during the whole 
night. On 22 August 2013, five persons allegedly broke into Ms X&#8217;s house and 
threatened to kill her. It is reported that the alleged perpetrators were only apprehended 
by the police after a relative of Ms X had filed a formal complaint, and that they were 
released within 72 hours. It is further reported that the parents of the alleged perpetrators 
and a police officer visited Ms X and her relative at their home and forced her to sign a 
written declaration affirming that she had no complaint of rape against the alleged 
perpetrators. It is further alleged that the police failed to respond quickly and effectively 
after the above incidents were reported and that those officers investigating this case 
colluded with the alleged perpetrators.

<p>Alleged risk of imminent execution in violation of international human rights law.  
According to the information received, Messrs Zaniar Moradi (or Zanyar Moradee) and 
Loghman Moradi (or Loqman Moradee), both members of the Kurdish community, at 
the time of writing were at risk of imminent execution. Messrs Zaniar Moradi and 
Loghman Moradi were the subject of three previous communications dated 15 
November 2011 (A/HRC/19/44), 29 February 2012 (A/HRC/20/30) and 9 January 2013 
(A/HRC/23/51), where it was alleged that the defendants had been subjected to torture 
and were forced to confess. The Government&#8217;s replies on their cases confirmed the 
sentences to death against Messrs Zaniar Moradi and Loghman Moradi, without 
providing details on how the imposition of the death penalty in these cases complied 
with international human rights law standards. The new information alleged in the 
current follow-up communication contains details of the allegations of torture against 
the defendants, as well as new allegations of violations of fair trial standards.

<p>Allegations concerning the draft Special Secrets Bill which could seriously restrict the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in Japan. According to the information 
received, the Lower House of the Japanese Parliament was at the time of writing 
deliberating a bill, approved by the Cabinet in October 2013. The draft Bill reportedly 
includes a number of provisions that may not be in line with international human rights 
standards on freedom of opinion and expression and with Japan&#8217;s Constitution, which 
recognizes the right to access information as part of the right to freedom of expression 
as a fundamental right. It is alleged that, if enacted, the Bill would provide very broad 
grounds for secrecy, limited oversight on decisions to classify matters as state secrets, 
and potential penalization of disclosure of confidential information including by 
whistle-blowers&#8217; and the press.

<p>Alleged arbitrary detention, torture and denial of medical treatment. According to the 
information received, in August 2013, Mr Ahmed Hassan Al-Din was reportedly 
arrested by law enforcement and State security officers and taken to Tajamo Awawal 
Police Station in New Cairo District 2. While detained, Mr Al-Din was allegedly beaten 
and insulted by several police officers. On 20 August, he was transferred to the State 
Security Investigation building, where he was reportedly put in a small cell and left 
handcuffed in a stress position for eight hours. While blindfolded, he was reportedly 
punched several times in the face before being taken to an interrogation room. He was 
later transferred to Tora prison in Aqrab, where he remained detained at the time of 
writing. It is reported that Mr Al-Din suffers from back pain as a result of falling twice 
when forced to walk down the stairs blindfolded. In an attempt to protest his situation, 
on 24 October 2013, Mr Al-Din began a hunger strike and on 4 November, he refused to 
take liquids.

Furthermore, there are reports of about 200 similar cases concerning torture and ill-
treatment committed by BSF and of impunity in this regard.

<p>Alleged enforced disappearance of four activists by an unknown group in the Syrian

and human rights defenders Ms. Razan Zaitouneh, Mr. Wa&#8217;el Hamada, Mr. Nazem 
Hamadi and Ms. Samira Khalil, were allegedly abducted by unknown individuals from a 
joint office of the Violations Documentation Center (VDC) and the Local Development

Republic. Prior to the alleged abductions, it is reported that Mr. Hamada, Ms. 
Zaitouneh&#8217;s husband, was imprisoned for several months before being released. In 
addition, a person associated with the aforementioned individuals was reportedly 
detained by the Air Force intelligence services. It is further reported that Ms. Zaitouneh 
was forced into hiding in 2011 after receiving threats from Syrian authorities due to her 
activities in documenting human rights violations. It is also reported that during the 
previous months, Ms. Zaitouneh received threats from at least one armed opposition 
group in the Eastern Ghouta area. The fate and whereabouts of Ms. Razan Zaitouneh, Mr.

<p>Alleged failure to provide compensation and enforce remedies for two Thai nationals, 
who were trafficked from Thailand to Italy. According to the information received, in 
2006, Ms. X and Ms. Y were promised well paying jobs in Italy by one of their 
neighbours. However, upon arrival in the country in February 2006, they were forced 
into prostitution. Less than four months following their arrival, reports indicate that the 
police raided the brothel where they were forced to work in. The two victims were 
initially arrested for irregularly residing in the country but after screening interviews the 
charges were dropped and they were repatriated to Thailand. After their return, the two 
women pressed charges and on 12 October 2007 the Court of First Instance of Thailand 
convicted the accused under the Act to Prevent and Suppress Prostitution and handed her 
an 18 year imprisonment sentence as well as compensation for the victims. It is alleged 
that the accused escaped from Thailand to Italy before the verdict was delivered and that 
the conviction has yet to be enforced and compensation paid.

According to the information received, &#8220;Dylacha&#8221; is an indigenous Evenki obshchina 
(clan community) founded in 1992 and located in Bauntovski Evenkiisky District, 
Baikal region, Republic of Buryatia. Dylacha held a license to carry out mining and 
related processing of nephrite, a type of jade. The livelihood of the indigenous peoples 
of the Baikal region has been based on mining and processing of nephrite for hundreds 
of years.  Reportedly, although Dylacha has complied with relevant Russian legislation 
and regulations in carrying out its activities, including its mining operations, 
Government authorities have dissolved Dylacha alleging that its activities were in 
violation of Russian legislation. Specifically, it was alleged that the community is not 
permitted to carry out &#8220;non-traditional activities&quot; but only has the right to generate 
earnings from fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. These actions against Dylacha 
have allegedly caused it to experience significant economic hardship.
