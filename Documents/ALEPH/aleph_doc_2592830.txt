NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Alta Mesa Holdings, LP and its subsidiaries (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “Alta Mesa”) is
an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development,
and production of onshore oil and natural gas properties located primarily in Oklahoma and
Louisiana.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has provided a discussion of significant accounting policies in Note 2 in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Annual Report”).  As of
June 30, 2016, the Company’s significant accounting policies are consistent with those
discussed in Note 2 in the 2015 Annual Report.
Principles of Consolidation and Reporting
The consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts after elimination of all significant
intercompany transactions and balances. The consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, which were
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in our 2015 Annual Report.
The consolidated financial statements included herein as of June 30, 2016, and for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited, and in the opinion of management,
the information furnished reflects all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of consolidated financial position and of the results
of operations for the interim periods presented. The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) for
interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements. Certain reclassifications of prior period consolidated financial
statements have been made to conform to current reporting practices. The consolidated results of
operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full
year.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period.
Reserve estimates significantly impact depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and
potential impairments of oil and natural gas properties and are subject to change based on
changes in oil and natural gas prices and trends and changes in estimated reserve quantities.
We analyze estimates, including those related to oil and natural gas reserves, oil and natural gas
revenues, the value of oil and natural gas properties, bad debts, asset retirement obligations,
derivative contracts, state taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on
historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update provides guidance concerning the
recognition and measurement of revenue from contracts with customers. Its objective is to
increase the usefulness of information in the financial statements regarding the nature, timing
and uncertainty of revenues. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard is required to be adopted using either the full
retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted, or the modified retrospective
approach, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance sheet. In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date. ASU 2015-14
defers the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, making it effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that
reporting period.
Additionally, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the implementation
guidance on principal versus agent considerations on such matters. In April 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies
guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance
contained in the new revenue recognition standard. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends certain issues
in ASU 2014-09 on transition, collectability, non-cash consideration, and the presentation of
sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from
6
Table of Contents
customers. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on our consolidated
financial statements, and whether to use the full retrospective approach or the modified
retrospective approach.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires that most equity instruments be
measured at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU No.
2016-01 also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and
disclosure requirements for financial instruments. ASU No. 2016-01 does not apply to equity
method investments or investments in consolidated subsidiaries. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this guidance will have on its
financial position, cash flows and results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes
ASC 840 “Leases” and creates a new topic, ASC 842 "Leases." The amendments in this update
require, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the
exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a
lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or
control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a
modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The
amendments are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of the amendments to our financial
statements and accounting practices for leases.

4. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The Company follows ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.” ASC 820 provides
a hierarchy of fair value measurements, based on the inputs to the fair value estimation process.
It requires disclosure of fair values classified according to defined “levels,” which are based on
the reliability of the evidence used to determine fair value, with Level 1 being the most reliable
and Level 3 the least reliable. Level 1 evidence consists of observable inputs, such as quoted
prices in an active market. Level 2 inputs typically correlate the fair value of the asset or liability to
a similar, but not identical item which is actively traded. Level 3 inputs include at least some
unobservable inputs, such as valuation models developed using the best information available in
the circumstances.
The fair value of cash, accounts receivable, other current assets, and current liabilities
approximate book value due to their short-term nature. The estimate of fair value of long-term
debt under our senior secured revolving credit facility is not considered to be materially different
from carrying value due to market rates of interest. The fair value estimate of our senior secured
term loan is not considered to be materially different from carrying value as there were no
significant changes in our credit risk.  The fair value of the notes payable to our founder is not
practicable to determine because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been
consummated at arm’s length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted
values available for this instrument, and an independent valuation would not be practicable due
to the lack of data regarding similar instruments, if any, and the associated potential costs.
7
Table of Contents
Our senior notes are carried at historical cost, net of amortized discount; we estimate the fair
value of the senior notes for disclosure purposes. We have estimated the fair value of our $450
million senior notes payable to be $380.3 million at June 30, 2016.  This estimation is based on
the most recent trading values of the senior notes at or near the reporting dates, which is a Level
1 determination. See Note 7 for information on long-term debt.
We utilize the modified Black-Scholes and the Turnbull Wakeman option pricing models to
estimate the fair values of oil and natural gas derivative contracts. Inputs to these models include
observable inputs from the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) for futures contracts, and
inputs derived from NYMEX observable inputs, such as implied volatility of oil and natural gas
prices. We have classified the fair values of all our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as
Level 2.
Oil and natural gas properties are subject to impairment testing and potential impairment write
down. Oil and natural gas properties with a carrying amount of $27.5 million were written down to
their fair value of $14.2 million, resulting in an impairment charge of $13.3 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016.  For the six months ended June 30, 2015, oil and natural gas
properties with a carrying amount of $280.2 million were written down to their fair value of $202.8
million, resulting in an impairment charge of $77.4 million. Oil and natural gas properties with a
carrying amount of $24.2 million were written down to their fair value of $12.6 million, resulting in
an impairment charge of $11.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  For the three
months ended June 30, 2015, oil and natural gas properties with a carrying amount of $8.2
million were written down to their fair value of $3.9 million, resulting in an impairment charge of
$4.3 million.    Significant Level 3 assumptions used in the calculation of estimated discounted
cash flows in the impairment analysis included our estimate of future oil and natural gas prices,
production costs, development expenditures, estimated timing of production of proved reserves,
appropriate risk-adjusted discount rates, and other relevant data.
New additions to asset retirement obligations result from estimations for new properties, and fair
values for them are categorized as Level 3. Such estimations are based on present value
techniques that utilize company-specific information for such inputs as cost and timing of
plugging and abandonment of wells and facilities. We recorded $0.6 million and $0.7 million in
additions to asset retirement obligations measured at fair value during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The following table presents information about our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair
value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and indicates the fair
value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value (unaudited):

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We account for our derivative contracts under the provisions of ASC 815, “Derivatives and
Hedging.” We have entered into forward-swap contracts and collar contracts to reduce our
exposure to price risk in the spot market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. From time to
time, we also utilize financial basis swap contracts, which address the price differential between
market-wide benchmark prices and other benchmark pricing referenced in certain of our oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids sales contracts. Substantially all of our hedging agreements
are executed by affiliates of our lenders under the credit facility described in Note 7, and are
collateralized by the security interests of the respective affiliated lenders in certain of our assets
under the credit facility. The contracts settle monthly and are scheduled to coincide with oil
production equivalent to barrels (Bbl) per month, gas production equivalent to volumes in millions
of British thermal units (MMBtu) per month, and natural gas liquids production to volumes in
gallons (Gal) per month. The contracts represent agreements between us and the counterparties
to exchange cash based on a designated price, or in the case of financial basis hedging
contracts, based on a designated price differential between various benchmark prices. Cash
settlement occurs monthly. No derivative contracts have been entered into for trading or
speculative purposes.

Table of Contents
From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to
mitigate the risk of loss due to changes in interest rates.
We have not designated any of our derivative contracts as fair value or cash flow
hedges.  Accordingly, we use mark-to-market accounting, recognizing changes in the fair value
of derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations at each reporting date.
Derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements and are presented on a net basis
in the consolidated balance sheets. This netting can cause derivative assets to be ultimately
presented in a liability account on the consolidated balance sheets. Likewise, derivative
liabilities could be presented in an asset account.
The following table summarizes the fair value (see Note 4 for further discussion of fair value) and
classification of our derivative instruments, none of which have been designated as hedging
instruments under ASC 815:

Although our counterparties provide no collateral, the master derivative agreements with each
counterparty effectively allow us, so long as we are not a defaulting party, after a default or the
occurrence of a termination event, to set-off an unpaid hedging agreement receivable against the
interest of the counterparty in any outstanding balance under the credit facility.
If a counterparty were to default in payment of an obligation under the master derivative
agreements, we could be exposed to commodity price fluctuations, and the protection intended
by the hedge could be lost. The value of our derivative financial instruments would be impacted.

Credit Facility.    On February 3, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Amendment No. 13
(the “Thirteenth Amendment”) to the senior secured revolving credit facility (“credit facility”) with
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders signatory
thereto. The Thirteenth Amendment, among other things: (a) permits us to enter into exchanges
of outstanding senior notes for a third lien term loan, (b) permits us to draw the remaining
borrowing base availability under the credit facility into a controlled account with such funds not
being treated as debt for the purposes of leverage ratio compliance so long as they remain in the
controlled account, (c) permits us to dispose of oil and natural gas properties pursuant to the joint
development agreement with BCE-STACK Development LLC (“BCE”), (d) requires that twice a
month we transfer available cash in excess of $25 million to the controlled account, and (e)
increases the maximum leverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2016 and
September 30, 2016 from 4.00 to 1.00 to 4.50 to 1.00.    On June 16, 2016, we entered into an
Agreement and Amendment No. 14 (the “Fourteenth Amendment”) to the credit facility which,
among other things: (a) reaffirmed borrowing base at $300 million until the next scheduled
redetermination,  and (b) increased the applicable margins to be applied based on the utilization
of the borrowing base.  On March 16, 2016, we borrowed $141.9 million under the credit facility,
which represented the remaining undrawn amount that was available under the credit facility.  As
required by the terms of the credit facility, the borrowings were deposited into an account
controlled by the administrative agent and is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet under
“Short-term restricted cash.”  As of June 30, 2016, we have approximately $121.9 million
remaining in the controlled account.  Such funds will not be treated as debt for the purposes of
leverage ratio compliance so long as they remain in the controlled account. These funds are
available to be used for general corporate purposes.
The credit facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and is based
on our proved reserves and the value attributed to those reserves.  The borrowing base is
currently $300 million and the principal amount is payable on the maturity date of October 13,
2017.  The credit facility borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually in May and November.  
 The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus applicable margins between 2.50% and 3.50% or
a “Reference Rate,” which is based on the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank, N. A., plus a margin
ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%, depending on the utilization of our borrowing base. The weighted
average rate on outstanding borrowings was 4.06% as of June 30, 2016 and 2.87% as of
December 31, 2015.  The letters of credit outstanding as of June 30, 2016 were
approximately $6.1 million.
12
Table of Contents
The credit facility contains customary covenants including, among others, defined financial
covenants, including minimum working capital levels (the ratio of current assets plus the unused
borrowing base, to current liabilities, excluding assets and liabilities related to derivative
contracts) of 1.0 to 1.0, minimum coverage of interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0, and maximum
leverage of 4.5 to 1.0, which will decrease to 4.0 to 1.0 for the quarter ended December 31,
2016.  The interest coverage and leverage ratios refer to the ratio of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and exploration expense (“EBITDAX”, as defined
more specifically in the credit agreement) to interest expense and to total debt (as defined),
respectively. Financial ratios are calculated quarterly using EBITDAX for the most recent twelve
months.
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit facility. The
borrowing base is subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base
redeterminations based on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves as determined by the
lenders under our credit facility, and other factors deemed relevant by our lenders. Recent
declines in prices for oil and natural gas may cause our banks to reduce the borrowing base
under our credit facility when it is next redetermined.
Senior Secured Term Loan.  On June 2, 2015, we entered into a second lien senior secured term
loan agreement (the “Term Loan Facility”) with Morgan Stanley Energy Capital Inc., as
administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto, pursuant to which we borrowed $125
million.  The net proceeds of approximately $121 million from the Term Loan Facility, after
payment of transaction-related fees and expenses, were used to pay down outstanding amounts
under our existing credit facility.  The Term Loan Facility matures on April 15, 2018. The principal
amount is payable at maturity. On February 3, 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the
Term Loan Facility (the “First Amendment”). The First Amendment: (a) permits us to enter into
exchanges of outstanding senior notes for  a third lien term loan, (b) allows us to dispose of oil
and natural gas properties pursuant to the joint development agreement with BCE, (c) requires
that twice a month we transfer available cash in excess of $25 million to a controlled account,
with such funds in the controlled account to not be treated as debt for the purposes of leverage
ratio compliance so long as they remain in the controlled account, and (d) increases the
maximum leverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016
from 4.5 to 1.0 to 5.0 to 1.0.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at adjusted LIBOR plus 8.00%. The
covenants in the Term Loan Facility require, among other things, maintenance of certain ratios,
measured on a quarterly basis, as follows: (i) current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.0 to
1.0, (ii) debt to EBITDAX of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 (decreasing to 4.5 to 1.0 for the quarter ended
December 31, 2016), (iii) PV-9 of total proved reserves to total secured debt of at least 1.5 to 1.0,
and (iv) EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.  Obligations under the Term Loan
Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and affiliates and are secured
by second priority liens on substantially all of our subsidiaries assets that serve as collateral
under the credit facility.    As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial
covenants of the Term Loan Facility.
We have the option to prepay all or a portion of the Term Loan Facility at any time. The Term
Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments of 75% of the net cash proceeds from asset
sales, subject to a limited right to reinvest proceeds in capital expenditures, or an initial public
offering. Such prepayments are subject to a premium of between 3% declining to 1% prior to the
maturity date.    No such prepayment has occurred as of June 30, 2016.
Senior Notes. We have $450 million in outstanding registered senior notes due October 15, 2018
that carry a stated interest rate of 9.625% and an effective rate of 9.7825% at June 30, 2016.  
 Interest is payable semi-annually each April 15th and October 15th.  The senior notes are
unsecured and are general obligations, and effectively rank junior to any of our existing or future
secured indebtedness, which includes the credit facility and the Term Loan Facility. The senior
notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our material
subsidiaries. The balance is presented net of unamortized discount of $1.1 million and $1.4
million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The senior notes contain an optional redemption provision that began on October 15, 2015
allowing us to retire the principal outstanding, in whole or in part, at 102.406%.  Additional
optional redemption provisions allow for retirement at 100.0% beginning on October 15, 2016.
Under the terms of the indenture for the senior notes, if we experience certain specific change of
control events, unless we have previously or concurrently exercised our right to redeem all of the
senior notes under the optional redemption provision, such holder has the right to require us to
purchase such holder’s senior notes at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of purchase.
Notes Payable to Founder. We have notes payable to our founder (“Founder Notes”) that bear
simple interest at 10% with a balance of $26.3 million and $25.7 million at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.  The maturity date was extended on March 25, 2014 from
December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021.  Interest and principal are payable at maturity. Our
founder may convert the notes into shares of common stock of our Class B partner, High Mesa,
Inc. (“High Mesa”), upon certain conditions in the event of an initial public offering.
13
Table of Contents
These Founder Notes are unsecured and subordinate to all debt. In connection with the March
25, 2014 recapitalization of our Class B partner described in Note 11, the Founder Notes were
amended and restated to subordinate them to the paid in kind (“PIK”) notes of our Class B
partner.  The Founder Notes were also subordinated to the rights of the holders of Class B units
to receive distributions under our amended partnership agreement and subordinated to the rights
of the holders of Series B preferred stock to receive payments.
Interest on the Founder Notes amounted to $0.6 million for each of the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 and $0.3 million for each of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Such amounts have been added to the balance of the Founder Notes.
Deferred financing costs. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $7.9 million of deferred
financing costs related to the credit facility, Term Loan Facility and senior notes, which are being
amortized over the respective terms of the related debt instrument. Deferred financing costs
of $6.3 million related to the Term Loan Facility and senior notes are netted with long-term debt
on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 in accordance with ASU No. 2015-03,
which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Deferred financing costs of $1.6 million and $1.2
million related to the credit facility are included in deferred financing costs, net on the
consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Amortization of deferred financing costs recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 was $2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred financing costs
recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.0 million and $0.8 million,
respectively.  These costs are included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of
operations.

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies
Environmental claims: Various landowners have sued us in lawsuits concerning several fields in
which we have or historically had operations.  The lawsuits seek injunctive relief and other relief,
including unspecified amounts in both actual and punitive damages for alleged breaches of
mineral leases and alleged failure to restore the plaintiffs’ lands from alleged contamination and
otherwise from our oil and natural gas operations. We are unable to express an opinion with
respect to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the various environmental claims or to
estimate the amount or range of potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable. Therefore, we
have not provided any material amounts for these claims in our consolidated financial statements
at June 30, 2016.
Due to the nature of our business, some contamination of the real estate property owned or
leased by us is possible. Environmental site assessments of the property would be necessary to
adequately determine remediation costs, if any.  We have accrued a liability for soil
contamination in Florida of $1.2 million and $1.3 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively, based on our undiscounted engineering estimates. The obligations are
included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Title/lease disputes: Title and lease disputes may arise in the normal course of our operations.
These disputes are usually small but could result in an increase or decrease in reserves and/or
other forms of settlement, such as cash, once a final resolution to the title dispute is made.
Litigation:  On April 13, 2005, Henry Sarpy and several other plaintiffs (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
filed a petition against Exxon, Extex, the Meridian Resource Company (“TMRC,” our wholly-
owned subsidiary), and the State of Louisiana for contamination of their land in the New Sarpy
and/or Good Hope Field in St. Charles Parish.  Plaintiffs claim they are owners of land upon
which oil
14
Table of Contents
field waste pits containing dangerous and contaminating substances are located.  Plaintiffs
alleged that they discovered in May 2004 that their property is contaminated with oil field wastes
greater than represented by Exxon.  The property was originally owned by Exxon and was sold
to TMRC.  TMRC subsequently sold the property to Extex. We have been defending this ongoing
case and investigating the scope of the Plaintiffs’ alleged damage.  On April 14, 2015, TMRC
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Exxon to settle the claims in this ongoing
matter.  On July 10, 2015, the settlement and comprised agreements were finalized and signed
by the Plaintiffs and Exxon.  On July 28, 2015, the State of Louisiana issued a letter of no
objection to the settlement.  As of June 30, 2016, we have accrued approximately $4.0 million
($0.8 million in current liabilities and $3.2 million in other long-term liabilities) as the outcome of
the litigation was deemed probable and estimable.    The settlement requires payment over the
term of six years.
Other contingencies: We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities arising in the
ordinary course of business for which the outcome cannot be reasonably estimated; however, in
the opinion of management, such litigation and claims will be resolved without material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accruals for losses associated
with litigation are made when losses are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Performance appreciation rights:    In the third quarter of 2014, we adopted the Alta Mesa
Holdings, LP Amended and Restated Performance Appreciation Rights Plan (the
“Plan”), effective September 24, 2014.  The Plan is intended to provide incentive compensation
to key employees and consultants who make significant contributions to the Company.  Under
the Plan, participants are granted performance appreciation rights (“PARs”) with a stipulated
initial designated value (“SIDV”).  The PARs vest over time (as specified in each grant, typically
five years) and entitle the owner to receive a cash amount equal to the increase, if any, between
the SIDV and the designated value of the PAR on the payment valuation date.  The payment
valuation date is the earlier of a liquidity event (as defined in the Plan, but generally intended to
be either a recapitalization or an initial public offering of Company equity) or as selected by the
participant, but no earlier than five years from the end of the year of the grant.  Both the initial
designated value and the designated payment value of the PAR are determined by the Plan’s
administrative committee, composed of members of our board of directors. In the case of a
liquidity event, the designated value of all PARs is to be based on the net sale proceeds (as
defined in the Plan) from the liquidity event.  After any payment valuation date, regardless of
payment or none, vested PARs expire. During the first six months of 2016,  we granted 360,000
new PARs with a SIDV of $40 and terminated 23,500 PARs with a SIDV of $40, resulting in
578,000 PARs issued at a weighted average of $36.80 as of June 30, 2016. We are unable to
express an opinion with respect to the likelihood of a qualifying liquidity event which would result
in any payment under the Plan or to estimate any amount which may become payable under the
Plan. We consider the possibility of payment at a fixed determination date absent a positive
liquidity event to be remote.  Therefore, we have not provided any amount for this contingent
liability in our consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
10. SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Our business makes us vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas.
Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, and may
continue to be volatile in the future. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly
volatile during the years 2014 and 2015 and have declined dramatically since the second half of
2014 and remain depressed as of June 30, 2016.  Continued depressed oil and natural gas
prices, further price declines or any other unfavorable market conditions could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and on the carrying value of our proved oil and natural
gas reserves.  Sustained low oil or natural gas prices may require us to further write down the
value of our oil and natural gas properties and/or revise our development plans, which may
cause certain of our undeveloped well locations to no longer be deemed proved. As a result of
the depressed commodity prices and in order to preserve our liquidity, we have reduced our
budgeted capital expenditures for 2016 from 2015 levels.   This could cause a reduction in the
borrowing base under our credit facility to the extent that we are not able to replace the reserves
that we produce.  Low prices may also reduce our cash available for distribution, acquisitions
and for servicing our indebtedness.  We mitigate some of this vulnerability by entering into oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids price derivative contracts.  See Note 5.
11. PARTNERS’ DEFICIT
Management and Control:  Our business and affairs are managed by Alta Mesa Holdings GP,
LLC, our general partner (“General Partner”). With certain exceptions, the General Partner may
not be removed except for the reasons of “cause,” which are defined in the partnership
agreement.  Our partnership agreement provides for two classes of limited partners.  Class A
partners include our founder and other parties.  Our Class B partner is High Mesa.  The Class B
limited partner has certain approval rights, generally over capital plans and significant
transactions in the areas of finance, acquisition, and divestiture.
Distribution and Income Allocation: In connection with the recapitalization of High Mesa on
March 25, 2014, our partnership agreement was amended and restated to provide, among other
things, that all distributions under the partnership agreement shall first be made to holders of
Class B Units, until certain provisions are met.  After such provisions are met, distributions shall
then be made to holders of Class A and Class B Units pursuant to the distribution formulas set
forth in the amended partnership agreement.
15
Table of Contents
The Class B  partner may require the General Partner to make distributions; however, any
distribution must be permitted under the terms of our credit facility, Term Loan Facility, and senior
notes.
Distribution of net cash flow from a Liquidity Event (as defined below) is distributed to the Class A
and Class B partners according to a variable formula as defined in the partnership agreement. A
“Liquidity Event” is any event in which we receive cash proceeds outside the ordinary course of
our business. The Class B partner can, without consent of any other partners, request that the
General Partner take action to cause us, or our assets, to be sold to one or more third parties.
12. SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS
All of our material wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors under the terms of our senior notes,
our credit facility and our Term Loan Facility. Our consolidated financial statements reflect the
financial position of these subsidiary guarantors. The parent company, Alta Mesa Holdings, LP,
has no independent operations, assets, or liabilities. The guarantees are full and unconditional
(except for customary release provisions) and joint and several.  Those subsidiaries, which are
not wholly owned and are not guarantors, are minor. There are no restrictions on dividends,
distributions, loans, or other transfers of funds from the subsidiary guarantors to the parent
company.

ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. In addition, such
analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related
notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
(“2015 Annual Report”).  The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The
forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be
outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include,
but are not limited to, the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, production timing and volumes,
estimates of proved reserves, operating costs and capital expenditures, economic and
competitive conditions, regulatory changes and other uncertainties, as well as those factors
discussed below in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and in our
2015 Annual Report, particularly in the section titled “Risk Factors,” all of which are difficult to
predict. As a result of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events
discussed may not occur.
Overview
We have been engaged in the onshore oil and natural gas acquisition, exploitation, exploration
and production in the United States since 1987.  Currently, we are focusing our drilling efforts in
our core properties in the Sooner Trend area of the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma and the Weeks
Island Area in South Louisiana.  We maintain operational control of the majority of our properties,
either through directly operating them, or through operating arrangements with minority interest
holders.  Our operations also include other oil and natural gas interests in Texas and Louisiana.
The amount of revenue we generate from our operations will fluctuate based on, among other
things:
•the prices at which we will sell our production;
•the amount of oil and natural gas we produce; and
•the level of our operating and administrative costs.
In order to mitigate the impact of changes in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices on our
cash flows, we are a party to hedging and other price protection contracts, and we intend to enter
into such transactions in the future to reduce the effect of low oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices on our cash flows.
Substantially all of our oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and,
accordingly, the amounts presented reflect our proportionate interest in such activities. Inflation
has not had a material impact on our results of operations and is not expected to have a material
impact on the results of our operations in the future.
Outlook, Market Conditions and Commodity Prices
Our revenue, profitability and future growth depend on many factors, particularly the prices of oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids, which are beyond our control.  The relatively low level of
natural gas prices prompted our shift in emphasis to oil and natural gas liquids over the past
several years.  Accordingly, the success of our business is significantly affected by the price of oil
due to our current focus on development of oil reserves and exploration for oil.  Oil prices are
subject to significant changes.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2014, the price for oil began a
dramatic decline, and current prices for oil are significantly less than they have been over the last
several years.  Factors affecting the oil prices include worldwide economic conditions, including
the European credit markets; geopolitical activities, including developments in the Middle East,
South America, and elsewhere; worldwide supply conditions; weather conditions; actions taken
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the value of the U.S. dollar in
international currency markets.  Sustained low prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the carrying value of our oil and
natural gas properties, our proved reserves, and our ability to finance operations, including the
amount of our borrowing base under our credit facility.
During the last 12 month period ended June 30, 2016, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate
(“NYMEX WTI”) oil prices ranged from a high of $50.93 per Bbl in July 2015 to a low of $30.62
per Bbl in February 2016.  During the second quarter of 2016, NYMEX WTI prices averaged
approximately $45.59 per Bbl.  We received an average price of $43.12 per Bbl for the second
quarter of 2016 before the effects of hedging.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices (“NYMEX
HH”) have also been volatile and ranged from a high of $2.89 per MMBtu in August 2015 to a low
of $1.71 in March 2016. We received an average price of $1.69 per Mcf for natural gas in the
second quarter of 2016 before the effects of hedging. Although oil and natural gas prices have
recently begun to recover from the lows experienced during the first quarter of 2016, forecasted
prices for both oil and natural gas remain depressed.  The duration and magnitude of changes in
oil and natural gas prices cannot be predicted.
Depressed oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have impacted our earnings by
necessitating impairment write-downs in some of our oil and natural gas properties, either directly
by decreasing the market values of the properties, or indirectly, by lowering rates of return on oil
and natural gas development projects and increasing the chance of impairment write-downs.  We
recorded non-
17
Table of Contents
cash impairment expenses of $13.3 million and $77.4 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively.  In  the first six months of 2016 and 2015, write-downs were
primarily due to downward revisions in proved reserves in some fields and the effects of
decreased prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.  In the first six months of 2016, our
impairments were primarily related to a  frontier exploration area.  In the first six months of 2015,
our impairments were primarily related to Weeks Island Area and other non-core natural gas
fields.  Further declines in oil and/or natural gas prices may result in additional impairment
expenses.
Sustained low prices for oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids prices may require us to further
write down the value of our oil and natural gas properties and/or revise our development plans,
which may cause certain of our undeveloped well locations to no longer be deemed proved. It is
also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further
changes to the Company’s drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or
operating costs could result in other additional impairments.  As a result of depressed prices and
in order to preserve our liquidity, we reduced our budgeted capital expenditures for 2016 from
2015 levels.  Low prices may also reduce our cash available for distribution, acquisitions and for
servicing our indebtedness.
Our derivative contracts are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are
sensitive to changes in the price of oil and natural gas. Changes in these derivative assets and
liabilities are reported in our consolidated statements  of operations as gain / loss on derivative
contracts, which include both the non-cash increase and decrease in the fair value of derivative
contracts, as well as the effect of cash settlements of derivative contracts during the period. In the
first six months of 2016, we recognized a net loss on our derivative contracts of $27.5 million,
which includes $66.0 million in cash settlements received on derivative contracts. The $66.0
million in cash settlements received during the first six months of 2016 includes approximately
$40.2 million from settlement of several of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts prior to
contract expiry.  The objective of our hedging program is that, over time, the combination of
settlement gains and losses from derivative contracts with ordinary oil and natural gas revenues
will produce relative revenue stability. However, in the short term, both settlements and fair value
changes in our derivative contracts can significantly impact our results of operations, and  these
gains and losses will continue to reflect changes in oil and natural gas prices.
As of June 30, 2016, we have hedged approximately 69% of our forecasted production of proved
developed producing reserves through 2019 at weighted average annual floor prices ranging
from $2.88 per MMBtu to $4.50 per MMBtu for natural gas and $49.65 per Bbl to $67.05 per Bbl
for oil.  If oil and/or natural gas prices continue to decline for an extended period of time, we may
be unable to replace expiring hedge contracts or enter new contracts for additional oil and natural
gas production at favorable prices.
The primary factors affecting our production levels are capital availability, the effectiveness and
efficiency of our production operations, the success of our drilling program, and our inventory of
drilling prospects.  In addition, we face the challenge of natural production declines.  We attempt
to overcome this natural decline primarily through development of our existing undeveloped
reserves, enhanced completions,  well recompletions, and other enhanced recovery methods.
Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production.
Our ability to add reserves through drilling and other development techniques is dependent on
our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain
drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays in drilling, completing or connecting our
new wells to gathering lines will negatively affect our production, which will have an adverse
effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash flow from operations.
Operations Update
Sooner Trend.    Our assets in the Sooner Trend of Oklahoma are large, contiguous acreage
blocks with multiple productive zones at depths generally between 4,000 feet and 8,000 feet.
 These assets have historically been predominantly shallow-decline, long-lived oil fields
originally drilled on 80-acre vertical well spacing and waterflooded to varying degrees.  Our focus
in these fields is the continued implementation of a multi-year, multi-rig program to develop
several pay zones with horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing of the Mississippian
age Osage, Meramec, and Manning and the Pennsylvanian age Oswego, as well as the
definition of similar exploitation opportunities in the Woodford Shale, Hunton Lime, and other
formations.    We also maintain production in the historically principal field pay zones that have
been water flooded for several decades.  We have positioned ourselves for expanded horizontal
development of stacked pays, both within and contiguous with our legacy position in the Sooner
Trend.  In the second quarter of 2016, we completed 18 horizontal wells in the Osage
formations in the Sooner Trend.  Six of the completed wells for the second quarter of 2016 were
part of our Joint Development Agreement with BCE-Stack Development LLC (“BCE”).    We had
21 horizontal wells in progress as of the end of the second quarter of 2016,  11 of which were
drilled as part of our Joint Development Agreement with BCE.  Six of the 21 horizontal wells in
progress as of June 30, 2016 were on production subsequent to quarter end.
As of June 30, 2016, we had four drilling rigs operating in the Sooner Trend for horizontal
development.  We plan to utilize up to five drilling rigs during 2016 targeting the Mississippian
age Osage, Meramec, Manning, and the Pennsylvanian age Oswego with horizontal drilling.  We
will also participate in other horizontal wells as a non-operator, primarily targeting the Oswego
Lime, Meramec and Osage.

Table of Contents
Production from our Sooner Trend properties in the second quarter of 2016 was an average of
approximately 12,300 BOE/Day net to our interest, 73% oil and natural gas liquids, as compared
to an average of approximately 8,500 BOE/Day, 78% oil and natural gas liquids, in the second
quarter of 2015.  Production from our Sooner Trend properties in the first six months of 2016 was
an average of approximately 11,700 BOE/Day net to our interest, 75% oil and natural gas liquids,
as compared to an average of approximately 8,100 BOE/Day, 79% oil and natural gas liquids, in
the first six months of 2015.
Weeks Island Area.  The Weeks Island Area, located in Iberia and St. Mary Parish, Louisiana,
contains some of our largest proved developed reserves and consists of the Weeks Island and
Cote Blanche Island fields.
Weeks Island field, located in Iberia Parish, Louisiana, is a historically-prolific oil field with 55
potential pay zones that are structurally and stratigraphically trapped around a piercement salt
dome.    We expect to continue development activity in this field in 2016.
Cote Blanche Island field is located near Weeks Island field in St. Mary Parish. The field is a salt
dome structure and production from the Miocene sands discovered in 1948 by Texaco, three
years after the discovery at Weeks Island field. The geology is similar to Weeks Island and we
plan on utilizing the same geologic interpretation methods and engineering development
techniques at Cote Blanche that we use at Weeks Island to increase reserves and production.
In response to declining commodity prices, we are focusing our efforts on maintaining production
through more efficient lifting operations.  Production from the Weeks Island  Area in the second
quarter of 2016 was approximately 3,900 BOE/Day, net to our interest, 90% oil, as compared to
4,900 BOE/Day, 83% oil, for the second quarter of 2015.  Production from the Weeks Island
Areas in the first six months of 2016 was approximately 4,000 BOE/Day, net to our interest, 92%
oil, as compared to 4,800 BOE/Day, 83% oil in the first six months of 2015.

Revenues
Oil revenues in the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $16.4 million, or 27%,  to $43.8
million from $60.2 million in the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in revenue relative
to the same period in 2015, was primarily attributable to a decrease in average price as well as a
small decrease in production during the second quarter of 2016.   The average price of oil
exclusive of derivative contract settlements decreased $14.07 per Bbl or 25% in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease in oil revenues
of approximately $14.3 million. When including the effects of derivative contract settlements, the
overall price increased 27% from $62.88 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2015 to $80.03 per Bbl
in the second quarter of 2016.  The overall price in the second quarter 2016 included settlements
of oil derivative contracts prior to contract expiry of approximately $34.4 million.  Production
decreased 36 MBbls,  resulting in a decrease of $2.1 million in oil revenues.  The difference in
production is primarily due to the sale of our Eagleville field in 2015 of 122 MBbls and natural
decline in production in Weeks Island Area of 49 MBbls, partially offset by an increase in
production in the Sooner Trend of 135 MBbls.
Natural gas revenues in the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $2.4 million, or 29%,
to $5.8 million from $8.2 million in the same period of 2015. The decrease in natural gas revenue
was primarily attributable to a decrease in average price partially offset by an increase in
production during the second quarter of 2016. The average price of natural gas exclusive of
derivative contract settlements decreased $1.05 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2016, resulting
in a decrease in natural gas revenues of approximately $3.6 million.  When including the effects
of derivative contract settlements, the overall price decreased 71% from $9.01 per Mcf in the
second quarter of 2015 to $2.64 per Mcf in the second quarter of 2016.  The overall price in the
second quarter of 2016 included settlements of natural gas derivative contracts prior to contract
expiry of approximately $2.4 million compared to $14.7 million of similar settlements of natural
gas derivative contracts in the corresponding period in 2015.  Production increased 0.4 Bcf
resulting in an increase of $1.2 million in natural gas revenues. Although we continue to have
an emphasis on liquids-rich assets in our portfolio, this increase is primarily due to natural gas
produced in association with oil.
Natural gas liquids revenues increased $0.9 million, or 28%, during the second quarter of 2016 to
$4.0 million from $3.1 million in the same period in 2015. The increase in natural gas liquids
revenue was attributable to increased production volumes during the second quarter of 2016,
partially offset by a lower average price.    Production increased 71 MBbls from 175 MBbls to 246
MBbls, resulting in an increase of $1.3 million in natural gas liquids revenues.  The increase in
production is primarily due to an increase in production in our Sooner Trend field of 79 MBbls
partially offset by a decrease in production in non-core fields of 8 MBbls.    The average price of
natural gas liquids exclusive of derivative contract settlements decreased $1.65 per barrel or 9%
in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease in
natural gas liquids revenues of $0.4 million.  We entered into natural gas liquids derivative
contracts during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the effective dates of those contracts were
January 1, 2016.  The overall price including derivative contract settlements decreased 10% from
$17.95 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2015 to $16.11 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2016.
Gain on sale of assets was a gain of $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to a
gain of $25,000 in the second quarter of 2015.    The gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016
is primarily related to the sale of non-core assets in South Louisiana.
Loss on derivative contracts was a loss of $38.3 million in the second quarter of 2016 as
compared to a loss of $15.2 million during the same period in 2015.  The fluctuation from period
to period is due to the volatility of oil, and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding
hedge contracts during these periods.    The $38.3 million loss in the second quarter of 2016 is
inclusive of $40.8 million from settlements received on our derivative contracts of which $36.8
million were from settlements of oil and natural gas derivative contracts prior to contract
expiry.  The $15.2 million loss in the second quarter of 2015 is inclusive of $24.7 million in
settlements received on oil and natural gas derivative contracts of which $14.7 million were  from
settlements of natural gas derivative contracts prior to contract expiry.
Expenses
Lease and plant operating expense decreased $0.6 million or 4% in the second quarter of 2016
as compared to the second quarter of 2015, to $14.9 million from $15.5 million.  In general, there
was a decrease in compression expense, salt water disposal costs,  and repairs and
maintenance expense of approximately $1.9 million partially offset by an increase in field
services and marketing and gathering expense of $1.3  million. On a per unit basis, lease and
plant operating expense  was  $8.13 per BOE and $8.98 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016
and 2015, respectively.
Production and ad valorem taxes decreased $1.5 million, or 36%, to $2.7 million in the second
quarter of 2016, as compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2015.  Production taxes
decreased from $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2015 to $2.3 million in the second quarter of
2016,  primarily due to the decline in oil and natural gas revenues.  Ad valorem taxes increased
approximately $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2016 from the corresponding period of
2015 primarily due to estimate adjustments in the second quarter of 2015.
Workover expense increased $1.2 million during the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the
second quarter of 2015. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is
attributable to many different properties.

Table of Contents
Exploration expense includes dry hole costs, the costs of our geology department, costs of
geological and geophysical data, expired leases, plug and abandonment expenditures, and
delay rentals.  Exploration expense decreased from $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 to
$3.4 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in geologic and
geophysical (“G&G”)  seismic expense of $3.2 million partially offset by an increase in expired
leasehold costs of $1.0 million in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the second quarter
of 2015.    During the second quarter of 2016, exploration expense consisted of G&G seismic
expense of $1.2 million, leasehold costs of $1.8 million, and plug and other abandonment
expenses of $0.5 million.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased from $38.2 million in the second
quarter of 2015 to $22.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a per unit basis, this expense
decreased from $22.16 per BOE in the second quarter of 2015 to $12.50 per BOE in the second
quarter of 2016.  The 2016 depletion rate per BOE was partially lower due to the impairment of
proved properties in 2015, which lowered the depletable base. Depreciation, depletion, and
amortization is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and
production by field.
Impairment expense increased from $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2015 to $11.6 million in
the second quarter of 2016. This expense varies with the results of exploratory and development
drilling, as well as with well performance, commodity price declines and other factors that may
render some fields uneconomic, resulting in impairment.  Impairment expense in the second
quarter of 2016 included a write-down of $10.3 million associated with the impact of low
commodity prices on frontier exploration areas.
Accretion expense is related to our obligation for retirement of oil and natural gas wells and
facilities. We record these liabilities when we place the assets in service, using discounted
present values of the estimated future obligation. We then record accretion of the liabilities as
they approach maturity. Accretion expense was $0.5 million in each of the second quarters of
2016 and 2015.
General and administrative expense increased $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2016 to
$12.1 million from $12.0 million in the second quarter of 2015.  The increase is primarily due
to legal fees and senior credit facility arrangement fees of $1.7 million offset by decrease in
salary, benefits and performance bonus of $1.3 million and a decrease in accrued legal
settlement expense of $0.3 million.  On a per unit basis, general and administrative expenses
were $6.58 per BOE and $6.93 per BOE in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Interest expense, net increased from $15.1 million in the second  quarter of 2015 to $17.4 million
in the  second quarter of 2016.    We incurred additional interest in the current quarter of $1.9
million due to the second lien senior secured term loan that we entered into during the second
quarter of 2015.  Interest on our credit facility also increased $0.3 million in the second quarter of
2016 as compared to the second quarter of 2015 as we drew down our remaining borrowing
base capacity during the first quarter of 2016.

Revenues
Oil revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $34.6 million, or 32%, to $75.0
million from $109.6 million for the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in oil revenue
was attributable to a lower average price as well as decreased production volumes. The average
price of oil exclusive of derivative contract settlements decreased 29% in the first six months of
2016, resulting in a decrease in oil revenues of approximately $30.5 million.  The overall price,
including settlements of derivative contracts, decreased 3% from $68.96 per Bbl in the first six
months of 2015 to $66.57 per Bbl in the first six months of 2016.
An approximate $4.1 million decrease in oil revenues in the first six months of 2016 was due to a
decrease in production of 79 MBbls, or 4%. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of our
Eagleville field during the third quarter of 2015 and natural decline in production in our Weeks
Island Area, partially offset by an increase in production from the Sooner Trend field.  The sale of
Eagleville and natural decline production of our Weeks Island Area decreased production by 362
MBbls.  Sooner Trend increased production by 291 MBbls, from 930 MBbls in the first six months
of 2015 to 1,221 MBbls in the corresponding period of 2016.
Natural gas revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $5.9 million, or 36%, to
$10.5 million from $16.4 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in natural gas
revenue was attributable to a decrease in price, partially offset by an increase in production
during the first six months of 2016.  The average price of natural gas exclusive of derivative
contract settlements decreased 39% in the first six months of 2016, resulting in a decrease in
natural gas revenues of approximately $6.7 million.  The overall price, including derivative
contract settlements, decreased 61% from $6.56 per Mcf in the first six months of 2015 to $2.56
per Mcf in the first six months of 2016.  The overall price in the second quarter of 2016 includes
$2.4 million we received related to settlement of several of our natural gas derivative
contracts prior to contract expiry as compared to $14.7 million we received related to similar
settlements of natural gas derivative contracts in the corresponding period in 2015.  An
approximate $0.8 million increase in natural gas revenues was due to an increase in production
of 0.3 BCF, or 5%.
Natural gas liquids revenues increased $0.3 million, or 5%, in the first six months of 2016 to $6.1
million from $5.8 million in the same period in 2015. The increase in natural gas liquids revenue
was attributable to an increase in production volumes partially offset by decreased price in the
first six months of 2016.  The increase in volume is primarily due to increased production in our
Sooner Trend field.  The Sooner Trend field produced 375 MBbls and 236 MBbls in the first six
months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The increase in volume in Sooner Trend was partially
offset by the decrease in volume of 55 MBbls due to the sale of our Eagleville field, resulting in
an increase in natural gas liquids revenues of approximately $1.7 million.  The average price of
natural gas liquids exclusive of derivative contract settlements decreased $3.15 per Bbl or 18%
in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, resulting in a decrease in
natural gas liquids revenues of $1.4 million.  We entered into natural gas liquids derivative
contracts during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the effective dates of those contracts were
January 1, 2016.  The overall price including derivative contract settlements decreased 18% from
$17.12 per Bbl to $13.98 per Bbl for the first six months of 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Gain on sale of assets was $3.7 million in the first six months of 2016, as compared to $0.2
million in the first six months of 2015.  The $3.7 million gain in the first six months of 2016 was
due to the sale of certain non-core assets.
Gain (loss) on derivative contracts was a loss of $27.5 million during the six months ended June
30, 2016 as compared to a gain of  $11.6 million during the same period in 2015. The fluctuation
from period to period is due to the volatility of oil, and natural gas prices and changes in our
outstanding hedge contracts during these periods. The $27.5 million loss in the first six months of
2016 is inclusive of $66.0 million in settlements received on derivative contracts of which $40.2
million were from settlements of oil and natural gas derivative contracts prior to expiry.  The $11.6
million gain in the first six months of 2015 is inclusive of $58.5 million in settlements received on
derivative contracts of which $32.6 million were from settlements of oil and natural gas derivative
contracts prior to expiry.
Expenses
Lease and plant operating expense decreased $0.4 million, or 1% in the first six months of 2016
as compared to the first six months of 2015, from $33.9 million to $33.5 million, primarily due to a
decrease in cost for salt water disposal,  chemicals, and repairs and maintenance totaling $3.2
million, partially offset by an increase in field services and marketing and gathering expense
totaling $2.8 million. On a per unit basis, lease and plant operating expenses were $9.56 per
BOE and $9.87 per BOE for the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Production and ad valorem taxes decreased $3.4 million, or 40%, to $5.1 million in the first six
months of 2016, as compared to $8.5 million in the first six months of 2015.  Production taxes
decreased $3.0 million in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of
2015, as a result of the decline in oil and natural gas revenues.  Ad valorem taxes decreased
$0.4 million, primarily due to the sale of our Eagleville field during the third quarter of 2015.
Workover expense decreased from $3.3 million in the first six months of 2015 to $2.5 million
in the first six months of 2016. This expense varies depending on activities in the field and is
attributable to many different properties.
24
Table of Contents
Exploration expense includes dry hole costs and the costs of our geology department, costs of
geological and geophysical data, expired leases, plug and abandonment expenditures, and
delay rentals. Exploration expense decreased $23.6 million, from $30.3 million in the first six
months of 2015 to $6.7 million in the first six months of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in dry
hole expenses of $18.8 million, and a decrease in G&G expenses of $6.3 million. This decrease
was partially offset by an increase in leasehold expense in the first six months of 2016 of $1.1
million.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense decreased $34.6 million to $44.4 million in the
first six months of 2016 as compared to an expense of $79.0 million in the first six months of
2015. On a per unit basis, this expense decreased from $23.00 per BOE in the first six months of
2015 to $12.69 per BOE in the first six months of 2016.   The 2016 depletion rate per BOE was
lower due to the impairment of proved properties in 2015, which partially lowered the depletable
base.  The rate is a function of capitalized costs of proved properties, proved reserves and
production by field.
Impairment expense decreased $64.1 million from $77.4 million in the first six months of 2015 to
$13.3 million in the first six months of 2016. This expense varies with the results of drilling, as
well as with price declines and other factors that may render some fields uneconomic, resulting in
impairment.  Impairment expense in the first six months of 2015 included a write-down of our
Weeks Island Area and natural gas fields in South Texas, East Texas and South Louisiana.  
 Impairment expense in the first six months of 2016 included a write-down of $10.3 million
associated with the impact of low commodity prices on frontier exploration areas.
Accretion expense is related to our obligation for retirement of oil and natural gas wells and
facilities. We record these liabilities when we place the assets in service, using discounted
present values of the estimated future obligation. We then record accretion of the liabilities as
they approach maturity. Accretion expense was $1.1 million in the first six months of 2016 and
$1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2015.
General and administrative expense decreased $7.4  million in the first six months of 2016 to
$22.3 million from $29.7 million in the first six months of 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a
decrease in accrued legal settlement expense of $5.2 million and accrued performance bonus of
$4.0 million partially offset by an increase in legal fees and credit facility arrangement fees of
$2.8 million.
Interest expense, net increased $4.4 million in the first six months of 2016 to $33.6 million from
$29.2 million in the first six months of 2015.  We incurred additional interest of $5.1 million,
including amortization of deferred financing loan cost, on the senior secured term loan that we
entered into during the second quarter 2015. Interest on our credit facility decreased $0.6 million
in the first six months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower average
outstanding balances.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal requirements for capital are to fund our day-to-day operations, exploration and
development activities, and to satisfy our contractual obligations, primarily for the repayment of
debt and any amounts owed during the period related to our hedging positions.
Our 2016 capital budget is primarily focused on the development of existing core areas through
exploitation and development. Currently, we plan to spend approximately $120 million in 2016
for exploration and development, of which over 90% is allocated to our Sooner Trend properties
and  the Weeks Island Area.  We have expended or accrued approximately $90.5 million through
June 30, 2016.    We reduced our anticipated capital expenditures for 2016 from 2015 levels in
response to the continued depressed oil prices and to preserve liquidity.  Our future drilling plans,
plans of our drilling operators and capital budgets are subject to change based upon various
factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas
prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling
services and equipment, actions of our operators, gathering system and pipeline transportation
constraints and regulatory approvals. Because a large percentage of our acreage is held by
production, we have the ability to materially decrease our drilling and recompletion budget in
response to market conditions with decreased risk of losing significant acreage.
We expect to fund our 2016 capital expenditures predominantly with cash flows from operations,
supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility.  If necessary, we may also access capital
through proceeds from potential asset dispositions and the future issuances of debt and/or equity
securities, subject to the distribution of proceeds therefrom as set forth in our partnership
agreement. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as
necessary to facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to
selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than
anticipated and other sources of capital we have historically utilized are not available on
acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending.
As we execute our business strategy, we will continually monitor the capital resources available
to meet future financial obligations and planned capital expenditures.  We cannot make
assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our
outstanding indebtedness or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient
to enable us to pay our outstanding indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs.  If our
business does not generate sufficient cash flow from
25
Table of Contents
operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may have to undertake alternative
financing plans, such as, refinancing or restructuring our debt; selling assets; reducing or
delaying acquisitions or our drilling programs; or seeking to raise additional capital.
We continue to evaluate our management of liability options and may in the future engage in
negotiations with holders of our senior notes or other debt holders regarding potential alternative
transactions, along with possible avenues for increasing our near-term liquidity.
However, we cannot make assurances that any such negotiations will be successful or that we
would be able to refinance or restructure our debt or implement alternative financing plans, if
necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that implementing any such alternative
financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations.  In addition, any failure to make
scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result
in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness
on acceptable terms.
Senior Notes
We have $450 million in outstanding registered senior notes due October 15, 2018 that carry a
stated interest rate of 9.625% and an effective interest rate of 9.7825% at June 30, 2016. Interest
is payable semi-annually each April 15th and October 15th. The senior notes are unsecured and
are general obligations, and effectively rank junior to any of our existing or future secured
indebtedness, which includes the credit facility and senior secured term loan. The senior notes
are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our material subsidiaries.
The senior notes contain an optional redemption provision that began on October 15,
2015 allowing us to retire the principal outstanding, in whole or in part, at 102.406%. Additional
optional redemption provisions allow for retirement at 100.0% beginning on October 15, 2016. As
of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the senior notes.
Credit Facility
We have a senior secured revolving credit facility (“credit facility”) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as
the administrative agent, which matures October 13, 2017.  As of June 30, 2016, the credit facility
was subject to a $300 million borrowing base limit.  We had $300 million outstanding under the
credit facility at June 30, 2016, which includes $293.9 million of outstanding borrowings and $6.1
million of outstanding letters of credit, with no remaining availability. Our restricted subsidiaries
are guarantors of the credit facility.
On February 3, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Amendment No. 13 (the “Thirteenth
Amendment”) to the credit facility which, among other things: (a) permits us to enter into
exchanges of outstanding senior notes for a third lien term loan, (b) permits us to draw the
remaining borrowing base availability under the credit facility into a controlled account with such
funds not being treated as debt for the purposes of leverage ratio compliance so long as they
remain in the controlled account, (c) permits us to dispose of oil and natural gas properties
pursuant to the joint development agreement with BCE, (d) requires that twice a month we
transfer available cash in excess of $25 million to the controlled account, and (e) increases the
maximum leverage ratio for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016
from 4.0 to 1.0 to 4.5 to 1.0.    On June 16, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Amendment
No. 14 (the “Fourteenth Amendment”) to the credit facility which, among other things: (a)
reaffirmed borrowing base at $300 million until the next scheduled redetermination, and (b)
increased the applicable margins to be applied based on the utilization of the borrowing base.
On March 16, 2016, we borrowed $141.9 million under the credit facility, which represented the
remaining undrawn amount that was available under the credit facility. As required by the terms
of the credit facility, the borrowings were deposited into an account controlled by the
administrative agent. Such funds will not be treated as debt for the purposes of leverage ratio
compliance so long as they remain in the controlled account.  As of June 30, 2016, we had
approximately $121.9 million remaining in the controlled account.  These new borrowings bear
interest at 4.125%.  The credit facility borrowing base is redetermined semi-annually in May and
November.  If oil and natural gas prices continue to decline, the borrowing base under our credit
facility may be reduced.
Our credit facility provides for two alternative interest rate bases and margins. Eurodollar loans
accrue interest generally at the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a
margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%, depending on the utilization of our borrowing base.
“Reference rate” loans accrue interest at the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., plus a margin
ranging from 1.50% to 2.50%, depending on the utilization of our borrowing base. The average
rate on all loans outstanding as of June 30, 2016 under the credit facility was 4.06%, which was
based on the Eurodollar option.
The credit facility, the indenture governing the senior notes and the senior secured term loan
facility include covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial covenants including a current
ratio, leverage ratio, and interest coverage ratio. The terms of the credit facility also restrict our
ability to make distributions and investments.  At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the
covenants.
Senior Secured Term Loan
On June 2, 2015, we entered into a second lien senior secured term loan agreement (the “Term
Loan Facility”) with Morgan Stanley Energy Capital Inc.  as administrative agent, and the lenders
party thereto, pursuant to which we borrowed $125 million.  The Term Loan Facility matures on

On February 3, 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the Term Loan Facility (the “First
Amendment”). The First Amendment: (a) permits us to enter into exchanges of outstanding senior
notes for  a third lien term loan, (b) allows us to dispose of oil and natural gas properties pursuant
to the joint development agreement with BCE, (c) requires that twice a month we transfer
available cash in excess of $25 million to a controlled account, with such funds in the controlled
account to not be treated as debt for the purposes of leverage ratio compliance so long as they
remain in the controlled account, and (d) increases the maximum leverage ratio for the fiscal
quarters ending June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 from 4.5 to 1.0 to 5.0 to 1.0.
Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at adjusted LIBOR plus 8.00%. The
covenants in the Term Loan Facility require, among other things, maintenance of certain ratios,
measured on a quarterly basis, as follows: (i) current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.0 to
1.0, (ii) debt to EBITDAX of no more than 5.0 to 1.0 (decreasing to 4.5 to 1.0 for the quarter ended
December 31, 2016), (iii) PV-9 of total proved reserves to total secured debt of at least 1.5 to 1.0,
and (iv) EBITDAX to interest expense of at least 2.5 to 1.0.  PV-9 is calculated using four year
NYMEX strip pricing adjusted for differentials.  Obligations under the Term Loan Facility are
guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates and are secured by second priority liens
on substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets that serve as collateral under the credit
facility.  At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Term Loan Facility.
We have the option to prepay all or a portion of the Term Loan Facility at any time, and we are
subject to certain mandatory prepayments of proceeds from asset sales or an initial public
offering, which are subject to certain prepayment premiums.
Cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities
Operating activities used cash of $46.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to cash provided by operating activities of $82.4 million during the comparable period
in 2015, a decrease of $129.3 million.  The decrease in operating cash flows was attributable to
various factors.  Cash-based items of net loss, including revenues (exclusive of unrealized
commodity gains or losses), operating expenses and taxes, general and administrative
expenses, and the cash portion of our interest expense, resulted in a net decrease of
approximately $17.7 million.    Changes in restricted cash, working capital and other assets and
liabilities resulted in a decrease of $111.6 million in the first six months of 2016 as compared to
the corresponding period in 2015.
Cash flow used in investing activities
Investing activities used cash of $93.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as
compared to $91.7 million during the comparable period of 2015.  Capital expenditures for
property and equipment used cash of $95.0 million and $141.8 million in the first six months of
2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of properties provided proceeds of $1.4 million and $25.5
million in the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the second quarter of 2015,
net proceeds in the restricted account provided proceeds of $24.6 million.    We placed net
proceeds from the sale of our remaining interest in the Hilltop field into a restricted cash account
established during the fourth quarter 2014 as required under Section 1031-Like-Kind Exchange,
under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which was released in 2015.
Cash flow provided by financing activities
Financing activities provided cash of $141.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016
as compared to $16.5 million during the comparable period in 2015.  During the first six months
of 2016 we drew down $141.9 million on our credit facility and deposited the cash in a controlled
account pursuant to the Thirteenth Amendment of our credit facility.  In addition, we paid $0.8
million of deferred financing costs related to our credit facility.  In the first six months of 2015, we
used the proceeds received from the Term Loan Facility to reduce the outstanding balance under
our credit facility by $120.9 million.  In addition, during the first six months of 2015, we made
payments of $40.0 million to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility partially
offset by draws made on our credit facility of $64.6 million. Furthermore, we  made a capital
distribution of $3.8 million and we incurred $4.3 million of deferred financing cost related to the
Term Loan Facility during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
The information in this report includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  All statements, other than
statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, regarding our
strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs,
prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in
this report, the words “could”, “should”, “will”, “play”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”,
“expect”, “project” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-
looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events
and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events.
When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other
cautionary statements described under the heading “Risk Factors” included in our 2015 Annual
Report and Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,
2016 (“March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q”) and this report. These forward-looking statements are based
on management’s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and
timing of future events.

Table of Contents
Forward-looking statements may include statements about our:
·business strategy;
·reserves quantities and the present value of our reserves;  
·financial strategy, liquidity and capital required for our development program;
·future oil and natural gas prices;
·timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas;
·hedging strategy and results;
·future drilling plans;
·marketing of oil and natural gas;
·leasehold or business acquisitions;
·costs of developing our properties;
·liquidity and access to capital;
·future operating results; and
·plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this report that are not historical.
We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and
uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control,
incident to the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas. These risks
include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility, low prices for oil and/or natural gas,
global economic conditions, inflation, increased operating costs, lack of availability of drilling and
production equipment and services, environmental risks, weather risks, drilling and other
operating risks, regulatory changes, the uncertainty inherent in estimating oil and natural gas
reserves and in projecting future rates of production, reductions in cash flow, access to capital,
and the other risks described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Annual Report and in our
March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q.
Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural
gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on
the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made
by reservoir engineers.  Specifically, future prices received for production and costs may vary,
perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. Prices
for oil or natural gas remain depressed and have been trading at multi-year lows in the first six
months of 2016, and sustained lower prices will cause the twelve-month weighted average price
to decrease over time as the lower prices are reflected in the average price, which may reduce
the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves.  In addition, the results of drilling,
testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If
significant, such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development
drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of oil and
natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in the  2015 Annual Report, the March
31, 2016 Form 10-Q or this report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our
actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking
statements.
All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this report are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be
considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we
or persons acting on our behalf may issue.
Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-
looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
For information regarding our exposure to certain market risks, see “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Risk Management
Activities—Commodity Derivative Instruments” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2015 Annual Report. There have been no material
changes to the disclosure regarding market risks other than as noted below. See Part I, Item 1,
Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our outstanding derivative
contracts at the most recent reporting date.

Table of Contents
The fair value of our commodity derivative contracts at June 30, 2016 was a net asset of $10.8
million. A 10% increase or decrease in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices with all
other factors held constant would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, in the estimated
fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future net cash flows from such instruments) of
our commodity derivative contracts of approximately $28.6 million (decrease in value) or
$26.3 million (increase in value), respectively, as of June 30, 2016.
We are subject to interest rate risk on our variable interest rate borrowings. Although in the past
we have used interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of fluctuating interest rates on interest
expense, we currently have no open interest rate derivative contracts.  A 1% increase in interest
rates would increase annual interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately $2.9
million, based on the balance outstanding as of June 30, 2016.
ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, we carried out an

and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
