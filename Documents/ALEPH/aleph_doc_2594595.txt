Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company,
without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading.
These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of
management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these
interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company’s 10-K annual report
and all amendments. The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.
Results of operations for the interim period are not indicative of annual results.
Principles of consolidation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Citadel Exploration, Inc., Citadel
Exploration, LLC and Citadel Kern Bluff, LLC, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries.  All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Citadel Exploration, Inc., Citadel Exploration, LLC
and Citadel Kern Bluff, LLC will be collectively referred herein to as the “Company”.
Nature of operations
Currently, the Company is focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties in California.
Revenue Recognition
Sales of oil are recognized when the product has been delivered to a custody transfer point, persuasive evidence
of a sales arrangement exists, the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery,
collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured, and the sales price is fixed or determinable.
Impairment
The Company evaluates the impairment of its proved oil and natural gas properties on a field-by-field basis
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The
carrying values of proved properties are reduced to fair value when the expected undiscounted future cash flows
are less than net book value. The fair values of proved properties are measured using valuation techniques
consistent with the income approach, converting future cash flows to a single discounted amount. Significant inputs
used to determine the fair values of proved properties include estimates of: (i) reserves; (ii) future operating and
development costs; (iii) future commodity prices; and (iv) a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Use of estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ significantly from those estimates.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash, due to shareholders/related parties and
accounts and other payables approximate their fair values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these
instruments. It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest, price or credit risks
arising from these financial instruments.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to
be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
Earnings per share
The Company follows ASC Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share
(“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents
outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the
computation.
Recent pronouncements
The Company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements through June 30, 2016 and believes that
none of them will have a material effect on the company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the recoverability of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. Since its inception, the Company has been engaged substantially in
financing activities and developing its business plan and incurring startup costs and expenses. As a result, the
Company incurred an accumulated deficit in the amount of $7,641,125 as of June 30, 2016. In addition, the
Company’s development activities since inception have been financially sustained through debt and equity
financing.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital
from the sale of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. These
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this
uncertainty.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.
Overview
Citadel is an energy company engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties. Our
properties are located in the San Joaquin Basin of California. Subject to availability of capital, we strive to
implement an accelerated development program utilizing capital resources, a regional operating focus, an
experienced management and technical team, and enhanced recovery technologies to attempt to increase
production and increase returns for our stockholders. Our corporate strategy is to build value in the Company
through the acquisition of oil and gas leases with significant upside potential, successful exploration and
exploitation and the efficient development of these assets.
Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and
our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable.
Our Operations
Our principal strategy is to focus on the acquisition of oil and natural gas mineral leases that have known
hydrocarbons or are in close proximity to known hydrocarbons that have been underdeveloped. Once acquired, we
strive to implement an accelerated development program utilizing capital resources, a regional operating focus, an
experienced management and technical team, and enhanced recovery technologies to attempt to increase
production and increase returns for our stockholders. Our oil and natural gas acquisition and development activities
are currently focused in the State of California.
In December of 2014, Citadel began a work-over on the Yowlumne #2-26 well including installation of a new pump
in February of 2015. The well has been producing approximately 20- 25 barrels per day (32 degree API quality)
since the beginning of March. In June the well’s pump had a mechanical issue, the company performed well
maintenance in August returning the well to its previous production level. During December of 2015, extremely cold
weather forced the shut-down of the #2-26 well. Citadel plans to return the well to production in the fourth quarter of
2016. Citadel is in the final stages of the CEQA process to permit two additional exploration wells on the
Yowlumne acreage. Recent regulatory changes, including SB4 the State of California’s bill on fracking have
delayed the final approval of our CEQA application. As such we do not expect to have these prospects permitted
until the end of 2016, at which time we will determine when to drill. Both of these exploration wells will be targeting
the Stephens Sands at a depth of 12,000 to 15,000 feet. Citadel currently has a 75% working interest in these
exploration prospects and is the operator.
On July 31, 2015 Citadel acquired approximately 1,100 acres of leases, production facilities and equipment that
encompassed the Kern Bluff Oil Field. As consideration for this acquisition Citadel issued 6,000,000 shares of
common stock and paid $2,000,000 in cash. The transaction was financed via a $3,500,000 one year term loan
from Cibolo Creek Partners, of Midland Texas. In March of 2016, Cibolo Creek Partners converted the $3,500,000
term loan into Series A Participating Preferred Stock.
In December of 2015, Citadel shifted its CAPEX focus to remediation of the existing acquired facilities. At the time
of purchase, the oil at Kern Bluff was being processed by temporary facilities installed by the previous owner. As
production increased in September, it quickly became apparent that these facilities were not capable of processing
the additional volumes of oil and water being produced. The existing permanent facilities were built in the 1970’s
by Gulf Oil and require extensive remediation including new pipe, valves, flanges and tank repair. In order to
facilitate the remediation, Citadel elected to shut down the eight producing wells in early January.

Table of Contents
In June of 2016, Citadel completed its facility upgrades; the new facilities have production capacity of 500-700
BOPD. Citadel began drilling three wells in June and returned to production 9 idle wells. Production from the new
wells continues to increase as the wells clean up. As of August 15, 2016 the Company was producing
approximately 50 barrels of oil per day. The Company is currently working on purchasing and installing a steam
generator, to begin cyclic steaming operations in the 4th quarter of 2016.
Going Concern
The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this filing have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles that contemplate the continuance of the Company as a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
However, the Company is in the exploration stage and, accordingly, has not generated revenues from operations.
As shown on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred an
accumulated deficit in the amount of $7,641,125 as of June 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The future of the Company is dependent upon its ability to obtain financing and upon future profitable operations
from the development of its oil and gas business opportunities.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015
During the six month period ended June 30, 2016 we generated $26,762 from the sale of oil. During the six month
period ended June 30, 2015 we generated $60,141 from the sale of oil.
Operating expenses totaled $650,250 during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 which was an increase
over the period ended June 30, 2015. Operating expenses consisted of lease operating expense, general and
administrative costs, amortization and depreciation, professional fees, and executive compensation. The increase
consisted primarily of an increase in lease operating expenses and professional fees, while general and
administrative costs decreased. During the period ended June 30, 2015 the Company's operating expense totaled
$563,961.
General and administrative fees decreased from $187,714 to $131,057 from the six month period ended June 30,
2015 to the six month period ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to insurance, marketing and
meals and entertainment expenses.
Professional fees increased from $18,236 to $138,259 from the six month period ended June 30, 2015 to the six
month period ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to services provided to the Company for
accounting, consulting and legal.
Executive compensation decreased from $324,177 to $261,699 from the six month period ended June 30, 2015 to
the six month period ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the stock options that fully vested in
2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has established a capital budget for 2016 of $4,000,000 to complete facility remediation, return to
production up to 20 wells and drill up to 5 vertical wells and 1 horizontal well. Given the current state of depressed
oil prices, the Company’s ability to complete this capital budget will be highly dependent on higher oil prices and
access to capital.

Table of Contents
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $136,178 of current assets; of this amount $38,425 was cash. The following
table provides detailed information about the net cash flow for the quarters ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015
as presented in this quarterly report. To date, we have financed our operations through the issuance of stock and
borrowings from related parties and an unrelated third party.
The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

Operating activities
The net loss in the period was greater than the non-cash adjustments to reconcile the changes in the balance sheet
and statement of operations, which is the reason cash used in operating activities was negative.
Investing activities
The net cash used in investing activities consisted of drilling expenses and facility upgrades on oil and gas
properties of $1,408,873 on the Company’s properties.
Financing activities
The net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the preferred stock offering, net of offering
costs, totaling $1,425,000, a note payable totaling 68,736 and note repayments totaling $31,400.
As of March 31, 2016, we continue to use traditional and/or debt financing as well as through the issuance of stock
to provide the capital we need to run our business.
Without cash flow from operations we will require additional cash resources, including the sale of equity or debt
securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We
will require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy to
successfully develop our Kern Bluff Oil Field, exploration drilling at Yowlumne and or acquisitions we may decide
to pursue. If our own financial resources and then current cash-flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our
capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of
additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in
increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could
restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on
terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit
our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

Table of Contents
Our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing, and Joint Venture or Working
Interest partnerships will also be important to our expansion plans. In the event we experience any significant
problems assimilating acquired assets into our operations or cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our
strategic plan, we may have to reduce the growth of our operations. This may materially impact our ability to
increase revenue and develop our assets.
Contractual Obligations
An operating lease for rental office space was entered into beginning March 1, 2013 for two years at $2,150 per
month. The original lease was amended to include additional space at a price of $1,100 per month for the same
term.  The original term of the lease expired on March 1, 2015. As such our office lease is now on a month to month
basis at a rate of $3,000 per month.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of the date of this report, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Operation Plan
Our plan is to focus on the acquisition and drilling of prospective oil and natural gas mineral leases. Once we have
tested a prospect as productive, subject to availability of capital, we will implement a development program with a
regional operating focus in order to increase production and increase returns for our stockholders. Exploration,
acquisition and development activities are currently focused in California. Depending on availability of capital, and
other constraints, our goal is to increase stockholder value by finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves
at costs that provide an attractive rate of return on our investments.
We expect to achieve these results by:
•Investing capital in exploration and development drilling and in secondary and tertiary recovery of oil as well as
natural gas;
•Using the latest technologies available to the oil and natural gas industry in our operations;
•Finding additional oil and natural gas reserves on the properties we acquire.
In addition to raising additional capital we plan to take on Joint Venture (JV) or Working Interest (WI) partners who
may contribute to the capital costs of drilling and completion and then share in revenues derived from production.
This economic strategy may allow us to utilize our own financial assets toward the growth of our leased acreage
holdings, pursue the acquisition of strategic oil and gas producing properties or companies and generally expand
our existing operations.
Our future financial results will depend primarily on: (i) the ability to continue to source and screen potential
projects; (ii) the ability to discover commercial quantities of natural gas and oil; (iii) the market price for oil and
natural gas; and (iv) the ability to fully implement our exploration and development program, which is dependent on
the availability of capital resources. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects,
that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production,
or that we will be able to obtain additional funding to increase our currently limited capital resources.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
This item in not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company.
Item 4T. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our Chief Executive Officer, Armen Nahabedian, and our Chief Financial Officer, Philip McPherson evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as
of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation and assessment, Mr. Armen Nahabedian
and Mr. Philip McPherson concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not designed at a reasonable
assurance level and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary
course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other
matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We received notice on or about July 10, 2013 that
the Center for Biological Diversity (“CBD”) had filed a law suit against the County of San Benito regarding the
approval of Project Indian which is described more fully, above, as the “Case”. The Board of Supervisors voted 5-0
in favor of our application to drill 15 exploration wells on our Project Indian lease. The Court approved the petition
in a judgment entered on September 4, 2014, and ruled that Citadel was required to obtain an environmental
impact report before commencing Project Indian. Thereafter, the Court awarded the petitioner $347,969 as
attorney’s fees and costs against the County of San Benito and Citadel, jointly and severally. The Company has
requested a dismissal of its appeal of this decision which was granted as the Court required the Company to post a
bond in which it was unable to qualify for. In October of 2015, the company paid $92,693 to the Center for
Biological Diversity for a share of the attorney’s fees and costs outstanding which satisfied the judgment for
attorney’s fees and costs in full. Currently, the County of San Benito and Company are engaged in litigation
concerning the responsibility for the full-amount of the judgment for attorney’s fees and costs.
On November 4, 2014 voters in the County of San Benito passed Measure J which bans hydraulic fracturing and
other stimulation techniques defined as “high intensity petroleum operations” by the Measure, including steam
injection. The initiative was passed by a count of 8,034 to 5,605. In advance of the initiative passing, the County
preemptively passed an ordinance allowing for exemptions from the application of the Measure in the event the
Measure would result in a taking. A regulatory taking is a situation in which a government regulation limits the uses
of private property to such a degree that the regulation effectively deprives the property owners of economically
reasonable use or value of their property right to such an extent that it deprives them of utility or value of that
property right, even though the regulation does not formally divest them of title to it. Accordingly, Citadel Exploration
Inc. will provide the County of San Benito the ability to compensate the company for the diminished value at the
Indian Oil Field based on the reasonable Unrisked Resource Potential the property would ultimately yield, or allow
Citadel to proceed with full field development and steam injection under the exemption ordinance.  At this time
Citadel has reserved its rights, with respect to the Indian Oil Field, including claims for inverse condemnation.
Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our significant business risks are described in Item 1A. to Part I of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 (filed April 15, 2016) to which reference is made herein.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
Stock Issuances pursuant to Subscription Agreements
In December 2014, the Company approved the issuance of 500,000 common stock shares for engineering, legal,
accounting and marketing services performed in the fourth quarter of 2014.
In March of 2015, the Company approved the issuance of 1,400,000 common stock shares and issued 25,000
shares recorded as a stock payable at December 31, 2014, for the conversion of a $100,000 promissory note, plus
accrued interest of $2,164 and an additional capital investment of $107,835, all at $0.15 per share.
-15-
Table of Contents
In July of 2015, the Company approved the issuance of 6,000,000 common stock shares as partial consideration
for the purchase of the Kern Bluff Oil Field.
In March of 2016, the Company approved the issuance of up to 250,000 Series A Participating Preferred Stock.
The Series A Participating Preferred Stock has a 3 year term, with a 10% coupon. Each share of Series A converts
into 100 shares of the Company’s common stock, equaling a conversion price of $0.20 a share. Additionally the
Series A Participating Preferred Stock has a 2% overriding royalty (ORRI) on the Kern Bluff Oil Field, until
conversion, at which time the ORRI is reduced to 1% in perpetuity. The company issued 38,750 shares to investors
for cash proceeds of $775,000. Additionally the Company converted the $3,500,000 term loan with Cibolo Creek
Partners into 175,000 shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock. Cibolo Creek also subscribed for an
additional 5,000 shares of Series A Participating Preferred Stock for cash proceeds of $100,000.
In June of 2016, the Company issued 32,500 shares to investors for cash proceeds of $650,000.
We believe that the issuance and sale of the above securities were exempt from the registration and prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 by virtue of Section 4(2), Regulation D and/or Regulation S. The
securities were issued directly by us and did not involve a public offering or general solicitation. The recipient of the
securities was afforded an opportunity for effective access to files and records of our company that contained the
relevant information needed to make her investment decision, including our financial statements and 34 Act
reports. We reasonably believed that the recipient, immediately prior to issuing the securities, had such knowledge
and experience in our financial and business matters that she was capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment. The recipient had the opportunity to speak with our management on several occasions prior to her
investment decision. There were no commissions paid on the issuance and sale of the shares.
