The Appellants had pleaded guilty to one charge of Aggravated Robbery contrary to section 311(1) (a) of the Crimes Decree 2009 and were convicted on 17 July 2012. Each of them was sentenced to a term of 3 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years. Subsequently they filed applications for leave to appeal against their sentences.

When their applications for leave came before a single judge of the Court on 14 March 2014 the Appellants indicated that they wanted to abandon their appeals. The Appellants filed their notice of abandonment of appeal on 14 March 2014.

Under those circumstances the applications to abandon the appeals should be granted and the appeals dismissed.
