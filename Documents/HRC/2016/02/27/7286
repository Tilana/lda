<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights 
</p>
<p>focuses on the relationship between extreme poverty and extreme inequality and argues that 
</p>
<p>a human rights framework is critical in addressing extreme inequality. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur provides an overview of the widening 
</p>
<p>economic and social inequalities around the world; illustrates how such inequalities stifle 
</p>
<p>equal opportunity, lead to laws, regulations and institutions that favour the powerful, and 
</p>
<p>perpetuate discrimination against certain groups, such as women; and further discusses the 
</p>
<p>negative effects of economic inequalities on a range of civil, political, economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also analyses the response of the international community, 
</p>
<p>including the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to the 
</p>
<p>challenge of extreme inequality, finding that human rights are absent in the inequality 
</p>
<p>debate and little has been done to follow up on any of the studies or recommendations 
</p>
<p>emerging from the United Nations human rights system. 
</p>
<p> To conclude, the Special Rapporteur proposes an agenda for the future for tackling 
</p>
<p>inequality, including: committing to reduce extreme inequality; giving economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights the same prominence and priority as are given to civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights; recognizing the right to social protection; implementing fiscal policies specifically 
</p>
<p>aimed at reducing inequality; revitalizing and giving substance to the right to equality; and 
</p>
<p>putting questions of resource redistribution at the centre of human rights debates.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>26/3 and is the first report by Philip Alston submitted to the Human Rights Council in his 
</p>
<p>capacity as Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. Poverty and wealth are often discussed as if they have very little to do with one 
</p>
<p>another. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur argues that extreme poverty is directly 
</p>
<p>related to extreme inequality, especially, but not only, in relation to wealth and income 
</p>
<p>distribution within countries. He also argues that international human rights law has much 
</p>
<p>to say about existing inequalities and how they can be reduced in order to eliminate extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty. To date, however, the debate over inequality, which has assumed a new vibrancy 
</p>
<p>in the wake of the publication of Thomas Piketty&#8217;s book <i>Capital in the Twenty-First 
</i></p>
<p><i>Century</i>, has paid very little attention to the relevance of human rights and much of the 
</p>
<p>discussion that has taken place has been far more concerned with the plight of the middle 
</p>
<p>classes than of those living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>3. The international human rights community has largely reciprocated the economists&#8217; 
</p>
<p>neglect by ignoring the consequences of extreme inequality in the vast majority of its 
</p>
<p>advocacy and analytical work. It does so at its peril, however, since a human rights 
</p>
<p>framework that does not address extreme inequality as one of the drivers of extreme 
</p>
<p>poverty and as one of the reasons why over one quarter of humanity cannot properly enjoy 
</p>
<p>human rights is doomed to fail. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report is not, therefore, about the ways in which extreme inequality can 
</p>
<p>be tackled. Many excellent analyses are now becoming available in that regard.1 Nor does 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur seek in this report to survey the range of recommendations that 
</p>
<p>emerges from those analyses. Rather, the goal is to provide answers to two general 
</p>
<p>questions. First, what has the international human rights regime done to address the 
</p>
<p>relationship between extreme poverty and extreme inequality? Second, what might be done 
</p>
<p>to improve the record in this regard? 
</p>
<p><b> II. Defining and measuring inequality 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition and recent figures 
</b></p>
<p>5. Economic inequality can be used to refer to a range of inequalities relating to the 
</p>
<p>distribution of income (from labour or capital) or wealth (such as financial assets or land) 
</p>
<p>between individuals in a society. Economic inequalities are often expressed using the Gini 
</p>
<p>coefficient of inequality, which varies between 0 (expressing perfect equality) and 1 
</p>
<p>(expressing perfect inequality: for instance when one individual owns all the wealth in a 
</p>
<p>society), but there are a multitude of other ways to measure and present economic 
</p>
<p>inequalities.2 The magnitude of the problem of economic inequalities is dependent on what 
</p>
<p>exactly is being measured and how. An indicator measuring only labour income inequality 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Anthony B. Atkinson, <i>Inequality, What Can Be Done?</i> (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard 
</p>
<p>University Press, 2015); Fran&#231;ois Bourguignon, <i>The Globalization of Inequality</i> (Princeton, Princeton 
</p>
<p>University Press, 2015); Joseph Stiglitz, <i>The Great Divide</i> (New York, W.W. Norton and Company, 
</p>
<p>Inc., 2015).

</p>

<p>may be ineffectual if those in the upper quintile or decile derive their income from wealth 
</p>
<p>instead of labour. Measuring wealth inequality by looking at domestic tax data may lead to 
</p>
<p>different results than if wealth distribution is measured by taking only household surveys 
</p>
<p>into account.  
</p>
<p>6. When analysing inequalities, there are many other dimensions of well-being that can 
</p>
<p>be taken into account apart from income and wealth.3 Economic inequalities can be 
</p>
<p>distinguished from what can be termed &#8220;social inequalities&#8221;. Social inequalities may refer 
</p>
<p>to the distribution of, for instance, political power, health, education or housing among 
</p>
<p>individuals in a society. In theory, a society may have health equality, for instance, when 
</p>
<p>every individual has access to the same quality and quantity of health care. Social 
</p>
<p>inequalities and economic inequalities may, and often do, interact with, and reinforce, one 
</p>
<p>another, for instance when individuals with higher incomes or their family members have 
</p>
<p>more political power or access to better education than those with lower incomes.  
</p>
<p>7. Economic and social inequalities are often categorized as &#8220;vertical inequalities&#8221;,4 
</p>
<p>referring to the distribution of something such as income, health or power. Vertical 
</p>
<p>inequalities can be distinguished from &#8220;horizontal inequalities&#8221;, which are group-based 
</p>
<p>differences (describing between &#8220;whom&#8221; the relevant differences occur). Horizontal 
</p>
<p>inequalities may for instance refer to: inequality between men and women, between 
</p>
<p>majorities and minorities, between races, between groups of people with different sexual 
</p>
<p>orientations or between generations. Horizontal inequalities often overlap with vertical 
</p>
<p>inequalities, for instance when women are overrepresented in lower income segments or 
</p>
<p>when a racial minority is underrepresented in political bodies. 
</p>
<p>8. Current income-inequality figures are quite dramatic. According to a 2008 study by 
</p>
<p>the International Labour Organization (ILO), over the past two decades the income gap 
</p>
<p>between the top and bottom 10 per cent of wage earners increased in 70 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>countries for which data was available.5 According to a recent Organization for Economic 
</p>
<p>Cooperation and Development (OECD) study, the gap between rich and poor in OECD 
</p>
<p>countries is at its highest level in 30 years.6 In 2007, the average executive manager in the 
</p>
<p>15 largest firms in the United States of America earned more than 500 times what the 
</p>
<p>average employee in the United States earned, compared with over 300 times in 2003, and 
</p>
<p>similar patterns can be observed in many other countries.7 
</p>
<p>9. One indicator that gives a detailed overview of income inequalities, at least for most 
</p>
<p>countries in the global North, is the World Top Incomes Database 
</p>
<p>(http://topincomes.parisschoolofeconomics.eu). In the United States, in 2012, the top 1 per 
</p>
<p>cent of earners received almost 20 per cent of the national income. The top 10 per cent of 
</p>
<p>earners received almost half of the national income. These figures contrast sharply with 
</p>
<p>those of previous decades in the United States or with figures in other developed countries. 
</p>
<p>In 1973, the top 1 per cent in the United States earned approximately 8 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>(Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission) (2009), pp. 14&#8211;15.<b>

</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Countries</i> (New York, 2013), chap. 1.

</p>
<p>p. ix. 
</p>
<p> 6 Today, the richest 10 per cent of the population in the OECD area earn 9.5 times the income of the 
</p>
<p>poorest 10 per cent; in the 1980s this ratio stood at 7:1 and has been rising continuously ever since. 
</p>
<p>See Federico Cingano, &#8220;Trends in income inequality and its impact on economic growth&#8221;, OECD 
</p>

</p>
<p> 7 See ILO, <i>World of Work</i>, p. xi. </p>


<p>national income and the top 10 per cent earned about 32 per cent. In Sweden, in 2012, the 
</p>
<p>top 1 per cent earned around 7 per cent of the national income, from a low of around 4 per 
</p>
<p>cent in 1981, and the top 10 per cent earned around 28 per cent of the national income, 
</p>
<p>from a low of around 22 per cent in 1984. Income inequality in the United States in 2012 is 
</p>
<p>comparable to income inequality in Colombia in 2010, where the top 1 per cent of earners 
</p>
<p>also received about 20 per cent of the national income. 
</p>
<p>10. In <i>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</i>, Mr. Piketty shows that in 1970 the 
</p>
<p>wealthiest 10 per cent in Europe owned about 60 per cent of all wealth, while in the United 
</p>
<p>States the figure was about 65 per cent. Today, that share has increased by 5 percentage 
</p>
<p>points in both places. In January 2015, Oxfam International presented figures showing that 
</p>
<p>the richest 1 per cent of the world have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2009 to 48 per cent in 2014, with a prediction that it will exceed 50 per cent by 
</p>
<p>2016. Of the remaining wealth, only 5.5 per cent goes to those outside the top quintile.8 
</p>
<p>11. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has developed several 
</p>
<p>indicators that measure social and horizontal inequalities. An inequality-adjusted human 
</p>
<p>development index, calculated for 145 countries, indicates how achievements in the areas of 
</p>
<p>health, education and income are distributed among a population. UNDP also publishes the 
</p>
<p>coefficient of human inequality, which is a calculation of average inequality across the 
</p>
<p>three dimensions mentioned above. UNDP further measures gender inequality in its gender 
</p>
<p>inequality index. Looking at these different indices, which are not always as intuitive as the 
</p>
<p>income indices described above, it becomes clear that many countries do not even come 
</p>
<p>close to the levels of equality in terms of health, education and gender that exist in the more 
</p>
<p>egalitarian countries. Where Norway had an inequality-adjusted human development index 
</p>
<p>value of 0.891 in 2013, indicating a high level of equality in comparison with other 
</p>
<p>countries, the figures in countries such as the United States (0.755), the Russian Federation 
</p>
<p>(0.685), Chile (0.661), India (0.418) and the Central African Republic (0.203) are much 
</p>
<p>lower. The gender-related development index (female to male ratio of the human 
</p>
<p>development index) ranges from very high levels of equality between men and women in 
</p>
<p>Norway (0.997) to a very high level of gender inequality in Afghanistan (0.602).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic inequalities and equal opportunity 
</b></p>
<p>12. Perfect economic equality is not achievable and arguably not desirable, and there is 
</p>
<p>no reason to object to a certain degree of economic inequality if it reflects differences in 
</p>
<p>effort and talent and is instrumental in achieving greater welfare for society as a whole. 
</p>
<p>There does seem to be a consensus, however, that every human being is entitled &#8212; at the 
</p>
<p>very least &#8212; to equal opportunity.9 Two United States Presidents have articulated this 
</p>
<p>principle eloquently. Barack Obama described it as &#8220;the idea that success doesn&#8217;t depend 
</p>
<p>on being born into wealth or privilege, it depends on effort and merit&#8221;.10 In 1860 Abraham 
</p>
<p>Lincoln said: &#8220;When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that 
</p>
<p>he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor, for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See &#8220;Wealth: having it all and wanting more&#8221;, Oxfam Issue Briefing (January 2015), p. 2. 
</p>
<p> 9 &#8220;Although the principle of formal equality is the basis for social and economic interaction in most 
</p>
<p>modern societies, the social consensus on how much inequality of market outcomes is acceptable, 
</p>
<p>differs considerably among societies. But irrespective of cross-country differences in the level of 
</p>
<p>effective inequality, the increase in inequality over time has given rise to growing concerns in many 
</p>
<p>countries about its social and economic repercussions.&#8221; See <i>Trade and Development Report 2012</i> 
</p>
<p>(United Nations publication, Sales No. E.12.II.D.6), p. 32.  
</p>
<p> 10 Barack Obama, &#8220;Remarks by the President on economic mobility&#8221;, Washington, D.C., 4 December 
</p>
<p>2013. </p>


<p>his whole life.&#8221;11 Friedrich Hayek, known for his aversion to government intervention to 
</p>
<p>achieve more equality, wrote approvingly of a demand at the &#8220;height of the classical liberal 
</p>
<p>movement &#8230; that all man-made obstacles to the rise of some should be removed, that all 
</p>
<p>privileges of individuals should be abolished, and that what the state contributed to the 
</p>
<p>chance of improving one&#8217;s conditions should be the same for all&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>13. The problem in many societies is that poor people start the &#8220;race of life&#8221; at a 
</p>
<p>disadvantage and will meet many more hurdles on their way than others.13 The situation of 
</p>
<p>high inequality in many countries today certainly does not conform to the idea of &#8220;fair 
</p>
<p>equality of opportunity&#8221; proposed by John Rawls in <i>A Theory of Justice</i>, who wrote: &#8220;More 
</p>
<p>specifically, assuming that there is a distribution of natural assets, those who are at the same 
</p>
<p>level of talent and ability, and have the same willingness to use them, should have the same 
</p>
<p>prospects of success regardless of their initial place in the social system, that is, irrespective 
</p>
<p>of the income class into which they are born.&#8221;14 
</p>
<p>14. From the perspective of equality of opportunity, it is problematic if extreme economic 
</p>
<p>inequalities begin at birth. Mr. Piketty has shown that for those born in France between 1910 
</p>
<p>and 1960, &#8220;the top centile of the income hierarchy consisted largely of people whose primary 
</p>
<p>source of income was work&#8221;. For those born in France in the 1970s, and even more for those 
</p>
<p>born later, things are different, however. Mr. Piketty has written that the &#8220;top centile of the 
</p>
<p>social hierarchy in France today are likely to derive their income about equally from inherited 
</p>
<p>wealth and their own labor&#8221;. Even more problematic is Mr. Piketty&#8217;s finding that nearly one-
</p>
<p>sixth of those born in France today &#8220;will receive an inheritance larger than the amount the 
</p>
<p>bottom half of the population earns through labor in a lifetime. (And this group largely 
</p>
<p>coincides with the half of the population that inherits next to nothing).&#8221;15 
</p>
<p>15. In principle, economic inequalities that begin at birth can be corrected during one&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>lifetime. But research has shown that starting life at an economic disadvantage makes it 
</p>
<p>much more likely that one also ends life at an economic disadvantage.16 A study based on 
</p>
<p>data from a subset of OECD countries found that intergenerational mobility differs 
</p>
<p>strikingly between countries:  
</p>
<p>In countries like Finland, Norway, and Denmark the tie between parental economic 
</p>
<p>status and the adult earnings of children is weakest: less than one fifth of any 
</p>
<p>economic advantage or disadvantage that a father may have had in his time is passed 
</p>
<p>on to a son in adulthood. In Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States 
</p>
<p>roughly 50 percent of any advantage or disadvantage is passed on.17

</p>
<p> 13 &#8220;Income inequality specifically is one of the most visible aspects of a broader and more complex 
</p>
<p>issue, one that entails inequality of opportunity. This is a universal challenge that the whole world 
</p>
<p>must address.&#8221; (See the synthesis report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;The road to dignity by 
</p>
<p>2030: ending poverty, transforming all lives and protecting the planet&#8217;&#8221; (A/69/700, para. 68).)

</p>
<p> 16 &#8220;The gap between formal and real equality of opportunities has deep economic roots and far-reaching 
</p>
<p>economic consequences. Inequality that begins in the cradle is not easily redressed through social 
</p>
<p>mobility.&#8221; (See <i>Trade and Development Report 2012</i>, p. 40.) 
</p>
<p> 17 See Miles Corak, &#8220;Income inequality, equality of opportunity, and intergenerational mobility&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>Discussion Paper No. 7520 (Bonn, Institute for the Study of Labor, 2013), p. 4. </p>


<p>The implications of this phenomenon for a country with relatively low levels of 
</p>
<p>intergenerational mobility, such as the United States, was explained in intuitive terms in 
</p>
<p>2012 by a leading economist: &#8220;The chance of a person who was born to a family in the 
</p>
<p>bottom 10 percent of the income distribution rising to the top 10 percent as an adult is about 
</p>
<p>the same as the chance that a dad who is 5&#8217;6&#8221; tall having a son who grows up to be over 
</p>
<p>6&#8217;1&#8221; tall. It happens, but not often.&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>16. The differences in intergenerational economic mobility between countries are not 
</p>
<p>random. Studies have shown a clear negative relationship between economic inequalities in 
</p>
<p>a country and intergenerational earnings mobility.19 Alan Krueger has called this the &#8220;Great 
</p>
<p>Gatsby curve&#8221;. Joseph Stiglitz has written that the ideal of equal opportunity is increasingly 
</p>
<p>a myth in many countries and that the decline in opportunity has gone hand in hand with 
</p>
<p>growing inequality.20  
</p>
<p><b> C. Inequality and political power 
</b></p>
<p>17. In all modern democracies, laws, regulations and institutions influence, and are 
</p>
<p>influenced by, the distribution of economic and other forms of power. Economic 
</p>
<p>inequalities are not only the result of market forces, but equally of political forces that 
</p>
<p>affect laws, regulations and institutions.21 A full understanding of economic inequalities 
</p>
<p>therefore requires an examination of the exercise of political power.  
</p>
<p>18. Democracy and civil and political rights are closely linked to the equal division of 
</p>
<p>economic and other factors that are crucial for well-being. Amartya Sen famously argued 
</p>
<p>that democracy and the upholding of related civil and political rights, such as freedom of 
</p>
<p>the press and the right to vote, are connected to the non-occurrence of famines. He 
</p>
<p>suggested that &#8220;India&#8217;s success in eradicating famine is not matched by a similar success in 
</p>
<p>&#8230; relieving inequalities in gender relations&#8221;. According to Mr. Sen, deprivations such as 
</p>
<p>gender inequality &#8220;call for deeper analysis, and for a greater and more effective use of mass 
</p>
<p>communication and political participation &#8211; in sum, for a fuller practice of democracy&#8221;.22 
</p>
<p>The existence of a democracy and the right to participate in the political process do not 
</p>
<p>guarantee equal opportunity and more equal outcomes. As other authors have argued, the 
</p>
<p>correlative human rights obligations necessary to &#8220;constitute democracy and ensure that it 
</p>
<p>functions properly&#8221; include more than just the right to vote: the State &#8220;may need to take 
</p>
<p>positive steps to protect individuals against other individuals&#8217; interference with the right.&#8221;23 
</p>
<p>19. A major problem in both developing and developed countries is the capture of the 
</p>
<p>political process by powerful groups, and the exclusion of others, leading to laws, 
</p>
<p>regulations and institutions that favour the powerful. Economic inequality is often 
</p>
<p>accompanied by political inequality, meaning that not all citizens are able to equally 
</p>
<p>exercise their democratic rights.24 According to Oxfam, many people around the world

</p>
<p> 24 &#8220;Only some Americans fully exercise their rights as citizens, and they usually come from the more 
</p>
<p>advantaged segments of society. Those who enjoy higher incomes, more occupational success, and 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>believe that laws and regulations are designed to benefit the rich.25 According to Mr. 
</p>
<p>Stiglitz, in the context of the United States, government plays a double role in current 
</p>
<p>economic inequality: &#8220;It is partly responsible for the inequality in before-tax-distribution of 
</p>
<p>income, and it has taken a diminished role in &#8216;correcting&#8217; this inequality through 
</p>
<p>progressive tax and expenditure policies.&#8221;26  
</p>
<p>20. Inequalities, political capture and the exercise of civil and political rights are closely 
</p>
<p>connected. According to the World Bank, &#8220;unequal distributions of control &#8230; of political 
</p>
<p>influence perpetuate institutions that protect the interests of the most powerful, sometimes 
</p>
<p>to the detriment of the personal and property rights of others&#8221;.27 Writing about the United 
</p>
<p>States, where income inequality is at a historic high,28 Mr. Stiglitz has argued that the right 
</p>
<p>to participate in the democratic process remains effectively unfulfilled for many poor 
</p>
<p>Americans: &#8220;While the days of outright exclusion from the voting process are mostly 
</p>
<p>behind us in the United States, there remains a steady stream of initiatives to limit 
</p>
<p>participation, invariably targeting the poor and less well connected. &#8230; The result is that one 
</p>
<p>in four of those eligible to vote &#8212; 51 million Americans or more &#8212; are not registered.&#8221;29 
</p>
<p>Paul Krugman has written that &#8220;extreme concentration of income is incompatible with real 
</p>
<p>democracy&#8221;.30  
</p>
<p>21. Economic inequalities seem to encourage political capture and the unequal 
</p>
<p>realization of civil and political rights. High levels of economic inequalities &#8220;may create 
</p>
<p>institutions that maintain the political, economic and social privileges of the elite and lock 
</p>
<p>the poor into poverty traps from which it is difficult to escape&#8221;.31 This vicious cycle may be 
</p>
<p>broken when civil and political rights are enjoyed more equally, as illustrated by the case of 
</p>
<p>Chile. Under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet during the 1970s and 1980s, income 
</p>
<p>inequality worsened, then improved after democracy was reinstated (although it is still 
</p>
<p>higher than it was in the 1960s or early 1970s).32 Another example is Rwanda, where 
</p>
<p>gender equality is enshrined in the Constitution and a quota system has contributed to more 
</p>
<p>than half of the members of Parliament being women, making it the only country in the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>the highest levels of formal education, are the ones most likely to participate in politics and make 
</p>
<p>their needs and values known to government officials.&#8221; See Task Force on Inequality and American 
</p>
<p>Democracy, &#8220;American democracy&#8221;, p. 5. 
</p>
<p> 25 &#8220;A survey in six countries (Spain, Brazil, India, South Africa, the UK and the US) showed that a 
</p>
<p>majority of people believe that laws are skewed in favor of the rich &#8211; in Spain eight out of 10 people 
</p>
<p>agreed with this statement. Another recent Oxfam poll of low-wage earners in the US reveals that 
</p>
<p>65 percent believe that Congress passes laws that predominantly benefit the wealthy.&#8221; See Oxfam,

<p>world with more female than male members of parliament.33 After the introduction of the 
</p>
<p>quota system, the Rwandan Parliament passed legislation to enhance gender equality, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;including several laws aimed at preventing and punishing gender-based violence, laws 
</p>
<p>granting more extensive property rights to women and key legislation on women in the 
</p>
<p>workforce.&#8221;34  
</p>
<p>22. The protection of core labour rights, such as the rights to freedom of association and 
</p>
<p>collective bargaining, is also essential for a more equal division of power and the reduction 
</p>
<p>of economic inequalities. While it is very difficult to measure the causal relationship 
</p>
<p>between the fulfilment of those core labour rights and economic inequalities, various 
</p>
<p>studies point to a relationship between the lack of protection of core labour rights and 
</p>
<p>deunionization and between deunionization and growing wage inequality. The authors of a 
</p>
<p>recent study note: &#8220;The neoliberal paradigm in the early 1980s created an extremely 
</p>
<p>negative environment for unions with the abandonment of full-employment policies. Since 
</p>
<p>that time, labor laws across the world have become much less union friendly, and 
</p>
<p>unionizing new establishments has become harder.&#8221;35  
</p>
<p>23. A sizeable amount of literature sets out the relationship between deunionization and 
</p>
<p>wage inequality. The authors of a World Bank study on the economic effect of adopting or 
</p>
<p>enforcing the two core labour rights mentioned above reported &#8220;very robust&#8221; findings that 
</p>
<p>unions compress wage inequality. In particular, they found that the wage differentials 
</p>
<p>between skilled and unskilled workers were reduced when unions were present.36 This is 
</p>
<p>consistent with another study, in relation to the United States, in which the authors 
</p>
<p>concluded: <b> 
</b></p>
<p>When individual union membership is considered, union decline accounts for a fifth 
</p>
<p>of the growth in men&#8217;s earnings inequality. Adding normative and threat effects of 
</p>
<p>unions on nonunion pay increases the effect of union decline on wage inequality 
</p>
<p>from a fifth to a third. By this measure, the decline of the U.S. labor movement has 
</p>
<p>added as much to men&#8217;s wage inequality as has the relative increase in pay for 
</p>
<p>college graduates.37  
</p>
<p>A 2013 study about Turkey shows that the fall of unionization in that country resulted in 
</p>
<p>higher wage inequality during the period 1980&#8211;2008.38 Also relevant is the evidence that 
</p>
<p>not only does deunionization affect wage inequality, but wage inequality also affects 
</p>
<p>unionization.39<b>

<p><b> D. Discrimination and inequalities 
</b></p>
<p>24. Vertical and horizontal inequalities, including economic inequalities, are often 
</p>
<p>closely related to discrimination. In many countries, the poorest sector of the population 
</p>
<p>coincides with social and ethnic groups that experience discrimination. It is therefore 
</p>
<p>possible that levels of economic inequality in many countries would be lower today in the 
</p>
<p>absence of discrimination.40 When dealing with economic inequalities, we should therefore 
</p>
<p>pay specific attention to the overlap between economic inequalities and group-based 
</p>
<p>inequalities (horizontal inequalities), because they can indicate discrimination as an 
</p>
<p>important cause of inequality.41 As Mr. Stiglitz has written: &#8220;One of the most invidious &#8212; 
</p>
<p>and hardest to eradicate &#8212; sources of inequality is discrimination, both ongoing 
</p>
<p>discrimination and the legacy of past discrimination.&#8221;42 
</p>
<p>25. Although many forms of discrimination are inherently unjust, the correlation 
</p>
<p>between gender-based discrimination and economic inequalities deserves special mention 
</p>
<p>since it potentially affects half of the world&#8217;s population. While both men and women may 
</p>
<p>experience myriad inequalities, based on factors such as their race, ethnicity, sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation or disability, gender-based discrimination is too often seen to be almost 
</p>
<p>exclusively a women&#8217;s problem. In its <i>World Development Report 2012</i>, the World Bank 
</p>
<p>describes the forms of discrimination that still exist in many countries and that directly 
</p>
<p>affect economic inequality between men and women. According to the World Bank, men 
</p>
<p>and women still have different ownership rights in at least nine countries, and in many 
</p>
<p>countries, women and girls still have fewer inheritance rights than men and boys.43 In 
</p>
<p>addition, women continue to fare badly in the labour market generally. A stocktaking by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) 
</p>
<p>shows that almost 80 countries maintain restrictions on the types of work that women are 
</p>
<p>permitted to undertake. Also according to UN-Women, at the global level, women&#8217;s labour 
</p>
<p>force participation rates have stagnated since the 1990s. Currently, only half of women are 
</p>
<p>in the labour force compared to more than three quarters of men. Despite considerable 
</p>
<p>regional variations, nowhere has this gender gap been eliminated: globally, women earn on 
</p>
<p>average 24 per cent less than men. In one study of four countries, lifetime income gaps 
</p>
<p>between women and men were estimated to be between 31 and 75 per cent.44 
</p>
<p><b> E. Detrimental effects of economic inequalities on the enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. It is clear that economic inequalities severely affect a range of civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>27. Economic inequalities can threaten the right to life, liberty and security of the 
</p>
<p>person. A 2009 study using data from 162 countries for the years 1980&#8211;2004 found robust 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 40 &#8220;One interpretation of these findings is that between-group differences account for, and possibly 
</p>
<p>explain, a non-negligible portion of overall inequality.&#8221; See World Bank, <i>World Development Report 
</i></p>
<p><i>2006</i>, p. 43. 
</p>
<p> 41 &#8220;The issue has particular salience when it involves groups, as the influence of social norms and 
</p>
<p>discrimination come to the fore, and the arguments that outcomes may reflect choice have less

<p>support for the relationship between income inequality and personal integrity rights 
</p>
<p>violations across the whole sample of countries.45 A 2011 study showed a strong 
</p>
<p>association between income inequality and homicide rates based on data from 33 rich and 
</p>
<p>middle-income countries.46 One overview study concluded that research &#8220;has consistently 
</p>
<p>linked income inequality with crime, namely intentional homicides and robbery&#8221;.47  
</p>
<p>28. Economic inequalities, especially when extreme, can also be closely linked to social 
</p>
<p>unrest and conflict.48 The Secretary-General has noted that when people perceive inequality 
</p>
<p>to be unfair and excessive, protests and social unrest can result, such as those seen around 
</p>
<p>the world in recent years (see A/67/394, para. 26). A study on poverty and inequality found 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;high levels of interlocking inequalities may undermine the realization of civil, 
</p>
<p>political and social rights; they may raise the level of crime and plunge societies into 
</p>
<p>conflict&#8221;.49 ILO, in its <i>World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2015</i>, stated that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;rising inequalities have undermined trust in government, with a few exceptions&#8221; and that 
</p>
<p>significant falls in trust &#8220;in particular if they accompany stagnant or declining incomes, can 
</p>
<p>contribute to social unrest, as several countries in the Middle East have demonstrated, with 
</p>
<p>knock-on effects on social conditions, growth and employment dynamics&#8221;. Even in ancient 
</p>
<p>times, Plato argued that &#8220;if a state is to avoid &#8230; civil disintegration &#8230; extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>wealth must not be allowed to rise in any section of the citizen-body, because both lead to 
</p>
<p>disasters&#8221;.50  
</p>
<p>29. Economic inequalities not only impair civil and political rights but also negatively 
</p>
<p>affect the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. A good example is the right to 
</p>
<p>health. According to the World Bank, &#8220;infants from poorer families and children from rural 
</p>
<p>areas are more likely to die than their peers from richer families and urban areas&#8221; and the 
</p>
<p>poor are &#8220;considerably less likely than the non-poor to have access to high-impact health 
</p>
<p>services, such as skilled delivery care, antenatal care, and complementary feeding.&#8221;51 The 
</p>
<p>Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission found that &#8220;people from lower occupational classes who 
</p>
<p>have less education and income tend to die at younger ages and to suffer, within their 
</p>
<p>shorter lifetimes, a higher prevalence of various health problems&#8221; and that &#8220;these 
</p>
<p>differences in health conditions do not merely reflect worse outcomes for people at the very 
</p>
<p>bottom of the socio-economic scale but extend to people throughout the socio-economic 
</p>
<p>hierarchy, i.e. they display a &#8216;social gradient&#8217;&#8221;.52 The World Health Assembly, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution WHA62.14, has also affirmed the recommendation of the Commission on Social 
</p>
<p>Determinants of Health on the need &#8220;to tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money 
</p>
<p>and resources&#8221;.

<p> 48 In a recent report, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean noted that a 
</p>
<p>decline in economic disparities may not necessarily lead to less social unrest and conflict. &#8220;Chile and 
</p>
<p>Brazil, which have brought polarization and poverty down, have recently been hit by expressions of 
</p>
<p>social unrest. One possibility is that in some of the countries of the region, declining polarization and 
</p>
<p>poverty have boosted the sense of identification with the middle class and fed higher expectations, 
</p>
<p>which could lead to conflicts if not met.&#8221; (See <i>Social Panorama of Latin America</i>, p. 106).

<p>30. Studies have demonstrated the negative effect of income inequality upon the right to 
</p>
<p>education.53 A 2014 study published by OECD showed that &#8220;increased income disparities 
</p>
<p>depress skills development among individuals with poorer parental education background, 
</p>
<p>both in terms of the quantity of education attained (e.g. years of schooling), and in terms of 
</p>
<p>its quality (i.e. skill proficiency)&#8221; and that &#8220;higher inequality lowers the opportunities of 
</p>
<p>education (and social mobility) of disadvantaged individuals in the society, an effect that 
</p>
<p>dominates the potentially positive impacts through incentives&#8221;.54 Another study showed that 
</p>
<p>the youngest children in Ecuador, irrespective of wealth quintile or education of their 
</p>
<p>parents, performed broadly as well as their comparators, but that, as they got older, only 
</p>
<p>those children in the top half of the wealth distribution and with highly educated parents 
</p>
<p>maintained their performance relative to their comparators.55  
</p>
<p>31. Economic inequalities also have an impact on the realization of the right to water. In 
</p>
<p>a 2012 report, the Secretary-General cited an analysis of data from 35 countries in sub-
</p>
<p>Saharan Africa that found that access to improved sources of water varied from 94 per cent 
</p>
<p>among the richest 20 per cent in urban areas to 34 per cent among the poorest 20 per cent in 
</p>
<p>rural areas (see A/67/394, para. 29). In another study, it was found that the &#8220;rate of progress 
</p>
<p>in access to water and sanitation is very uneven among wealth quintiles in many countries, 
</p>
<p>with the poorest two quintiles frequently experiencing lack of improvement while other 
</p>
<p>quintiles experience significant advances&#8221;.56 
</p>
<p>32. It is clear therefore that the most impoverished suffer the most extreme effects of 
</p>
<p>inequality for a variety of reasons. In part, this is because their influence and capacity to 
</p>
<p>exercise rights is diminished relatively, even if not absolutely, as others become wealthier 
</p>
<p>and gain greater political and economic power, and in part because they are more 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to the harms associated with social unrest, crime and violence. 
</p>
<p><b> III. I</b>nternational community&#8217;s response to inequality<b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. In 1999, the authors of a major study concluded that while global inequality was a 
</p>
<p>major problem, it had been largely neglected by traditional investigations into world order. 
</p>
<p>They argued that processes of globalization were exacerbating inequalities both within and 
</p>
<p>among States and eroding the capacity of traditional institutions to manage the resulting 
</p>
<p>threats.57 But it took well over another decade for the challenge of inequalities to appear 
</p>
<p>high on the list of the international community&#8217;s priority concerns. In the outcome

<p>34. In 2014, the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals presented its 
</p>
<p>proposals for the post-2015 development agenda (see A/68/970 and Corr.1). Proposed goal 
</p>
<p>10 is aimed explicitly at reducing inequality within and among countries. The specific 
</p>
<p>targets associated with goal 10 include the following: achieve and sustain income growth of 
</p>
<p>the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average; ensure 
</p>
<p>equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome; and adopt policies, especially fiscal, 
</p>
<p>wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality.  
</p>
<p>35. In December 2014, the Secretary-General presented a synthesis report containing his 
</p>
<p>vision for the negotiations of the new sustainable development goals (A/69/700). In the 
</p>
<p>report, the Secretary-General spoke of gross and intolerable inequalities, and argued that 
</p>
<p>income inequality specifically was one of the most visible aspects of a broader and more 
</p>
<p>complex issue, one that entailed inequality of opportunity. He underlined that, as States 
</p>
<p>implemented the new agenda, they must address inequalities in all areas, agreeing that no 
</p>
<p>goal or target be considered met unless met for all social and economic groups. The 
</p>
<p>defining challenge of the time was to close the gap between the determination to ensure a 
</p>
<p>life of dignity for all, and the reality of persisting poverty and deepening inequality (ibid., 
</p>
<p>paras. 65 and 67&#8211;68). 
</p>
<p>36. Although one of the Open Working Group&#8217;s proposed goals is aimed at reducing 
</p>
<p>inequalities, the Special Rapporteur has observed that human rights norms are almost 
</p>
<p>absent from the proposal (see A/69/297, paras. 45&#8211;49). In his synthesis report the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General attributed far greater importance to them, although he did not explicitly 
</p>
<p>discuss the relationship between inequalities and human rights. The link was however 
</p>
<p>acknowledged in statements calling for a future free from poverty and built on human 
</p>
<p>rights, equality and sustainability, a post-2015 agenda built on the principles of human 
</p>
<p>rights and the rule of law, equality and sustainability, and again in the linking of the 
</p>
<p>challenges of reinforcing human rights, equality and sustainability (see A/69/700, paras. 18, 
</p>
<p>49 and 82). More generally, the Secretary-General underscored the need to continue to 
</p>
<p>remedy the policy incoherence between current modes of international governance in 
</p>
<p>matters of trade, finance and investment on the one hand, and the norms and standards for 
</p>
<p>labour, the environment, human rights, equality and sustainability on the other (ibid., para. 
</p>
<p>95). He also acknowledged an indirect link between human rights and inequality by 
</p>
<p>juxtaposing the value of dignity with deepening inequality, thus implying that inequality 
</p>
<p>undermined human dignity. 
</p>
<p>37. The United Nations has not been alone in recognizing the threat posed by the 
</p>
<p>dramatic growth in inequalities. The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund 
</p>
<p>(IMF) has warned consistently of the seriousness of the problem. At the Fund&#8217;s annual 
</p>
<p>meeting in 2014 she said: &#8220;There has been a staggering rise in inequality &#8212; 7 out of 10 
</p>
<p>people in the world today live in countries where inequality has increased over the last three 
</p>
<p>decades. And yet, we know that excessive inequality saps growth, inhibits inclusion, and 
</p>
<p>undermines trust and social capital.&#8221;58 In February 2014, the Executive Board of IMF 
</p>
<p>discussed a staff paper on fiscal policy as the primary tool for Governments to affect 
</p>
<p>income distribution, including &#8220;options for reform of expenditure and tax policies to help 
</p>
<p>achieve distributive objectives efficiently in a manner consistent with fiscal sustainability 
</p>
<p>and recent evidence on how fiscal policy measures can be designed to mitigate the impact 
</p>
<p>of fiscal consolidation on inequality&#8221;.59

</p>
<p> 59 See IMF, <i>Annual Report 2014: From Stabilization to Sustainable Growth</i> (2014), p. 37. </p>


<p>38. The World Bank has also been active on this front. In its <i>Annual Report 2014</i> it 
</p>
<p>noted that &#8220;rising inequality in many countries is harmful to economic stability and the 
</p>
<p>sustainability of growth, but well-designed policies can reduce inequality without hurting 
</p>
<p>growth&#8221;. In January 2015, the Bank&#8217;s Chief Economist suggested that the &#8220;deep and 
</p>
<p>pervasive inequality that exists today can only be condemned&#8221;. He recalled that the annual 
</p>
<p>income of the world&#8217;s 50 wealthiest people was close to the total income of the poorest 1 
</p>
<p>billion, a figure that he characterized as &#8220;a collective failure&#8221;. He called for the 
</p>
<p>consideration of &#8220;policies and interventions to curb such extreme inequality&#8221;, which he said 
</p>
<p>must be done &#8220;not only out of a sense of justice, but also because, in a world afflicted with 
</p>
<p>such extreme disparities, its poorest residents lose their voice, even when they have the 
</p>
<p>right to vote. Extreme inequality is, ultimately, an assault on democracy.&#8221;60 
</p>
<p>39. It seems clear, however, that the deeply expressed concerns about the consequences 
</p>
<p>of inequality are not in fact bringing the sort of deep changes that would be required in the 
</p>
<p>policies of such institutions. For the most part, the response seems to involve the tweaking 
</p>
<p>of traditional policies rather than any change in the fundamental priorities underlying the 
</p>
<p>work of those institutions. This makes it all the more important to inquire into the role that 
</p>
<p>could or should be played by human rights bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. United Nations human rights bodies and inequality 
</b></p>
<p>40. Economic inequalities have long been a focus of analysis within the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights system. But despite the various reports by different special rapporteurs calling 
</p>
<p>attention to the problems associated with extreme inequality, little has been done to follow 
</p>
<p>up on any of the studies or recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. In 1992, the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination and Protection of Minorities on the realization of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, Danilo T&#252;rk, recommended that a special rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>human rights be appointed. He characterized income inequality as one of the main 
</p>
<p>challenges of the time, and stated that income distribution within States remained 
</p>
<p>distressingly inequitable. The Special Rapporteur lamented the fact that, in the 1980s, the 
</p>
<p>urban working classes and large segments of the middle class had been impoverished, while 
</p>
<p>groups and businessmen associated in one way or another with the internationalization of 
</p>
<p>capital represented the major economic beneficiaries of the previous 10 years. He found 
</p>
<p>that drastic measures to rectify that income injustice were required and that adequately 
</p>
<p>carrying out poverty-reduction programmes and fulfilling economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights throughout society was unthinkable without also redressing current income 
</p>
<p>imbalances. He identified taxation as a central means of redressing existing imbalances of 
</p>
<p>income distribution (see E/CN.4/Sub.2/1992/16, paras. 76&#8211;84). 
</p>
<p>42. In its resolution 1993/40, the Sub-Commission, recalling the report by its Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, stated that it was deeply alarmed that the gap between the rich and the poor had 
</p>
<p>more than doubled over the previous three decades and that it was conscious of the impact 
</p>
<p>of inequitable income distribution on the realization of the rights to health, education, 
</p>
<p>housing, food, environmental quality and other economic, social and cultural rights. Also, it 
</p>
<p>reiterated the fundamental principles of equality of treatment, human dignity, equity and 
</p>
<p>justice. Aware that the relationship between income distribution and growing levels of 
</p>
<p>poverty, as well as the violation of human rights, required further in-depth research and

<p>analysis by the human rights community, the Sub-Commission entrusted Asjb&#248;rn Eide with 
</p>
<p>the task of producing a report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p>in particular economic, social and cultural rights, and income distribution, at both national 
</p>
<p>and international levels. In endorsing the proposal, the Commission on Human Rights, in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 1994/20, called the fair distribution of the benefits of development one of the 
</p>
<p>central purposes of the process of development. 
</p>
<p>43. In a report to the Sub-Commission in July 1994, Mr. Eide focused on the impact of 
</p>
<p>different patterns of income distribution on the enjoyment of human rights and the remedial 
</p>
<p>action to be taken in cases of intolerable levels of income inequality. He did not examine 
</p>
<p>the question of how the enjoyment of human rights affected the structure of income 
</p>
<p>distribution and avoided discussing the causes of inequality because they had already been 
</p>
<p>the subject of an enormous body of literature of an ideological and dogmatic nature. He 
</p>
<p>argued that gaps in income between rich and poor at the national level should be given 
</p>
<p>attention to the same extent as gaps in income between nations (see E/CN.4/Sub.2/1994/21, 
</p>
<p>paras. 12, 14, 18 and 21). 
</p>
<p>44. Mr. Eide attached considerable importance to the policies of international financial 
</p>
<p>institutions and was critical of IMF for adopting the position that it should not concern 
</p>
<p>itself with income distribution. As noted earlier, the position of IMF today differs 
</p>
<p>significantly. Mr. Eide criticized the role played by international financial institutions in 
</p>
<p>reducing the power of the State, which he considered to have an essential role to play in 
</p>
<p>ensuring equity in income distribution. In reflecting on the obligations of States in relation 
</p>
<p>to efforts to reduce income inequality, Mr. Eide called for, inter alia, policies to ensure 
</p>
<p>access to land and other productive assets; the provision of public services and other 
</p>
<p>benefits as well as equality of opportunity for all; guarantees of non-discrimination in 
</p>
<p>employment; the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women; and the provision of a functioning system of taxation (ibid., 
</p>
<p>paras. 82&#8211;83). 
</p>
<p>45. Subsequent to Mr. Eide&#8217;s report, the Sub-Commission decided to appoint a Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights, in particular 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, and income distribution. Jos&#233; Bengoa was appointed as 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur and produced several reports between 1995 and 1998. He reached the 
</p>
<p>following general conclusions (see E/CN.4/Sub.2/1998/8, paras. 4&#8211;9):  
</p>
<p> (a) The growth in the world economy since 1987 has been accompanied by a 
</p>
<p>marked negative distribution of income at both the international and national levels;  
</p>
<p> (b)  When income distribution begins to be concentrated in the hands of the few, 
</p>
<p>relative poverty increases, as does extreme poverty, both in the developed and developing 
</p>
<p>world; 
</p>
<p> (c) Bad income distribution, when accompanied by economic growth, causes 
</p>
<p>explosive social situations;  
</p>
<p> (d) Income distribution is very closely linked to the full enjoyment and 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights and persistently bad distribution of income is also the cause of 
</p>
<p>persistent violations of human rights; intolerable degrees of income inequality constitute a 
</p>
<p>violation of the norms of national and international coexistence and therefore of the rights 
</p>
<p>of persons;  
</p>
<p> (e) Income distribution should become an economic and social indicator used by 
</p>
<p>international financial institutions and other international organizations. 
</p>
<p>46. Mr. Bengoa also recommended the creation of a social forum to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>participation of States, international organizations, non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>corporations in discussing how to take economic, social and cultural rights into account in </p>


<p>their policies. The Social Forum was set up in 2002 and recent sessions have focused on the 
</p>
<p>rights of older persons (2014) and on the rights of access to medicines in the context of the 
</p>
<p>right to health (2015). 
</p>
<p><b> V. An agenda for the future for tackling inequality 
</b></p>
<p>47. A number of steps must be taken if the international human rights regime is to be 
</p>
<p>able to respond meaningfully to the threat posed by extreme inequality. Some of these 
</p>
<p>proposals are already well known, while others will require a willingness to step back and 
</p>
<p>acknowledge that the existing system has some deep biases that need to be corrected over 
</p>
<p>time. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rejecting extreme inequality 
</b></p>
<p>48. It must be accepted that extreme inequality and respect for the equal rights of all 
</p>
<p>persons are incompatible. Formal recognition of the fact that there are limits of some sort to 
</p>
<p>the degrees of inequality that can be reconciled with notions of equality, dignity and 
</p>
<p>commitments to human rights for everyone would be an important step forward. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Committing to reduce extreme inequality 
</b></p>
<p>49. Having taken the principled position that there must be limits to inequality, States 
</p>
<p>should then formally commit themselves to policies explicitly designed to reduce, if not 
</p>
<p>eliminate, extreme inequality. Political recognition of the challenge and the holding of a 
</p>
<p>meaningful and sustained public debate on the most appropriate measures to be taken is the 
</p>
<p>starting point for genuine efforts to reduce extreme inequality. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Making economic, social and cultural rights central 
</b></p>
<p>50. A serious commitment to tackle extreme inequality is only possible in the context of 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes that take the concept of economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>seriously and give them prominence and priority equal to that of civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>For all of the achievements that have been accomplished in this domain over the past two 
</p>
<p>decades, the fact remains that economic, social and cultural rights continue to enjoy only 
</p>
<p>second-rank status. There are many contexts in which they are absent, marginalized or only 
</p>
<p>half-heartedly taken on board. In circumstances in which economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights are not a fundamental part of the overall approach, there are no obvious limits to 
</p>
<p>inequality. Mr. Sen is correct in noting that &#8220;the exclusion of all economic and social rights 
</p>
<p>from the inner sanctum of human rights, keeping the space reserved only for liberty and 
</p>
<p>other first-generation rights, attempts to draw a line in the sand that is hard to sustain&#8221;.61 
</p>
<p><b> D. Ensuring social protection floors 
</b></p>
<p>51. It is difficult to accept that a State that has no basic social protection floor in place, 
</p>
<p>whether so called or not, is meeting its most basic obligations in relation to the economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights of its citizens and others. Social protection schemes can have a 
</p>
<p>dramatic impact on reducing inequalities. In Brazil, for example, two programmes, the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 61 See Amartya Sen, <i>The Idea of Justice</i> (Harvard University Press, 2011) p. 385. </p>


<p>Continuous Benefit Programme and the Family Allowance, jointly contributed to a 
</p>
<p>significant fall in Gini inequality between 1995 and 2004.62 The Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>should thus insist on explicit recognition by key actors that there is a human right to social 
</p>
<p>protection. At present, the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of 
</p>
<p>living, proclaimed so proudly in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>subsequently often reaffirmed in binding treaty obligations, are ignored or even challenged 
</p>
<p>by the policies advocated by many of the key actors involved in addressing the plight of the 
</p>
<p>hundreds of millions of persons living in extreme poverty. Many leading international 
</p>
<p>organizations and financial institutions still avoid recognizing those rights in their policies 
</p>
<p>and programmes (see A/69/297, para. 51). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Implementing fiscal policies to reduce inequality 
</b></p>
<p>52. States should reduce inequality by adopting taxation policies that are instrumental to 
</p>
<p>achieving that aim. While preparations for the Third International Conference on Financing 
</p>
<p>for Development Conference, to be held in 2015, and the post-2015 development agenda 
</p>
<p>have brought fiscal policies to prominence in international development debates, the basic 
</p>
<p>principle that tax and development policies go together was already recognized over half a 
</p>
<p>century ago in the Declaration on Social Progress and Development, in which the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly called for the achievement of equitable distribution of national income, utilizing, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, the fiscal system and government spending as an instrument for the equitable 
</p>
<p>distribution and redistribution of income in order to promote social progress (art. 16 (c)).  
</p>
<p>53. There is greater awareness of this principle today, as reflected, for example, in the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General&#8217;s observation that progressive tax policies can play an important role in 
</p>
<p>addressing inequality and poverty and in his exhortation that Governments consider a 
</p>
<p>combination of progressive income taxes and highly redistributive transfers to decrease 
</p>
<p>income inequality and its impact on social development (see A/67/394, para. 56). It cannot 
</p>
<p>be said, however, that current policies in the human rights area have come anywhere near 
</p>
<p>recognizing the fact that tax policy is, in many respects, human rights policy. The 
</p>
<p>regressive or progressive nature of a State&#8217;s tax structure, and the groups and purposes for 
</p>
<p>which it gives exemptions or deductions, shapes the allocation of income and assets across 
</p>
<p>the population, and thereby affects levels of inequality and human rights enjoyment.63 
</p>
<p>Appropriate redistributive measures through taxation and other fiscal policies must be seen 
</p>
<p>as an integral part of a commitment to ensuring full respect for human rights across the 
</p>
<p>entire society. Even IMF now acknowledges that &#8220;extreme caution about redistribution &#8212; 
</p>
<p>and thus inaction &#8212; is unlikely to be appropriate in many cases&#8221;. It also acknowledges that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;on average, across countries and over time, the things that governments have typically 
</p>
<p>done to redistribute do not seem to have led to bad growth outcomes, unless they were 
</p>
<p>extreme&#8221; and that &#8220;the resulting narrowing of inequality helped support faster and more 
</p>
<p>durable growth, apart from ethical, political, or broader social considerations&#8221;.64

</p>
<p> 63 International financial institutions should consider human rights obligations and impact when setting 
</p>
<p>conditions and policies in the area of fiscal policy and, in particular, promote progressive rather than 
</p>
<p>regressive taxation and ensure that all States are granted space to conduct counter-cyclical fiscal 
</p>
<p>policies. See the 2014 report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council (A/HRC/26/28 and Corr.1, paras. 38 and 82 (a)).

<p><b> F. Revitalizing the equality norm 
</b></p>
<p>54. At present, there is no explicitly stated right to equality, as such, under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. In order to ground equality as an organizing theme in this area of law,65 
</p>
<p>human rights bodies and commentators have relied on provisions such as those in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights that proclaim the equal rights of men and women 
</p>
<p>(preamble), that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights (art. 1) and 
</p>
<p>that all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal 
</p>
<p>protection of the law&#8221; (art. 7).66 These provisions have been paired with those dealing with 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination, which is also considered to be one of the central and foundational 
</p>
<p>principles of international human rights law. Virtually all of the core human rights treaties 
</p>
<p>contain explicit provisions on non-discrimination. Also, for the most part, human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies have been careful to emphasize that the norms of equality and non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>require substantive and not just formal equality. 
</p>
<p>55. However, in reading the jurisprudence generated by most of the treaty bodies, it is 
</p>
<p>difficult to escape certain conclusions. First, article 3 of the International Covenants on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, which asserts equal rights for men and women, has perhaps not been given 
</p>
<p>its fullest reading, especially in terms of access to resources. Second, for all of the attention 
</p>
<p>given to affirmative obligations to eliminate discrimination, much of the work of the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies seems unduly confined to a focus on specific violations of non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Linked to this is a reluctance to develop notions of distributive equality, which has been 
</p>
<p>much debated in the literature, and would give an important added dimension to the effort 
</p>
<p>to combat extreme inequality. Third, the right to equality needs to be given greater attention 
</p>
<p>so that it is able to add substantively to the jurisprudence of international human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies in ways that it has not, thus far.67 Finally, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights has to date done all too little in practice, as opposed to its analysis in 
</p>
<p>general comments,68 to explore what might be involved in the prohibitions in article 2 (2) of 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights against discrimination 
</p>
<p>based on social origin, property or birth.69 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 65 Equality is such a central principle in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations that some have argued &#8220;that its absence would make the landscape of human 
</p>
<p>rights look fundamentally different&#8221;. See Jarlath Clifford, &#8220;Equality&#8221;, in Dinah Shelton, ed., <i>The 
</i></p>
<p><i>Oxford Handbook of International Human Rights Law</i> (Oxford, 2013), p. 431. 
</p>

<p>the deeper objectives of the norm and to deal more effectively with the problem of extreme

<p>inequality, have been suggested by Sandra Fredman and are deserving of very careful consideration.

<p>She argues: &#8220;Substantive equality should be developed in a multi-dimensional format, which 
</p>
<p>recognises and addresses the distributional, recognition, structural and exclusive wrongs experienced 
</p>
<p>by out-groups. This yields four main purposes or dimensions of substantive equality: to redress 
</p>
<p>disadvantage; to address stigma, stereotyping, prejudice and violence; to embrace difference and 
</p>
<p>achieve structural change; and to enhance voice and participation.&#8221; See Sandra Fredman, <i>Substantive

<p><b> G. Putting questions of resources and redistribution back into the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights equation 
</b></p>
<p>56. The challenge of putting questions of resources and redistribution back into the 
</p>
<p>human rights equation has several dimensions: 
</p>
<p>(a) The nature of the obligation to ensure respect for civil and political rights has 
</p>
<p>been treated all too often as implying that resource considerations are not relevant in 
</p>
<p>evaluating governmental compliance with the relevant international obligations. In other 
</p>
<p>words, questions of the availability of resources and equality of access to those resources 
</p>
<p>were largely eliminated from the most vibrant parts of the international human rights 
</p>
<p>system, and relegated instead to the minor league discussions about economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights. In the latter context, ironically, they were given overwhelming importance, 
</p>
<p>such that the qualification contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights that a State&#8217;s obligations extended only to the maximum of its available 
</p>
<p>resources is often invoked to excuse basic non-compliance; 
</p>
<p>(b) This artificial marginalization of questions of resources and distribution from 
</p>
<p>the main human rights debates has also been reinforced by the determination of many 
</p>
<p>States to keep the areas of international economics, finance and trade quarantined from 
</p>
<p>human rights. The World Bank can simply refuse to engage with human rights in the 
</p>
<p>context of its policies and programmes, IMF does the same, and the World Trade 
</p>
<p>Organization is little different. When such issues are raised in the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>the argument is invariably heard that it is not the appropriate forum and these matters 
</p>
<p>should be dealt with elsewhere. But when efforts are made to raise human rights in such 
</p>
<p>forums, the refrain is that they should rather be dealt with by the Human Rights Council; 
</p>
<p>(c) Leading human rights non-governmental organizations need to overcome 
</p>
<p>their deep reluctance to bring issues such as resources and the need for redistributive 
</p>
<p>policies into their research and advocacy. The result of their current failure to do so is that 
</p>
<p>for all of their excellent work in exposing the magnitude of a specific range of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations (overwhelmingly violations of civil and political rights), the deeper structures 
</p>
<p>that keep in place policies and systems that do little to address extreme poverty and do even 
</p>
<p>less to address extreme inequalities are effectively left in place, and the status quo is 
</p>
<p>reaffirmed.
