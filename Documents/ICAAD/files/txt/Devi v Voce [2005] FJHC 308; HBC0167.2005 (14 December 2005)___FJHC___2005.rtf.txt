FIRST DEFENDANT

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FIJI

Mr M K Sahu Khan for the Plaintiff
Mrs M Ajala for the Defendants

Date of Minute: 14 December 2005

MINUTE FOR COUNSEL

Counsel appeared before me on 25 November 2005 when this case came up in the callover to be allocated a further hearing date.

Counsel will recall that Mr Sahu Khan advised he had made a proposal for settlement but had received no reply. If necessary he will ask the Court to rely on the medical report which he has filed and assess quantum of damages.

Mrs Ajala replied that she had no instructions and knew nothing of the matter.

I arranged with Counsel to call a judicial conference early in 2006 with a view to hearing the Defendants response to the offer of settlement, or to arrange an early hearing date so a final judgment can be issued.

A copy of this minute will be delivered to Mr M K Sahu Khan and Mrs M Ajala. I have arranged a judicial conference which I require them to attend, fully informed and instructed, on Thursday 16 February 2006, at 9.30am.
