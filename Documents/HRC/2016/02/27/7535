<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to paragraph 29 of Human Rights Council 
resolution 23/17, in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report to the 
Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session on the activities of the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions for the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights in accrediting national institutions in accordance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights (Paris Principles). 
</p><p>2. The report includes activities and achievements since the report issued in 2013 on 
the accreditation of national human rights institutions (A/HRC/23/28). 
3. The statute of the International Coordinating Committee mandates the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation to review and analyse the applications for accreditation 
submitted by national human rights institutions and to make recommendations to the 
Bureau of the International Coordinating Committee on the compliance of applicants with 
the Paris Principles. The Subcommittee comprises one representative of an &#8220;A&#8221; status 
national human rights institution from each of the four regional groupings of the 
International Coordinating Committee: Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific and 
Europe. The members of the Subcommittee are appointed by each regional grouping for a 
renewable term of three years. The members designate the Chair by consensus, from among 
themselves, for a renewable term of one year. In accordance with article 6 of the statute of 
the International Coordinating Committee, meetings of the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
shall be held under the auspices of, and in cooperation with, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).  
4. During the period covered by the report, the Subcommittee members were from 
Canada, France, Mauritania and Qatar. The Chair of the Subcommittee was the chair of the 
national human rights institution of Qatar. In May 2013, a representative of the national 
human rights institution of Germany substituted for a representative of the national human 
rights institution of France, since the latter institution was under consideration for 
reaccreditation during the Subcommittee session. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Improvement of the International Coordinating Committee 
accreditation process 
</b></p>
<p>5. The International Coordinating Committee has introduced various measures to 
improve its accreditation procedures: 
</p>
<p>(a) The review of national human rights institutions, which is aimed at assessing 
their effectiveness and performance, has become more rigorous, as it is based on 
documented evidence provided by the institution under review, as well as on information 
received from civil society organizations and other stakeholders. The review has also 
become fairer, since an appeals procedure was included to give institutions an opportunity 
to challenge the recommendations issued by the Subcommittee on Accreditation; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Subcommittee on Accreditation issues a number of focused and tailored 
recommendations to the national human rights institution under review, even when it 
recommends an &#8220;A&#8221; status; 
</p>
<p>(c) Recommendations by the Subcommittee on Accreditation, once adopted by 
the Committee Bureau, are made public in the report of the Subcommittee, which is posted 
on the International Coordinating Committee website (nhri.ohchr.org). </p>


<p>6. Where, in accordance with article 16.2 of the statute of the International 
Coordinating Committee, it appears that the circumstances of any national human rights 
institution accredited with an &#8220;A&#8221; status may have changed in a way which affects its 
compliance with the Paris Principles, the Chair of the Committee or the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation may initiate a special review of the accreditation of that institution. Further to 
special review, the status of national human rights institution can be either maintained or 
downgraded. 
</p>
<p>7. With regard to flagrant cases, where the independence and credibility of &#8220;A&#8221; status 
national human rights institutions come under threat due to exceptional circumstances, and 
pending the conclusion of the special review process, article 18.2 of the statute of the 
International Coordinating Committee stipulates that where, in the opinion of the Chair of 
the International Coordinating Committee, an exceptional circumstance exists necessitating 
the urgent consideration of immediate suspension of an accredited &#8220;A&#8221; status institution, 
the [Committee] Bureau may decide to immediately suspend accreditation classification of 
that institution and initiate a special review, pursuant to article 16.2. Article 18.3 describes 
the procedure to be followed for the immediate suspension of accreditation in exceptional 
circumstances. As stipulated in article 18.4: 
</p>
<p>for the purposes of article 18.2 and 18.3, an &#8220;exceptional circumstance&#8221; refers to a 
sudden and drastic change in the internal political order of a State such as: a break in 
the constitutional or democratic order; or a declared state of emergency; or gross 
violations of human rights; and is accompanied by any of the following: there is a 
change in the [national human rights institution] enabling legislation or other 
applicable law that is contrary to the Paris Principles; or there is [a] change in the 
composition of the [national human rights institution] that is not undertaken in 
accordance with the established selection and/or appointment process; or the 
[national human rights institution] acts in a way that seriously compromises its 
compliance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>8. In accordance with the accreditation procedure stipulated in article 12 of the statute 
of the International Coordinating Committee, the recommendations of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation are submitted to the Committee Bureau for it to make the final decision on 
the accreditation status of the national human rights institutions reviewed, subsequent to the 
following process:  
</p>
<p>(a) The recommendation made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation is 
forwarded to the applicant;  
</p>
<p>(b) Within 28 days of receipt of the recommendation, the applicant may 
challenge it by submitting, through OHCHR, a written communication to the Chair of the 
International Coordinating Committee; 
</p>
<p>(c) The report of the Subcommittee, including the recommendation, is 
subsequently forwarded for decision to the Committee Bureau. If any challenges have been 
received from the national human rights institution reviewed, the challenges, together with 
the statements of compliance and the summaries prepared by OHCHR of all the documents 
submitted by the institutions concerned, are sent to the Bureau members to enable them to 
assess the validity of the challenges;  
</p>
<p>(d) If within 20 days of receipt of the report and the challenges at least four 
members of the Committee Bureau from no fewer than two regional groups notify the 
secretariat that they support the objection to the recommendation of the Subcommittee on 
Accreditation, the recommendation is referred to the Bureau at its next meeting for 
decision;  </p>


<p>(e) If at least four members from two or more regional groups do not raise any 
objection to the recommendation within 20 days of its receipt, the recommendations will be 
deemed approved by the Committee Bureau;  
</p>
<p>(f) The accreditation decision of the Bureau of the International Coordinating 
Committee is final. 
</p>
<p>9. In accordance with the rules of procedure of the Subcommittee on Accreditation, the 
classifications for accreditation are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;A&#8221; status: Compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;B&#8221; status: Not fully compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>&#8226; &#8220;C&#8221; status:  Non-compliant with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>10. The Subcommittee on Accreditation also welcomes reports from civil society 
organizations on the functioning and efficiency of national human rights institutions under 
review. Such reports are shared with the institutions concerned for their comments or 
clarification. Summaries of all documentation received from institutions are prepared by the 
secretariat and shared with the relevant institutions prior to review. National human rights 
institutions are given one week to point out any factual errors in the summaries. The 
summaries and comments are subsequently brought to the attention of the members of the 
Subcommittee. 
</p>
<p>11. The following may attend meetings of the Subcommittee as observers: 
representatives of the secretariat of the Network of African national human rights 
institutions; the secretariat of the Asia Pacific Forum of national human rights institutions; 
the secretariat of the European Network of national human rights institutions; the Network 
of the Americas; and the representative of the International Coordinating Committee.  
</p>
<p>12. The Subcommittee on Accreditation acknowledges the dedicated professionalism 
demonstrated by OHCHR in assuming the secretariat function and successfully servicing 
two sessions per year. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Accreditation process in 2013 and the first session of 2014 
</b>13. The General Assembly, in its resolution 67/163, encouraged the Ombudsman, 
mediator and other national human rights institutions to request, in cooperation with 
OHCHR, their accreditation by the International Coordinating Committee in order to enable 
them to interact effectively with the relevant human rights bodies of the United Nations 
system.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. By 23 May 2014, the number of accredited national human rights institutions had 
reached 106. Of these, 71 had &#8220;A&#8221; status, 25 &#8220;B&#8221; status and 10 &#8220;C&#8221; status (see annex). 
</p><p>15. During the three sessions under review, the Subcommittee on Accreditation issued 
recommendations emphasizing the need for a clear, transparent and participatory selection 
process of members of national human rights institutions, as required by the Paris 
Principles and by the Subcommittee in its general observations on the International 
Coordinating Committee. It also stressed the importance of the provision of adequate core 
funding by the State to ensure the independence and financial autonomy of such 
institutions. In addition, the Subcommittee recognized the importance of members of 
national institutions being granted immunity against legal liability for actions taken in their 
official capacity. It furthermore stressed the need for greater cooperation by and 
engagement of national human rights institutions with regional and international human 
rights systems. </p>


<p>16. In March 2014, the Subcommittee on Accreditation initiated the practice of 
deliberating in camera, without the presence of OHCHR, which serves as the secretariat of 
the Subcommittee meetings. In accordance with article 6 of the statute of the International 
Coordinating Committee, general meetings of the International Coordinating Committee 
and meetings of the Subcommittee on Accreditation shall be held under the auspices of, and 
in cooperation with, OHCHR. Accordingly, OHCHR ought to be present in decision-
making meetings of the Sub-Committee.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  New applications 
</b></p>
<p>17. During the two sessions of 2013 and the first session of 2014, the Subcommittee 
considered six new applications for accreditation. Further to the Subcommittee&#8217;s 
deliberations, the Office for the Protection of Citizens of Haiti and the Netherlands Institute 
for Human Rights were accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status. The Ethiopian Human Rights 
Commission, the Oman National Human Rights Commission and the National Centre for 
Human Rights of Slovakia were accredited with &#8220;B&#8221; status. The decision on accreditation 
for the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights of Hungary has been deferred to the second 
session of 2014, pending the receipt of clarification from the institution.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Applications for reaccreditation 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Subcommittee on Accreditation reviewed 22 national human rights institutions 
for reaccreditation, from Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Croatia, Egypt, France, Georgia, 
Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Malawi, Mongolia, Paraguay, the Republic of Korea, the 
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine and 
Venezuela.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. The national human rights institutions of Armenia, Croatia, France, Georgia, Ghana, 
Guatemala, Rwanda, Timor-Leste, Togo, Uganda and Venezuela were reaccredited with 
&#8220;A&#8221; status.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Deferrals 
</b></p>
<p>20. The reaccreditation decisions for the national human rights institutions of Albania, 
Afghanistan, Egypt, Germany, Malawi, Mongolia, Paraguay, the Republic of Korea, the 
Russian Federation, Thailand and Ukraine have been deferred to future sessions of the 
Subcommittee on Accreditation, pending receipt of clarification from the institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Special review 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the period under review and in accordance with articles 16.2, 17 and 18 of 
the statute, the Subcommittee on Accreditation conducted a special review of the national 
human rights institutions of Indonesia and Nepal. Further to its deliberations, the 
Subcommittee decided that the national human rights institution of Indonesia should retain 
its &#8220;A&#8221; status. The A special review of the national human rights institution of Nepal has 
been deferred to October 2014.  
</p>
<p>22. In March 2014, the Subcommittee on Accreditation decided to conduct a special 
review of the national human rights institution of Venezuela in October 2014. </p>


<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>23. <b>The Secretary-General commends the Subcommittee on Accreditation for its 
performance and underscores the dedicated and professional support provided by 
OHCHR to its work and in the accreditation process.  
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The Paris Principles and the general observations adopted by the International 
Coordinating Committee which interpret those principles, remain the basis on which 
the Subcommittee accredits national human rights institutions. In order to do so, in 
addition to legislation and other documentation submitted by institutions, the 
Subcommittee invites civil society organizations to provide input on the functioning of  
institutions under review. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>With the enhanced role of &#8220;A&#8221; status national human rights institutions in the 
proceedings of the Human Rights Council, the Subcommittee on Accreditation is more 
vigilant and rigorous in granting &#8220;A&#8221; status, to ensure that only institutions fully 
compliant with the Paris Principles can make use of the benefits granted to &#8220;A&#8221; status 
national human rights institutions in their interaction with the Human Rights Council 
mechanisms, including the universal periodic review process.  
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The role of OHCHR in acting as secretariat for the Subcommittee and in the 
holding of the Subcommittee&#8217;s meetings under its auspices, enhances the credibility of 
the accreditation process before the international and regional human rights systems. 
The presence of OHCHR during the decision-making process is instrumental to 
attesting the compliance of this process with the established rules of procedure, and 
contributes to its transparency, fairness and rigour. 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>National human rights institutions are urged to implement recommendations 
emanating from the Subcommittee on Accreditation with a view to enhancing their 
compliance with the Paris Principles and their effectiveness in discharging their 
mandate. Governments and other stakeholders, including United Nations entities, are 
encouraged to assist the national human rights institutions in implementing those 
recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>Newly established national human rights institutions are encouraged to request 
accreditation by the International Coordinating Committee in order to interact 
effectively with peer institutions as well as the regional and international human 
rights system.  
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>The interdependence and indivisibility of human rights require that the broad 
mandate of national human rights institutions, as set out in the Paris Principles and 
emphasized by the Subcommittee, include the promotion and protection of all rights: 
civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>The Paris Principles require that the composition of national human rights 
institutions and the appointment of their members, by means of election or otherwise, 
ensure the pluralistic representation of social forces (civil society) involved in the 
protection and promotion of human rights. The Subcommittee on Accreditation 
interprets that provision as requiring a clear, transparent, merit-based and 
participatory selection and appointment process. It is recommended that the selection 
and appointment process, be formalized in the legislation establishing national human 
rights institutions and/or in binding administrative guidelines, as appropriate.  
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>The Secretary-General encourages Member States and other stakeholders to 
guarantee through financial contribution the continuation of high-quality servicing of 
the Subcommittee on Accreditation by OHCHR. </b></p>
