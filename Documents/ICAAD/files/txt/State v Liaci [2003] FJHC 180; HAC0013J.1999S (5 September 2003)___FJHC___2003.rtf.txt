IN THE HIGH COURT OF FIJI
AT SUVA
CRIMINAL JURISDICTION

CRIMINAL CASE NO: HAC0013 OF 1999

STATE

v.

AMEO RAMOKOSOI LIACI; and
SAIRUSI UASIRO

Counsel: Mr. P. Bulamainaivalu for State
Mr. N. Vere for Accused Persons

Judgment: 5th September 2003

JUDGMENT

The two assessors are of the view that the two accused persons are not guilty of the offences on the Information. These opinions are based apparently on their doubt about the evidence of Laisenia Dakunituraga and the reliability of the 2nd accuseds interview to the police. Their opinions are not perverse and clearly possible on the facts.

I agree with them and acquit both accused accordingly.
