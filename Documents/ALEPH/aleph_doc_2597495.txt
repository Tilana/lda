Act”). All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this Form 10-Q that
address activities, events or developments that we expect, project, believe or anticipate will or
may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are
based on management’s current belief, based on currently available information, as to the
outcome and timing of future events. Forward-looking statements may include statements that
relate to, among other things, our:
●future financial and operating performance and results;

All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q, regarding our
strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs,
prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in
this Form 10-Q, the words “could,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project”
and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all
forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are
based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on
currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events.
Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the
anticipated future results or financial condition expressed or implied by the forward-looking
statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include but are not limited to:
●the cyclical nature of the oil and natural gas industry;
    
 ●the potential for our oil-company customers to backward-integrate by starting their own well
service operations;
    
 ●the potential for excess capacity in the oil and natural gas service industry;
    
 ●dependence on the spending and drilling activity by the onshore oil and natural gas industry;
    
 ●competition within the oil and natural gas service industry;
●concentration of our customer base and fulfillment of existing customer contracts;
    
 ●our ability to maintain pricing and obtain contracts;
    
 ●deterioration of the credit markets;
    
 ●our ability to raise additional capital to fund future and committed capital expenditures;
●increased vulnerability to adverse economic conditions due to indebtedness;
    
 ●our limited operating history on which investors will evaluate our business and prospects;
    
 ●our ability to obtain raw materials and specialized equipment;
    
 ●technological developments or enhancements;
    
 ●asset impairment and other charges;
    
 ●our identifying, making and integrating acquisitions;
    
 ●our major shareholders and management control over stockholder voting;
3
●loss of key executives;
    
 ●the ability to employ skilled and qualified workers;
    
 ●work stoppages and other labor matters;
    
 ●hazards inherent to the oil and natural gas industry;
    
 ●inadequacy of insurance coverage for certain losses or liabilities;
    
 ●delays in obtaining required permits;
    
 ●ability to import equipment or spare parts into Argentina on a timely basis;
    
 ●regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry;
    
 ●legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to well stimulation;
●future legislative and regulatory developments;
    
 ●foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
    
 ●effects of climate change;
    
 ●volatility of economic conditions in Argentina;
    
 ●market acceptance of turbine pressure pumping technology;
    
 ●the profitability for our customers of shale oil and gas as commodity prices decrease;
    
 ●risks of doing business in Argentina and the United States; and
    
 ●costs and liabilities associated with environmental, health and safety laws, including any
changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof.
For additional information regarding known material factors that could affect our operating results
and performance, please read (1) “Risk Factors” in Part II—Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, as well as
“Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 and (2) “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” in Part I—Item 2 of this Form 10-Q, as well as in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Should one or more of these known
material risks occur, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results,
performance, achievements or plans could differ materially from those expressed or implied in
any forward-looking statement.
We believe that it is important to communicate our expectations of future performance to our
investors. However, events may occur in the future that we are unable to accurately predict, or
over which we have no control. When considering our forward-looking statements, you should
keep in mind the cautionary statements in this Form 10-Q, which provide examples of risks,
uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or any person acting
on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or
referred to in this section and any other cautionary statements that may accompany such forward-
looking statements. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to
update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in
this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q.
You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Each forward-looking
statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement.

ECO-STIM ENERGY SOLUTIONS, INC.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
Note 1 – Organization and Nature of Business
Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a stage technology-driven
independent oilfield services company providing well stimulation, coiled tubing and field
management services to the upstream oil and gas industry. We are focused on reducing the
ecological impact and improving the economic performance of the well stimulation process. We
have assembled technologies and processes that have the ability to (1) reduce the surface
footprint, (2) reduce emissions and (3) conserve fuel and water during the stimulation process.
The Company will focus on the most active shale resource basins outside of the United States,
using our technology to differentiate our service offerings. Our management team has extensive
international industry experience. Our first operation is in Argentina, home to the Vaca Muerta,
the world’s third-largest shale resource basin as measured by technically recoverable reserves.
We also intend to pursue other markets including Mexico, Colombia and the United States or any
other location where we believe we can offer clear advantages and achieve strong returns. The
Company may also explore opportunistic acquisitions and/or joint ventures with established
companies in target markets.
Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”)
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The December 31, 2015
consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include
all the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. However, the Company believes that the disclosures
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In the Company’s opinion, all
the adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for fair
presentation have been included. The results of operations for the six month period ended June
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year
or for any future period. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
herein should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
for the year ended December 31, 2015, a copy of which was filed with the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Principles of Consolidation
We consolidate all wholly-owned subsidiaries, controlled joint ventures and variable interest
entities where the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary. All material
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used in,
but are not limited to, determining the following: allowance for doubtful accounts, recoverability of
long-lived assets and intangibles, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income
taxes and stock-based compensation. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is
acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment
changes.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains deposits in several financial
institutions, which may at times exceed amounts covered by insurance provided by the U.S.
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Company has not experienced any losses
related to amounts in excess of FDIC limits.
9
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue is heavily dependent on three major customers. All revenue is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured as follows:
Well Stimulation Revenue
The Company provides well stimulation services based on contractual arrangements, such as
term contracts and pricing agreements, or on a spot market basis. Revenue will be recognized
and customers will be invoiced upon the completion of each job, which can consist of one or
more stimulation stages.
Under term pricing agreement arrangements, customers commit to targeted utilization levels at
agreed-upon pricing, but without termination penalties or obligations to pay for services not used
by the customer. In addition, the agreed-upon pricing is typically subject to periodic review.
Spot market basis arrangements are based on an agreed-upon hourly spot market rate. The
Company also charges fees for setup and mobilization of equipment depending on the job,
additional equipment used on the job, if any, and materials that are consumed during the well
stimulation process. Generally, these fees and other charges vary depending on the equipment
and personnel required for the job and market conditions in the region in which the services are
performed.
The Company also generates revenues from chemicals and proppants that are consumed while
performing well stimulation services.
Coiled Tubing Revenue
The Company began providing coiled tubing and other well stimulation services in early 2015.
Jobs for these services are typically short term in nature, lasting anywhere from a few hours to
multiple days. Revenue is recognized upon completion of each day’s work based upon a
completed field ticket. The Company charges the customer for mobilization, services performed,
personnel on the job, equipment used on the job, and miscellaneous consumables at agreed-
upon spot market rates.
Field Management Revenue
The Company enters into arrangements to provide field management services. Field
management revenue relates primarily to geophysical predictions and production monitoring,
utilizing down-hole diagnostics tools. Revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced upon
the completion of each job. The service invoices are for a set amount, which includes charges for
the mobilization of the equipment to the location, the service performed, the personnel on the job,
additional equipment used on the job, consumables used throughout the course of the service,
and processing and interpretation of data acquired via down-hole diagnostic tools.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, capital lease obligations and notes payable.
The recorded values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts
payable, and accrued expenses approximate their fair values based on their short-term nature.
The carrying value of capital lease obligations and notes payable approximate their fair value,
and the interest rates approximate market rates.
Functional and Presentation Currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Company’s entities are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional
currency”). The functional currency for the Norwegian and Argentine subsidiaries is the U.S.
Dollar. The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, which is the
Company’s presentation currency.
10
Marketable Securities
Investments in marketable securities are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-
maturity. Our marketable equity investments are classified as trading and their cost basis is
determined by the specific identification method. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on
trading securities are included in net income.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company purchased and sold Argentine bonds
to capitalize its subsidiary in Argentina. This resulted in a gain on the sale of trading securities of
$872,920 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to the
Company taking advantage of the favorable spread in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar
and Argentine Peso.
Net Loss per Common Share
For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the weighted average shares outstanding
excluded certain stock options and potential shares from convertible debt of 4,412,132 and
4,117,964, respectively, from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because these shares
would be anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive warrants of 100,000 for each of the six months ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 were also excluded from the calculation.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated at amounts management expects to collect from outstanding
balances both billed and unbilled (unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized
as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients). Management provides for
probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation
allowance based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. To date, the
Company has not recognized any losses due to uncollectible accounts. Balances still
outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a
charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. The Company evaluated
all accounts receivable and determined that no reserve for doubtful accounts was necessary at
June 30, 2016 and 2015.
Prepaids
Prepaid expenses are primarily comprised of Argentinian value added tax and prepaid
insurance. The prepaid value added tax will be reduced as the Company continues to invoice
customers in Argentina.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value) using the average
method and appropriate consideration is given to deterioration, obsolescence and other factors in
evaluating net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, Plant and Equipment (“PPE”) is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical
cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets for financial reporting purposes. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that
extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. The cost of assets sold or abandoned and the related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gains or losses are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the respective period.
The estimated useful lives of our major classes of PPE are as follows:
11
Leases
Major Classes of PPE
Machinery and equipment
Vehicles
Leasehold improvements
Furniture and office equipment 3-5 years
Estimated Useful Lives
 2-7 years
 5 years
 5 years (or the life of the lease)
The Company leases certain equipment under lease agreements. The Company evaluates each
lease to determine its appropriate classification as an operating or capital lease for financial
reporting purposes. Any lease that does not meet the criteria for a capital lease is accounted for
as an operating lease. The assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lower of
the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets.
Assets under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term.
Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock options, warrants, and restricted stock grants under the fair
value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718. The Company currently uses the straight-line
amortization method for recognizing stock option and restricted stock compensation costs. The
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
made to our employees, directors or outside service providers are based on the estimated fair
value of the awards on the grant dates. The grant date fair value is estimated using either an
option-pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price, if
such a price exists. Such cost is recognized over the period during which an employee, director
or outside service provider is required to provide service in exchange for the award, i.e., “the
requisite service period” (which is usually the vesting period). The Company also estimates the
number of instruments that will ultimately be earned, rather than accounting for forfeitures as they
occur.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. ASC Topic 360 requires
the Company to review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be
recoverable. The impairment review includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset or group of assets with their associated carrying value. If the carrying
value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges), an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds
the fair value. If estimated future cash flows are not achieved with respect to long-lived assets,
additional write-downs may be required. The Company evaluated its long-lived assets for
impairment at June 30, 2016 and has determined no impairment is necessary.
Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk
The majority of the Company’s business is conducted with major and independent oil and gas
companies in Argentina. The Company evaluates the financial strength of its customers and
provides allowances for probable credit losses when deemed necessary. The Company derives
a large amount of revenue from a small number of major and independent oil and gas
companies.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of major clients. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, three major customers accounted for approximately 91.2% of our
services revenue. Our accounts receivable, at June 30, 2016 were concentrated, with major
customers representing 92.2%. Pluspetrol, YPF and Madalena represent our largest customers.
12
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method in accordance with
ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income taxes are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which such
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates
on deferred income taxes is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations of the period
that includes the enactment date. In addition, a valuation allowance is established to reduce any
deferred tax asset for which it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized.
The Company is subject to U.S. federal and foreign income taxes along with state income taxes
in Texas. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty
about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately
sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period
during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not
that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or
litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions.
Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with
the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that
exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
Costs,” which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements.
ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. The amendments are to be
applied retrospectively and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption
is permitted. We adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 resulting in
reclassification of short-term debt issuance cost of $185,362 and $185,362 as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 respectively; and long-term debt issuance cost of $169,916 and
$262,597 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.

Note 4 – Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has two stock incentive plans, the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”)
and the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), for the granting of stock-based incentive
awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock, to
employees, consultants and members of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). The
2013 Plan was adopted in 2012 and amended in 2013 and authorizes 1,000,000 shares to be
issued under the 2013 Plan. The 2015 Plan, f/k/a “the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan,” was adopted
in 2014; in 2015 it was amended and 500,000 additional shares were authorized, resulting in a
maximum of 1,000,000 shares being authorized for issue under the modified 2015 Plan. The
2015 Plan was further amended in 2016 to authorize an additional 200,000 shares. Both the
2013 Plan and the 2015 Plan, as amended, have been approved by the shareholders of the
Company. As of June 30, 2016, 18,328 shares were available for grant under the 2013 Plan and
741,000 shares were available for grant under the 2015 Plan.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock
price volatility. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are
expected to be outstanding. The Company determined the initial expected life based on a
simplified method in accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,
giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules, and pre-vesting and post-
vesting forfeitures.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $432,397 and
$814,255, respectively, of stock-based compensation, which is included in cost of services,
selling, general and administrative expense, and research and development in the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Total unamortized stock-
based compensation expense at June 30, 2016 was $1,248,730 and will be fully expensed
through 2019.
Note 5 – Commitments and Contingencies
Capital Lease Obligations
In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company purchased and upgraded equipment from non-related
third parties, investing approximately $3.5 million. In December 2013, the Company sold the
equipment to a related party leasing company, Impact Engineering, AS. Simultaneously, the
equipment package was leased back to Eco-Stim Energy Solutions Argentina SA (“EcoStim
Argentina”), a subsidiary of the Company, as a capital lease for a 60-month period with payments
beginning in February of 2014. The Company agreed to prepay one year of payments in the
amount of approximately $1.0 million and maintain a balance of no less than six months of
prepayments until the final six months of the lease. These prepayments were made prior to
December 31, 2013. Further rent payments are $81,439 per month and commenced on February
1, 2014. The final six months prepaid is shown as other non-current assets in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets with a balance of $488,633.
14
The minimum present value of the lease payments is $3.1 million with a 60-month term and
implied interest of 14%. The next four years of lease payments are scheduled as follows:

Note 6 – Debt
On May 28, 2014 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Convertible Note Facility
Agreement (the “Note Agreement”) with ACM Emerging Markets Master Fund I, L.P. (“ACM”). The
proceeds from the Note Agreement have been used primarily for capital expenditures, certain
working capital needs and approved operating budget expenses.
The Note Agreement allowed the Company to issue ACM a multiple draw secured promissory
note with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $22 million, convertible into the common
stock of the Company (the “Common Stock”) at a price of $6.00 per share at the option of ACM.
The outstanding debt under the facility is convertible immediately and accrues interest at 14%
per annum with interest payments due annually in arrears. The debt can be prepaid in full under
certain conditions after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and matures on the date that is
four years following the Closing Date.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has drawn down the full $22 million available under the Note
Agreement, which was primarily used for capital expenditures, certain working capital needs and
approved operating budget expenses. The balance for accrued interest at June 30, 2016 was
$286,904.
On May 28, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment with ACM. ACM and the Company
agreed to give ACM the ability to have the $2,485,162 interest payment, which was due on May
28, 2015 (the “Deferred Interest”), paid in the form of shares of the Company’s common stock
upon the consummation of a future equity offering, should one occur. On July 15, 2015, the
Company issued 523,192 shares of unregistered common stock at a price of $4.75 per share to
ACM as payment for the Deferred Interest.
All obligations under the Note Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets
of the Company and have subsidiary guarantees and pledges of the capital stock of the
subsidiary guarantors subject to certain terms and exceptions. From time to time, management
has obtained amendments and waivers to the agreement to accommodate and adapt to the
changing business environment. Management believes that the Company will be in compliance
with the amended covenants, but there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve such
compliance. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if
not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants or had obtained any necessary waiver as of June 30, 2016.
15
On October 10, 2014, the Company entered into an equipment purchase agreement for the TPUs
equipment and related spare parts for a total purchase price of approximately $6,500,000, of
which $4,100,000 was financed. The total amount financed, including any accrued interest, was
to become due and payable on April 1, 2015. On March 12, 2015, the Company amended the
agreement to add a blender, two data vans and a manifold at an increased cost of $400,000, and
amended the due date of the final payment to March 31, 2016. The amended agreement provides
for monthly installment payments of $50,000 beginning in May 2015. The second amended
agreement provides for monthly installment payments of $25,000 beginning in April 2016. The
note accrues interest at a rate of 9% per annum from April 1, 2016 until maturity on December 15,
2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a balance of $1,041,458 and accrued interest of
$38,464.
On January 1, 2016, the Company financed its operational insurance premiums with US
Premium Finance for a total of $194,611 at an interest rate of 5.87%. As of June 30, 2016, the
Company had a balance of $98,493 and accrued interest of $482.
Note 7 – Subsequent Events
On July 13, 2016, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the
“Agreement”) with FBR Capital Markets & Co. and MLV & Co. LLC (the “Distribution Agents”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company may sell from time to time through the
Distribution Agents shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with an
aggregate sales price of up to $5,801,796 (the “Shares”). Sales of the Shares, if any, will need to
be approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and will be made by any method permitted
that is deemed an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), including sales made directly on or through the
NASDAQ Capital Market, the existing trading market for our common stock or on any other
existing trading market for our common stock, sales made to or through a market maker other
than on an exchange or otherwise, in negotiated transactions at market prices, and/or any other
method permitted by law. Sales of the Shares may be made at market prices prevailing at the
time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, and subject to
such other terms as may be agreed upon at the time of sale including a minimum sales price that
may be stipulated by the Company’s Board of Directors.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the
related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, together with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,”
“us,” the “Company” or like terms refer to Eco-Stim Energy Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
This section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual
results may differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement because of
various factors, including those described in the section titled “Cautionary Statements Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in this Form 10-Q.
Overview
We are a technology-driven independent oilfield services company providing well stimulation,
coiled tubing and field management services to the upstream oil and gas industry. We are
focused on reducing the ecological impact and improving the economic performance of the well
stimulation process. We have assembled proven technologies and processes that have the
ability to (1) reduce the surface footprint, (2) reduce emissions and (3) conserve fuel and water
during the stimulation process. We will focus on bringing these technologies and processes to
the most active shale resource basins outside of the United States, using our technology to
differentiate our service offerings. Our management team has extensive international industry
experience. Our first operation is in Argentina, home to the Vaca Muerta basin, the world’s third-
largest shale resource basin as measured by technically recoverable reserves. We also intend to
pursue other markets that meet our investment criteria, which may include Mexico, Colombia and
the United States as well as other markets and where we believe we can offer clear strategic
advantages and achieve acceptable financial returns. We may also explore opportunistic
acquisitions and/or joint ventures with established companies in target markets.
Our management team has extensive experience in operating well stimulation fleets, coiled
tubing units and other downhole completion equipment, as well as providing “sweet spot”
analysis in shale resource basins using geophysical predictive modeling. We expect to leverage
our management’s experience and historical local relationships in undersupplied markets to
pursue profitable long-term contracts. We expect to compete for business with a limited number
of other service companies based on technical capability, quality of equipment, local experience
and existing relationships rather than solely on price. We also believe that we benefit from our
association with our largest investors, which give us strategic advantages in emerging markets
such as Argentina.
Results of Operations
For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $1,647,840 to $2,337,579 from
$3,985,419 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a
reduction in well simulation services of $1,498,024, coiled tubing services of $294,096, offset by
an increase of $144,280 in field services. The decrease in activity was related to (1) uncertainty
surrounding the energy policy of the newly elected president of Argentina; (2) the depressed
international oil price which reduced global capital expenditures for oil and gas companies; (3)
the departure of the CEO of our largest customer; and (4) an oversupply of equipment which
reduced pricing for our services.
Cost of services decreased $1,369,307 to $2,470,038 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $3,839,345 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to lower activity levels during the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of
2015 and certain cost reduction efforts.
Our selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $353,284 to $1,579,808 for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $1,933,092 for the three months ended June 30,
2015. This decrease was mainly as a result of lower costs associated with professional,
consulting, travel expenses, labor and benefits cost of $407,915; partially offset by an increase in
rent, administrative office costs and marketing expenses of $45,722; and insurance costs of
$8,909. Overall, we have focused on reducing costs to better match the lower activity levels.
17
Research and development for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $145,457 to
$106,359 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $251,816 for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. Research and development includes the cost associated with research
activities of fiber optics technology and latest generation turbine-powered pressure pumping
technology. The research efforts around the initial reconfiguration of the turbine powered
pressure pumping units was substantially completed during the second quarter.
Net other expense decreased $39,786 to $560,482 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $600,268 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, This decrease was primarily
due to a higher interest income of $466,977: lower interest expenses, foreign currency and other
expenses of $160,216; offset by the absence of the gain on sale of trading securities which was
$587,407 for the second quarter of 2015.
For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $2,705,628 to $4,171,484 from
$6,877,112 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a
reduction in well simulation services of $2,743,648, field services of $47,075, offset by an
increase of $85,095 in coiled tubing services.
Cost of services decreased $2,292,717 to $4,706,165 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $6,998,882 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to lower activity levels during the six months ended June 2016 compared to the six months
ended June 2015.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $356,875 to $3,153,072 for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $3,509,947. This decrease was mainly as a result of
lower costs associated with professional, consulting, travel expenses of $240,895; decreased
stock compensation of $237,956 partially offset by rent, administrative office costs and marketing
expenses of $85,460; labor and benefits cost $13,059 and insurance costs of $23,457. Overall,
we have focused on reducing costs to better match the lower activity levels.
Research and development for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $218,547 to
$274,815 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $493,362 for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. Research and development includes the cost associated with research
activities of fiber optics technology and latest generation turbine-powered pressure pumping
technology. The research efforts around the initial reconfiguration of the turbine powered
pressure pumping units was substantially completed during the second quarter.
Net other expense increased $873,678 to $2,304,361 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $1,430,683 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This increase was primarily
due to a higher interest expenses, foreign currency and other expenses of $631,325; plus,
absence of the gain on sale of trading securities which was $872,920, offset by interest income of
$630,567.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity to date have been proceeds from various equity and debt
offerings. We completed a public offering during the first quarter of 2015 and a second offering on
July 15, 2015 as discussed in in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 Part II – Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplemental Data – Notes to consolidate
financial statements – Note 11 – “Equity Offering.”
We continually monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt financings, in order to
meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. The successful execution of
our growth strategy depends on our ability to raise capital as needed to, among other things,
finance the purchase of additional equipment. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on
favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to sustain or increase our current level of growth in
the future. The availability of equity and debt financing will be affected by prevailing economic
conditions in our industry and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond
our control.
18
Capital Requirements
The energy services business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment to expand,
upgrade and maintain equipment. Our primary uses of capital have been the acquisition of
equipment, working capital to finance the start of our operations and general administrative
expenses.
Going forward, we expect our capital requirements to consist primarily of:
●growth capital expenditures, such as those to acquire additional equipment and other assets to
grow our business; and
    
 ●maintenance capital expenditures, which are capital expenditures made to extend the useful
life of our assets.
Additionally, we continually monitor new advances in well stimulation equipment and down-hole
technology as well as technologies that may complement our business and opportunities to
acquire additional equipment to meet our customers’ needs. Our ability to make any significant
acquisition for cash would likely require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which
may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.
Our ability to fund operations, and to fund planned and committed 2016 capital expenditures will
depend upon our future operating performance, and more broadly, on the availability of equity
and debt financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, market conditions
in the exploration and production industry and financial, business and other factors, many of
which are beyond our control.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Net cash used in operating activities was $3,794,607 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $7,943,985 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily
due to lower activity levels during the six months ended June 2016 compared to the six months
ended June 2015.
Net cash used in investing activities was $2,706,050 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to net cash used in investing activities of $166,506 for the six months ended June 30,
2015. This decrease is primary related to absence of the gain on sale of trading securities in the
six months of 2016.
Net cash used in financing activities was $2,347,857 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to net cash provided for financing activities of $4,690,206 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to absence of sale of common stock in the six
months of 2016.
The following table summarizes our cash flows from financing activities for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015:

On December 15, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase, from time
to time from December 16, 2015 through December 16, 2017, up to $5 million in shares of its
outstanding common stock. As of June 30, 2016 the Company had purchased 21,850 shares at a
cost of $57,469 under the buy-back program.

We had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $8,848,514 for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $3,420,285 for the
six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily resulting from our operating activities and capital
expenditures.
We do not generate positive cash flow at this time. Further, while we believe we will begin
generating positive cash flow from operations in second half of 2016, our liquidity provided by our
existing cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to fund our full capital expenditure plan
and working capital needs. Our current capital commitments will require us to obtain additional
equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.
Impact of Inflation on Operations
Management is of the opinion that inflation has not had a significant impact on our business to
date. We purchase our equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices,
and employ skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the general economy
increases, our costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. Also, increases in
activity in oilfields can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which we hire
employees as well as increases in the costs of certain materials and key equipment components
used to provide services to our customers.
Industry Trends and Outlook
We face many challenges and risks in the industry in which we operate. Although many factors
contributing to these risks are beyond our ability to control, we continuously monitor these risks
and have taken steps to mitigate them to the extent practicable. In addition, while we believe that
we are well positioned to capitalize on available growth opportunities, we may not be able to
achieve our business objectives and, consequently, our results of operations may be adversely
affected. Please read this section in conjunction with the factors described in the sections titled
“Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for
additional information about the known material risks that we face.
Our business depends on the capital spending programs of our customers. Revenue from our
stimulation and field management segments are expected to be generated by providing services
to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies throughout Argentina, Colombia,
Mexico and other countries. Demand for our services is a function of our customers’ willingness
to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons in
these areas, which in turn is affected by current and expected levels of oil and natural gas prices.
Companies in the energy services industry have historically tended to delay capital equipment
projects, including maintenance and upgrades, during industry downturns.
The oil and gas industry has traditionally been volatile, is highly sensitive to a combination of
long-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil
and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived
stability and sustainability of those prices, production depletion rates and the resultant levels of
cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling and
workover budget, as well as domestic and international economic conditions, political instability
in oil producing countries and merger, acquisition and divestiture activity among exploration and
production companies. The volatility of the oil and gas industry, and the consequent impact on
exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover
activity by our customers. This volatility affects the demand for our services and our ability to
negotiate pricing at levels generating desirable margins, especially in our stimulation business.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that is material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally
means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity
unconsolidated with us is a party, under which we have (i) any obligation arising under a
guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or (ii) a retained or contingent
interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity
or market risk support for such assets.
