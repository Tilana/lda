<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 
of 25 March 2010 entitled &#8220;combating defamation of religions&#8221;, in which the Council 
requested the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,

religions, and in particular on the ongoing serious implications of Islamophobia, for the 
enjoyment of all rights by their followers, to the Council at its fifteenth session&#8221;. 
 The Special Rapporteur submitted a first report on the topic at the twelfth session of 
the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/12/38) and the present report should be read in 
conjunction with that report. 
 Following his previous report, which focused on the legal and conceptual questions 
concerning the debate on &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; and incitement to racial or religious 
hatred, the Special Rapporteur would like in the present report to refer to cases pertaining 
to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 brought to his attention and make related 
observations. 
 The above-mentioned cases cover a wide range of issues and appear to fall under

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 
of 25 March 2010 entitled &#8220;Combating defamation of religions&#8221;, in which the Council 
requested the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance to &#8220;report on all manifestations of defamation of 
religions, and in particular on the ongoing serious implications of Islamophobia, for the 
enjoyment of all rights by their followers, to the Council at its fifteenth session&#8221;. 
</p><p>2. The Special Rapporteur submitted a first report on the topic at the twelfth session of 
the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/12/38) and the present report should be read in 
conjunction with that report. Following his previous report, which focused on the legal and 
conceptual questions concerning the debate on &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; and incitement to 
racial or religious hatred, the Special Rapporteur would like in the present report to refer to 
related cases brought to his attention. In this context, cases received relating to issues 
pertaining to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 and the related observations of the 
Special Rapporteur are the subject of the second chapter of the present report. Conclusions 
and recommendations are then presented in the third chapter.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Issues pertaining to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 
</b>3. Since submitting his previous report, the Special Rapporteur has continued to 
receive regularly cases on issues pertaining to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16. The 
cases brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur cover a wide range of issues and 
appear to fall under the following five broad and non-exhaustive categories. The themes 
covered include: (a) acts of violence or discrimination, or incitement thereto, against 
individuals on the basis of their religion or belief; (b) attacks on religious sites; (c) religious 
and ethnic profiling; (d) religious symbols; and (e) negative stereotyping of religions, their 
followers and sacred persons.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline that the above-mentioned issues 
sometimes overlap and therefore cases which have been put in one category could also have 
been classified in another one. The categories chosen are therefore not always mutually 
exclusive. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur would like to stress that cases reported below 
are summarized in a brief manner, without referring to all actions taken thereupon by the 
concerned Governments or other relevant stakeholders and without taking a position 
thereon. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference for the media reports1 compiled by its Islamophobia Observatory and conveyed 
through its Permanent Observer Mission in Geneva. In addition, the Special Rapporteur 
also received from other various sources, including civil society and other United Nations 
human rights mechanisms, reports on cases pertaining to issues raised in Human Rights 
Council resolution 13/16. Due to the word limit of the present report, the Special 
Rapporteur may only refer to a number of cases. He would like to emphasize that the cases 
below were selected because they exemplify issues and behaviours addressed by Human 
Rights Council resolution 13/16.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The monthly bulletins and annual reports of the Islamophobia Observatory of the Organization of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Conference are available from http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=182. They cover 
an array of issues mostly relating to European and other Western countries. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14999 
</p>
<p><b> A. Acts of violence or discrimination, or incitement thereto, against 
individuals on the basis of their religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>6. Numerous cases of acts of violence or discrimination, or incitement thereto, against 
individuals on the basis of their religion or belief have been reported to the Special 
Rapporteur since his last report. He would like to refer to those cases following two 
subcategories: (1) acts of violence, or incitement thereto, against individuals on the basis of 
their religion or belief; and (2) acts of discrimination, or incitement thereto, against 
individuals on the basis of their religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Acts of violence, or incitement thereto, against individuals on the basis of their 
religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cases received by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>7. On 1 July 2009, a Muslim woman was murdered by a man during an appeal hearing 
at a court of law in Dresden, Germany, where she was testifying in a criminal case for 
verbal abuse. The man had reportedly called the Muslim woman who wore a headscarf, an 
&#8220;Islamist&#8221; and a &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, when she asked him to make room for her son on playground 
swings. 
</p>
<p>8. On 31 July 2009, following allegations against three Christian children who 
reportedly cut the Holy Koran in order to play with the paper, a mob was raised in the city 
of Gojra, Pakistan. Reportedly, Islamists blocked the traffic and demanded the arrest of the 
children accused of having desecrated the Holy Koran. The demonstration was organized 
and announced through the loudspeakers of mosques. The next day, the mob swelled and 
moved towards a block of Christian housing. Those in the mob were allegedly armed with 
sticks, stones, guns and other chemicals. Violence erupted and eight Christians of the same 
family were killed and several injured. 
</p><p>9. On 20 September 2009, a robber reportedly wrapped a Muslim woman in a carpet 
and set her on fire after he raided her home in Westminster, United Kingdom. As he set the 
carpet alight, he allegedly told her: &#8220;this is your Eid present, you Muslim&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. On 27 September 2009, about 150 people armed with sticks and hammers allegedly 
attacked the Bat Nha monastery in Viet Nam. Plain-clothes police officers were reportedly 
among the mob and police officers in uniform blocked the roads leading to the monastery. 
The mob violently proceeded to the eviction of 379 monks and nuns from the monastery. 
Some monks and nuns were beaten up and four of them were sexually assaulted. According 
to the reports, the monks did not attempt to defend themselves, but they sat down and 
started to chant in response. 
</p>
<p>11. On 21 November 2009, following allegations that a 12-year-old Muslim girl had 
been raped by a Coptic Christian man from the village of Al Kom Al Ahmar, Egypt, at least 
three shops owned by Coptic Christians were set on fire. Later on the same day, several 
Muslim individuals reportedly attacked Coptic Christian property, including shops, 
pharmacies and vehicles. 
</p>
<p>12. On 18 December 2009, a Sikh student, working as a part-time pizza delivery 
assistant, was reportedly assaulted in Texas, United States of America. He brought pizzas 
into a home on a delivery and four men took the pizza. Without paying, they began eating, 
while allegedly at the same time hurling xenophobic epithets at the Sikh student and 
threatening him. The men then allegedly grabbed the Sikh student and threw him into a 
swimming pool. The four attackers surrounded the pool, kicking him in the head and body. 
For 20 minutes, he swam trying to escape. He eventually seized an opportunity to flee and 
made it to his car with two men in pursuit. </p>


<p>GE.10-14999 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>13. On 1 January 2010, the Sunni Imam of the Riyadh Mosque, Saudi Arabia, delivered 
a Friday prayer speech in the Al-Bourdi Mosque in which he allegedly called for the 
elimination of all Shia believers in the world, including those residing in Saudi Arabia. 
Furthermore, he reportedly stated that Shia believers were not true Muslims, that their 
doctrine was based on blasphemous principles and that they were remnants of an old 
Persian religion. One week earlier, the Imam, while wearing a Saudi military uniform, 
reportedly urged Saudi soldiers in the border area with Yemen to kill all Shias they can see 
in their fight against al-Houthi rebels. 
</p>
<p>14. On 29 May 2010, during Friday prayers, gunmen armed with grenades attacked two 
mosques of the Ahmadiyyah community in the city of Lahore, Pakistan. According to 
reports, at least 70 members of the Ahmadiyyah community were killed in these targeted 
attacks and reportedly hundreds of Ahmadi worshippers were held hostage in one of the 
mosques. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on acts of violence, or incitement thereto, 
against individuals on the basis of their religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns all acts of violence, or incitement 
thereto, against individuals based on religion or belief and calls upon States to take all 
necessary and appropriate measures to investigate these acts, prosecute and sanction the 
perpetrators in accordance with international human rights law, and compensate the 
victims. The Special Rapporteur recalls that acts of violence against individuals, including 
those committed on the basis of the religion or belief of the individuals, are strictly 
prohibited in international human rights law. Relevant standards include articles 3 and 5 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which respectively stipulate that &#8220;everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and the security of person&#8221; and that &#8220;no one shall be subjected to 
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221;. Articles 6, 7 and 9 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also guarantee the right to life, the 
right not to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and the rights to liberty and security of person. 
</p>
<p>16. As regards relevant international standards concerning incitement to acts of 
violence, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to article 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, according to which &#8220;any advocacy of national, 
racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence 
shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. In addition to the above, in its resolution 64/164, the General Assembly emphasized 
that &#8220;States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish 
acts of violence against persons belonging to religious minorities, regardless of the 
perpetrator, and that failure to do so may constitute a human rights violation&#8221; and urged 
States &#8220;to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion or belief, and to this end &#8230; to ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is 
deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of religion or belief and 
that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, or arbitrary arrest or detention on that account and to bring to justice all 
perpetrators of violations of these rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Acts of discrimination, or incitement thereto, against individuals on the basis of their 
religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cases received by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>18. On 25 December 2009, a family doctor in Utrecht, Netherlands, allegedly refused to 
allow a Muslim woman wearing a niqab into his consultation room. The woman, </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-14999 
</p>
<p>accompanied by her husband, had brought her baby to see the doctor. When they were 
called in to the see the doctor, the doctor told the father that only he could go in with the 
baby. When the mother insisted that she should enter as the baby&#8217;s mother, the doctor 
reportedly replied that he did not want anybody wearing a niqab helping or entering his 
consultation room because of his religious convictions. 
</p>
<p>19. In April 2010, the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan was passed, including a provision that reserves the post of Prime Minister to a 
Muslim individual. As a result, article 91 of the Constitution now reads &#8220;after the election 
of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, the National Assembly shall, to the exclusion of 
any other business, proceed to elect without debate one of its Muslim members to be Prime 
Minister&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. According to reports, members of the Rohingya Muslim community in Myanmar 
need to obtain permission to marry. If they get married in a religious way only, which is not 
considered as an official marriage, they may be imprisoned. These measures are only 
reportedly imposed on Rohingya Muslims and only in North Arakan, Myanmar. In 
addition, under the 1982 Citizenship Act, the vast majority of the Rohingyas are still denied 
Myanmar citizenship, which has curtailed the full exercise of their civil, cultural, economic, 
political and social rights and led to various discriminatory practices.  
</p>
<p>21. In Pakistan, Muslims are required to solemnly declare in their passport application 
form that they &#8220;do not recognize any person who claims to be prophet in any sense of the 
word or of any description whatsoever after Muhammad (peace be upon him) or recognize 
such claimant as prophet or a religious reformer as a Muslim&#8221; and that they &#8220;consider 
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Quadiani to be an imposter nabi and also consider his followers 
whether belonging to the Lahori or Quadiani Group to be NON-MUSLIM&#8221;. 
</p><p>22. In the Maldives, it is not possible for non-Muslims to obtain Maldivian citizenship. 
Section 2 (a) of the Citizenship Act provides that in order for a person to become a citizen 
of the Maldives he or she must satisfy a number of conditions, including being a Muslim. 
Moreover, the Peoples&#8217; Special Majlis (Constitutional Assembly) reportedly approved on 
19 November 2007, an amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Maldives, 
requiring all Maldivian citizens to be Muslims. As a result, article 9 (d) of the 2008 
Constitution now reads: &#8220;Despite the provisions of article (a) a non-Muslim may not 
become a citizen of the Maldives.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>23. In Saudi Arabia, non-Muslims are reportedly not permitted to get Saudi citizenship 
and no places of worship other than mosques are permitted in the country. As a result, 
individuals have been arrested and detained for non-Muslim worship, even though the 
worship was non-public. For instance, in March 2009, three Indian Christians were detained 
after holding a private religious gathering in the Eastern Province, which gathering was 
raided by members of the Commission to Promote Virtue and Prevent Vice. The latter 
allegedly confiscated religious materials. The three Indian Christians were released a few 
days later. 
</p>
<p>24. In Angola, it was alleged that a number of Christian groups and the Muslim 
community in Angola had not been granted legal recognition, despite having submitted 
several applications for registration with domestic authorities. Reportedly, other religious 
minorities had no chance of recognition. Indeed, in accordance with the registration 
requirements, a religious group must have at least 100,000 adherents to qualify for 
registration; the adherents must be adults and reside in the national territory; their 
signatures must be recognized by a notary; and they must come from at least two-thirds of 
all the provinces of Angola. 
</p>
<p>25. Several cases of discrimination against individuals based on religion or belief are 
referred to by Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, in her </p>


<p>GE.10-14999 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/8). As such, she 
deplores that members of certain religious or belief groups are often denied access to 
employment or have faced obstacles thereto, both in Government institutions and private 
companies. She also referred to persistent inequalities and religious differentials in relation 
to employment. The question of discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on 
the right to adequate housing was also raised. In this regard, she referred to a mission report 
by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, who had reported 
on several cases of land confiscation against members of the Baha&#8217;&#237; faith in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, which were often accompanied by threats and physical violence before 
and during related forced evictions (E/CN.4/2006/41/Add.2, paras. 81&#8211;85). Cases of direct 
and indirect discrimination based on religion or belief adversely affecting the right to health 
have also been reported by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief in the 
same report. For instance, during her visit to India, reference was made to the bias in public 
services provisioning against areas with a high proportion of Muslims. As such, more than 
10,000 villages with a high proportion of Muslims were without any medical facilities.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on acts of discrimination, or incitement 
thereto, against individuals on the basis of their religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns all acts of discrimination, or incitement 
thereto, against individuals on the basis of their religion or belief. He recalls that they are 
clearly prohibited in international human rights law. Indeed, the principle of non-
discrimination is generally perceived as one of the most important in the field of human 
rights and is therefore enshrined in all core international human rights conventions. This 
includes: article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; article 5 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; article 
2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; 
article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; article 7 of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families; article 5 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities; and articles 2 and 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Special 
Rapporteur would like to recall that, in accordance with international human rights law, 
States have the duty to refrain from discriminating against individuals or groups of 
individuals based on, inter alia, their ethnicity and/or religion or belief; prevent such 
discrimination, including from non-State actors; and take steps to ensure that, in practice, 
every person in their territory enjoys all human rights without discrimination of any kind. 
</p><p>27. Furthermore, the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief2 extensively addresses the principle of non-
discrimination. In particular, its article 2, paragraph 1, states that &#8220;no one shall be subject to 
discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons, or person on the grounds of 
religion or other belief&#8221;. Article 4 provides that &#8220;all States shall take effective measures to 
prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition, 
exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil, 
economic, political, social and cultural life&#8221; and that they &#8220;shall make all efforts to enact or 
rescind legislation where necessary to prohibit any such discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 See General Assembly resolution 36/55 of 25 November 1981.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-14999 
</p>
<p>28. With regard to incitement to acts of discrimination against individuals based on their 
religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur would like to once again refer to article 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits any advocacy of 
national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition to the above, in its resolution 64/164, the General Assembly urged 
&#8220;States to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion or belief, and to this end &#8230; to ensure that no one is discriminated against on the 
basis of his or her religion or belief when accessing, inter alia, education, medical care, 
employment, humanitarian assistance or social benefits, and to ensure that everyone has the 
right and the opportunity to have access, on general terms of equality, to public services in 
one&#8217;s country, without any discrimination on the basis of religion or belief&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Attacks on religious sites 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cases received by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>30. On 22 January 2009, the Apostolic Nunciature in the city of Caracas, Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela, was reportedly attacked when members of an organization called 
&#8220;La Piedrita&#8221; threw gas canisters into the mission&#8217;s house. Reportedly, the attackers also 
left pamphlets insulting Catholic leaders. On 30 January 2009, 15 unidentified armed men 
forced their way into the Tiferet Israel Synagogue in the city of Caracas. They threw Torah 
scrolls on the floor, stole the synagogue&#8217;s computers and allegedly spray-painted the walls 
with anti-Semitic graffiti, such as &#8220;Damn the Jews&#8221;, &#8220;Jews out of here&#8221;, &#8220;Death to all&#8221; and 
&#8220;Israel assassins&#8221;. Earlier in January 2009, the message &#8220;Property of Islam&#8221; had been 
sprayed on its walls.  
</p>
<p>31. On 18 February 2009, about 200 Government security forces, police and plain-
clothed agents reportedly surrounded the Hosseinieh of the Nematollahi-Gonabadi Sufi 
order, located in the Takhteh Foulad Cemetery in Isfahan, Islamic Republic of Iran, and 
demolished the building using bulldozers and loaders. 
</p>
<p>32. On 22 August 2009, anti-religious and threatening or hateful messages were 
allegedly written in an Islamic centre in South Carolina, United States of America. 
Worshippers found &#8220;Death to Muslims&#8221; written on the floor. It was reportedly the third 
incident at the Islamic Centre in recent years. 
</p>
<p>33. In November 2009, more than 20 Muslim graves were allegedly vandalized in a 
cemetery in Manchester, United Kingdom. Reportedly, only Muslim graves were targeted. 
This was the third time that the graves had been damaged after similar attacks took place in 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p>34. On 6 December 2009, a mosque in Melilla, Spain, was reportedly desecrated with 
graffiti saying &#8220;Viva Franco&#8221;, &#8220;No Moors&#8221; and &#8220;One, Great and Free&#8221;, etc. That was the 
first time in years that a religious building had been attacked in Melilla.  
</p>
<p>35. On 31 December 2009, an attack was reportedly perpetrated by an unknown 
assailant against a mosque in Malm&#246;, Sweden. Shots were fired through the window of the 
building; however nobody was seriously injured during the incident. Around five people, 
including the Imam, were in an office following evening prayers.  
</p>
<p>36. According to reports, on 27 January 2010 &#8212; on the occasion of the International 
Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust &#8212; police discovered 
that the Jewish cemetery of Cronenbourg in Strasburg, France, had been vandalized. 
Eighteen graves had reportedly been painted with Nazi swastikas and 13 others had been 
pushed over. On one tomb, the police discovered the inscription &#8220;Juden Raus&#8221; (Jews out).  </p>


<p>GE.10-14999 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>37. On 30 January 2010, a complaint was lodged by the Muslim Cultural Association in 
the town of Cr&#233;py-en-Valois, France, after local residents reportedly discovered graffiti on 
the walls of a Muslim place of worship. Such graffiti included the words &#8220;Islam out of 
Europe&#8221;, &#8220;Islam out&#8221;, as well as a blue, white and red flag and a Celtic cross. An inscription 
&#8220;France to the French&#8221; was discovered on a wall in a nearby street where the worshipers 
usually parked their cars. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on attacks on religious sites  
</b>38. The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns all attacks perpetrated against religious 
sites. In this regard, he would like to recall the existing international human rights standards 
to protect religious sites. For instance, according to article 6 (a) of the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or 
Belief,3 the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes the freedom, 
&#8220;to worship or assemble in connection with a religion or belief, and to establish and 
maintain places for these purposes&#8221;. Furthermore, in its resolution 55/254 on protection of 
religious sites, the General Assembly &#8220;calls upon all States to exert their utmost efforts to 
ensure that religious sites are fully respected and protected in conformity with international 
standards and in accordance with their national legislation and to adopt adequate measures 
aimed at preventing such acts or threats of violence&#8221;. In its general comment No. 22, the 
Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;the freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, 
observance, practice and teaching encompasses a broad range of acts. The concept of 
worship extends to ritual and ceremonial acts giving direct expression to belief, as well as 
various practices integral to such acts, including the building of places of worship&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>39. In relation to places of worship, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the 
work undertaken by Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. In 
her report to the sixty-first session of the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/61), 
she stressed that &#8220;places of worship are an essential element of the manifestation of the 
right to freedom of religion or belief to the extent that the great majority of religious 
communities or communities of belief need the existence of a place of worship where their 
members can manifest their faith&#8221; (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 50). She also stated that places of 
worship, cemeteries, monasteries or community headquarters have more than a material 
significance for the religious community attached to them. Believers are in a situation of 
special vulnerability whenever they find themselves in places of worship, given the nature 
of their activities. She further stated that she was &#8220;therefore of the opinion that States 
should pay increased attention to attacks on places of worship and ensure that all 
perpetrators of such attacks are properly prosecuted and tried&#8221; (para. 49). Moreover, she 
emphasized that &#8220;attacks or other forms of restriction on places of worship in many cases 
violate the rights not only of a single believer, but also of a group of individuals forming 
the community that is attached to the place in question&#8221; (A/64/159, para. 11).

<p>United States of America. Reportedly, a repeatedly occurring process for some Sikh 
individuals &#8212; including for those who have no criminal records and are citizens of the 
United States of America &#8212; was described as follows: upon disembarking the plane, the 
targeted individual is identified and escorted by two officers of the Department of 
Homeland Security. The officers take the individual through immigration and then onward 
to baggage claim. After the luggage is picked up, the individual is taken to a private 
location where the baggage and the person is searched, all documentation with the 
individual is photocopied, and the individual&#8217;s phone is taken and information from the 
phone stored by the officers. The individual is questioned in detail about their trip, and then 
the individual is released. Throughout the entire experience, officers allegedly treat the 
individual rudely, asking pointed questions in a manner that is threatening as if the person 
is a suspect, and the experience lasts approximately two hours. According to the <i>2009 
Global Sikh Civil Rights Report</i>, Sikhs travelling to Pakistan on pilgrimage visas to visit the 
birthplace of Guru Nanak Sahib Ji and other historical places of worship for short visits 
reported facing similar problems even though their visas to Pakistan reflected very short 
visits. 
</p>
<p>41. In her report on her 2009 visit to Canada (A/HRC/13/23/Add.2), Gay McDougall, 
independent expert on minority issues, addressed the question of religious and ethnic 
profiling. Accordingly, persons belonging to African Canadian, Muslim, Arab and Latino 
communities reported feeling subject to unjustified police surveillance and experiencing 
negative interactions with the police, which they considered to be consistent with a practice 
of ethnic profiling. For instance, the independent expert met an individual who had been 
detained for considerable periods under security certificate provisions. He described his 
treatment as discriminatory and his detention as based only upon his profile as a man of 
Arab ethnicity. Numerous civil society groups claim the powers authorized under the 2001 
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act were used indiscriminately, are targeted against 
Muslims and Arabs, resulting in discriminatory impact, and serve to reinforce negative 
stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>42. Among the key findings of the 2009 European Union Minorities and Discrimination 
Survey, &#8220;the survey found very high levels of police stops among minority groups that were 
interviewed. On average, the proportion of those who were stopped by the police at least 
once in the 12 months prior to the survey interview was 33 per cent of all North Africans; 
30 per cent of Roma; 27 per cent of Sub-Saharan Africans; 22 per cent of both Central and 
East European and former Yugoslavian respondents; 21 per cent of Turkish respondents; 20 
per cent of Russian respondents &#8230; Looking at a breakdown of the results according to 
specific groups in Member States: very high rates of presumed ethnic profiling (over 20 per 
cent) were recorded for the Roma in Greece (39 per cent), North Africans in Spain (31 per 
cent), Sub-Saharan Africans in France (24 per cent), Roma in Hungary (24 per cent) and 
North Africans in Italy (21 per cent)&#8221;.5

<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on religious and ethnic profiling 
</b>43. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports that individuals may be regularly 
and in a discriminatory manner subjected to stop and searches, interrogations, document 
checks or arrests, for instance in the context of immigration or security controls, solely 
because of their perceived religious or ethnic affiliation. While he acknowledges that States 
are obliged to take effective measures in preventing and combating terrorist attacks and that 
profiling is, in principle, a permissible means of law enforcement activity, the Special

<p>Rapporteur would like to underline that this practice raises human rights concerns, in 
particular regarding the non-derogatory principle of non-discrimination, the right to 
privacy, the right to freedom of movement and the right to personal liberty, which are all 
enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>44. Profiling techniques based on perceived religion or ethnicity applied inadequately 
may have a stigmatization effect on members of the groups targeted. The Special 
Rapporteur would like, in this regard, to refer to the thorough analysis undertaken by 
Martin Scheinin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, in his report to the fourth session of the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/26). In particular, Martin Scheinin expressed his concern 
&#8220;that profiling based on stereotypical assumptions may bolster sentiments of hostility and 
xenophobia in the general public towards persons of certain ethnic or religious 
background&#8221;. He added that &#8220;ethnicity, national origin and religion are inaccurate indicators 
because the initial premise on which they are based, namely that Muslims and persons of 
Middle Eastern and South Asian appearance or origin are particularly likely to be involved 
in terrorist activities, is highly doubtful&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the 2009 
Durban Review Conference outcome document which &#8220;calls upon States not to resort to 
profiling founded on grounds of discrimination prohibited by international law, including 
on racial, ethnic or religious grounds and prohibit it by law&#8221;.6 He also would like to refer to 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which stated in paragraph 20 of 
its general comment No. 31 on the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration 
and functioning of the criminal justice system that States parties should &#8220;take the necessary 
steps to prevent questioning, arrests and searches which are in reality based solely on the 
physical appearance of a person, that person&#8217;s colour or features or membership of a racial 
or ethnic group, or any profiling which exposes him or her to greater suspicion&#8221;. Likewise, 
the Special Rapporteur believes that measures taken in the fight against terrorism should 
not discriminate, in purpose or effect, on the grounds of religion or perceived religious 
affiliation of persons. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Religious symbols 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cases received by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>46. According to reports, Muslim female students in Turkey continue to be prevented 
from wearing headscarves in most universities, after the constitutional amendment of 9 
February 2008 lifting the ban on headscarves in public institutions was annulled by the 
Constitutional Court on 5 June 2008. Reportedly, university regulations still prohibit 
students from taking examinations if their heads are covered. As a consequence, Muslim 
students would be prevented from wearing headscarves when taking their examinations. 
</p>
<p>47. According to reports, members of the Sikh community in France continue to be 
prohibited from wearing their <i>daastar</i> (turban) in schools and on photograph identification 
documents, as a result of the implementation of Act No. 2004-228 of 15 March 2004 on 
&#8220;la&#239;cit&#233;&#8221;, and conspicuous religious symbols in public schools. Consequently, Sikh students 
have reportedly been expelled from schools or are refused admission to school. No Sikh 
children have allegedly been allowed to wear a turban in their school since the law came 
into force.

<p>48. On 19 August 2009, a town in northern Italy reportedly banned women from 
wearing the &#8220;burqini&#8221; favoured by conservative Muslim women. The mayor of the town 
allegedly said that women wearing them to pools or the beach would be subjected to a 500 
euro fine. He added that &#8220;the sight of a &#8216;masked woman&#8217; could disturb small children, not 
to mention problems of hygiene&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>49. On 3 November 2009, in the <i>Lautsi v. Italy</i> case &#8212; where the applicant was 
contesting the display of Catholic crucifixes in Italian classrooms &#8212; the European Court of 
Human Rights unanimously concluded that there had been a violation of article 2 of 
Protocol No. 1 to and article 9 on the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.7 
According to the Court, the compulsory display of a symbol of a given confession in the 
exercise of public duties, in specific situations that came under Government control, 
especially in classrooms, restricted the rights of parents to educate their children in 
conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe or not to believe. 
Such restrictions were incompatible with the State&#8217;s duty to observe neutrality in the 
exercise of public duties, and in particular in the field of education.  
</p>
<p>50. On 29 November 2009, Switzerland accepted a popular initiative banning the 
construction of new minarets. The Constitution of Switzerland has therefore been amended 
to include a new article stating that &#8220;the construction of minarets is prohibited in 
Switzerland&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>51. In January 2010, the Indian Supreme Court ordered that niqab-clad women cannot 
be issued voter identity cards, rejecting the argument that religion prohibits them from 
lifting their veils.  
</p>
<p>52. In March 2010, the province of Quebec, Canada, adopted legislation which 
stipulates that Muslim women will need to uncover their faces when dealing with Quebec 
Government services or when they are provincial employees. 
</p>
<p>53. On 27 March 2010, an &#8220;anti-minaret conference&#8221; was reportedly held in the Ruhr 
Valley city of Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The gathering was called to look into the 
possibility of a European Union-wide minaret ban. At the end of the Conference, the 
extreme-right parties attending the event allegedly said they were going to begin a 
campaign for a European referendum imposing a minaret ban. The parties supporting the 
referendum campaign were the Belgian Vlaams Belang and the Austrian Freedom Party. 
</p>
<p>54. On 8 April 2010, the High Court of Bangladesh issued a verdict ordering the 
Ministry of Education to ensure that women who are employed in public institutions are not 
required to wear the veil or hijab against their will.  
</p><p>55. On 29 April 2010, the Belgian Lower House of Parliament voted in favour of a bill 
which would ban wearing the full veil in any public space, including on the street. 
However, the proposed bill does not specifically mention the niqab, referring more 
generally to any clothing that conceals the face. Discussions are ongoing and the Senate 
still needs to approve the bill.  
</p>
<p>56. On 4 May 2010, the Parliament of the canton of Aargau, Switzerland, voted to 
introduce a motion in the country&#8217;s Federal Assembly that would forbid people from 
wearing the niqab in public places.  
</p>

to proceed with rules to prohibit the public use of the niqab.

<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on religious symbols 
</b>58. In recent years, there have been numerous public debates around the issue of bans or 
restrictions on religious symbols, and in particular on minarets, the Islamic veil and the full 
head-to-toe niqab. The Special Rapporteur is aware that the question of religious symbols 
has engendered difficult and highly emotional debates within the concerned societies. He is 
well aware of the manifold arguments brought forward by all sides which support or contest 
such bans or restrictions.  
</p>
<p>59. The ban or restriction of the use or display of religious symbols relates to several 
human rights. In order to take a position on the legality of those bans and restrictions from a 
human rights perspective, the Special Rapporteur takes the view that it is necessary to 
assess if they run counter to, inter alia, the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief, the 
freedom of expression and the principle of non-discrimination. For instance, it would be 
essential to assess whether the display, use or construction (in particular for minarets) of 
certain religious symbols is constitutive of one&#8217;s freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or 
belief. Such an assessment should be undertaken by an independent and impartial judiciary 
on a case-by-case basis, in order to take into account all specificities of a given case. 
However, with regard to the principle of discrimination, the Special Rapporteur takes the 
view that bans or restrictions concerning the construction of minarets, for instance, may be 
discriminatory, since they target a specific religion only. Likewise, legislative provisions 
that would specifically prohibit the wearing of the Islamic veil would also be discriminatory 
towards a specific group of the population, i.e., Muslim women. There may also be indirect 
discrimination even when legislative provisions prohibit the wearing of all religious 
symbols. Indeed, while these legislative provisions may appear non-discriminatory on the 
face of it, they might still target certain specific groups, such as Muslim women or Sikhs, in 
a disproportionate manner, since Muslim and Sikh religious symbols &#8212; such as the veil or 
the <i>dastaar</i> (turban) &#8212; are generally worn in a more visible manner than religious symbols 
of other religions are. More generally on this point, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
refer to the report to the sixty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights by 
Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, in which she stated 
that &#8220;the fundamental objective should be to safeguard both the positive freedom of religion 
or belief as manifested in observance and practice by voluntarily wearing or displaying 
religious symbols, and also the negative freedom from being forced to wear or display 
religious symbols&#8221; (E/CN.4/2006/5, para. 60). 
60. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the question of religious symbols is a 
delicate one and that security concerns and the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, 
in particular with regard to the wearing of the niqab, come into play when assessing the 
legality of those bans or restrictions. Likewise, women&#8217;s rights, and in particular the 
principle of equality between men and women and the individual&#8217;s freedom to wear or not 
to wear religious symbols, ought to be taken into account when debating the wearing of the 
niqab. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur would like to express his concerns with regard 
to the fact that the recent controversial debates around the construction of minarets and the 
wearing of religious symbols demonstrate the fears among the population towards a single 
religion. He deeply deplores the numerous political campaigns which have relied on those 
fears and which have actually fostered them for political gains. These political campaigns 
often reinforce negative stereotypes about certain groups of individuals and thereby 
promote intolerance and misunderstanding among the population. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore strongly encourages moderate voices from all sides to be more prominent and 
vocal, in order to counter these political campaigns with rational arguments, including those 
based on human rights, and for these debates to be more balanced. </p>

<p><b> E. Negative stereotyping of religions, their followers and sacred persons  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cases received by the Special Rapporteur 
</b>61. On 3 April 2009, the Hamas Al-Aqsa television reportedly broadcasted a play 
entitled &#8220;The House of Sheikh Yassin&#8221;, which was performed at the Islamic University of 
Gaza City. One of the characters of the play was an ultra-orthodox Jewish father. In the 
play, the Jewish father allegedly said that &#8220;We Jews hate Muslims. We like to kill Muslims. 
We Jews drink the blood of Muslims and Arabs.&#8221; Later, the father said to his son: &#8220;Shimon, 
I want to teach you some things: first of all, you have to hate Muslims, you have to drink 
Muslim blood. We have to wash our hands in Muslim blood.&#8221; He then allegedly added that 
&#8220;we have to conspire against Arabs and Muslims to satisfy God. We will destroy the Arabs 
and the Muslims&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>62. On 5 June 2009, the Vlaams Belang party reportedly held a protest against the 
planned mosque at the Sint-Bernardsesteenweg in Antwerp, Belgium. Before the protest, 
Vlaams Belang gave out 50,000 flyers against the mosque, which according to them would 
be a symbol of the Islamization of Antwerp and Flanders. The Vlaams Belang leader is 
alleged to have said that &#8220;Islam is like a cuckoo which lays its eggs in our European nest. 
We hatch them and will in the end be cast off.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>63. In July 2009, the Dove World Outreach Centre church in Gainesville, United States 
of America, reportedly posted a sign that read &#8220;Islam is of the Devil&#8221; on its front lawn. 
Despite protests by local residents against such a sign, the church&#8217;s pastor indicated that he 
would put up more signs. 
</p>
<p>64. On 11 September 2009 &#8212; on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the 11 
September 2001 terrorist attacks &#8212; supporters of the English Defence League and &#8220;Stop 
the Islamization of Europe&#8221; allegedly gathered outside Harrow Central Mosque in 
Birmingham, United Kingdom, to demonstrate against what they refer to as &#8220;Islamic 
colonization&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur received several reports of cartoons depicting Jews in a 
negative manner. Among others, on 8 September 2009, in Saudi Arabia, on the occasion of 
the seventieth anniversary of the Second World War, a cartoon depicting one woman and 
one child both dressed as a devil on a bloody background was released in the <i>Al-Jazirah 
</i>newspaper. While the woman &#8212; representing the Second World War &#8212; displays a devil&#8217;s 
fork, the child displays a similar fork, but with the Star of David at its top. On 15 November 
2009, in the United Arab Emirates, a cartoon depicting a hand coming out of a bloody 
archway to catch an Arab man was released in the <i>Al Ittihad </i>newspaper. On the archway, 
the following inscription could be read: &#8220;International Slaughterhouse under Zionist 
Management&#8221;. On 25 November 2009, in Oman, a cartoon depicting a menorah with 
missiles at the end of each of its branches was released in the <i>Oman </i>newspaper.  
</p>
<p>66. On 13 December 2009, a group of around 100 parishioners from the St. Parascheva 
Orthodox Church in Chisinau, Republic of Moldova, reportedly dismantled a Jewish 
symbol &#8212; the Hanukkah Menorah &#8212; on Europe Square, transported it to Stefan the Great 
Square and dumped it upside down. Under the leadership of the Orthodox priest, the group 
of parishioners also put a small cross in the place of the Hanukkah Menorah. In addition, 
during the event, the priest allegedly stated that Jewish people were trying to &#8220;dominate 
people&#8221; and recalled that the Republic of Moldova was an Orthodox country. He reportedly 
also said that &#8220;the Jews can try to kill us, to traumatize our children&#8221;, but that Moldovan 
Orthodox believers would resist.  
</p>
<p>67. On 8 January 2010, to illustrate an article on cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, reportedly 
the victim of a homicide attempt on 1 January 2010, the Norwegian newspaper <i>Aftenposten</i> </p>


<p>GE.10-14999 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>published a copy of 6 of the 12 controversial caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which 
had been first published by the Danish newspaper <i>Jyllands-Posten</i> in September 2005.  
</p>
<p>68. In February 2010, five men allegedly set up a page on the online social utility 
&#8220;Facebook&#8221; declaring &#8220;all Muslims should be thrown out of Wales&#8221;. Around 150 people 
joined the group on the social networking site, claiming they would march through the 
Rhondda Valleys, United Kingdom, to air their anti-Islamic feelings. The rally did however 
not take place due to the arrest of the five men by police.  
</p>
<p>69. On 3 February 2010, the Norwegian <i>Dagbladet</i> newspaper reportedly published a 
photograph showing a man in front of a computer screen with a depiction of Prophet 
Muhammad as a pig. The picture accompanied an article which said that users were posting 
offensive material about Muslims and Jews on the Facebook page of the country&#8217;s security 
police.  
</p>
<p>70. On 20 February 2010, Christians in the town of Batala, India, took to the streets to 
protest against the publication of a cartoon from a school textbook that portrayed Jesus 
raising a can of beer in one hand and holding a cigarette in the other. The parish priest of 
Gurdaspur, India, allegedly said that the objectionable posters of Jesus hurt Christians, who 
form 25 per cent of Gurdaspur district&#8217;s population. 
</p>
<p>71. On 20 March 2010, a Bahraini resident with Sri Lankan nationality was arrested in 
Sri Lanka on allegations that her books &#8220;From Darkness to Light&#8221; and &#8220;Questions and 
Answers&#8221; were insulting to the Buddhist religion. The books were written about her 
conversion in 1999 from Buddhism to Islam. 
</p>
<p>72. In April 2010, the Sk&#229;ne political party posted posters in the city of Malm&#246;, 
Sweden, which depict the prophet Muhammad naked with a 9-year-old wife by his side and 
accompanied by the statement &#8220;He is 53, she is 9. Is that the kind of marriage we want to 
see in Sk&#229;ne?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>73. In the 200th episode of the television show &#8220;South Park&#8221;, broadcasted in the United 
States and the United Kingdom in April 2010, the Prophet Muhammad reportedly appeared 
several times inside a bear suit. Figures from other religions were also depicted, including a 
drug-snorting Buddha and Jesus watching pornography. The following 201st episode 
allegedly had any oral references to the Prophet Muhammad bleeped out, with a prominent 
banner stating &#8220;censored&#8221; in the programme. The images of the prophet in a bear outfit 
were substituted with Santa Claus in the same costume.  
</p>
<p>74. On 22 April 2010, the &#8220;Everybody Draw Mohammed Day&#8221; Facebook page was 
created by a cartoonist in the United States. The page reportedly encouraged users to post 
images of the Prophet Muhammad. In reaction, Pakistan blocked Facebook on 19 May 
2010, following a ruling by the Lahore High Court. The latter however reversed its ruling 
on 24 May 2010 after officials of the social networking site issued apologies for a page 
deemed offensive to Muslims and removed its content.  
</p>
<p>75. Launched on 23 April 2010, the British National Party&#8217;s 2010 general election 
manifesto demands that &#8220;Islamic immigration be halted and reversed as it presents one of 
the most deadly threats yet to the survival of our nation&#8221; and stated that &#8220;today Europe 
faces a renewed Muslim invasion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Observations by the Special Rapporteur on negative stereotyping of religions, their 
followers and sacred persons 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur regrets the worldwide reports of stereotyping which do not 
contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to constructive and peaceful 
dialogue among different communities. He deplores their sometimes provocative nature and 
the distorted vision that they convey. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur would like to </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-14999 
</p>
<p>remind that peaceful expressions of opinions and ideas either orally, through the press or 
other media, should always be tolerated, as long as they do not fall under the restrictions 
enshrined in articles 19, paragraph 3, and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur would like to distinguish between negative stereotyping of 
religions on the one hand, and of religious followers or of sacred persons on the other, since 
these instances should be treated differently from a human rights perspective. International 
human rights law protects individuals and groups of individuals and therefore guarantees 
the freedom of individuals and groups of individuals to exercise freely their religion or 
belief. Religions as such however are subject to vigorous interrogation and criticism 
regarding their doctrines and teachings in the context of the full exercise of the freedom of 
expression. Yet, freedom of opinion and expression may be restricted when it amounts to 
advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence.  
</p>
<p>78. With regard to negative stereotyping of religious followers and of sacred persons, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that, in accordance with article 19, paragraph 3, 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression &#8220;carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore 
be subjected to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and 
are necessary: (a) for respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) for the protection of 
national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals&#8221;. Yet, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to recall that, as stated by the Human Rights Committee in 
its general comment No. 10, &#8220;when a State party imposes certain restrictions on the 
exercise of freedom of expression, these may not put in jeopardy the right itself&#8221;.8 
</p><p>79. The respect of the rights or reputations of others has in some cases been relied on in 
order to request restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and sanctions against the 
perpetrators of defamatory language targeting religious followers or sacred persons. While 
the Special Rapporteur believes that each case should be adjudicated on its own merits by 
an independent and impartial judiciary, he would like to emphasize that the argument 
relating to the defence of truth should always be taken into account and that a very high 
threshold should be met before warranting restrictions and sanctions on defamatory 
expressions targeting individuals. In cases concerning sacred persons, the fact that the latter 
may be fully assimilated with a religion should also be taken into consideration when 
assessing the case. In cases where the high threshold is met and the defamatory statement is 
proven to be a false one, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline that the 
implementation of sanctions, if any, should in no way be of a criminal nature. As stated by 
Frank La Rue, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, in his report to the fourteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council (A/HRC/14/23, para. 83): &#8220;any attempt to criminalize freedom of expression as a 
means of limiting or censuring that freedom must be resisted. He therefore encourages all 
efforts to decriminalize acts considered to be acts of defamation and to make civil liability 
proceedings the sole form of redress for complaints of damage to reputation. However, civil 
penalties for defamation should not be so heavy as to block freedom of expression and 
should be designed to restore the reputation harmed, not to compensate the plaintiff or to 
punish the defendant; in particular, pecuniary awards should be strictly proportionate to the 
actual harm caused, and the law should give preference to the use of non-pecuniary 
remedies, including, for example, apology, rectification and clarification&#8221;.

<p>80. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, negative stereotyping of religions, their followers 
and sacred persons may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of human rights by 
religious followers. Indeed, there may be some cases where stereotyping of religions, their 
followers and sacred persons may lead to actual cases of advocacy of religious hatred, such 
as prohibited in article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that determining which acts might trigger article 20 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights remains problematic, including where 
to draw the line between criticism &#8212; even if deemed offensive &#8212; and advocacy of racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
However, the Special Rapporteur takes the view that the threshold must be very high. He 
also would like to emphasize that each set of facts is particular and can only be assessed 
and adjudicated by an independent and impartial judiciary, according to its own 
circumstances and taking into account the specific context. 
</p>
<p>81. Negative stereotyping of religions, their followers and sacred persons may in some 
instances be symptomatic of intolerant mentalities within a given society. Since they relate 
to the state of mind or &#8220;forum internum&#8221; of an individual, the Special Rapporteur takes the 
view that intolerance mentalities by themselves do not constitute human rights violations. 
Yet, he acknowledges that they may eventually lead to such violations if not monitored 
closely and if they remain unaddressed. Indeed, intolerant mentalities become a human 
rights issue once they are publicly expressed through advocacy of racial or religious hatred 
that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore believes that early warning signs (such as racial and religious intolerance towards 
specific ethnic or religious groups) should be addressed by Governments through a wide 
range of measures aimed at finding ways to create a peaceful society. In this regard, 
prevention is key to creating an atmosphere of religious tolerance and to prevent other 
manifestations of intolerance, in cases where they would already have been expressed. 
Prevention encompasses a wide range of activities in the fields of, inter alia, education, 
awareness-raising, interreligious and intercultural dialogue. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to stress the importance of education which should aim to inculcate, from early 
childhood, a spirit of tolerance and respect for the spiritual values of others. He also would 
like to emphasize on the role of religious leaders. While the latter may be instrumental in 
allowing religious communities to live side-by-side peacefully, they may also foster 
religious intolerance within their respective communities. Therefore, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages States to interact with religious leaders when designing prevention 
measures aiming at curbing manifestations of intolerance.

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses his concerns vis-&#224;-vis reports received on 
worldwide incidents related to issues raised in Human Rights Council resolution 
13/16. Such reports appear to fall under five broad and non-exhaustive categories 
warranting different approaches under international human rights law, which 
provides sufficient tools to respond to all of them. These categories include acts of 
violence or discrimination, or incitement thereto, against individuals on the basis of 
their religion or belief; attacks on religious sites; religious and ethnic profiling; 
religious symbols; and negative stereotyping of religions, their followers and sacred 
persons. </b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/16 which requested that 
particular attention be given to the phenomenon of Islamophobia, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to highlight that he unfortunately continues to receive 
worrying reports of incidents negatively affecting the human rights of Muslim </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>individuals. He would like to express his serious concerns with regard to acts of 
violence or acts of discrimination targeting Muslim individuals which are based on 
religious intolerance. The Special Rapporteur takes the view that this phenomenon 
remains a serious issue in a variety of countries and that it therefore needs to be 
addressed with greater resolve by States in order to prevent further discrimination 
and violence, and incitement thereto, and intolerance against Muslim individuals.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns acts of violence or discrimination, 
or incitement thereto, against persons based on their religion or belief. He recalls that 
these acts are clearly prohibited in international law and that relevant human rights 
standards guarantee the right to life, the right not to be subjected to torture or to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the rights to liberty and to 
security of person, as well as the overarching principle of non-discrimination. As 
regards incitement to acts of violence or discrimination against persons based on their 
religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States to take all necessary and 
appropriate measures to implement article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly condemns attacks on religious sites. He recalls 
that places of worship are an essential element of the manifestation of the right to 
freedom of religion or belief which is protected by international human rights law. 
The Special Rapporteur therefore calls upon States to abide by the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or 
Belief, as well as relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the necessity for States to take 
measures to combat terrorism and that profiling is, in principle, a permissible means 
of law enforcement activity, he nonetheless expresses his deep concerns at reports of 
discriminatory profiling targeting specific groups of the population based on their 
perceived ethnic or religious background. In line with the Durban Review Conference 
outcome document, he calls upon States not to resort to profiling founded on grounds 
of discrimination prohibited by international law, including on racial, ethnic, or 
religious grounds.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The bans or restrictions on the construction, use or display of religious symbols 
raise several issues in terms of human rights. The Special Rapporteur takes the view 
that the following questions should be kept in mind when assessing the legality of such 
bans or restrictions: is the construction, use or display of certain religious symbols 
constitutive of the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief? Is the ban or 
restriction discriminatory (in a direct or indirect manner) vis-&#224;-vis specific groups of 
the population? Is the ban or restriction on the display of religious symbols 
proportionate to the necessity for security measures by the State concerned? Is the 
ban or restriction on the display of religious symbols necessary to uphold the principle 
of equality of men and women? Does the ban or restriction take into account the 
individual freedom to wear or not to wear religious symbols? The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that the question of religious symbols is a delicate one and he 
emphasizes that answers to such questions should be provided by an independent and 
impartial judiciary and in light of the specific circumstances of each case under 
consideration.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur regrets reports of stereotyping which do not contribute 
to the creation of an environment conducive to constructive and peaceful dialogue 
among communities. Nonetheless, he recalls that peaceful expressions of opinions and 
ideas should always be tolerated, as long as they do not fall under the restrictions in 
articles 19, paragraph 3, and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.  </b></p>


<p>GE.10-14999 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur distinguishes between stereotyping of religions on one 
hand and of religious followers or sacred persons on the other. With regard to 
stereotyping of religious followers and of sacred persons, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that the right to freedom of expression may be restricted in order to protect, 
inter alia, the rights or reputations of others. However, in accordance with articles 19 
and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, any restrictions on 
the right to freedom of expressions must be established in law; they must pursue a 
legitimate aim; and they must be proportional to the aim sought to be achieved. As a 
result, the Special Rapporteur believes that a very high threshold should be met and 
that the defamatory expressions targeting individuals must have been proven false 
before they warrant restrictions and sanctions thereon. Moreover, he recommends 
that sanctions be of a civil nature only and that fines arising from civil defamation 
procedures respect the principle of proportionality in order not to have a long-lasting 
and chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>With regard to stereotyping of religions, he recalls that vigorously 
interrogating and criticizing religious doctrines and their teachings is thoroughly 
legitimate and constitutes a significant part of the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion or expression. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that 
domestic blasphemy laws aiming to protect religions per se can prove 
counterproductive since they could result in de facto censure of robust examination of 
religious doctrines and teachings and of inter- and intra-religious criticism. Moreover, 
the Special Rapporteur received reports that many of these laws afford different levels 
of protection to different religions and have often proved to be applied in a 
discriminatory manner. He was informed of numerous examples of persecution of 
religious minorities or dissenting believers, but also of atheists and non-theists, as a 
result of legislation on religious offences or overzealous application of laws that may 
be fairly neutral on the face of it. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
States to move away from the notion of defamation of religions towards the legal 
concept of advocacy of racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence in order to anchor the debate in the relevant 
existing international legal framework, and in particular that provided in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Advocacy of racial or religious hatred is a symptom, the external manifestation 
of something much more profound which is intolerance and bigotry. Intolerance 
against individuals based on their religion or belief unfortunately continues to be 
manifested in different ways. It is therefore critical that States find the most effective 
ways through which to protect individuals from advocacy of hatred and violence by 
others. While legislative responses have often been relied on by States to respond to 
these phenomena, they are far from being sufficient to bring about real changes in 
mindsets, perceptions and discourse. Indeed, tackling the root causes of 
manifestations of religious intolerance affecting individual&#8217;s human rights requires a 
much broader set of policy measures, for example in the areas of education, 
awareness-raising and interreligious and intercultural dialogue. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore strongly recommends that States put a strong emphasis on a 
broad range of preventive measures which aim at fostering a peaceful society where, 
inter alia, freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief may be fully 
exercised by all individuals.
