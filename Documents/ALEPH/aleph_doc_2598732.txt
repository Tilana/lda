INFORMATION CIRCULAR
(As at September 2, 2016, except as indicated)
Hudson  Resources  Inc.  (the  “Company”)  is  providing  this  information  circular  and  a  form  of  proxy  in 
connection  with  management’s  solicitation  of  proxies  for  use  at  the  annual  general  meeting  (the 
“Meeting”) of the Company to be held at 10th Floor, 595 Howe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, on 
Tuesday, October 4, 2016, at 10:00 A.M. (Vancouver time) and at any adjournments.  The Company will 
conduct  its  solicitation  by  mail  and  officers  and  employees  of  the  Company  may,  without  receiving 
special compensation, also telephone or make other personal contact.  The Company will pay the cost of 
solicitation. 
 
APPOINTMENT OF PROXYHOLDER 
 
The  purpose  of  a  proxy  is  to  designate  persons  who  will  vote  the  proxy  on  a  shareholder’s  behalf  in 
accordance  with  the  instructions  given  by  the  shareholder  in  the  proxy.    The  persons  whose  names  are 
printed  in  the  enclosed  form  of  proxy  are  officers  or  Directors  of  the  Company  (the  “Management 
Proxyholders”). 
 
A  shareholder  has  the  right  to  appoint  a  person  other  than  a  Management  Proxyholder,  to 
represent  the  shareholder  at  the  Meeting  by  striking  out  the  names  of  the  Management 
Proxyholders  and  by  inserting  the  desired  person’s  name  in  the  blank  space  provided  or  by 
executing a proxy in a form similar to the enclosed form.  A proxyholder need not be a shareholder. 
 
VOTING BY PROXY 
 
Only registered shareholders or duly appointed proxyholders are permitted to vote at the Meeting.  
Shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted or be withheld from voting on each matter 
referred to in the Notice of Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the shareholder on any ballot 
that  may  be  called  for  and  if  the  shareholder  specifies  a  choice  with  respect  to  any  matter  to  be  acted 
upon, the shares will be voted accordingly. 
 
If  a  shareholder  does  not  specify  a  choice  and  the  shareholder  has  appointed  one  of  the 
Management Proxyholders as proxyholder, the Management Proxyholder will vote in favour of the 
matters  specified  in  the  Notice  of  Meeting  and  in  favour  of  all  other  matters  proposed  by 
management at the Meeting. 
 
The  enclosed  form  of  proxy  also  gives  discretionary  authority  to  the  person  named  therein  as 
proxyholder  with  respect  to  amendments  or  variations  to  matters  identified  in  the  Notice  of  the 
Meeting  and  with  respect  to  other  matters  which  may  properly  come  before  the  Meeting.    At  the 
date of this information circular, management of the Company knows of no such amendments, variations 
or other matters to come before the Meeting. 
 
COMPLETION AND RETURN OF PROXY 
 
Completed forms of proxy must be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrar and transfer agent, 
Computershare Trust Company of Canada, 100 University Avenue, 8th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2Y1, 
not later than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, prior to the time of the 
Meeting, unless the chairman of the Meeting  elects to exercise his discretion to accept  proxies received 
subsequently.

NON-REGISTERED HOLDERS 
 
Only shareholders whose names appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of 
shares or duly appointed proxyholders are permitted to vote at the Meeting.   Most shareholders of 
the  Company  are  “non-registered”  shareholders  because  the  shares  they  own  are  not  registered  in  their 
names  but  instead  registered  in  the  name  of  a  nominee  such  as  a  brokerage  firm  through  which  they 
purchased the shares; bank, trust company, trustee or administrator of self-administered RRSP’s, RRIF’s, 
RESP’s and similar plans; or clearing agency such as The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited (a 
“Nominee”).  If you purchased your shares through a broker, you are likely a non-registered holder. 
 
In  accordance  with  securities  regulatory  policy,  the  Company  has  distributed  copies  of  the  Meeting 
materials,  being  the  Notice  of  Meeting,  this  information  circular  and  the  Proxy,  to  the  Nominees  for 
distribution to non-registered holders. 
 
Nominees  are  required  to  forward  the  Meeting  materials  to  non-registered  holders  to  seek  their  voting 
instructions in advance of the Meeting.  Shares held by Nominees can only be voted in accordance with 
the instructions of the non-registered holder.  The Nominees often have their own form of proxy, mailing 
procedures and provide their own return instructions. If you wish to vote by proxy, you should carefully 
follow the instructions from the Nominee in order that your Shares are voted at the Meeting. 
 
If you, as a non-registered holder, wish to vote at the Meeting in person, you should appoint yourself as 
proxyholder by writing your name in the space provided on the request for voting instructions or proxy 
provided by the Nominee and return the form to the Nominee in the envelope provided.  Do not complete 
the voting section of the form as your vote will be taken at the Meeting. 
 
Non-registered holders who have not objected to their Nominee disclosing certain ownership information 
about themselves to the Company are referred to as "non-objecting beneficial owners (“NOBOs”).  Those 
non-registered  holders  who  have  objected  to  their  Nominee  disclosing  ownership  information  about 
themselves to the Company are referred to as "objecting beneficial owners" (“OBOs”). 
 
The Company is not sending the Meeting materials directly to NOBOs in connection with the Meeting, 
but rather has distributed copies of the Meeting materials to the Nominees for distribution to NOBOs. 
 
The Company does not intend to pay for Nominees to deliver the Meeting materials and Form 54-101F7 – 
Request for Voting Instructions Made by Intermediary to OBOs.  As a result, OBOs will not receive the 
Meeting Materials unless their Nominee assumes the costs of delivery. 
 
NOTICE-AND-ACCESS 
 
The Company is not sending the Meeting materials to shareholders using “notice-and-access”, as defined 
under NI 54-101. 
 
REVOCABILITY OF PROXY 
 
In  addition  to  revocation  in  any  other  manner  permitted  by  law,  a  registered  shareholder,  his  attorney 
authorized  in  writing  or,  if  the  registered  shareholder  is  a  corporation,  a  corporation  under  its  corporate 
seal  or  by  an  officer  or  attorney  thereof  duly  authorized,  may  revoke  a  proxy  by  instrument  in  writing, 
including  a  proxy  bearing  a  later  date.    The  instrument  revoking  the  proxy  must  be  deposited  at  the 
registered office of the Company, at any time up to and including the last business day preceding the date 
of  the  Meeting,  or  any  adjournment  thereof,  or  with  the  chairman  of  the  Meeting  on  the  day  of  the 
Meeting.

company,  which  made  a  Voluntary  Appointment  of  an  Administrator,  Ernst  &  Young  (Australia),  as  a 
result  of  becoming  insolvent.    The  reasons  for  the  insolvency  are  summarized  in  the  Questionnaire  and 
Report  to  the  Administrators  dated  November  14,  2008,  as  filed  with  the  ASX.  As  a  result  of  the

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
 
Compensation Program Objectives 
 
The Company’s compensation policies and programs are designed to be competitive with similar junior 
mineral  exploration  companies  and  to  recognize  and  reward  executive  performance  consistent  with  the 
success  of  the  Company.    These  policies  and  programs  are  intended  to  attract  and  retain  capable  and 
experienced  people.    The  Compensation  Committee’s  role  and  philosophy  is  to  ensure  that  the 
Company’s goals and objectives, as applied to the actual compensation paid to the Company’s executive 
officers are aligned with the Company’s overall business objectives and with shareholders’ interests. The 
Company’s  Compensation  Committee  is  comprised  of  two  Directors,  John  Hick  and  John  McConnell. 
Each of the members of the Compensation Committee is independent of management of the Company.  In 
addition  to  informal  industry  comparables  from  publicly  available  information,  the  Compensation 
Committee considers a variety of factors when determining both compensation policies and programs and 
individual  compensation  levels.    These  factors  include  the  long-range  interests  of  the  Company  and  its 
stockholders,  overall  financial  and  operating  performance  of  the  Company,  and  the  Compensation 
Committee’s  assessment  of  each  executive’s  individual  performance  and  contribution  toward  meeting 
corporate  objectives.    Superior  performance  is  recognized  through  the  Company’s  incentive  policy  and 
programs.    The  executive  compensation  program  is  comprised  of  the  following  principal  components: 
(a) base  salary;  (b)  short-term  incentive  compensation  comprised  of  discretionary  cash  bonuses;  and 
(c) long-term incentive compensation comprised of share options. Together, these components support the 
Company’s  long-term  growth  strategy  and  are  designed  to  address  the  following  key  objectives  of  our 
compensation program: 
 
• 
 
• 
 
•
focus performance by linking incentive compensation to the achievement of business objectives 
and financial and operational results.
align executive compensation with shareholders’ interests;
attract and retain highly qualified management; and
The Company’s compensation program is primarily designed to reward performance and, accordingly, the 
performance of both the Company, as well as the individual performance of executive officers during the 
year  in  question,  are  examined  by  the  Board  in  conjunction  with  setting  executive  compensation 
packages.    The  Board  does  not  set  specific  performance  objectives  in  assessing  the  performance  of  the 
CEO  and  other  executive  officers;  rather  the  Board uses  its  experience  and  judgment  in  determining  an 
overall compensation package for the CEO and other executive officers.  Some of the factors looked at by 
the  Board  in  assessing  the  performance  of  the  Company  and  its  executive  officers  are  as  follows:  (a) 
exploration  successes;  (b)  additions  to  mineral  resources;  (c) ability  to  raise  capital  as  required;  (d) 
compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory  requirements;  and  (e)  ability  to  raise  the  profile  of  the  Company 
within the investment community.  The Company weighs and reviews its performance for all of the above 
relative to its goals and objectives and in relation to the performance of its industry peer group. 
 
Elements of the Executive Compensation Program 
 
The Company’s executive compensation policy consists of an annual base salary and long term incentives 
in the form of stock options granted under the Company’s Stock Option Plan. 
 
Base Salaries 
 
The  base  salary  component  is  intended  to  provide  a  fixed  level  of  competitive  pay  that  reflects  each 
executive  officer’s  primary  duties  and  responsibilities.  It  also  provides  a  foundation  upon  which
7
performance based incentive compensation elements are assessed and established.  The Company intends 
to pay base salaries to its executive officers, including the CEO, that are in the range of those for similar 
positions within the industry peer group.  The Company does not benchmark its executive compensation 
program.  Salaries of the executive officers, including that of the CEO are reviewed annually. 
 
Short-Term Incentive Compensation  – Cash Bonuses 
 
In  addition  to  base  salaries,  the  Company  has  a  discretionary  bonus  plan  pursuant  to  which  the  Board, 
upon  recommendation  to  the  Board,  may  award  annual  cash  bonuses  to  executive  officers.    The  annual 
cash  bonus  element  of  the  executive  compensation  program  is  designed  to  reward  both  corporate  and 
individual performance during the Company’s last completed financial year. It is the Board’s philosophy 
that  an  individual  bonus  should  be  tied  primarily  to  that  individual’s  contribution  to  corporate 
performance.  The amount of the bonus paid is not set in relation to any formula or specific criteria but is 
the result of a subjective determination of the Company’s and the individual’s performance.  The Board 
has  not  established  strict  predetermined  quantitative  performance  criteria  linked  to  the  payment  of 
bonuses. 
 
Long Term Incentive Compensation – Stock Options 
 
Executive officers, along with all of the Company’s officers, Directors, employees, contractors and other 
service providers, are eligible to participate in the Company’s share option plan (the “Option Plan”).  The 
Option  Plan  and  the  Common  Shares  reserved  thereunder  have  been  approved  by  the  Company’s 
shareholders on an annual basis.  The Option Plan promotes an ownership perspective among executives, 
encourages  the  retention  of  key  executives  and  provides  an  incentive  to  enhance  shareholder  value  by 
furthering the Company’s success.  As with most companies in the Company’s peer group, options form 
an integral component of the total compensation package provided to the Company’s executive officers.  
Participation in the Option Plan rewards overall corporate performance, as measured through the price of 
the Company’s Common Shares. In addition, the Option Plan enables executives to develop and maintain 
a  significant  ownership  position  in  the  Company.    Option  grants  may  be  made  periodically,  typically 
annually, to ensure that the number of Options granted to any particular individual is commensurate with 
the  individual’s  level  of  ongoing  responsibility  within  the  Company.    In  considering  option  grants,  the 
Compensation  Committee  evaluate  the  number  of  Options  an  individual  has  been  granted,  the  exercise 
price and value of the Options and the term remaining on those Options. 
 
Compensation Policies and Risk Management 
 
The  Board  of  Directors  considers  the  implications  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  Company’s 
compensation policies and practices when determining rewards for its officers.  Commenced in 2012, the 
Board  of  Directors  intends  to  review  at  least  once  annually  the  risks,  if  any,  associated  with  the 
Company’s compensation policies and practices at such time. 
 
Executive compensation is comprised of short-term compensation in the form of a base salary and long-
term ownership through the Company’s Option Plan. This structure ensures that a significant portion of 
executive compensation (stock options) is both long-term and “at risk” and, accordingly, is directly linked 
to the achievement of business results and the creation of long term shareholder value.  As the benefits of 
such compensation, if any, are not realized by officers until a significant period  of time has passed, the 
ability of officers to take inappropriate or excessive risks that are beneficial to their compensation at the 
expense  of  the  Company  and  the  shareholders  is  extremely  limited.    Furthermore,  the  short-term 
component  of  executive  compensation  (base  salary)  represents  a  relatively  small  part  of  the  total 
compensation.    As  a  result,  it  is  unlikely  an  officer  would  take  inappropriate  or  excessive  risks  at  the 
expense  of  the  Company  or  the  shareholders  that  would  be  beneficial  to  their  short-term  compensation 
when their long-term compensation might be put at risk from their actions.
8
Due  to  the  small  size  of  the  Company  and  the  current  level  of  the  Company’s  activity,  the  Board  of 
Directors is able to closely monitor and consider any risks which may be associated with the Company’s 
compensation policies and practices.  Risks, if any, may be identified and mitigated through regular Board 
meetings during which financial and other information of the Company are reviewed.  No risks have been 
identified  arising  from  the  Company’s compensation  policies  and practices  that  are  reasonably  likely to 
have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
Hedging of Economic Risks in the Company’s Securities 
 
The  Company  has  not  adopted  a  policy  prohibiting  Directors  or  officers  from  purchasing  financial 
instruments that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of the Company’s securities 
granted as compensation or held, directly or indirectly, by Directors or officers.  However, the Company 
is not aware of any Directors or officers having entered into this type of transaction. 
 
Summary Compensation Table 
 
The  following  table  (presented  in  accordance  with  National  Instrument  Form  51-102F6  (“Statement  of 
Executive  Compensation”  and  “Form  51-102F6”)  sets  forth  all  annual  and  long  term  compensation  for 
services in all capacities to the Company for the last three most recently completed financial years of the 
Company in respect of each of the individuals comprised of each CEO and the CFO who acted in such 
capacity for all or any portion of the most recently completed financial year, and each of the three most 
highly  compensated  executive  officers,  or  the  three  most  highly  compensated  individuals  acting  in  a 
similar capacity, (other than the CEO and the CFO), as at March 31, 2016 whose total compensation was, 
individually, more than $150,000 for the financial year and any individual who would have satisfied these 
criteria but for the fact that individual was neither an executive officer of  the Company, nor acting in a 
similar  capacity,  at  the  end  of  the  most  recently  completed  financial  year  (collectively  the  “Named 
Executive Officers” or “NEOs”).

in relation to a securities purchase program or other program. 
 
INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON 
 
Except as set out herein, no person who has been a Director or executive officer of the Company at any

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE 
 
A summary of the responsibilities and activities and the membership of each of the Committees is set out 
below. 
 
National Policy 58-201 establishes corporate governance guidelines which apply to all public companies.  
The Company has reviewed its own corporate governance practices in light of these guidelines.  In certain 
cases,  the  Company’s  practices  comply  with  the  guidelines,  however,  the  Board  considers  that  some  of 
the  guidelines  are  not  suitable  for  the  Company  at  its  current  stage  of  development  and  therefore  these 
guidelines  have  not  been  adopted.    National  Instrument  58-101  mandates  disclosure  of  corporate 
governance practices which disclosure is set out below. 
 
Independence of Members of Board 
 
The Company’s Board consists of six Directors, four of whom are independent based upon the tests for 
independence set forth in NI 52-110.  John W.W. Hick, John McConnell, Flemming Knudsen and John 
McDonald  are  independent.    James  Tuer  is  not  independent  as  he  is  the  President  and  CEO  of  the 
Company.    Effective  July  20,  2016,  Herbert  Wilson  is  not  independent  as  he  was  appointed  Director, 
Engineering Development. 
 
Management Supervision by Board 
 
The operations of the Company do not support a large Board of  Directors and the Board has determined 
that the current constitution of the Board is appropriate for the Company’s current stage of development.  
Independent  supervision  of  management 
through  choosing  management  who 
demonstrate  a  high  level  of  integrity  and  ability  and  having  strong  independent  Board  members.    The 
independent  Directors  are,  however,  able  to  meet  at  any  time  without  any  members  of  management 
including  the  non-independent  Directors  being  present.    Further  supervision  is  performed  through  the 
Audit  Committee  which  is  composed  of  a  majority  of  independent  Directors  who  meet  with  the 
Company’s auditors without management being in attendance. 
 
Risk Management 
 
The  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  for  adoption  of  a  strategic  planning  process,  identification  of 
principal  risks  and  implementing  risk  management  systems,  succession  planning  and  the  continuous 
disclosure requirements of the Company under applicable securities laws and regulations. 
 
The audit committee is responsible for the risk management items set out in the audit committee charter.

Participation of Directors in Other Reporting Issuers 
 
The  participation  of  the  Directors  in  other  reporting  issuers  is  described  in  the  table  provided  under 
“Election of Directors” in this information circular. 
 
Orientation and Continuing Education 
 
While  the  Company  does  not  have  formal  orientation  and  training  programs,  new  Board  members  are 
provided with: 
 
1.
a summary of significant corporate and securities responsibilities.
access to recent publicly filed documents of the Company, technical reports and the Company’s 
internal financial information; 
 
access to management and technical experts and consultants; and
2. 
 
3. 
 
Board members are encouraged to communicate with management, auditors and technical consultants; to 
keep  themselves  current  with  industry  trends  and  developments  and  changes  in  legislation  with 
management’s  assistance;  and  to  attend  related  industry  seminars  and  visit  the  Company’s  operations.  
Board members have full access to the Company’s records. 
 
Ethical Business Conduct 
 
The Board views good corporate governance as an integral component to the success of the Company and 
to meet responsibilities to shareholders.  The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that is posted on its 
website  at  www.hudsonresources.ca  and  has  instructed  its  management  and  employees  to  abide  by  the 
Code. 
 
Nomination of Directors 
 
The  Board  has  responsibility  for  identifying  potential  Board  candidates.    The  Board  assesses  potential 
Board  candidates  to  fill  perceived  needs  on  the  Board  for  required  skills,  expertise,  independence  and 
other factors.  Members of the Board and representatives of the mineral exploration industry are consulted 
for possible candidates.  John W.W. Hicks and John McConnell comprise the Nominating Committee. 
 
Compensation of Directors and the CEO 
 
The  independent  Directors  are  John  W.W.  Hick,  John  McConnell,  Flemming  Knudsen  and  John 
McDonald.  John W.W. Hick and John McConnell comprise the Compensation Committee of the Board, 
which has the responsibility for determining compensation for the Directors and senior management. 
 
To  determine  compensation  payable,  the  independent  Directors  review  compensation  paid  for  Directors 
and CEOs of companies of similar size and stage of development in the mineral exploration industry and 
determine an appropriate compensation reflecting the need to provide incentive and compensation for the 
time and effort expended by the Directors and senior management while taking into account the financial 
and  other  resources  of  the  Company.    In  setting  the  compensation,  the  independent  Directors  annually 
review the performance of the CEO in light of the Company’s objectives and consider other factors that 
may have impacted the success of the Company in achieving its objectives.
15
Board Committees 
 
As the Directors are actively involved in the operations of the Company and the size of the Company’s 
operations  does  not  warrant  a  larger  Board  of  Directors,  the  Board  has  determined  that  additional 
committees are not necessary at this stage of the Company’s development. 
 
Assessments 
 
The  Board  does  not  consider  that  formal  assessments  would  be  useful  at  this  stage  of  the  Company’s 
development.    The  Board  conducts  informal  annual  assessments  of  the  Board’s  effectiveness,  the 
individual  Directors  and  each  of  its  committees.    To  assist  in  its  review,  the  Board  conducts  informal 
surveys  of  its  Directors,  receives  an  annual  report  from  the  Corporate  Governance  and  Nominating 
Committee on its assessment of the functioning of the Board and reports from each committee respecting 
its own effectiveness.  As part of the assessments, the Board or the individual committee may review their 
respective mandate or charter and conduct reviews of applicable corporate policies. 
 
Audit Committee 
 
The Audit Committee’s Charter 
 
Mandate 
 
The  primary  function  of  the  Audit  Committee  (the  “Committee”)  is  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in 
fulfilling  its  financial  oversight  responsibilities  by  reviewing  the  financial  reports  and  other  financial 
information provided by the Company to regulatory authorities and shareholders, the Company’s systems 
of  internal  controls  regarding  finance  and  accounting  and  the  Company’s  auditing,  accounting  and 
financial  reporting  processes.    Consistent  with  this  function,  the  Committee  will  encourage  continuous 
improvement of, and should foster adherence to, the Company’s policies, procedures and practices at all 
levels.  The Committee’s primary duties and responsibilities are to: 
 

Serve  as  an  independent  and  objective  party  to  monitor  the  Company’s  financial  reporting  and 
internal control system and review the Company’s financial statements. 
 
Review and appraise the performance of the Company’s external auditors.
 
 

Provide an open avenue of communication among the Company’s auditors, financial and senior 
management and the Board of Directors.
Composition 
 
The  Committee  shall  be  comprised  of  three  Directors  as  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  the 
majority of whom shall be free from any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would 
interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment as a member of the Committee. 
 
At least one member of the Committee shall have accounting or related financial management expertise.

PARTICULARS OF OTHER MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON 
 
A. 
 
The Board of Directors of the Company implemented a Stock Option Plan (the “Plan”) effective July 15, 
2006, which was amended August 10, 2011, which was approved by the TSX Venture Exchange and the 
shareholders of the Company.  The number of common shares which may be issued pursuant to options 
previously granted and those granted under the Plan is a maximum of 10% of the issued and outstanding 
common  shares  at  the  time  of  the  grant.    In  addition,  the  number  of  shares  which  may  be  reserved  for 
issuance to insiders as a group is 10%, to any one individual may not exceed 5% of the issued shares on a 
yearly basis or 2% if the optionee is engaged in investor relations activities or is a consultant.  Under TSX 
Venture  Exchange  policy,  all  such  rolling  Stock  Option  Plans  which  set  the  number  of  common  shares 
issuable  under  the  plan  at  a  maximum  of  10%  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  must  be 
approved and ratified by shareholders on an annual basis. 
 
Therefore, at the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to pass a resolution in the following form:
21
“UPON MOTION IT WAS RESOLVED that the Company approve and ratify, subject to 
regulatory  approval,  the  Stock  Option  Plan  pursuant  to  which  the  Directors  may,  from 
time  to  time,  authorize  the  issuance  of  options  to  Directors,  officers,  employees  and 
consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries to a maximum of 10% of the issued and 
outstanding  common  shares  at  the  time  of  the  grant,  with  a  maximum  of  5%  of  the 
Company’s issued and outstanding  shares being  reserved to any one person  on a yearly 
basis.”
The purpose of the Plan is to allow the Company to grant options to Directors, officers, employees and 
consultants,  as  additional  compensation,  and  as  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  success  of  the 
Company.  The granting of such options is intended to align the interests of such persons with that of the 
shareholders.  Options will be exercisable over periods of up to five years as determined by the Board of 
Directors of the Company and are required to have an exercise price no less than the closing market price 
of the Company’s shares prevailing on the day that the option is granted.  Pursuant to the Plan, the Board 
of  Directors  may  from  time  to  time  authorize  the  issue  of  options  to  Directors,  officers,  employees  and 
consultants  of  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  or  employees  of  companies  providing  management  or 
consulting  services  to  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries.    The  Plan  contains  no  vesting  requirements,  but 
permits the Board of Directors to specify a vesting schedule in its discretion.  The Plan provides that if a 
change of control, as defined therein, occurs, all shares subject to option shall immediately become vested 
and may thereupon be exercised in whole or in part by the option holder. 
 
If the optionee ceases to be an eligible person as a result of termination for cause of such optionee by the 
Company  any  outstanding  option  held  by  such  optionee  on  the  date  of  such  termination,  whether  in 
respect of option shares that are vested or not, shall be cancelled as of that date.  If the optionee ceases to 
be  an  eligible  person  due  to  his  or  her  retirement  at  the  request  of  his  or  her  employer  earlier  than  the 
normal  retirement  date  under  the  Company's  retirement  policy  then  in  force,  or  due  to  his  or  her 
termination  by the Company other than for cause, or due to his or her voluntary resignation, the option 
than held by the optionee shall be exercisable to acquire unissued option shares at any time up to but not 
after the earlier of the expiry date and the date which is 90 days (30 days if the optionee was engaged in 
investor relations activities) after the optionee or, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its sole 
discretion  if  it  determines  such  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the  Company,  extend  the  expiry  date  of  the 
option  of  an  optionee  to  a  later  date  within  a  reasonable  period  in  accordance  with  TSX  Venture 
Exchange Policy 4.4 (Section 3.8(i)). 
 
The full text of the Plan is available for viewing up to the date of the Meeting at the Company’s offices at 
Suite 1460, 1066 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6E 3X1. 
 
Unless  such  authority  is withheld,  the persons named in  the enclosed Proxy  intend to vote for the 
approval and ratification of the Plan.
