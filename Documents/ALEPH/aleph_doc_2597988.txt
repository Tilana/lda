INDEPENDENT AUDITORâ€™S REVIEW REPORT
To the members of PanTerra Gold Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of PanTerra Gold Limited, which
comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in
equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes
comprising a statement of accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directorsâ€™
declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the
half-yearâ€™s end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directorsâ€˜ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditorâ€™s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether,
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving
a true and fair view of the consolidated entityâ€™s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of PanTerra Gold
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the
annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which
has been given to the directors of PanTerra Gold Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the
directors as at the time of this auditorâ€™s review report.

Conclusion

Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us

believe that the half-year financial report of PanTerra Gold Limited is not in accordance with the

Corporations Act 2001 including:

(a) giving a true and fair View of the consolidated entity's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and

(b) complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and Corporations
Regulations 2001.

Emphasis of Matter

Without modifying our conclusion, we draw attention to Note 1(c) in the financial statements, which

states that the consolidated entity made a loss of $1,479,622 for the half year and the consolidated

entityâ€˜s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $16,604,804.

The ability of the consolidated entity to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the successful

execution of loan documentation which extends the ALCIP loan to 31 December 2018 which is subject

to a number of conditions. These conditions, along with other matters as set out in Note 1(c), indicate

the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the consolidated entityâ€˜s

ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be unable to realise

its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
