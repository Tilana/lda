</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human 
</p>
<p>rights presents fiscal policy, and particularly taxation policies, as a major determinant in the 
enjoyment of human rights. Taxation is a key tool when tackling inequality and for 
generating the resources necessary for poverty reduction and the realization of human 
rights, and can also be used to foster stronger governance, accountability and participation 
in public affairs. She outlines relevant human rights obligations to guide and inform State 
revenue-raising practices, including the duty to use the maximum available resources for 
the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. She also analyses the questions of 
how the principles of non-discrimination and equality and the duty of international 
cooperation and assistance should inform taxation policies at the global and national levels. 
After assessing how revenue-raising policies and practices can be strengthened through a 
human rights-based approach, she makes recommendations for fiscal and tax policies that 
are grounded in human rights and can lead to poverty reduction, sustainable development 
and the realization of transformative rights.  </p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Fiscal policies are a critical tool that States can employ to comply with their 
international human rights obligations. They can play a major role in achieving equality, 
tackling discrimination, and strengthening governance and accountability, as well as 
combating poverty and funding development.  
</p>
<p>2. Revenue and expenditure are the two main instruments of fiscal policy. In policy and in 
practice, they are complementary and intertwined. Both functions are critical to realizing 
human rights, and human right norms apply to all aspects of fiscal policy. Given that 
government expenditure has been subject to a considerable amount of analysis from the 
perspective of human rights, however, the Special Rapporteur will focus on the revenue-
raising side of fiscal policy, in particular taxation. Although non-tax revenues are also 
important for most States, taxation is the primary source of public resource generation, 
besides being also the most sustainable and predictable source of financing for the 
provision of public goods and services.1 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/13,,the 
Special Rapporteur aims to put a human face on debates about tax collection, tax structures 
and tax abuse. Although taxation policy may seem far removed from the daily problems of 
the poor, it in fact plays a major role in determining and adjusting levels of inequality in a 
society and in funding essential services, social protection and poverty reduction measures; 
it is therefore central to realizing the rights and defining the opportunities of people living 
in poverty. Mobilizing domestic resources is also a crucial step in the financing of the 
Millennium Development Goals and the emerging post-2015 sustainable development 
agenda, as well as in complying with existing commitments to make tax systems more pro-
poor.2 
</p>
<p>4. Human rights obligations do not prescribe precise taxation policies, given that States 
have the discretion to formulate the policies most appropriate to their circumstances. 
However, a wide range of international treaties, such as the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
impose limits on the discretion of States in the formulation of fiscal policies. In order to 
ensure that States respect, protect and fulfil rights and to assist them in opening fiscal space 
towards the realization of human rights, fiscal policies must be guided by the obligations 
imposed by these treaties.  
</p>
<p>5. A State breaches its international obligation whenever its actions or omissions are not in 
conformity with a specifically determined conduct required of it by that obligation;3 for 
example, actions or omissions that diminish public revenues by allowing large-scale tax 
evasion or tax structures that have a disproportionate impact on the poorest segments of the 
population could constitute violations of human rights obligations, such as the obligation to 
allocate the maximum available resources to the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights or to eliminate discrimination.4 
</p>

<p>6. The present report focuses mainly on the obligations of States as primarily responsible 
for human rights obligations. Business enterprises are, however, also crucial actors in the 
area of fiscal policy. United Nations treaty bodies have repeatedly reiterated their view that 
States should take steps to prevent violations of human rights outside of their territories as a 
result of the activities of business enterprises that are incorporated under their laws or that 
have their main seat or place of business under their jurisdiction.5 For example, States 
should take measures to ensure that business enterprises that the State is in a position to 
regulate, including legal, accounting and other specialized firms that assist in tax abuse, do 
not participate in or facilitate tax abuse or illicit financial flows, given that they have a 
detrimental impact on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights.6 
</p>
<p>7. Moreover, under the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 7  business 
enterprises also have a responsibility to respect human rights, which covers the full range of 
rights listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and the eight core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) 
(principle 12). Business practices that avoid taxation may breach their responsibility to 
respect insofar as such actions have a negative human rights impact (principle 13) &#8211; which 
indeed they may &#8211; as will be further explored below. In addition, business enterprises that 
knowingly avoid paying tax are purposefully depriving countries of the resources they need 
to fulfil their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>8. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur explains the scope and content of human 
rights principles and obligations relevant to the formulation of revenue-raising policies. She 
elucidates the minimum requirements with which a State must comply in order to fulfil 
these principles and obligations. After clarifying the crucial functions of tax with regard to 
human rights, she examines different tax measures and practices from a human rights 
perspective. The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with recommendations for tax 
policies most beneficial for the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>9. In order to prepare the report, the Special Rapporteur addressed a questionnaire to 
States and other stakeholders in which she requested information on their national fiscal 
policies.8 The Special Rapporteur also convened an expert meeting, in collaboration with 
the Friedrich Ebert Foundation (Geneva), the Center of Concern, Christian Aid and 
MISEREOR, hosted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on 16 and 17 September 2013.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to all States that submitted information, 
and to the experts, United Nations agencies and civil society organizations that supported 
this process and assisted in the preparation of the report, in particular the Center of 
Concern, the Center for Economic and Social Rights and other members of the Righting 
Finance Initiative.

<p><b> II. Normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. International human rights law sets obligations for States to respect, protect and fulfil 
human rights in all the ways that they exercise their functions, and the design, 
implementation and monitoring of revenue-raising policies is no exception. In the section 
below, the Special Rapporteur examines how a State&#8217;s use of its revenue-raising power has 
a direct impact on its ability to comply with international human rights obligations, in 
particular relating to the economic, social and cultural rights of people living in poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rights to equality and to non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>12. States have an obligation to guarantee that human rights are exercised without 
discrimination of any kind. This is a fundamental pillar of international human rights law 
and an immediate obligation of all States.9  
</p>
<p>13. The rights to equality and to non-discrimination should be respected in all revenue-
raising policies State. Thus, any action or omission by the State in this area must not 
discriminate, either directly or indirectly,10 against any individual or group (including on 
the basis of race, gender, disability or economic and social status) or perpetuate 
discrimination and inequality.11  
</p>
<p>14. The discrimination prohibited under international human rights law includes any 
distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that has the 
intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an 
equal footing, of all rights. 12  Not all differences in treatment, however, constitute 
discrimination. A distinction is compatible with the principles of equality and non-
discrimination if the differentiation is reasonable and objective, and pursues a legitimate 
aim under human rights instruments, and there is a reasonable relationship of 
proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought.13 
</p>
<p>15. Moreover, in some circumstances, these rights require States to take affirmative action 
or special measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and attitudes that 
cause or perpetuate systemic or de facto discrimination.14 These measures should not be 
considered discriminatory because they address structural disadvantages and encourage the 
equal enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>16. In revenue collection, compliance with these rights may require States to set up a 
progressive tax system with real redistributive capacity that preserves, and progressively 
increases, the income of poorer households. It also implies that affirmative action measures

<p>aimed at assisting the most disadvantaged individuals and groups that have suffered from 
historical or persistent discrimination, such as well-designed subsidies or tax exemptions, 
would not be discriminatory. In contrast, a flat tax whereby all people are required to pay 
an equal proportion of their income would not be conducive in achieving substantive 
equality, as it limits the redistributive function of taxation. 
</p>
<p>17. Revenue collection is a critical tool for States in tackling and redressing systemic 
discrimination and ensuring equal access to economic, social and cultural rights. In order to 
redress structural inequalities, including gender inequalities, States should evaluate the 
differential impact of existing and proposed fiscal policies on different groups, in particular 
those who suffer from structural discrimination. For example, certain tax arrangements that 
directly or indirectly disincentivize women&#8217;s participation in the labour force or promote 
the male bread-winner family model could threaten women&#8217;s enjoyment of human rights.15 
Meanwhile, a State with a very narrow tax base or that fails to tackle tax evasion may result 
in its inability to fund social protection or adequate and accessible public services, a 
situation that is likely to create or entrench inequalities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p>18. The right to self-determination, enshrined in both the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, expressly encompasses the rights of peoples (not the State or Government) to freely 
dispose of their natural wealth and resources.16 Considering that many natural resources are 
finite and non-renewable, this right needs to be protected with special care, taking into 
account the rights of future generations.17 At the very least, a State&#8217;s population has a right 
to enjoy a fair share of the financial and social benefits that natural resources can bring. 
This requires ensuring participation, access to information and high standards of 
transparency and accountability in decision-making about the use of natural resources. 
Where indigenous peoples are involved, States have additional and specific obligations, 
including ensuring free, prior and informed consent in any decisions regarding the use of 
their lands.18 
</p>
<p>19. The right to self-determination also underlines the rights of all peoples to &#8220;freely pursue 
their economic, social and cultural development&#8221; and the duty of States to respect that right. 
This has clear implications for activities that undermine the ability of other States to raise 
revenue and fund their own development.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Rights to participation, accountability, transparency and access to 
information 
</b></p>
<p>20. The rights to participation, accountability, transparency and access to information are 
critical human rights principles that also apply to fiscal policies and must be implemented 
throughout the policy cycle, from design of budgets and tax codes, allocation of 
expenditure, through to monitoring and evaluation of impact.

</p>

<p>21. Many human rights treaties emphasize the right to participation.19 In particular, article 
25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights includes the right of all 
people to take part in the conduct of public affairs, a right that covers all aspects of public 
administration and the formulation and implementation of policy at international, national, 
regional and local levels.20 Effective and meaningful participation is in turn dependent on 
the right to seek, receive and impart information.21  
</p>
<p>22. Decision-making processes regarding tax and public revenues must therefore be based 
on full transparency and the broadest possible national dialogue, with effective and 
meaningful participation of civil society and those who will be directly affected by such 
policies, including people living in poverty.22 Fiscal policies should be subjected to the 
scrutiny of the population during design, implementation and evaluation stages, with the 
various interests transparently identified. This will require capacity-building and fostering 
fiscal literacy in the population. The population should have access to all relevant 
information in an accessible and understandable format,23 and inclusive mechanisms should 
be put in place to ensure that they are actively engaged in devising the most appropriate 
policy options.24 Owing to the asymmetries of power, expertise and interests in this debate, 
specific measures should be taken to ensure equal access and opportunities to participate, 
particularly for people living in poverty.25 
</p>
<p>23. To ensure accountability, fiscal policies, including, for example, tax incentives granted 
to foreign investors, should be open to judicial oversight, while public officials should be 
accountable for decisions that endanger the enjoyment of human rights. Accessible 
mechanisms for complaints and redress should also be put in place. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Specific obligations with regard to economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. Although obligations with regard to economic, social and cultural rights are primarily 
enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
provisions regarding such rights are also included in the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>25. States must devote the &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; to ensure the progressive 
realization of all economic, social and cultural rights as expeditiously and effectively as 
possible,26 even during times of severe resource constraints, whether caused by a process of 
adjustment, economic recession or other factors.27 This principle should guide the State&#8217;s 
decisions and priorities in generating, mobilizing and allocating resources in order to permit 
the realization of human rights. The obligation of progressive realization independent of

<p>economic growth also exists; it requires the effective use of available resources,28 including 
potential resources that could be raised through reasonable efforts, such as taxation 
measures and international assistance and cooperation.29 Other areas are also critical for 
mobilizing resources, including debt and deficit financing, monetary policy and financial 
regulation.30  
</p>
<p>26. Although most provisions in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights are considered subject to progressive realization, States that claim resource 
constraints have the burden of proof to show that every effort has been made to move 
towards the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights as a matter of priority, 
and that they are truly unable rather than unwilling to meet these obligations. 31  This 
includes an obligation to &#8220;actively seek assistance&#8221; through international cooperation.32  
</p>
<p>27. Moreover, States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights have an immediate core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very 
least, minimum essential levels of all economic, social and cultural rights. 33  These 
minimum essential levels are entitlements that are crucial to securing an adequate standard 
of living through basic subsistence, essential primary health care, basic shelter and housing 
and basic forms of education for all members of society.34 Even during times of severe 
resource constraints, States must demonstrate that every effort has been made to use all 
resources that are at its disposal, including resources that could potentially be collected 
through taxation, or tackling tax evasion and other illicit financial flows, in an effort to 
satisfy, as a matter of priority, minimum essential levels.35  
</p>
<p>28. The obligation to progressively realize economic, social and cultural rights entails a 
prohibition of deliberate retrogression, namely, of measures that directly or indirectly lead 
to backwards steps in the enjoyment of rights. There is a strong presumption that such 
measures are in violation of human rights standards. States may only adopt such 
retrogressive measures if they can demonstrate that they have carefully considered all 
alternatives, including revenue-raising ones, and that they are duly justified by reference to 
the totality of the rights in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, in the context of the full use of the maximum available resources.36 The

<p>compatibility of, for example, austerity measures (such as those that many States 
implemented in the wake of the 2008/09 financial crisis) with the Covenant would therefore 
depend partly on whether the State has sought revenue-raising alternatives before making 
cuts in areas that are important for ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, such as cuts in public sector employment, public services or social protection. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Obligations of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>29. States have a duty to provide international assistance and cooperation commensurate 
with their capacities, resources and influence, as established in Articles 55 and 56 of the 
Charter of the United Nations and in several international human rights treaties. Particularly 
important are the obligations of international assistance and cooperation enshrined in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (arts. 2, para. 1 and 1, 
para. 1), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 4) and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 32), on the basis of the recognition that some 
countries will not be able to achieve the full realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights if other countries in a position to assist do not do so. 
</p>
<p>30. As part of international cooperation and assistance, States have an obligation to respect 
and protect the enjoyment of human rights everywhere, which involves avoiding conduct 
that would foreseeably risk impairing the enjoyment of human rights by persons beyond 
their borders, and conducting assessments of the extraterritorial impact of laws, policies and 
practices.37  
</p>
<p>31. States must refrain from any conduct that impairs the ability of another State to comply 
with its own human rights commitments.38 Furthermore, they have an obligation to create 
an international enabling environment for the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural 
rights, including in matters relating to taxation. They should also coordinate with each other 
in order to cooperate effectively in the universal fulfilment of economic, social and cultural 
rights.39  
</p>
<p>32. In this sense, providing an avenue for high-net-worth individuals and transnational 
corporations to evade tax liabilities (such as through the establishment of tax havens) could 
be contrary to obligations of international assistance and cooperation, because it can 
directly undermine the ability of another State to mobilize the maximum available 
resources for the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights. This could 
then obstruct the residents of that State from enjoying, for example, their rights to health, 
education or social security.  
</p>
<p>33. When acting as a member of an international organization, a State remains responsible 
for its own conduct in relation to its human rights obligations within and outside its 
territory. This includes identifying the possible human rights impact of measures agreed at 
the international level, including the impact on persons living in poverty.40 Therefore, when 
a State makes decisions about loans as a member of an international financial institution, 
careful consideration of human rights obligations would mitigate against imposing 
conditions regarding fiscal policies that may jeopardize the human rights of the borrower

<p>State&#8217;s population or undermine that State&#8217;s ability to use maximum available resources to 
realize economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>34. In the past, it has been difficult to reach international agreement on tax cooperation 
owing to the powerful entrenched interests at play and the reluctance of States to cede any 
sovereignty on tax affairs. In the current status quo, however, certain States &#8211; in particular 
low-income States and States with high debt levels or loans from international financial 
institutions &#8211; have very limited sovereignty over their tax affairs. Indeed, their actions in 
this sphere are frequently constrained by wealthy countries, international financial 
institutions and business interests. Tax sovereignty is also undermined by competition for 
foreign investment between developing countries, creating a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; in terms 
of both corporate tax rates and incentives.  
</p>
<p>35. A contemporary interpretation of existing obligations of international cooperation and 
assistance should recast or redefine the outdated emphasis on tax sovereignty to a more 
modern conception of international tax cooperation in a globalized and interdependent 
world economy (see paras. &#8230; below).41 
</p>
<p><b> III. Tax: a critical tool for realizing human rights and tackling 
inequality  
</b></p>
<p>36. Taxation is critical to finance development and can be a powerful tool for stimulating 
poverty reduction. Higher and more stable revenues result in increased sustainable 
investment in public services, infrastructure and other development needs, and improve 
competitiveness of economies over the long term. Taxes are not the only source of 
government revenue, but they are arguably the most important, because they combine three 
critical functions, addressed below: (a) the generation of revenue for the realization of 
rights; (b) achieving equality and tackling discrimination; and (c) strengthening governance 
and accountability.  
</p>
<p>37. Certainly, poverty reduction is more effective and sustainable when combined with 
investments in areas such as education, health and food security. These areas are also 
critical for ensuring the realization of rights in the present and future and for overcoming 
the intergenerational transmission of poverty.  
</p>
<p>38. Taxation policies also have the potential to reduce income and wealth inequalities, 
depending on their level and progressiveness.42 This is a crucial goal, because inequalities 
have been shown to slow the pace of poverty reduction, create intergenerational poverty 
traps through uneven access to health and education, and increase the vulnerability of 
societies to economic crises. 43  Some research has shown that improvement in income

<p>distribution is the key channel for poverty reduction.44 In most economies, the redistribution 
achieved through income taxes is even higher than for means-tested social transfers.45  
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, when revenue is used to finance public services, it creates conditions 
propitious to growth and employment in formal sectors of the economy, guaranteeing both 
equality of access and equality of opportunities.46 Public services also mitigate the impact 
of skewed income distribution and directly contribute to reducing inequality. 47  
</p>
<p>40. Promoting economic growth is also a primary and legitimate concern of State fiscal 
policies. Progressive taxation can, however, help Governments to achieve more sustainable 
growth and to distribute the fruits of prosperity more fairly. Indeed, a recent study by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that the combined direct and indirect effects of 
redistribution, including the growth effects of the resulting lower inequality, are on average 
pro-growth.48 Many developing countries have experienced significant economic growth in 
recent decades, although without a proportionate reduction in poverty or inequality, 
indicating that the benefits of growth have been concentrated in the hands of a few. This is 
in large part because the proceeds of growth have not been adequately taxed and 
redistributed, leading to a concentration of wealth that has considerable negative 
implications for human rights, social cohesion and future economic growth prospects.49  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur explores three key areas in which government revenue-raising 
policies or practices can facilitate the enjoyment of human rights below. </p>
<p><b> A. Generating revenue for the realization of rights  
</b></p>
<p>42. The most straightforward way in which government revenues can facilitate compliance 
with human rights obligations is by providing resources for public goods, such as education 
and health services &#8211; goods that are critical to realizing human rights and that ultimately 
benefit the whole of society.  
</p>
<p>43. The quality, accessibility and availability of goods and services needed for the 
realization of human rights, such as the rights to an adequate standard of living, health, 
education and social security, will hinge on the resources that the State is able to collect. 
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), strengthening tax systems is vital to guarantee the right to education. Many of 
the countries furthest from achieving the widespread enjoyment of the right to education do 
not, however, tap their tax bases sufficiently.50  
</p>
<p>44. Low levels of revenue collection have a disproportionate impact on the poorest 
segments of the population and constitute a major obstacle to the capacity of the State to 
finance public services and social programmes. A lack of access to quality services is a 
constituent element of poverty, and people living in poverty are particularly dependent on 
public services, being unable to pay for private alternatives. In addition, their specific needs

<p>and characteristics make it more likely they will have to interact with State-funded 
institutions and services on a regular basis. This is particularly the case for people who 
experience multiple forms of discrimination and disadvantage; for example, persons with 
disabilities are more likely to come into regular contact with health and social services, 
while women are more likely to be directly dependent on social protection and health 
systems for at least some period of their lives because of their sexual and reproductive 
health and maternity-related needs. Women also serve as unpaid alternative care providers 
when public services are not adequately funded, increasing their time burden and limiting 
their opportunities to engage in paid work, education, training or leisure, while also 
negatively affecting their enjoyment of rights such as health, education, participation and 
social security.51 
</p>
<p><b> B. Achieving equality and tackling discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>45. Transferring and redistributing wealth through taxation has the potential to redress 
systemic discrimination (based on, inter alia, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, socioeconomic status) and to spur progress towards substantive equality.52 These 
are fundamental human rights goals and are conducive to sustainable poverty reduction. 
Tax structures must, however, be carefully designed if a more equitable distribution of 
incomes is to be achieved. 
</p>
<p>46. Progressive tax systems, in particular direct taxes, are one of the most important tools 
available to Governments in addressing income inequality.53 Personal income tax is one of 
the most progressive and important kinds of tax in this regard. Indirect taxes, such as those 
based on consumption (such as value-added or sales taxes) are typically regressive, because 
they generally constitute a larger proportion of the income of people living in poverty;54 for 
example, in Latin America, on average for the poorest 20 per cent of the population, sales 
tax accounts for 13.7 per cent of their income, while only 5.8 per cent of income for the 
richest 20 per cent.55 Thus, despite exemptions aimed at decreasing the burden on lower-
income groups, the poor bear a tax burden 2.4 times higher than that of the wealthiest 
people.56 Women, who tend to use larger portions of their income on basic goods because 
of gender norms that assign them responsibility for the care of dependents, bear the 
regressive brunt of consumption taxes.57  
</p>
<p>47. Overall, high tax rates for goods and services and low rates for income, wealth and 
property bring about inequitable and discriminatory outcomes; indeed, it has been shown 
that the negative effect of indirect taxes on the income of people living in or on the verge of 
poverty can be greater than the positive effect of cash transfers.58  Such regressive tax 
structures also restrict the redistributive aspect of social programmes, resulting in them

<p>effectively being funded by the very persons whom they seek to benefit.59 Thus, although 
each country&#8217;s situation is different, the higher the prevalence of regressive taxes in the mix 
of revenue-raising sources, the more likely it is that a State will run afoul of the principles 
of equality and non-discrimination and that the minimum essential enjoyment of rights by 
the poorest will be threatened.  
</p>
<p>48. A well-placed tax threshold (namely, the income below which an individual or 
household is exempted from income tax) is also crucial for ensuring that the taxation 
system does not jeopardize the ability of people living in poverty to enjoy minimum 
essential levels of economic, social and cultural rights. Unfortunately, in some countries, 
households are required to pay tax before they earn enough to even meet minimum food 
basket requirements.60 
</p>
<p>49. Tax structures also affect other types of inequality; for instance, tax structures 
frequently discriminate against women directly or indirectly, for example by assuming 
women&#8217;s income to be supplemental to their household.61  This actively disincentivizes 
wage-earning and therefore could reduce participation in the labour market by women, 
potentially threatening their right to work. Policymakers should be aware of the extent to 
which tax policies, such as the treatment of income derived from jointly-owned assets of 
married couples, strengthen or break down gender inequalities, or discriminate against 
different types of households.62  
</p>
<p>50. Each national and economic context is different; the optimum form and scale of 
redistribution is therefore different for each country. States do have, however, an obligation 
to address proactively inequality in the enjoyment of rights. Redistribution through tax 
systems is clearly a powerful tool for them to do so.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Strengthening governance and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>51. Historically, the formation of accountable and effective States has been closely tied to 
the emergence of taxation systems. 63 Fiscal policies can spur State-building and foster 
citizenship,64 affect the level and quality of people&#8217;s participation in public affairs and 
strengthen the accountability and capacity of the State.65 Conversely, tax abuse and unfair 
tax practices erode confidence in government, while States that do not have to rely on tax 
contributions (but rather on, for example, revenues from natural resources) tend to exhibit 
lower levels of accountability and participation in public affairs.66 
</p>
<p>52. In the same vein, the more a State can rely on domestic rather than external resource 
mobilization for its financing, the more it will be able to deploy sustainable development 
strategies and policies that are responsive to the needs of its people and accountable to 
them. Therefore, a sustainable base of domestic revenue becomes an enabling factor to

<p>exercise the right to self-determination and the right of all persons to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs.67 In this regard, it will also be crucial to build public confidence 
that these resources are being well used by, for example, increasing public participation and 
oversight of budgeting and expenditure. 
</p>
<p>53. Income distribution and its management through taxation also have a crucial 
relationship with democracy. Growing income disparities can serve to polarize and 
fragment societies, which can ultimately lead to alienation and social unrest.68  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Strengthening revenue raising through a human rights-based 
approach 
</b></p>
<p>54. In order to realize the potential of taxation to fulfil the above-described functions to the 
greatest possible extent, there are several actions that States should take. These measures 
are examined from the human rights perspective below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Widening the tax base and improving efficiency 
</b></p>
<p>55. In some States, despite significant efforts to increase revenue through taxation, the 
amount actually collected is demonstrably inadequate to realize human rights. In Latin 
America and the Caribbean, for example, most States have tax ratios that are clearly lower 
than they should be when their level of development is considered.69 It is however crucial 
that taxes be raised and collected in human rights-compliant ways, where those who can 
least afford it are not asked to pay more (see paras. 45 &#8211; 50 above). 
</p><p>56. Evidence shows that, even in developing countries, widening tax bases and improving 
tax collection efficiency could raise considerable additional revenue.70 For instance, if all 
developing countries were able to raise 15 per cent of their national income in tax, a 
commonly accepted minimum figure (the OECD average is 37 per cent), they could realize 
at least an additional $198 billion per year, more than all foreign development assistance 
combined.71  
</p>
<p>57. Tax collection efficiency can also be increased by improvements in tax administration. 
Tax administrations with appropriate financial, personal and technical resources are critical 
to increase levels of revenue collection and to avoid abuse. Lack of investment in tax 
authorities is therefore a short-term false economy, with negative implications for the 
enjoyment of human rights. It is also crucial that tax authorities be perceived as being 
independent, fair, transparent and accountable.

<p><b> B. Tackling tax abuse 
</b></p>
<p>58. Tax abuse includes tax evasion, fraud and other illegal practices, including the tax 
losses resulting from other illicit financial flows, such as bribery, corruption and money 
laundering. 72  Levels of tax evasion are extremely high in many countries; 73  globally, 
approximately $3 trillion of government revenue is lost to tax evasion every year.74 While 
high-income countries are the biggest losers in absolute terms, low- and middle-income 
countries are particularly affected by the losses, and also face particular constraints when 
tackling tax abuse. 75  In 2011, developing countries lost $946.7 billion owing to illicit 
financial flows (a substantial portion of which relates to tax abuse),76 according to OECD 
more than seven times official development assistance for that year, and substantially more 
than the estimated costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.77  
</p>
<p>59. Tax abuse is thus not a victimless practice; it limits resources that could be spent on 
reducing poverty and realizing human rights, and perpetuates vast income inequality. While 
the rich benefit from this practice, the poor feel the negative impact on their standard of 
living, their unequal political power and the inferior quality of health and education 
services for themselves and their children. Simulations suggest that, if all the capital flight 
from Africa over the period 2000-2008 had been invested in Africa, with the same 
productivity as actual investment, the average rate of poverty reduction would have been 4 
to 6 percentage points higher per year. 78  Meanwhile, the recent devastating austerity 
measures taken in some countries could have been avoided entirely if some of the annual 
revenue lost from tax evasion had been recovered.79 
</p>
<p>60. A State that does not take strong measures to tackle tax abuse cannot be said to be 
devoting the maximum available resources to the realization of economic, social and 
cultural rights. Moreover, high levels of tax abuse undermine the principles of equality and 
non-discrimination, given that evaders end up paying less than taxpayers with the same &#8211; or 
less &#8211; capacity to pay. High net-worth individuals and large corporations also have a far 
greater ability to evade taxes as they are able to pay tax advisers, lawyers and accountants 
(who may sometimes provide inappropriate advice and assistance) and to open undeclared 
foreign bank accounts in low-tax jurisdictions. Tax abuse by corporations and high net-
worth individuals forces Governments to raise revenue from other sources: often regressive 
taxes, the burden of which falls hardest on the poor. Therefore, if States do not tackle tax 
abuse, they are likely to be disproportionately benefiting wealthy individuals to the 
detriment of the most disadvantaged. Monitoring, preventing and punishing abuse is 
therefore essential in order to comply with human rights principles and improve the 
distributive effects of tax systems.

<p>61. It is important to note, however, that tax evasion is not possible in a domestic vacuum. 
Individual countries, in particular low-income countries, are severely constrained in the 
measures that they alone can take against tax abuse. Illicit financial flows are international 
in nature and therefore beyond the capacity of one State alone to tackle. The availability of 
offshore financial centres (tax havens) that offer low or no taxes and secrecy is a major 
factor. More than $21 trillion in private assets are reportedly held in tax havens to evade 
and avoid taxes.80 Tax havens enable large-scale tax abuse (as well as illicit activities, such 
as corruption) and deprive other countries of the revenue they need to fulfil their 
obligations. In addition, given that most tax havens are located in &#8211; or under the jurisdiction 
of &#8211; wealthy countries, the global flow of money to these centres exacerbates global 
inequalities.81 
</p>
<p>62. The actions of States to facilitate and/or actively promote tax abuse and other illicit 
financial flows through their tax secrecy laws and policies could jeopardize their 
compliance with international human rights obligations, particularly with regard to 
international cooperation and economic, social and cultural rights.82 States should therefore 
take concerted and coordinated measures against tax evasion globally as part of their 
domestic and extraterritorial human rights obligations and their duty to protect people from 
human rights violations by third parties, including business enterprises (see paras. 1 &#8211; 35 
above).  
</p>
<p><b> C. Reassessing corporate taxation contributions 
</b></p>
<p>63. In many countries, business enterprises are taxed at a very low rate, even if they make 
large profits, owing in large part to the infrastructure, healthy educated workforce and other 
resources that public funds enable. In addition, many large transnational corporations are 
able to effectively avoid tax in many jurisdictions, including in countries where they make 
large profits.  
</p>
<p>64. States increasingly grant tax incentives (or tax holidays) to corporations 83  as they 
compete to attract foreign investment.84 Many least developed countries, for example, offer 
extremely favourable tax deals to foreign investors in agriculture and mining owing to the 
perceived competition between countries for this investment.85 These incentives warrant a 
heightened level of scrutiny in human rights terms, because they restrict the State&#8217;s revenue 
and therefore the resources it is able to devote to rights realization. According to some 
estimates, revenue losses to developing countries can reach $138 billion per year. 86

<p>Estimates in many African countries show that revenue losses from tax incentives were 
between 2 and 8 per cent of GDP.87 
</p>
<p>65. The evidence that incentives succeed in attracting investment is actually weak.88 It is 
likely that, in many cases, the investment would have come even without the incentive, and 
that the costs of the incentive may indeed outweigh the benefit of the investment. 89 
Moreover, the granting of incentives has global ramifications, as it creates a &#8220;race to the 
bottom&#8221;. There are also significant implications for the right to information, transparency 
and accountability, as tax incentives are often negotiated in secret between the Government 
and the company concerned, fostering corruption and weak governance. 
</p>
<p>66. Incentives sometimes take the form of a &#8220;tax stability&#8221; &#8220;or &#8220;advance pricing&#8221; 
agreement, signed with foreign investors to insulate them from future changes in the 
domestic tax rates for an extended period of time. These types of agreement should also be 
examined with caution under human rights law, because they reduce public resources 
regardless of the evolving impact on human rights.90 
</p>
<p>67. As in any case where a State is alleged to be failing to use its maximum 
available resources to fulfil obligations to progressively realize economic, social and 
cultural rights, incentives would have to be justified by a clear description of deliberate, 
concrete and targeted advances towards the fulfilment of human rights that can be expected 
from their implementation.91 States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights would also have the burden of proving periodically that the 
granting of corporate tax breaks was the least restrictive policy option from the perspective 
of economic, social and cultural rights.92  
</p>
<p><b> D. Broadening the contributions of the financial sector 
</b></p>
<p>68. The huge growth of the financial sector in recent decades and the bailout in the wake of 
the 2008-2009 crisis raise significant human rights concerns. It is clear that at least some of 
the profitability growth was precisely due to the risk-taking and leveraging that ultimately 
proved excessive, resulting in a huge rescue from public funds that could have been used 
for poverty reduction and the realization of human rights. The sector&#8217;s excess returns were 
thus made, at least partially, at the expense of the public, while its tax rates were kept low. 
The owners, managers and/or creditors of financial institutions were able to enjoy the full 
gains of good times, whereas ordinary taxpayers were expected to shoulder the costs to save 
the sector as it was collapsing, while also having to endure austerity measures. 93 
Insufficiently regulated financial sectors have also played a role in enabling the aggressive

<p>avoidance or evasion of taxation by other actors, for instance through structured finance 
instruments,94 transfer pricing or profit shifting (see paras. 74 &#8211; 78 below).  
</p><p>69. Low tax demands of the financial sector and lack of regulation may therefore be 
indicative of a State&#8217;s unwillingness (rather than inability) to use its maximum available 
resources. Increasing taxation of the financial sector could play a role in redressing this 
balance and discourage the excessive risk-taking that led to the crisis.95 Taxes on certain 
types of financial transactions have been introduced in various jurisdictions (including in 
India, Peru, South Korea and Sweden) as a way to raise revenue from the financial sector as 
well as to deter speculative trading activities that generate risks for the whole of society (in 
the form of crises or fluctuations in food/fuel prices). This measure could also enable States 
to better comply with several human rights obligations, in particular those regarding 
economic, social and cultural rights.96 
</p>
<p><b> E. Ensuring sustainable use of natural resources while respecting rights 
</b></p>
<p>70. Natural resources can be a vital source of revenue that the State can use to comply with 
its human rights obligations. The financial and social benefits of natural resource 
exploitation are, however, increasingly bypassing people in producing countries. In most 
countries, extractive industries generate few jobs directly and have only weak links to local 
markets. 97  Far from bringing benefits, the exploitation of natural resources has been 
frequently linked to human rights abuse and encroachment on lands and livelihoods of 
communities, mass evictions, pollution and environmental degradation, which may result in 
violations of rights to health, food, housing and water.98 The right of people to participate in 
decisions regarding natural resources is often violated, especially where the land, territory 
and resources of indigenous peoples is concerned.  
</p>
<p>71. In addition, the rightful benefits in terms of revenue often go abroad (sometimes to tax 
havens),99 aided by the fact that extractive industries are often not required to disclose their 
profits on a project-by-project basis. The public revenue generated through taxes on the 
sector remains well below potential;100 the revenue secured by many resource-rich countries 
is very low in relation to the value of exports.101  
</p>
<p>72. A State allowing or directly undertaking exploitation of natural resources without 
ensuring that a fair share of the proceeds are taxed and/or allocated towards fulfilling 
human rights could be an indication of a failure to mobilize adequate resources. Moreover,

<p>excessive reliance on revenues from finite natural resources raises concerns not only about 
long-term sustainability but also governance and accountability.102 
</p>
<p>73. The political processes and policy choices that guide the capture and distribution of 
revenues from natural resource exploitation often determine whether they can be allocated 
for the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights, poverty reduction and 
social development. Good macroeconomic management of natural resources, such as 
stabilization funds, exchange rate and monetary policies, and financial and industrial 
policies that foster diversification are critical to enabling inclusive and sustainable 
development from natural resource exploitation. 103  Decisions about natural resource 
extraction must therefore be made with care, taking into account environmental concerns 
and the rights of future generations while respecting the rights of the entire population.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Enhancing international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>74. In order to take effective and decisive action in these matters, concerted international 
cooperation is necessary. Without absolving any State of its obligation to raise the 
maximum available resources domestically to ensure the progressive realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights, there are limits to national-level actions in the absence 
of global reforms. Many States are undoubtedly hamstrung in their efforts to enact 
progressive taxation and combat illicit financial flows that could fight inequality and 
enhance the realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>75. Globalization and increased cross-border flows of goods and capital have vastly 
increased the chances that one State&#8217;s actions or omissions may affect another State&#8217;s 
ability to raise public revenues, and increased the ways and means that companies and 
individuals can use to evade and avoid taxes.104 Illicit financial flows inevitably involve at 
least two countries. The tax laws and structures of one State can therefore erode the 
national tax bases of other States and hamper the application of progressive tax rates and 
the achievement of redistributive goals, ultimately threatening the realization of rights. 
There is a therefore a particularly urgent need for States to cooperate proactively on matters 
of tax and fiscal policy. In particular, high-income States that enable or fail to tackle tax 
abuse and illicit financial flows should shoulder some responsibility for the shortcomings of 
the tax and public finance systems in developing countries and related poverty rates, lack of 
enjoyment of human rights and economic inequalities. 
</p><p>76. While the rules of some international treaties address the handling of cross-border 
financial flows, they are manifestly inadequate to deal with the nature of modern globalized 
business. Owing to gaps in the interaction of different tax systems and, in some cases, 
because of the application of bilateral tax treaties, income from cross-border activities may 
go untaxed anywhere or be simply undertaxed.105 Transnational corporations are able to 
shift profits across borders &#8211; including to tax havens where they have little or no real 
commercial presence &#8211; in order to take advantage of tax rates that are lower than in the 
country where the profit is made. This practice, which deprives both developed and

<p>developing countries of billions of dollars worth of potential tax revenue, is known as tax 
&#8220;base erosion and profit shifting&#8221;.106 
</p>
<p>77. The annual loss to Africa from transfer mispricing has been estimated at $38 billion, 
higher than the flow of development assistance to the region over the same period.107 The 
problem is exacerbated by a lack of accessible information on &#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221; (the 
ultimate owner of companies, trusts and funds) and the fact that companies are not required 
to report systematically their income and activities on a country-by-country basis. 
</p>
<p>78. A new multilateral tax regime based on the premise of tax cooperation over competition 
is therefore urgently required. Existing mechanisms, such as the Committee of Experts on 
International Cooperation on Tax Matters, could play an important role with more 
dedicated support. Now is the time to take decisive action towards cooperation, guided by 
human rights principles. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>79<b>. States must realize the full potential of tax collection as a tool to generate revenue 
for the fulfilment of human rights obligations and to redress discrimination and 
inequality. Human rights principles regarding participation, transparency, 
accountability and non-discrimination should be followed throughout the whole 
revenue-raising cycle. For this purpose, States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Seek to increase tax revenue in a manner compatible with their human 
rights obligations of non-discrimination and equality, and increase the allocation of 
revenues collected to budget areas that contribute to the enjoyment of human rights;  
 (b) Invest financial resources and political will in strengthening national tax 
authorities, ensuring that they have technical and budgetary autonomy and that their 
staff is professionalized;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Increase reliance on personal and direct taxes, and design all taxes in 
ways that reduce regressive impact and gender bias; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Carefully consider the income tax threshold to ensure that persons below 
or near the poverty line are not driven deeper into poverty by tax policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Conduct human rights assessments of fiscal policy periodically and with 
broad public participation, including analysis of the distributional consequences and 
tax burden borne by different income sectors and disadvantaged groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Review tax structures, codes and instruments for explicit and implicit 
gender bias and ensure they do not reinforce existing gender inequalities, including 
through their impact on unpaid care work;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure that people have access to all relevant data and information on 
fiscal policy and government revenues, including from the corporate sector, and 
include such information under right to information laws; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Take measures to build the capacity of all people to understand fiscal 
policy options, and establish inclusive mechanisms to ensure that they are actively 
engaged in devising the most appropriate policy options;

</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Institute fully transparent public oversight over the granting and 
monitoring of tax incentives, and conduct periodic assessments of social benefits and

individuals who will be most affected; and refrain from granting fixed-term tax 
holidays and tax stability agreements that may undermine accountability for evolving 
impact on human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Ensure accessible channels for accountability and remedy for any 
negative human rights impact of fiscal policy, including by strengthening the capacity 
of the judicial system and national human rights institutions to address fiscal policy; 
 (l) Ensure that extractive industries are subject to appropriate tax rates and 
export duties, and that the human rights of affected communities and future 
generations are protected in the exploitation of natural resources;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) Proactively disclose information on contracts, concessions and licensing 
agreements in the extractive sector and related information, including expected tax 
revenues and export royalty rates; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Ensure the public revenue raised from the financial sector is 
commensurate to the sector&#8217;s profitability and the risks it generates; implement a 
financial transaction tax, and consider allocating the revenues specifically to 
expenditure that can contribute to the realization of human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Implement regulations that prevent the role played by the financial sector 
in aiding tax evasion and profit-shifting. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> With regard to international cooperation and extraterritorial impact, each State 
should refrain from any conduct that impairs the ability of another State to raise 
revenue as required by their human rights commitments, and cooperate in creating an 
international environment that enables all States to fulfil their human rights 
obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> For the above-mentioned purpose, States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Actively pursue international cooperation in tax matters, working 
towards a multilateral regime for tax transparency that tackles tax abuse; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Enact clear legislation and regulations to ensure that companies domiciled 
in their territory respect human rights in their operations everywhere, including in 
tax planning practices;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Provide, when in a position and requested to do so, funding and technical 
assistance to strengthen the capacity of tax authorities in less developed countries to 
collect taxes and to adhere to international agreements that benefit them;

Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, support its 
upgrade to intergovernmental status, and support the implementation of its Model 
Tax Convention and the Code of Conduct on Cooperation in Combating International 
Tax Evasion and Avoidance; </b></p>


<p><b> (f) Adopt country-by-country reporting standards for all transnational 
corporations; in the case of extractive industries, also enforce project-by-project 
disclosure standards, such as those embodied in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform

them to all extractive industry companies listed on their stock exchanges; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Adopt a framework that commits it to full disclosure of beneficial 
ownership of registered companies through national public registries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Include a commitment to align fiscal policy with human rights obligations

<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that international economic bodies and 
financial institutions, in particular IMF, the European Union, the World Bank, the 
European Central Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development</b>: 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Consider human rights obligations and impact when setting conditions 
and policies in the area of fiscal policy; in particular, promote progressive rather than 
regressive taxation and ensure that all States are granted space to conduct counter-
cyclical fiscal policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Utilize their significant technical capacity to help Governments to 
broaden their fiscal space and redistributive capacities in accordance with their 
human rights obligations;
