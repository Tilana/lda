</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and is 
entitled to a social and international order, in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, the 
Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977, other international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law instruments and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, and Human 
Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 and decision 5/101 of 18 June 2007, and resolution 
16/21 of 25 March 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling in particular</i> that the Human Rights Council has the mandate to, inter alia, 
serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that millions of people around the world are affected by systematic 
human rights violations and abuses in armed conflicts, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p>  
 &#61482; The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of 
</p>
<p>the Council on its twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/24/2), Part One. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling </i>the principles and provisions related to international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, and to the promotion of responsible action by States, as 
contained in the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the General Assembly on 2 April 2013,1 as 
well as in other relevant instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all efforts should be made to ensure the cessation of all violations 
and abuses of, and the full respect for, international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law in armed conflicts, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses its deep concern </i>at the fact that arms transfers to those involved in 
armed conflicts may seriously undermine the human rights of civilians, especially women, 
children, the elderly, persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Notes with alarm</i> that such arms transfers can have a seriously negative 
impact on the human rights of women and girls, who may be disproportionately affected by 
the widespread availability of arms, as it may increase the risk of sexual and gender-based 
violence, and may also contribute to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Urges</i> all States to refrain from transferring arms to those involved in armed 
conflicts when said States assess, in accordance with their applicable national procedures 
and international obligations and standards, that such arms are sufficiently likely to be used 
to commit or facilitate serious violations or abuses of international human rights law or 
international humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> all relevant special procedures, commissions of inquiry and human 
rights treaty bodies to bear the present resolution in mind, within the framework of their 
respective mandates, when considering the situation of human rights in armed conflicts.
