<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent visited Brazil from 
</p>
<p>4 to 14 December 2013, at the invitation of the Government. The members of the 
</p>
<p>delegation were Mireille Fanon-Mend&#232;s-France and Maya Sahli, independent experts.  
</p>
<p>2. They met government and State officials in Bahia, Bras&#237;lia, Pernambuco, S&#227;o Paulo 
</p>
<p>and Rio de Janeiro. In each State, the experts also met municipal-level organs of the 
</p>
<p>National System for the Promotion of Racial Equality, the justice system, the police, human 
</p>
<p>rights and public ministries as well as local civil society organizations, including those of 
</p>
<p>African descent working on a wide range of human rights issues. In Bahia and Pernambuco, 
</p>
<p>they visited traditional Quilombola and Terreiro communities; in S&#227;o Paulo, the State 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s prison and the Museum of Afro-Brazilian Culture and in Rio de Janeiro the 
</p>
<p>Providencia Favela and the LAESER
1
 research group in the Federal University of Rio de 
</p>
<p>Janeiro. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group&#8217;s visit to Brazil can be considered in part as a follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>visit in 2005 of the Special Rapporteur against contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.2 
</p>
<p>4. The experts wish to thank the Government for its invitation and assistance during 
</p>
<p>the visit, in particular representatives of the Itamaraty and the Secretariat of Policies for the 
</p>
<p>Promotion of Racial Equality (SEPPIR). They would also like to thank the academics, civil 
</p>
<p>society, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and particularly Afro-Brazilians met 
</p>
<p>during their visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Historical context  
</b></p>
<p>5. Brazil received 40 per cent of the estimated tens of millions of enslaved Africans 
</p>
<p>brought to the Americas and in 1888 became the last country in the region to abolish 
</p>
<p>enslavement. The Republic was proclaimed in 1889 and a federal and decentralized system 
</p>
<p>was adopted. Whereas the non-white population could not afford a high level of economic 
</p>
<p>development, immigration policies to &#8220;whiten&#8221; the population were adopted in the early 
</p>
<p>twentieth century; racism and racial discrimination rooted in the ideological pillars of the 
</p>
<p>slave system and colonization prevailed. Brazil was considered to be a &#8220;racial democracy&#8221; 
</p>
<p>with racism and racial discrimination absent from Brazilian society, yet they remained in 
</p>
<p>the collective unconscious. The legacy of the slave trade, enslavement and colonialism 
</p>
<p>upheld the idea that black people, if allowed into the dominant system, would destroy it 
</p>
<p>from within. 
</p>
<p>6. While Brazil enjoyed rapid economic growth in the early twenty-first century, that 
</p>
<p>has slowed down in recent years with rising inflation. In 2012, the economy of Brazil grew 
</p>
<p>by 0.9 per cent. The immense size and diversity of Brazil coupled with its federal system 
</p>
<p>make for an extremely complex context. States have varying levels of development, thus, 
</p>
<p>the north-east, which has the largest percentage of Afro-Brazilians, has some of the poorest 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p> 2 Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and related intolerance, Doudou Di&#232;ne (E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.3). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/68/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>and least developed States. Brazil can no longer be called a racial democracy, but as 
</p>
<p>expressed by civil society and some State bodies, it is characterized by institutional racism, 
</p>
<p>in which racial hierarchies are culturally accepted as natural.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ethnic and demographic situation  
</b></p>
<p>7. Brazil has a population of more than 190.7 million. With 47.7 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population identifying as white, 7.6 per cent as &#8220;black&#8221; (<i>preto</i>), 43.1 per cent as &#8220;brown&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(<i>pardo</i>), 1.1 per cent as &#8220;yellow&#8221; and 0.4 per cent indigenous, the 2010 census reported for 
</p>
<p>the first time that Afro-Brazilians3 made up more than half of the population (96,800,000 
</p>
<p>people).4  
</p>
<p>8. Despite making up more than half the country&#8217;s population, Afro-Brazilian 
</p>
<p>economic participation is only 20 per cent of gross domestic product. Unemployment is 
</p>
<p>50 per cent higher among Afro-Brazilians than European descendants and the average 
</p>
<p>monthly income of European descendants is US$ 860, nearly double that of Afro-Brazilians 
</p>
<p>at US$ 466.5 The life expectancy of Afro-Brazilians is only 66 years compared to 72 years 
</p>
<p>for European descendants. Food security remains an issue for Afro-Brazilians; 43 per cent 
</p>
<p>experienced food insecurity compared to 24 per cent of white Brazilians.6 A total of 52 per 
</p>
<p>cent of Afro-Brazilians lack housing with adequate sanitation, compared to 28 per cent of 
</p>
<p>European descendants, and 26 per cent of Afro-Brazilians live in households without 
</p>
<p>running water, compared to 8 per cent of European descendants.7  
</p>
<p>9. Many Afro-Brazilians belong to traditional communities and populations; Quilombo 
</p>
<p>heritage communities and Terreiro traditional African religious communities. Quilombos </p>
<p>are the descendants of escaped African slaves who created organized free communities, as 
</p>
<p>well as Afro-Brazilians living on lands inherited or donated due to services to the State, 
</p>
<p>lands that they occupied and cultivated within private estates and lands purchased during or 
</p>
<p>after slavery. According to SEPPIR, there are at present 2,400 certified Quilombo heritage 
</p>
<p>communities, but the real total could surpass 3,000 representing some 1.7 million people. 
</p>
<p>They continue to assert their cultural identity and historical ties to their lands. However 
</p>
<p>realizing rights to official land titles remains a challenge. Conditions in those communities 
</p>
<p>are some of the worst in Brazil, lacking access to water, sanitation, education, health and 
</p>
<p>transport services. 
</p>
<p>10. There is a considerable population of migrants and refugees of African descent 
</p>
<p>living in Brazil, who are at risk of multiple discrimination based both on their African 
</p>
<p>descent and their immigration status. According to the country&#8217;s National Committee for 
</p>
<p>Refugees,8 65 per cent of asylum seekers in Brazil are from the continent of Africa, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The terms &#8220;Afro-Brazilian&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; are used here in to refer to all those self-declared as <i>preto </i>or </p>
<p><i>pardo </i>in the 2010 census unless otherwise specified.

<p>including Angolans, Congolese and Liberians.9 There are also large numbers of Colombian 
</p>
<p>and Haitian refugees, many of whom are Afro-descendants. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Racism and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>11. Racism and discrimination, particularly at the institutional level, were raised as 
</p>
<p>serious concerns by several members of civil society and government representatives 
</p>
<p>working on racial equality. Racism permeates all areas of life yet it has been difficult for 
</p>
<p>Afro-Brazilians to raise and discuss the issue as many national and international academics 
</p>
<p>and actors still subscribe to the racial democracy myth. This is often used by conservative 
</p>
<p>politicians to discredit affirmative actions and targeted policies and laws. 
</p>
<p>12. Several institutions for the promotion of racial equality such as CEPIR (State 
</p>
<p>Committee for the Promotion of Ethnoracial Equality) in Pernambuco, focus on reducing 
</p>
<p>institutional racism including sensitizing and capacity-building work with police officers. 
</p>
<p>The Pernambuco Public Ministry created a working group against racism which researches 
</p>
<p>the prevalence of institutional racism, holds public audiences and sensitization workshops 
</p>
<p>with police, public service providers and human rights defenders and capacity-building for 
</p>
<p>members of the black movement. 
</p>
<p>13. The Municipal Secretary for Reparations of Salvador da Bahia spoke about 
</p>
<p>widespread manifestations of racism and racial inequality based on &#8220;pigmentocracy&#8221; 
</p>
<p>against Afro-Brazilians, despite their being the majority of the population, and about the 
</p>
<p>invisibility and xenophobia from which they suffer. Efforts have been made in certain 
</p>
<p>municipalities to combat institutional racism through the creation of an intersectoral 
</p>
<p>working group on racism and racial equality with representation from different secretariats, 
</p>
<p>training the general public and staff members of governmental bodies on non-
</p>
<p>discrimination to deconstruct the myth that racism does not exist.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>14. Brazil&#8217;s domestic legal system provides for a clear prohibition of racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination. The Constitution of Brazil
10
</p>
<p> criminalizes acts of racism subjecting them to 
</p>
<p>imprisonment without the right to bail or prescription. This prohibition is reflected in Law 
</p>
<p>No. 7716
11
</p>
<p> that was later modified by Law No. 9459,
12
</p>
<p> which expanded its focus to include 
</p>
<p>acts arising not only from racial discrimination but also discrimination based on ethnicity, 
</p>
<p>religion or nationality.
13
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15. Several decrees have been adopted to address the specific situation of traditional 
</p>
<p>communities and peoples including Quilombola communities and African religious 
</p>
<p>communities. Decree No. 6040/2007 created a National Policy for Sustainable 
</p>

</p>
<p>Development of Traditional People and Communities. In addition Decree No. 6261/2007 
</p>
<p>created the Quilombola Social Agenda.  
</p>
<p>16. In the area of education, Law No. 10.369 of 2003 established guidelines and bases 
</p>
<p>for national education and included mandatory teaching of Afro-Brazilian history and 
</p>
<p>culture in educational institutions. Following a landmark ruling
14
</p>
<p> by the Supreme Court on 
</p>
<p>the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education, the Quota Law was adopted 
</p>
<p>establishing quotas for students from public schools, Afro-Brazilians and indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples to increase access to higher education (discussed further in chapter IV.A). 
</p>
<p>17. Significant advances have been made in the area of racial equality legislation. 
</p>
<p>Decree No. 6872/2009 approved the National Plan for the Promotion of Racial Equality, 
</p>
<p>including actions for employment and economic development, education, health, cultural 
</p>
<p>diversity, human rights and public security, traditional peoples and communities, 
</p>
<p>international policy, social development and food security, infrastructure and youth. That 
</p>
<p>was translated into a federal law with the adoption of the Statute of Racial Equality,
15
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>which defines the principal areas to be addressed by public bodies in order to overcome 
</p>
<p>racial inequality. 
</p>
<p>18. Several States and municipalities have developed laws against racism, for example 
</p>
<p>S&#227;o Paulo State Law No. 14&#8211;187 of 2010,  which punishes acts of racial discrimination 
</p>
<p>providing channels for complaints and sanction. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. SEPPIR, created in 2003, participated in the development of the Multi-Annual 
</p>
<p>Plan
16
</p>
<p> of Brazil, resulting in the Thematic Programme against Racism and Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Racial Equality being included in 25 other programmes, 96 goals and 52 initiatives and 10 
</p>
<p>budgetary activities in different areas of the Government.
17
</p>
<p> Through the coordination of the 
</p>
<p>National System for the Promotion of Racial Equality, there are also State and municipal 
</p>
<p>institutions for the promotion of racial equality in many regions of Brazil. Those 
</p>
<p>institutions work in partnership with other State and municipal secretariats to combat 
</p>
<p>racism and discrimination and promote racial equality. Their activities include: promoting 
</p>
<p>programmes for vulnerable groups and affirmative action initiatives, supporting the 
</p>
<p>implementation of legislation and policy including State and municipal-level action plan 
</p>
<p>monitoring; courses for the promotion of racial equality since 2012,
18
</p>
<p> coordinating and 
</p>
<p>advising on the formulation of new policies for racial equality. 
</p>
<p>20. SEPPIR has several sub-secretaries and departments including: a secretariat for 
</p>
<p>Affirmative Action Policies, and for Policies for Traditional Communities. A parliamentary 
</p>
<p>adviser works with the National Congress assisting with legislative proposals for the 
</p>
<p>promotion of racial equality.
19
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21. Significant legal and policy advances have been made for Afro-Brazilians in 
</p>
<p>general, particularly during the Lula administration.

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>concerned that many of the bodies, particularly at State and municipal levels, are lacking 
</p>
<p>sufficient financial and human resources to carry out their activities. Many have low 
</p>
<p>visibility in terms of physical presence and position within State or municipal governments.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, the increased focus at the legislative and policy level on Afro-Brazilians 
</p>
<p>has led to new opposition and challenges to targeted policies addressing racial inequality. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group is concerned that progress made to date is at risk of regression due to 
</p>
<p>threats, particularly from right-wing groups.  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, many targeted anti-discrimination measures are designed for 
</p>
<p>minorities. Afro-Brazilians now constitute a majority and are continuing to grow, thus 
</p>
<p>racial equality and social inclusion need to be part of universal policies for the society as a 
</p>
<p>whole.  
</p>
<p>24. Many representatives of civil society expressed concern that current poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction policies, which stimulate growth, are not sufficient for addressing the specific 
</p>
<p>social and economic inequality faced by Afro-Brazilians. The argument that racism and 
</p>
<p>racial inequality are a consequence of poverty is often used to justify policies which reduce 
</p>
<p>poverty but not necessarily eliminating racism. There is very often an intersectionality 
</p>
<p>between poverty and racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Affirmative action policies 
</b></p>
<p>25. Brazil has been a regional leader in affirmative action policies in employment and 
</p>
<p>education for Afro-Brazilians and other marginalized groups. Many of those actions are 
</p>
<p>supported or accompanied by the SEPPIR Secretariat for Affirmative Action policies in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with other public and private bodies.  
</p>
<p>26. Affirmative action based on race/ethnicity in Brazil has been legislated upon since 
</p>
<p>2003 when Decree No. 4886 created the National Policy for the Promotion of Racial 
</p>
<p>Equality. It has faced serious opposition in Brazil with opponents arguing that it risked 
</p>
<p>exacerbating racial differences and conflicts. Others argued that the racially mixed society 
</p>
<p>of Brazil made targeted affirmative action policies too complex or that such policies 
</p>
<p>constituted racial discrimination against those not eligible. The Working Group notes that 
</p>
<p>there is also another risk, that special measures are pretenses to hide racial discrimination 
</p>
<p>that affects a large part of Brazilian society. 
</p>
<p>27. Quotas based on State law and demographics have been in operation in some 
</p>
<p>universities since 2004 enabling greater access to higher education. For example, in 2012 
</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s law reserved 20 per cent of places on any course for students self-
</p>
<p>identified as &#8220;black&#8221; as well as 20 per cent for students from public schools, and 5 per cent 
</p>
<p>for other excluded groups.  
</p>
<p>28. The Integrated Programme of Affirmative Action for Afro-descendants, Brasil 
</p>
<p>Afroatitude, a partnership between 10 universities and the Ministry of Health was 
</p>
<p>established to support Afro-Brazilian quota students. With support from SEPPIR and the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education it provides financial support to 500 <i>quotista</i> students promoting their 
</p>
<p>participation in diverse academic initiatives.
21
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>29. While it is still too early to fully assess the impact of the quota system for Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians, some research will be discussed below in the section on education.

<p><b> IV. Thematic areas 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Education 
</b></p>
<p>30. Education is compulsory for children between 6 and 14 years of age and there is 
</p>
<p>currently an enrolment rate of 98 per cent for this age group. The 2 per cent not enrolled 
</p>
<p>tends to be in marginalized, rural communities including Quilombola communities. Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilian children and young people have traditionally had lower access to education than 
</p>
<p>Brazilians of European descent. In 2008, young Brazilians of European descent attended 
</p>
<p>school for eight years, while Afro-Brazilians had only six years of schooling.22 
</p>
<p>31. As Afro-Brazilians are overrepresented among the rural population of Brazil, one of 
</p>
<p>the barriers they face is the distance from school. The Working Group welcomes initiatives 
</p>
<p>to address this issue such as the Ministry of Education&#8217;s Caminho da Escola Programme, 
</p>
<p>launched in 2007. It provides safe quality transport for students in rural areas to access 
</p>
<p>schools.
23
</p>
<p> The Ministry&#8217;s Plan of Articulated Action includes work with States and 
</p>
<p>municipalities to develop technical and financial assistance for education in indigenous, 
</p>
<p>Quilombola and rural areas.
24
</p>
<p> Afro-Brazilians have some of the highest rates of illiteracy. 
</p>
<p>32. While between 1988 and 2008 rates of illiteracy fell at a faster rate among Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians than among the white population, in 2008 illiteracy was still twice as common 
</p>
<p>among Afro-Brazilians as among European descendants: 13.6 per cent compared to 6.2 per 
</p>
<p>cent.
25
</p>
<p> The worst rates of illiteracy were in the north-east of Brazil, the region with the 
</p>
<p>highest black population, where over 15 per cent of whites and 20 per cent of Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians were illiterate.
26
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33. The Ministry of Education&#8217;s Literate Brazil Programme, created in 2003, helps to 
</p>
<p>overcome illiteracy among adults, young people and the elderly. The Programme works 
</p>
<p>throughout the country with particular focus on 1,928 municipalities with more than 25 per 
</p>
<p>cent illiteracy rates. Between 2003 and 2010, an estimated 13 million people benefited from 
</p>
<p>the Programme.
27 
</p>
<p>White students are much more likely than Afro-Brazilian students to 
</p>
<p>attend private schools. In 2008, at the first level of basic education, only 7.7 per cent of 
</p>
<p>Afro-Brazilian students were in private institutions, compared to 18.2 per cent of students 
</p>
<p>of European descent. At middle level, only 7.7 per cent of Afro-Brazilians were educated in 
</p>
<p>private schools and 20.3 per cent of white students.
28 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34. According to civil society, the history and contributions of Afro-Brazilians have 
</p>
<p>been invisible within the education system. Racism and discrimination are a problem in 
</p>
<p>many educational institutions with negative stereotypes of Africans. In 1985, the 
</p>
<p>Government implemented the National Didactic Book Programme to prevent the use of 
</p>
<p>images that transmitted racism or prejudice against indigenous peoples and people of 
</p>
<p>African descent.
29 
</p>
<p>Civil society members in Pernambuco complained of racist attitudes

</b></p>
<p>displayed by teachers towards their students concerning their culture, religion, hair and 
</p>
<p>appearance.  
</p>
<p>35. The adoption of Law No. 10.639 in 2003 sought to address those issues by 
</p>
<p>amending the General Education Law to include African and Afro-Brazilian history in the 
</p>
<p>national curriculum making African and Afro-Brazilian history and culture compulsory at 
</p>
<p>basic and secondary education levels.
30
</p>
<p> The Working Group welcomes this law as an 
</p>
<p>important step which should contribute to the elimination of racist attitudes within society 
</p>
<p>and also provide Afro-Brazilian children and young people with a culturally relevant 
</p>
<p>education. It notes with appreciation the many steps taken at both national and local levels 
</p>
<p>for its implementation. 
</p>
<p>36. As part of its work to promote the implementation of Law No. 10.639 and Law 
</p>
<p>No. 11.635 on religious intolerance, the Pernambuco Committee for the Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Ethnoracial Equality runs a course for priests in theology of religions of African origin in 
</p>
<p>partnership with the Catholic University of Pernambuco and the Higher Education 
</p>
<p>Foundation of Olinda. In 2008, the Ministry of Education developed a network of history 
</p>
<p>teachers in all universities, thereby ensuring since 2011 the inclusion of history teaching in 
</p>
<p>teacher training courses in universities. The Ministry has translated all eight volumes of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization&#8217;s General History of 
</p>
<p>Africa series into Portuguese for use in school teaching.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group remains concerned at reports from civil society about the 
</p>
<p>obstacles faced in the implementation of Law No. 10.639, including the lack of suitable 
</p>
<p>training for teachers, lack of relevant school materials and opposition from ultraright, 
</p>
<p>evangelical sects to the teaching of Afro-Brazilian cultural and religious traditions. Civil 
</p>
<p>society in S&#227;o Paulo spoke of the resistance of teachers to teaching Afro-Brazilian history 
</p>
<p>and culture, with many failing to see their importance. 
</p>
<p>38. In 2005, the Ministry of Education launched the University for All programme,31 
</p>
<p>which promoted access to higher education for low-income students through partial and 
</p>
<p>complete bursaries in private higher education institutions. Between 2005 and 2011, 
</p>
<p>912,204 bursaries were provided, 48 per cent of which went to Afro-Brazilian students.
32
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39. In 2009, SEPPIR with the National Council for Scientific and Technological 
</p>
<p>Development launched the Institutional Programme of Bursary Scientific Initiation in 
</p>
<p>Affirmative Action which offers around 800 bursaries per year to quota students in federal 
</p>
<p>educational institutions.
33
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>40. Following legal challenges claiming that affirmative action in higher education 
</p>
<p>constituted discrimination, the Federal Supreme Court unanimously ruled the use of racial 
</p>
<p>quotas in education
34
</p>
<p> as constitutional. On 29 August 2012, Law No. 12.711, the Quota 
</p>
<p>Law, was adopted, establishing criteria for quotas for students from public schools, Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians and indigenous peoples, defining a minimum of 50 per cent access to federal 
</p>
<p>universities and technical further education institutions.  
</p>
<p>41. Despite its critics, affirmative action has had an impact on the higher educational 
</p>
<p>opportunities of Afro-Brazilians as well as other disadvantaged groups. Yet, the Working 
</p>
<p>Group remains concerned about the limitations of applying affirmative action. In 2008, 
</p>
<p>26.3 per cent of higher education institutions provided quotas for access to education for

</p>
<p> 34 On 26 April 2012. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/68/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>Afro-Brazilians, indigenous peoples, public school students, Quilombo and/or students 
</p>
<p>from other groups in situation of disadvantage. However, the number of quotas 
</p>
<p>corresponded only to 10.5 per cent of the places available in higher education institutions.
35
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>42. In the same year, 45.9 per cent of quotas went to students from public schools, 
</p>
<p>38.3 per cent to Afro-Brazilians including those from Quilombola communities, 3 per cent 
</p>
<p>to indigenous peoples, 3.3 per cent to students with special needs and 9.5 per cent to other 
</p>
<p>groups. While quotas enable initial access to higher education, associated costs can still 
</p>
<p>make education difficult for students. Furthermore, certain Afro-Brazilian students face 
</p>
<p>difficulties in finalizing higher education, due to the unequal access that they encounter to 
</p>
<p>quality secondary education.  
</p>
<p>43. The Working Group hopes that with the recent adoption of the Quota Law, future 
</p>
<p>research will be able to show more positive data on the implementation of higher education 
</p>
<p>quotas; they are certainly necessary, as a first step, to change the structural institutional 
</p>
<p>racism.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>44. Afro-Brazilians are underrepresented in State and municipal governments, 
</p>
<p>particularly in senior positions except for within mechanisms for the promotion of racial 
</p>
<p>equality. For example the Municipal Secretary for Affirmative Action in Salvador is the 
</p>
<p>only Afro-Brazilian of the municipality&#8217;s 12 secretaries.  
</p>
<p>45. There have been initiatives to increase Afro-Brazilian representation among public 
</p>
<p>positions. The Minister of the Supreme Court,
36
</p>
<p> the reporting Minister for the <i>Quotas </i>case 
</p>
<p>in the Supreme Court, told the Working Group that while they were able to argue for the 
</p>
<p>constitutionality of quotas in education, such affirmative action in employment, particularly 
</p>
<p>in the private sector, would be much harder. Without sufficient levels of education 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups were unable to access professional positions.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Culture 
</b></p>
<p>46. The issue of Afro-Brazilian culture within Brazilian society is complex, as the 
</p>
<p>Working Group learned from meetings with both government bodies and civil society. On 
</p>
<p>the surface, Afro-Brazilian culture may seem to have important recognition, as the most 
</p>
<p>celebrated cultural manifestations of Brazil have roots in Afro-Brazilian traditions, such as 
</p>
<p>samba music, carnival and capoeira. Yet, many of those traditions have become 
</p>
<p>appropriated by wider society, commercialized and commoditized to such a degree that 
</p>
<p>they are no longer available to Afro-Brazilian communities.  
</p>
<p>47. The Municipal Secretary of Reparations of Salvador coordinates a Racial 
</p>
<p>Observatory for Carnival specifically to monitor and address that problem. 
</p>
<p>48. Other Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations remain on the margins of Brazilian 
</p>
<p>culture; artists and writers face barriers in accessing funding or recognition for their work. 
</p>
<p>The positive promotion and maintenance of Afro-Brazilian cultural traditions are 
</p>
<p>fundamental for promoting a positive self-identity for young people, challenging racism 
</p>
<p>and increasing participation in wider society.

</b></p>
<p>49. The Working Group met with the Director and representatives of the Palmares 
</p>
<p>Cultural Foundation, the country&#8217;s first public institution focused on the promotion of Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilian art and culture. Representatives of the Foundation stressed that the budget for 
</p>
<p>work on Afro-Brazilian culture was currently less than 10 per cent of the overall budget for 
</p>
<p>culture in Brazil. 
</p>
<p>50. Since 1999 the Afro-Brazilian group Olodum has run a Creative Schools Project &#8212; 
</p>
<p>the Interdisciplinary Project for Development of Citizenship and Preservation of Black 
</p>
<p>Culture &#8212; which promotes positive identity and intellectual development for students. 
</p>
<p>Using the framework of Law No. 10.639, it transforms pedagogical practices (including the 
</p>
<p>use of Afro-Brazilian culture and art to form conscious citizens); confronts inequalities, 
</p>
<p>breaks barriers of racial prejudice, provides a participatory space for the community and 
</p>
<p>disseminates information about the importance of African culture in the construction of 
</p>
<p>Brazilian society. 
</p>
<p>51. Another concern raised by several members of civil society was the World Cup 
</p>
<p>(2014) and the Olympics (2016). For instance, the Secretary of Social Development and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in Pernambuco raised human rights concerns as a consequence of the World 
</p>
<p>Cup, such as street clean-ups particularly of children living or working in the streets, sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation, and training for taxi drivers.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>52. Several measures have been adopted to increase Afro-Brazilian participation and 
</p>
<p>representation in decision-making spaces. The Ministry of Justice reserves 20 per cent of its 
</p>
<p>supervisory and high-level advisory roles for Afro-Brazilians. There is no law for quotas to 
</p>
<p>ensure a minimum number of Afro-Brazilian parliamentary candidates.  
</p>
<p>53. Under the initiative of the Nucleus of Black Parliamentarians of the Workers Party 
</p>
<p>and other members of the government, there are a number of legal projects under 
</p>
<p>consideration in the National Congress to increase Afro-Brazilian political participation.
37
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The Constitution Bill
38
</p>
<p> would add an item to the Transitional Constitutional Provisions Act 
</p>
<p>determining reservation of seats for members of the black population in the House of 
</p>
<p>Representatives and the Legislative Assembly.  
</p>
<p>54. Those proposals have been accompanied by the Parliament Advisory of SEPPIR and 
</p>
<p>are in line with initiatives already implemented by several municipal and State governments 
</p>
<p>since 2002. A study carried out by the Institute for Applied Economic Research identified 
</p>
<p>50 such initiatives, four of which were carried out by the State governments of Paran&#225;, 
</p>
<p>Mato Grosso, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul to reserve seats to increase access to 
</p>
<p>public services.
39
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>55. For example, the State of Rio de Janeiro Law No. 6067/2011 reserves 20 per cent of 
</p>
<p>executive and legislative positions (10 per cent where there are less than 20 spaces) for 
</p>
<p>Afro-Brazilians and indigenous peoples. Decree No. 4.3007/2011 reserves 20 per cent of 
</p>
<p>positions in public offices and positions with the executive authorities and the indirect 
</p>
<p>administration for Afro-Brazilians and indigenous peoples.

<p>been approved in the federal administration, setting quotas of 20 per cent for Afro-Brazilian 
</p>
<p>candidates.  
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group welcomes the affirmative action policies which, if implemented 
</p>
<p>successfully, will increase Afro-Brazilian participation and inclusion in higher education, 
</p>
<p>employment and political processes and in the long term contribute to the reduction of 
</p>
<p>racism and discrimination in those institutions and in society in general. At the same time it 
</p>
<p>echoes concerns that some of those initiatives may merely be concessionary actions to 
</p>
<p>avoid having to deal directly with the existence of racism and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>57. Further, the Working Group is concerned at continued opposition and backlash 
</p>
<p>particularly by far right political actors and urges that sufficient support be given to those 
</p>
<p>laws by members of the government to avoid a regression. As one academic in Pernambuco 
</p>
<p>pointed out, whenever affirmative action is raised for public debate racism becomes worse. 
</p>
<p>Yet conversely, as the Municipal Secretary for Reparations in Salvador da Bahia 
</p>
<p>highlighted, one of the biggest obstacles to the implementation of affirmative actions was 
</p>
<p>the lack of acceptance or perception that racism existed. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Administration of justice  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>58. Acts of racism and discrimination are criminalized in accordance with the Federal 
</p>
<p>Constitution, Law No. 7716 on Racism (1989) as well as several other federal, State and 
</p>
<p>municipal-level laws. Yet, victims of racism and discrimination face several barriers to 
</p>
<p>accessing justice and seeking remedies. These include lack of awareness or knowledge of 
</p>
<p>existing protective laws which may prevent them from reporting cases or pressing charges; 
</p>
<p>negative experiences of the justice system and lack of confidence in the process; 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitudes or lack of interest among the police and lawyers; lack of financial 
</p>
<p>resources; and geographical marginalization.
41
</p>
<p> The Municipal Secretary for Affirmative 
</p>
<p>Action in Salvador highlighted that racism cases did not often reach court as at each stage 
</p>
<p>they became weaker and weaker and that they arrived at court as &#8220;injuries&#8221; cases not 
</p>
<p>considered as racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>59. Societal denial of the existence of racism also remains a barrier to access to justice. 
</p>
<p>Several civil society organizations reported that, where cases were brought to court, 
</p>
<p>convictions were difficult to obtain as the racial democracy myth made it difficult to prove 
</p>
<p>prejudice or discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or colour of skin.
42
</p>
<p> There further 
</p>
<p>existed few sensitization or diversity training programmes for judges and other judicial 
</p>
<p>system officials and a lack of available information on the issue.
43
</p>
<p> In 2008, SEPPIR helped 
</p>
<p>introduce a professorship in human rights, which included courses for senior officials of the 
</p>
<p>justice system and federal and State-level courses on the rights of traditional communities.  
</p>
<p>60. There has been a rise in the number of racism cases reaching courts. In the period 
</p>
<p>2005&#8211;2008, 232 second instance cases of racism were heard in courts of justice and a 
</p>
<p>further 41 in regional employment tribunals. Cases in the courts of justice rose from 84 in 
</p>
<p>the period 2005&#8211;2006 to 148 between 2007 and 2008.44 However, while in the period 
</p>
<p>2005&#8211;2006, 39.3 per cent of the cases had a positive outcome for the victims and 52.4 per

</p>
<p>positive outcome for victims and 66.9 per cent ruled in favour of the accused.
45
</p>
<p> In the 
</p>
<p>employment tribunal cases the majority of perpetrators were legal entities (90.2 per cent).
46
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Of the 41 employment tribunal cases between 2005 and 2008, 15 (36.1 per cent) had a 
</p>
<p>positive outcome for the victim while 24 (58.5 per cent) were decided in favour of the 
</p>
<p>accused.
47
</p>
<p> The Working Group is concerned that while there has been an increase in the 
</p>
<p>number of cases of racism being reported and taken up, barriers still exist in achieving 
</p>
<p>convictions for the perpetrators of those crimes. 
</p>
<p>61. There are several mechanisms for access to justice in Brazil. Both the Public 
</p>
<p>Defence and the Public Prosecutor can act judicially or extrajudicially. In appropriate cases, 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial means can be used to mitigate conflicts. The Public Defence acts in 
</p>
<p>administrative, civil and penal areas in favour of the most poor.
48
</p>
<p> This can include 
</p>
<p>possessory actions for the defence of traditional ownership, civil judicial action for the 
</p>
<p>reparation of harm caused to the community and civil public action for the defence of 
</p>
<p>diffuse and collective rights including ethnic and territorial rights as well as those for the 
</p>
<p>defence of the environment, combating pollution and access to natural resources.
49
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>62. The Public Prosecutor can take action in the following areas: penal action for the 
</p>
<p>accountability of crimes against communities; support for situations of both urban and rural 
</p>
<p>land conflicts through mediation; and civic public action for the defence of the diffuse and 
</p>
<p>collective rights including ethnic and territorial rights, defence of the environment, 
</p>
<p>combating pollution and access to natural resources.
50
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>63. The Federal Public Prosecutor51 works on the following areas: protection of the 
</p>
<p>interests of individuals and indigenous communities, families, children and young people, 
</p>
<p>the elderly, minorities and consumers. 
</p>
<p>64. The public hearing is an open space for information in accessible language and 
</p>
<p>adequate formats aimed at collecting and considering societal opinions in the deliberation 
</p>
<p>of problems. In land conflict cases for traditional communities which have not received a 
</p>
<p>rapid response, public hearings have been demonstrated to be successful mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>drawing public attention to situations and pushing for attention from the appropriate

</p>
<p>their rights such as lawyers&#8217; associations.  
</p>

<p><b> 2. Criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>67. The overrepresentation of Afro-Brazilians in the criminal justice system including in 
</p>
<p>custody and in prisons remains a concern. Since the abolition of enslavement Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians have been criminalized, starting with the 1890 Vagrancy Law which outlawed 
</p>
<p>traditionally Afro-Brazilian practices such as capoeira and African religions. This has fed 
</p>
<p>into a culture of racial profiling at all levels of the justice system. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment found that most 
</p>
<p>victims of torture in Brazilian prisons were Afro-Brazilians. According to civil society 
</p>
<p>sources Afro-Brazilians receive higher sentences than their white counterparts for the same 
</p>
<p>crime, and are more likely to suffer discrimination in prison. The Institute for Applied 
</p>
<p>Economic Research found that black people were twice as likely to be killed by the police 
</p>
<p>as whites in cities like Rio de Janeiro.53 The situation of Afro-Brazilians in the criminal 
</p>
<p>justice system in Brazil could be far worse than the data indicate. The Institute for 
</p>
<p>Religious Studies found that police homicides were twice as high as officially reported and 
</p>
<p>that, in the majority of the cases investigated (64 per cent), the victims were shot in the 
</p>
<p>back at close range &#8212; and most of those victims were of African descent.54 
</p>
<p>68. The Ministry of Justice was unable to provide the Working Group with the exact 
</p>
<p>number of Afro-Brazilian prisoners owing to the varied systems for data collection in each 
</p>
<p>State, but it estimates that 75 per cent of the prison population is Afro-Brazilian. According 
</p>
<p>to the S&#227;o Paulo State Secretary of Penitentiary Administration, the majority of Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians in prison are convicted for robbery or drug-trafficking. The Secretary denied any 
</p>
<p>kind of racism or discrimination within the penitentiary system stating that any 
</p>
<p>overrepresentation of Afro-Brazilians in the system would be due to trends in arrests, trials 
</p>
<p>and sentencing. When questioned about violence or torture by prison staff, the Secretary 
</p>
<p>claimed that most problems of violence within the prisons were prisoners attacking staff. 
</p>
<p>69. In Rio de Janeiro, a hotline established to track racial discrimination during a two-
</p>
<p>year period found 104 cases of discrimination in the criminal justice system; an unusually 
</p>
<p>high number considering most individuals do not report those crimes due to fear of 
</p>
<p>retaliation by the police. According to civil society sources, 80 per cent of robbery victims 
</p>
<p>in Rio did not register the crime with the police because they were afraid to interact with 
</p>
<p>police officers. Again, according to civil society, 76 per cent of citizens thought that the 
</p>
<p>police force was directly involved with death squads terrorizing Afro-Brazilian 
</p>
<p>communities suggesting that institutional racism led not only to incarceration but also to 
</p>
<p>excessive use of force and violence. 
</p>
<p>70. In Pernambuco, the Working Group was pleased to learn of efforts being made to 
</p>
<p>address institutional racism within the police force. The Group against Institutional Racism 
</p>
<p>was created in 2009 and its activities include training and capacity-building for the military 
</p>
<p>police, public campaigns against racism, a hotline to report racist crimes, cultural events, 
</p>
<p>conferences, support and assistance to Afro-Brazilian communities including the 
</p>
<p>Quilombola and Terreiro communities. 
</p>
<p>71. The S&#227;o Paulo State Secretary of Penitentiary Administration has developed a 
</p>
<p>human rights education programme. The course includes information on the legal 
</p>
<p>framework of non-discrimination for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, women, 
</p>
<p>people with disabilities, religious groups, and on laws on racial equality and affirmative 
</p>
<p>policies.

</p>
<p>mission to Brazil (4&#8211;14 November 2007) (A/HRC/8/3/Add.4 of 14 May 2008). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/68/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>72. In S&#227;o Paulo, the Working Group visited the Capital Female Penitentiary Unit and 
</p>
<p>met a group of French inmates, all of whom were of African descent and a group of 
</p>
<p>Brazilian inmates some of whom were of African descent. Most told the experts that issues 
</p>
<p>of racism and discrimination were not a problem in the prison, although one inmate said she 
</p>
<p>had experienced discrimination when trying to access sexual and reproductive health 
</p>
<p>services. The experts felt that the open environment in which the discussion took place 
</p>
<p>could have prevented inmates from speaking freely. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Multiple discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violence and young people 
</b></p>
<p>73. The issue of violence against Afro-Brazilians, particularly young people, was raised 
</p>
<p>repeatedly by civil society and several government representatives. The level of violence in 
</p>
<p>Brazil grew significantly in the last decades of the twentieth century. A report by the the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization shows that in the period 
</p>
<p>1979&#8211;2003, more than 550,000 people died from gunfire. These homicides grew by 542 per 
</p>
<p>cent and the number of young people who died from gunfire went from 31.6 per cent of all 
</p>
<p>victims to 41.6 per cent.
55
</p>
<p> Homicide is now the main cause of death among young people 
</p>
<p>between 15 and 29 years of age in Brazil and it particularly affects young black males 
</p>
<p>living in urban areas. That issue was raised by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions during his mission in 2007,
 
 when he asserted that between 
</p>
<p>45,000 and 50,000 homicides were committed each year, that homicide was the leading 
</p>
<p>cause of death for 15&#8211;44 year olds and that high levels of impunity meant those deaths 
</p>
<p>often went unpunished.
56
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>74. According to the Ministry of Health, of all homicides against young people in 2010, 
</p>
<p>76.6 per cent of victims were Afro-Brazilians and 91.3 per cent were males.
57
</p>
<p> A report by 
</p>
<p>the Mapa da Viol&#234;ncia &#8212; Map of Violence &#8212; project shows that of 17,426 homicides 
</p>
<p>involving young people that took place in Brazil in 2011, 76.9 per cent involved Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians (<i>pretos</i> and <i>pardos</i>).
58
</p>
<p> Young Afro-Brazilians are also often victims of racial 
</p>
<p>profiling. 
</p>
<p>75. One of the biggest concerns is violence perpetrated by the police and security forces 
</p>
<p>against young Afro-Brazilian males. Such complaints are not new with the Unified Black 
</p>
<p>Movement having denounced cases of violence, torture and death since 1978. The infamous 
</p>
<p>Candelaria massacre of eight young people in the streets of Rio de Janeiro in 1993, which 
</p>
<p>raised national and international outrage, is another example of such violence against Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilian young people. Twenty years after those events, arbitrary violence and killings of 
</p>
<p>young black people remain of concern.  
</p>
<p>76. According to a Ministry of Health report based on the System of Mortality 
</p>
<p>Information database in 2006, every 48 hours three people were killed by the police in 
</p>
<p>Brazil, amounting to 46 deaths per month or 560 per year.
59
</p>
<p> According to Soares (2003), 
</p>
<p>the police force (civil, military and federal) is one of the only institutions that did not

<p>undergo institutional reform at the end of the dictatorship and the adoption of the new 
</p>
<p>Constitution in 1988. Consequently, the institution continues to be characterized by a lack 
</p>
<p>of respect for human rights.
60
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>77. The police are responsible for maintaining public security as asserted in the Federal 
</p>
<p>Constitution, yet institutional racism, discrimination and a culture of violence lead to 
</p>
<p>practices of racial profiling, overpolicing, blackmail, torture, extortion and humiliation 
</p>
<p>particularly against Afro-Brazilians. The use of force and violence for crime control and 
</p>
<p>public security has become accepted by society at large because it is perpetrated against a 
</p>
<p>sector of society whose lives are not considered as valuable.
61
</p>
<p> The Working Group views 
</p>
<p>this as the fabrication of an internal enemy which justifies the use of military tactics to 
</p>
<p>control criminal behaviour and reduce public and private liberties.  
</p>
<p>78. The Geled&#233;s organization raised concern about the lack of attention paid to that issue 
</p>
<p>exemplifying the devaluation of young black lives in Brazilian society. The continued 
</p>
<p>urban violence against youth of African descent was felt by many Afro-Brazilians and 
</p>
<p>NGOs with whom the Working Group met as a &#8220;genocide&#8221;. The Government strongly 
</p>
<p>rejected that view expressed by civil society.
62
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>79. The Working Group understands that the violence perpetrated against young Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilian people comes not only from agents of the State but also from organized criminal 
</p>
<p>gangs, many of which involve young Afro-Brazilians in their activities. Yet the State has 
</p>
<p>the responsibility to respect the right to life of all its citizens, to protect them from violence 
</p>
<p>and take active steps to fulfil their right to life. The disproportionate numbers of Afro-
</p>
<p>Brazilians that live in the poorest areas, afflicted with crime and violence, means that right 
</p>
<p>to a life without violence is not being fulfilled by the State for Afro-Brazilians. In many 
</p>
<p>cases, the majority of the violence and deaths of young Afro-Brazilian people is carried out 
</p>
<p>by the military police. State governments have little control over the behaviour of the 
</p>
<p>police. The S&#227;o Paulo State government has been battling to demilitarize S&#227;o Paulo and 
</p>
<p>asserted that it did not have the power to change police behaviour, though it could work 
</p>
<p>hard to change the paths of young people through prevention work in schools and the 
</p>
<p>community.  
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group welcomes the efforts that have been made to address that issue. 
</p>
<p>In 2012, SEPPIR, in coordination with the National Secretariat for Youth launched the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Youth Alive Plan&#8221;. The initiative involves eight ministries and aims to reduce the high 
</p>
<p>rates of homicide among young Afro-Brazilian people through a participatory approach. 
</p>
<p>The Plan focuses its activities on the 132 municipalities where around 70 per cent of deaths 
</p>
<p>have occurred.
63
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>81. The Pernambuco Secretary for Social Defence talked about the Pacto Pela Vida 
</p>
<p>(Pact for Life) initiative, a State programme initiated in 2007 to reduce violence, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the capital of Recife. Pacto Pela Vida creates guidelines for all areas of the 
</p>
<p>State government, not just the police. In the first four years of its existence the programme 
</p>
<p>reduced violence by 30 per cent. In April 2007, there were 71 homicides and in October 
</p>
<p>2013, 26. Prevention work includes working with children in schools. 
</p>
<p>82. Yet the lack of coordination between the national security system and the judiciary 
</p>
<p>remains a concern. The police operate at State level and as such there is no national policy 
</p>
<p>or approach to recruitment and provision of training for the police forces. Some work has

<p>been done to promote human rights and address institutional racism but the police remain a 
</p>
<p>hierarchical institution and those at the top tend to maintain and uphold the prevailing 
</p>
<p>culture. The S&#227;o Paulo State Coordination of Policies for the Black and Indigenous 
</p>
<p>Population
64
</p>
<p> discussed the problem of impunity within the police force and also acts of 
</p>
<p>resistance. In S&#227;o Paulo, one of the main justifications given by the police for killings was 
</p>
<p>self-defence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Women and girls of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>83. Afro-Brazilian women and girls face intersectional discrimination based on their 
</p>
<p>gender and ethnicity. They are overrepresented in low-paid, often exploitative jobs such as 
</p>
<p>domestic work. In 2004, 67 per cent of Afro-Brazilian women earned less than US$ 1 per 
</p>
<p>hour, compared to 60 per cent of Afro-Brazilian men and 43 per cent of white women.
65
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>While access to adequate health care remains an issue for both men and women of African 
</p>
<p>descent, women face particularly life-threatening disparities in access to health services. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Equality in employment  
</b></p>
<p>84. During its meeting with the Secretary for Women, the Working Group spoke with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Secretary&#8217;s Programme for the Promotion of Gender and Ethnic-
</p>
<p>Racial Equality which aims to eliminate discrimination and inequality in the workplace. 
</p>
<p>According to representatives, although unemployment among women fell from 15.2 per 
</p>
<p>cent to 7.5 per cent between 2003 and 2011, women still experience worse work conditions, 
</p>
<p>lower salaries and discrimination in the workplace. Although on average women have more 
</p>
<p>years of education than men (9.2 compared to 7.9 years), they earn less. In addition women 
</p>
<p>do not reach as high levels within organizations as men; men are six times more likely to be 
</p>
<p>in the highest positions in organizations. Of the 8 million female domestic workers in 
</p>
<p>Brazil, 80 per cent are Afro-Brazilian. Congress changed article 7 of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>bringing labour rights of domestic workers in line with the rights of other workers. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group urges the Government to ratify the International Labour Organization 
</p>
<p>(ILO) Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning domestic work for domestic workers. 
</p>
<p>85. The Programme for the Promotion of Gender and Ethnic-Racial Equality, created in 
</p>
<p>2005, is supported by ILO, SEPPIR and UN Women. It works with public and private 
</p>
<p>organizations to design organizational action plans to adopt systematic practices for 
</p>
<p>equality between men and women, address transversally intersectionality of gender and 
</p>
<p>race. However, statistics also show that among women following the Programme, 72 per 
</p>
<p>cent were white and 16.5 per cent Afro-Brazilian and there was real inequality in access to 
</p>
<p>work.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Maternal mortality 
</b></p>
<p>86. Afro-Brazilian women are three times more likely to die in childbirth than white 
</p>
<p>women, owing, in part, to low-quality prenatal care.
66
</p>
<p> Ninety per cent of those deaths could 
</p>
<p>be preventable with access to adequate health care. The root causes of high maternal 
</p>
<p>mortality rates (MMR) include socioeconomic, regional, gender and racial disparities in

<p>health care. MMR is disproportionately high in the north and north-east of Brazil, as high as 
</p>
<p>73 per 1,000 due to inequality in health-care provision. According to the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Health, Afro-Brazilian women are 50 per cent more likely to die of obstetric-related causes 
</p>
<p>than white women. They receive lower quality health-care services, including less prenatal 
</p>
<p>visits, and less information is provided.  
</p>
<p>87. The Working Group was keen to follow up on the specific case of a young pregnant 
</p>
<p>Afro-Brazilian woman, Alyne da Silva Pimentel Teixeira who died in 2002. In 2008, the 
</p>
<p>NGO Center for Reproductive Rights representing the woman&#8217;s mother, Maria de Lourdes 
</p>
<p>da Silva Pimentel, sent a communication to the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women claiming a failure to ensure access to quality and timely 
</p>
<p>medical treatment violating articles 2 and 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Discrimination against Women.
67
</p>
<p> The NGO claimed that the victim had suffered 
</p>
<p>from multiple discrimination based on her socioeconomic background and as a woman of 
</p>
<p>African descent.  
</p>
<p>88. In the decision published in 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women&#8217;s recommendations to Brazil included effective remedies, 
</p>
<p>including financial compensation to the mother and daughter of the victim, and general 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure women&#8217;s right to safe motherhood and affordable access for all women 
</p>
<p>to adequate emergency obstetric care such as improved training, access to effective 
</p>
<p>remedies and sanctions.
68
</p>
<p> The experts welcome the fact that the State has taken steps on the 
</p>
<p>general recommendation concerning training for health-care workers. They also note that 
</p>
<p>the State has created an interministerial working group tasked with overseeing the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the case. While half of the financial compensation has been paid by the 
</p>
<p>Federal Government, the daughter of the victim has still not received compensation and the 
</p>
<p>Working Group urges the Government to fulfil this obligation.  
</p>
<p>89. In March 2013, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held a hearing on 
</p>
<p>the rights of Afro-Brazilians at the request of the Afro-Brazilian civil society organization, 
</p>
<p>Associa&#231;&#227;o Cultural de Mulheres Negras, and Global Rights based in the United States of 
</p>
<p>America. It concluded that while Brazil had worked towards implementing policies to 
</p>
<p>correct discrimination within institutions, they had not improved the situation of women of 
</p>
<p>African descent. Pending further information from the State and petitioners, the 
</p>
<p>Commission will issue recommendations to the State of Brazil.
69
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Traditional communities and populations 
</b></p>
<p>90. Many Afro-Brazilians belong to traditional communities and populations, Quilombo 
</p>
<p>heritage communities and Terreiro traditional African religious communities. Traditional 
</p>
<p>communities have established rights under the Federal Constitution and the process of 
</p>
<p>judicial decision must take into account the rights and interests of traditional 
</p>
<p>communities.

</p>
<p>92. Article 8 of Law No. 12.288 determines incentives to guarantee rights to health and 
</p>
<p>access to land for Quilombolas and articles 31&#8211;34 also address rights to land titles, public 
</p>
<p>policies for sustainable development and special treatment of Quilombola communities 
</p>
<p>promoting production and infrastructure. SEPPIR supports the work of federal government 
</p>
<p>bodies to increase policies in areas such as health and education and to develop suitable 
</p>
<p>plans and projects to work with Quilombola communities.  
</p>
<p>93. The Brazil Quilombola Programme, created in 2004, comprises initiatives by around 
</p>
<p>20 ministries in thematic areas of access to land, infrastructure, standard of living, local 
</p>
<p>development, productive inclusions, and citizenship rights. State-level seminars are carried 
</p>
<p>out to integrate State governments into the Programme and a workplan is being developed 
</p>
<p>by federal, State, municipal bodies and representatives of Quilombola communities.
72
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>94. Collective ownership is central to Quilombola rights. Despite a lack of official land 
</p>
<p>titles, Quilombola communities have lived and worked on their lands for generations and 
</p>
<p>ownership is transferred through the generations. In many cases communities have been 
</p>
<p>forcibly removed from their lands, often fleeing violence and intimidation, in violation of 
</p>
<p>ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
</p>
<p>Countries. That should not affect their claim to land but in practice it can make it harder for 
</p>
<p>recognized communities to obtain their land titles and many are caught up in long-standing 
</p>
<p>legal battles with other private landowners and corporations. Eighteen per cent of people 
</p>
<p>protected in the Brazilian Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders are 
</p>
<p>Quilombola community leaders. Furthermore, the Working Group believes that the right to 
</p>
<p>consultation is not fully implemented. 
</p>
<p>95. According to the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), 
</p>
<p>the process of gaining official titles for Quilombola communities is long and complex, 
</p>
<p>involving several elaborate steps following initial certification by the Palmares Cultural 
</p>
<p>Foundation. In the north-east alone there are 400 communities awaiting titles. There are 
</p>
<p>many communities that have certification but no land titles. For example while there are 
</p>
<p>110 recognized communities in Pernambuco only two have received land titles. In other 
</p>
<p>States such as Minas Gerais not one community has received official land titles. Challenges 
</p>
<p>in the administrative process of land titling occur when there is a conflict over the land, 
</p>
<p>multiple claims on the land or judicialization of those claims overlapping with titled lands 
</p>
<p>or conservation areas established by the State.
73
</p>
<p> When traditional communities report on 
</p>
<p>threats, violence or environmental degradation, they often experience discrimination. 
</p>
<p>96. In Pernambuco, the Working Group met with the Secretary for Social Development 
</p>
<p>and Human Rights who has worked with several Quilombola communities facing threats of 
</p>
<p>violence. It also visited the Quilombola community of Castainho which has been fighting

<p>for the demarcation of its territory since 1982. While INCRA has begun the process of 
</p>
<p>compensation for landowners, the process has been incredibly slow. The leader of the 
</p>
<p>community informed the Group that he and several others had received threats from the 
</p>
<p>landowner and his workers. 
</p>
<p>97. In Bahia, the Working Group visited the Quilombola community of Cachoeira. 
</p>
<p>Despite significant advances made during the Lula administration, it is still lacking basic 
</p>
<p>services. In particular the community needs better roads as heavy rains often leave them 
</p>
<p>inaccessible preventing them from exporting products. There is also a lack of health 
</p>
<p>services. For maternal health, pregnant women have to travel 28 km to Cachoeira for 
</p>
<p>examinations. Many community members lack identity cards which prevents them from 
</p>
<p>accessing services; the nearest place for birth and death registration is 28 km away. The 15 
</p>
<p>communities have been recognized as Quilombolas and have not experienced problems 
</p>
<p>with local landowners, however the process of land titling through INCRA took 10 years.  
</p>
<p>98. The Secretary for the Promotion of Racial Equality in the State of Bahia has taken 
</p>
<p>several actions to defend the rights of traditional communities which might come into 
</p>
<p>conflict with the interests of other members of society, including formulation and 
</p>
<p>management of specific policies and guidelines for the rights of traditional communities; 
</p>
<p>assistance in the process of regularization of land titles; support for organizational 
</p>
<p>processes, education and organizational capacity-building; public management for conflict 
</p>
<p>mitigation and monitoring of established mechanisms and State obligations.

<p>  
</p>
<p><i>  Terreiro communities 
</i></p>
<p>99. Traditional African religious communities (Terreiros) are linked to a Terreiro House 
</p>
<p>used to practising African traditions in respect of ancestors, nature and in the context of an 
</p>
<p>extended family.75 According to a report by the Committee for the Promotion of 
</p>
<p>Ethnoracial Equality of Pernambuco State, there are around 1,800 traditional communities 
</p>
<p>of Jurema, Umbanda and Candomble in Recife; in Pernambuco, around 6,000 of those and 
</p>
<p>other traditions. 
</p>
<p>100. In line with national and other State legislation, article 50 of the 1989 Constitution 
</p>
<p>of the State of Bahia asserts that the State will promote necessary actions for the 
</p>
<p>legalization of land in which Afro-Brazilian religious temples are situated. Article 5 of the 
</p>
<p>Federal Constitution provides for freedom of conscience and of belief &#8220;the free exercise of 
</p>
<p>religious cults being ensured and, under the terms of the law, the protection of places of 
</p>
<p>worship and their rights being guaranteed&#8221; (art. 5(VI)). Yet, many Terreiro populations face 
</p>
<p>widespread discrimination and obstacles in the practice of their traditions. For many, the 
</p>
<p>principal cause of discrimination is not based on ethnicity or colour of skin but on religion.  
</p>
<p>101. In Pernambuco, the Working Group visited the Ile Oya Terreiro House and learned 
</p>
<p>about the continued discrimination that it and other Terreiros face. There are frequent 
</p>
<p>orders by police to cease their religious ceremonies on account of noise disturbance while 
</p>
<p>no such rules are applied to other equally noisy ceremonies by other religions. They assert 
</p>
<p>that the discriminatory targeting of their practices can be part of an effort to suppress their 
</p>
<p>cultural expression. They note the positive change that Terreiro communities experienced 
</p>
<p>under the Lula administration with greater recognition and visibility; yet their religious 
</p>
<p>practices are often still criminalized and persecuted which is a legacy of an outdated law 
</p>
<p>which prohibited African religious practices.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The experts greatly appreciate the comprehensive and informative meetings 
that were held with government agencies. They note with satisfaction the many 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes and other initiatives that the State implements to combat racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination affecting people of African descent. These exist in government 
</b></p>
<p><b>departments, at federal and municipal levels, as well in as the many other institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>that are working on the promotion of the right to equality with non-discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p><b>They note the constant progress made since the first election of President Lula da 
</b></p>
<p><b>Silva. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The experts learned that education was still one of the major areas of 
discrimination and one of the main sources of inequality. The Working Group also 
</b></p>
<p><b>noted that the circle of poverty, inadequate housing and education, limited 
</b></p>
<p><b>employment opportunities and challenges in the administration of justice continued to 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect the lives of Afro-Brazilians at multiple levels and left them marginalized. Those 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues are not yet being sufficiently addressed in a holistic and coordinated manner.  
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Despite the high percentage of Afro-Brazilians in the population and the 
serious efforts and advances that have been made in combating direct discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>against people of African descent, the Working Group is concerned by the ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>structural and institutional racial discrimination and xenophobia that cannot be 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively addressed by the existing legal mechanisms and legislation. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The Working Group notes that people of African descent with whom they met 
shared experiences of serious racism and discrimination based on their skin colour. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Based on information received from civil society, the experts expressed concern about 
</b></p>
<p><b>the practice of racial profiling by the police, which reportedly results in 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionately high rates of harassment, arrests and imprisonment of people of 
</b></p>
<p><b>African descent.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Education is an essential step for fighting negative representations and 
stereotypes in society. The common history of enslavement and colonization based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the archaic idea of a hierarchy of races and superiority of cultures has to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognized as a common heritage and shared by former colonizers and former 
</b></p>
<p><b>colonized. It is imperative to deconstruct the paradigm which racializes all levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, through action at the political, economic and intellectual levels to create an 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding that the world is diverse in its entirety.</b> I<b>t is also important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>deconstruct the ideology of </b>&#8220;<b>whitening</b>&#8221;<b> which continues to affect the mentalities of a 
significant portion of society. This work should be done with the help of the media and 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the involvement of the society as a whole. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>On the other hand, it should also be kept in mind that as the country is a 
federation of States, most States have also enacted their own legislation prohibiting 
</b></p>
<p><b>racial discrimination in different areas where they have jurisdiction. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Working Group found that many of the recommendations made in the 
report of the Special Rapporteur against contemporary forms of racism, racial 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, xenophobia and related</b> <b>intolerance were still relevant and valid and 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be implemented.</b>76<b> In addition, the Working Group makes the following 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) While there is a strong body of public policy at the federal level the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group is concerned that at the State and municipal levels many of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies have less weight and implementing institutions lack funding and structure. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Municipal and State-level organs of the National System for the Promotion of Racial 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 76 E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.3, pp. 20&#8211;23. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/68/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Inequality must be recognized and sufficiently funded so that they are able to carry 
</b></p>
<p><b>out their activities effectively. This includes larger teams, more visible and accessible 
</b></p>
<p><b>working spaces and improved commitment from other governmental bodies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>better coordination to work in partnership on cross-cutting themes;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The adoption of the Quota Law in 2012 is a landmark step towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>equality in education. It is essential that further policy steps be taken to ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>once Afro-Brazilian students access university they are able to remain there for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>duration of their studies without facing obstacles of extra financial burdens, 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory attitudes and lack of support;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The process for titling of Quilombola lands should be reviewed to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>it a more expeditious and less complex process. Further training and sensitization for 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice officials concerning the rights of Quilombola communities are needed to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective protection from threats and violence in land dispute cases. ILO Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>No. 169 should be effectively implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The law criminalizing racism is a welcome step in the fight against 
</b></p>
<p><b>racism against Afro-Brazilians and other marginalized groups. It is important that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>law be fully implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Sufficient support should be given to promote and accompany legislative 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes in Congress for further affirmative action, particularly in creating quotas in 
</b></p>
<p><b>government;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Policies to prevent violence against vulnerable members of society 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly Afro-Brazilian women and young people are essential; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The independence of the military police has serious consequences for 
</b></p>
<p><b>young people of African descent in Brazil. The institution needs a federal level of 
</b></p>
<p><b>control. It can be returned to the command of the Ministry of Defence to enable such 
</b></p>
<p><b>a control and monitoring of its activities as well as coordinating training and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sensitization for officers throughout the country;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Steps must be taken to remove reliance on self-defence claims made by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the police in cases of death. This includes the passing of Legal Project 4471;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Further training and sensitization of the police are essential to change 
</b></p>
<p><b>the culture of violence under the pretext of national security. This involves working 
</b></p>
<p><b>with all ranks of the police force, particularly top levels to change attitudes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>behaviour; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) The recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women concerning maternal mortality must be fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) There is a need for increased investment in teacher training and 
</b></p>
<p><b>curriculum materials to ensure the effective implementation of Law No. 10.639 on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>teaching of Afro-Brazilian history and culture. Curriculum materials should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>improved to guarantee better knowledge of the history of Africa.
