</b></p>
<p>Agenda item 4 
</p>
<p><b>Human rights situations </b>that require the Council&#8217;s attention<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  28/22. </b>Situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
<b>Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including Council resolution 25/25 of 28 March 
</p>
<p>2014 and Assembly resolution 69/188 of 18 December 2014, and urging the 
</p>
<p>implementation of those resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing</i> in mind paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
</p>
<p>2006,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Council, of 
</p>
<p>18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and annexes thereto,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>the importance of following up on the recommendations contained in the 
</p>
<p>report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea,1 which was welcomed by both the Human Rights Council and the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, and transmitted to the relevant bodies of the United Nations, including the 
</p>
<p>Security Council,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> at the systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea that, in many instances, constitute crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity, as well as at the impunity of perpetrators, as described in the report of the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry,  
</p>

<p><i> Concerned </i>that the precarious humanitarian situation in the country is exacerbated 
</p>
<p>by the failure of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to provide 
</p>
<p>humanitarian agencies with free and unimpeded access to all populations in need and by its 
</p>
<p>national policy priorities that, among others, prioritize military spending over citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p>access to food,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms of its entire population, including by ensuring equal access to 
</p>
<p>adequate food, as well as, among others, freedom of religion or belief, freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression and freedom of association and assembly,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that particular risk factors affect women, children, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and the elderly, and the need to ensure the full enjoyment of all their human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms by them against neglect, abuse, exploitation and violence, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the participation of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in 
</p>
<p>the second universal periodic review process, noting the acceptance by the Government of 
</p>
<p>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea of 113 out of the 268 recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in the outcome of the review and its stated commitment to implement them and to 
</p>
<p>look into the possibility of implementing a further 58 recommendations, and emphasizing 
</p>
<p>the importance that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea accept and implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations in order to address the grave human rights violations in the country,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the important work of the treaty bodies in monitoring the 
</p>
<p>implementation of international human rights obligations, and emphasizing the need for the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to comply with its human rights obligations and to 
</p>
<p>ensure regular and timely reporting to the treaty bodies,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the importance of the issue of international abductions and of the immediate 
</p>
<p>return of all abductees, taking note of the outcome of the government-level consultation 
</p>
<p>between the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and Japan in May 2014, and expecting 
</p>
<p>concrete and positive results from the investigations being conducted by the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on all the Japanese nationals, in particular victims of abduction,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the importance of inter-Korean dialogue, which could contribute to the 
</p>
<p>improvement of the human rights and humanitarian situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the resumption of the reunions of separated families across the border 
</p>
<p>is an urgent humanitarian concern of the entire Korean people that needs to be resolved 
</p>
<p>without further delay, and hoping that necessary arrangements for further reunions on a 
</p>
<p>larger scale and a regular basis will be made by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, the Republic of Korea and members of the Korean diaspora,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of States engaging fully and constructively with the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, including with the universal periodic review process and other 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the Council, for the improvement of their situation of human rights,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest terms</i> the long-standing and ongoing systematic, 
</p>
<p>widespread and gross human rights violations and other human rights abuses committed in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and expresses its grave concern at the detailed 
</p>
<p>findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report, including:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well 
</p>
<p>as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association, which is enforced 
</p>
<p>through an absolute monopoly on information and total control over organized social life, 
</p>
<p>and arbitrary and unlawful State surveillance that permeates the private lives of all citizens;  </p>


<p>(<i>b</i>) Discrimination based on the <i>songbun</i> system, which classifies people on the 
</p>
<p>basis of State-assigned social class and birth, and also includes consideration of political 
</p>
<p>opinions and religion, discrimination against women, including unequal access to 
</p>
<p>employment, discriminatory laws and regulations, and violence against women; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Violations of all aspects of the right to freedom of movement, including 
</p>
<p>forced assignment to State-designated places of residence and employment, often based on 
</p>
<p>the <i>songbun</i> system, and denial of the right to leave one&#8217;s own country;  
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Systematic, widespread and grave violations of the right to food and related 
</p>
<p>aspects of the right to life, exacerbated by widespread hunger and malnutrition;  
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Violations of the right to life and acts of extermination, murder, enslavement, 
</p>
<p>torture, imprisonment, rape and other grave forms of sexual violence and persecution on 
</p>
<p>political, religious and gender grounds in political prison camps and ordinary prisons, and 
</p>
<p>the widespread practice of collective punishment with harsh sentences imposed on innocent 
</p>
<p>individuals;  
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) Systematic abduction, denial of repatriation and subsequent enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance of persons, including those from other countries, on a large scale and as a 
</p>
<p>matter of State policy; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
</p>
<p>acknowledge the human rights violations in the country and to take immediate steps to end 
</p>
<p>all such violations and abuses through, inter alia, the implementation of relevant 
</p>
<p>recommendations in the report of the commission of inquiry, including, but not limited to, 
</p>
<p>the following steps:  
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To ensure the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as 
</p>
<p>the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and association, including by permitting the 
</p>
<p>establishment of independent newspapers and other media; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To end discrimination against citizens, including State-sponsored 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on the <i>songbun</i> system, and to take immediate steps to ensure gender 
</p>
<p>equality and to protect women from gender-based violence; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) To ensure the right to freedom of movement, including the freedom to choose 
</p>
<p>one&#8217;s place of residence and employment; 
</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) To promote equal access to food, including through full transparency 
</p>
<p>regarding the provision of humanitarian assistance so that such assistance is genuinely 
</p>
<p>provided to vulnerable persons; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) To immediately halt all human right violations relating to prison camps, 
</p>
<p>including the practice of forced labour, to dismantle all political prison camps and to release 
</p>
<p>all political prisoners, to immediately cease the practice of the arbitrary execution of 
</p>
<p>persons in custody, and to ensure that justice sector reforms provide protections for a fair 
</p>
<p>trial and due process; 
</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) To resolve the issue of all persons who have been abducted or otherwise 
</p>
<p>forcibly disappeared, as well as their descendants, in a transparent manner, including by 
</p>
<p>ensuring their immediate return; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Reiterates its</i> <i>deep concern</i> at the commission&#8217;s findings concerning the 
</p>
<p>situation of refugees and asylum seekers returned to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, and other citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who have been 
</p>
<p>repatriated from abroad and made subject to sanctions, including internment, torture, cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhumane and degrading treatment, sexual violence, enforced disappearance or the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle of </p>


<p>non-refoulement, to treat humanely those who seek refuge and to ensure unhindered access 
</p>
<p>to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and 
</p>
<p>once again urges State parties to comply with their obligations under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law as well as the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol 
</p>
<p>thereto in relation to persons from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who are 
</p>
<p>covered by those instruments;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Stresses and restates</i> <i>its grave concern</i> about the commission&#8217;s finding that 
</p>
<p>the body of testimony gathered and the information received provided reasonable grounds 
</p>
<p>to believe that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State for 
</p>
<p>decades; these crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, 
</p>
<p>imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, 
</p>
<p>religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Stresses</i> that the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>have failed to prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, and encourages the members of the international community to cooperate 
</p>
<p>with accountability efforts and to ensure that these crimes do not remain unpunished;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Welcomes</i> General Assembly resolution 69/188, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>decided to submit the report of the commission of inquiry to the Security Council and 
</p>
<p>encouraged it to consider the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission 
</p>
<p>and to take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of 
</p>
<p>referral of the situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court and consideration of the scope for effective targeted sanctions against those 
</p>
<p>who appear to be most responsible for acts that, according to the commission, may 
</p>
<p>constitute crimes against humanity;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes</i> the decision of the Security Council to add the situation in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the list of issues of which the Council is seized, 
</p>
<p>the holding of an open Council meeting on 22 December 2014 during which the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea was discussed, and looks 
</p>
<p>forward to the continued and active engagement of the Council on this matter;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Commends </i>the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the

</p>

</p>
<p>international conference thereon;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also welcomes</i> the call of the Special Rapporteur for sustained action on this

</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to convene a panel discussion on the situation of human rights in the 
</p>

</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>Republic of Korea;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Welcomes </i>the steps taken by the Office of the High Commissioner towards 
</p>
<p>establishing a field-based structure in the Republic of Korea to strengthen the monitoring 
</p>
<p>and documentation of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of
