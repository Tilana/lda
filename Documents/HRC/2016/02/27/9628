<p><b>2/3.  Human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> at the suffering of the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan 
due to the violation of their fundamental and human rights since the Israeli military occupation 
of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> all relevant General Assembly resolutions, including the latest, 
resolution 60/40 of 1 December 2005, in which the Assembly declared that Israel had failed so 
far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of Israel&#8217;s decision of 14 December 1981 to impose 
its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has resulted in the 
effective annexation of that territory, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of non-acquisition of territory by force in accordance with the 
Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories (A/60/380) of 26 August 2005 and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli 
settlement in the occupied Arab territories and regretting Israel&#8217;s constant refusal to cooperate 
with and to receive the Special Committee, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/2/L.11/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, international 
law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirming the applicability of the 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 
</p>
<p>12 August 1949, and the relevant provisions of the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the 
occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the importance of the peace process which started in Madrid on the 
basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern over the halt in 
the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the basis of 
the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) with a view 
to establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, 
the most recent being resolution 2005/8 of 14 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions 
of the General Assembly and of the Security Council, in particular resolution 497 (1981), in 
which the Council, inter alia, decided that the Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and 
administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void and without international legal 
effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its decision; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also calls upon </i>Israel to desist from changing the physical character, 
demographic composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, 
and emphasizes that the displaced persons of the population of the occupied Syrian Golan must 
be allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan, and to desist from its 
repressive measures against them and from all other practices mentioned in the report of the 
Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; </p>

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to 
be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character and legal status of the 
occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have 
no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls once again upon</i> Member States not to recognize any of the legislative or 
administrative measures and actions referred to above; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of 
all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, international

inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,  
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations and as elaborated in the

18 January 2006 in which it reaffirmed, inter alia, the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories,

<p> <i>Mindful</i> that Israel is a party to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de jure to Palestinian 
and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of High Contracting 
Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 2001,  
</p>
<p> <i>Considering</i> that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention 
and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in Additional Protocol I to the 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
(including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of international law,

<p> <i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004,

<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>further</i> its attachment to the implementation by both parties of their obligations 
under the Quartet road map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
(S/2003/529, annex), and noting specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement activity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its grave concern</i> about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, of 
settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in violation of 
international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions, including plans to 
expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East Jerusalem, thus threatening the 
creation of a contiguous Palestinian State,

<p> <i>Expressing</i> <i>its concern</i> that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the 
realization of a two-State solution, </p>

<p>A/HRC/2/L.11/Add.1

</p>
<p> <i>Noting </i>the dismantlement of settlements in the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern 
West Bank, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing construction, contrary to international 
law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around 
East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the wall in departure 
from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future negotiations and make the 
two-State solution physically impossible to implement and which is causing the Palestinian 
people further humanitarian hardship,  
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include the 
great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully with 
</p>
<p>the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (E/CN.4/2006/29 and A/HRC/2/5) and calls 
upon the Government of Israel to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur to allow him fully to 
discharge his mandate;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of 
Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 49 of that 
Convention; settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment of a just and comprehensive 
peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign and democratic Palestinian State;  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/2/L.11/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Israeli so-called E1 plan aimed at expanding the Israeli settlement of 
Maale Adumim and building the wall around it, thereby further disconnecting occupied 
East Jerusalem from the northern and southern parts of the West Bank and isolating its 
Palestinian population; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The new Israeli plans to construct more than 900 additional housing units in 
different Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The implications on the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s recent announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
occupied Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait accompli 
on the ground that could well be permanent, in which case, it would be tantamount to de facto 
annexation;<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West Jerusalem 
and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev in violation of international law and relevant 
United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) The continued closures of and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the 
restriction of the freedom of movement of people and goods, including the repeated closure of 
the crossing points of the Gaza Strip, which have caused an extremely precarious humanitarian 
situation for the civilian population as well as impaired the economic and social rights of the 
Palestinian people;  
</p>
<p> (<i>h</i>) The continued construction, contrary to international law, of the wall inside the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem;

<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> Israel, the occupying Power:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including 
East Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and related 
activities;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>the full implementation of the Access and Movement Agreement 
of 15 November 2005, particularly the urgent reopening of Rafah and Karni crossings, which is 
crucial to ensuring the passage of foodstuffs and essential supplies, as well as the access of the 
United Nations agencies to and within the Occupied Palestinian Territory; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Demands</i> that Israel implement the recommendations regarding the settlements 
made by the then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in her report to the 
Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session on her visit to the occupied Palestinian 
territories, Israel, Egypt and Jordan (E/CN.4/2001/114);  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to take and implement serious measures, including confiscation 
of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts of violence by 
Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of the Palestinian 
civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal obligations, 
as mentioned in the Advisory Opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes </i>the Palestinian truce initiative and its acceptance by the Israeli side that 
came into effect on 26 November 2006 and urges all parties to maintain this truce, which could

<p> 9. <i>Urges</i> the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process and to
