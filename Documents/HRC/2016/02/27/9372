<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the interim Government of Fiji, the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of 
peoples to self-determination visited Fiji from 14 to 18 May 2007. The Group welcomed this 
opportunity to engage in a constructive dialogue with the interim Government and other 
stakeholders on issues of its mandate. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes that Fiji has an established tradition of well-trained, disciplined 
and highly skilled military and security personnel, who perform security functions in various 
capacities worldwide. However, the Working Group notes with concern that in a number of 
instances, the security-related functions carried out by Fijians abroad through private military 
and security companies (PMSCs) may qualify as mercenary-related activities. Unemployment 
and/or underemployment, a migratory population ready to perform security work abroad, and 
largely unmonitored activities of private security companies in Fiji have facilitated such 
recruitment in Fiji for work, including in Iraq. The Working Group has received information 
indicating contractual irregularities, harsh working conditions with excessive working hours, 
partial or non-payment of remuneration, ill-treatment and lack of basic necessities such as 
medical treatment and sanitation. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group has noted the absence of national legislation and measures in Fiji to 
effectively address these issues, and encourages the Fiji authorities to take positive action in 
order to ensure that private military and security companies in Fiji operate within a legal 
framework in full accordance with international human rights standards. The Working Group 
recommends accession to the 1989 International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries. It also recommends the development of national 
legislation to address mercenaries, mercenary-related activities and the activities of private 
companies offering military assistance, consultancy and security services on the international 
market; this can take place through the introduction of such elements in the penal legislation or 
through the elaboration of a separate comprehensive law. The Working Group also recommends 
the establishment of a system for regulating, licensing, controlling and monitoring the activities 
of private security companies in order to provide effective oversight whereby the authorities 
would maintain transparent registers of private security companies on all matters such as 
ownership, statutes, purposes and functions as well as a system of regular inspections to ensure 
accountability. It also recommends the adoption of measures to address issues of reintegration 
and post-traumatic stress disorder in individuals returning from security work abroad through the 
establishment of a comprehensive system of debriefing and professional counselling. The 
Working Group further urges the adoption of measures by the competent authorities allowing 
them to act with speed and vigour on complaints submitted by individuals who have returned 
from Iraq and to consider the complicity and responsibility of the private security companies and 
individuals involved. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the interim Government of Fiji, the Working Group visited Fiji from 14 
to 18 May 2007. The Working Group delegation was composed of its Chairperson-Rapporteur, 
Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado, and one of its members, Mr. Alexander Nikitin. The Working 
Group is grateful to the interim Government of Fiji for its invitation. The Working Group 
enjoyed excellent cooperation with the Fijian authorities throughout the planning and conduct of 
its visit. 
</p>
<p>2. The visit to Fiji forms part of an assessment by the Working Group of a phenomenon in 
recent years whereby nationals of countries have been recruited by private military and private 
security companies (hereinafter referred to as PMSCs<b>1</b>), often subsidiaries of foreign-based 
companies, to work in conflict situations in other regions, including Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Four areas were of particular interest to the Working Group in Fiji: (i) contracting and training of 
Fijians for security work in the Middle East; (ii) status and regulation of PMSCs in Fiji; national 
legislation and protection measures, including permits and licensing; citizen security and safety; 
(iii) status of the accession of Fiji to the 1989 Convention and implementation; and (iv) the 
situation of Fijians allegedly recruited as mercenaries in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea. 
3. During its visit, the Working Group delegation held meetings with the interim 
Prime Minister, the interim Minister for Foreign Affairs, the interim Attorney General, the 
interim Minister for Labour, the Deputy Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces, the 
Acting Police Commissioner, the Acting Chief Justice, as well as a former Prime Minister and a 
former Minister of Labour. The Working Group also held consultations with the Acting Chair, 
Commissioner and Director of the Fiji Human Rights Commission, representatives of Fiji Law 
Society, the Fiji Trade Unions Congress and several non-governmental organizations, academics 
at the University of the South Pacific, as well as employment agents and current and former 
employees of private security companies, and other individuals. In addition, the Working Group 
met with United Nations agencies, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and a number of 
representatives of the diplomatic community. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. The mandate of the Working Group was established in 2005 and builds on the work of the 
former mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  For the purposes of the present report and while recognizing the definitional challenges, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group refers to private military and security companies as including private companies 
which perform all types of security assistance, training, provision and consulting services, 
including unarmed logistical support, armed security guards, and those involved in defensive or 
offensive military and/or security-type activities, particularly in armed conflict areas. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/7/Add.3

</p>
<p>human rights and impeding the exercise of the rights of peoples to self-determination.<b>2</b> With the 
creation of the Working Group, the mandate was widened to include monitoring of PMSCs and 
the impact of their activities on all human rights. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group considers that State authorities have the primary responsibility in 
maintaining public security and law and order in the State, under international and domestic law. 
Noting the trends of privatization of security and the use of force, the Working Group is 
concerned that some PMSCs are committing human rights violations with impunity whilst 
operating in armed conflicts and other situations. This phenomenon is often associated with the 
creation by transnational companies of satellite subsidiaries which have a legal personality in one 
country, provide services in another and recruit personnel from third countries. As indicated in 
the Working Group&#8217;s annual report, the international legal framework and regulatory schema 
remain to meet the needs for accountability and oversight of these companies.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The visit of the Working Group took place following the military-led coup d&#8217;&#233;tat 
of 5 December 2006. The United Nations Security Council and the then Secretary-General 
condemned the coup and action by the military in Fiji and called for the peaceful restoration 
of the democratically elected Government as soon as possible. The United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Louise Arbour, expressed her concern 
through a public statement on 7 December 2006.<b>4</b> In January 2007, the new United Nations 
Secretary-General reiterated the previous calls for the &#8220;immediate reinstatement of the legitimate 
authority in Fiji and its return to constitutional rule and full democracy&#8221;.<b>5</b>

</b>  The Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
</p>
<p>impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination was established by the 
Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 11 of resolution 2005/2. The Working Group is 
composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities and headed by its 
Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain). The other Working Group 
experts are Ms. Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Ms. Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez 
(Colombia), Mr. Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation) and Ms. Shaista Shameem (Fiji). 
As agreed by Working Group members, Ms. Shameem was not part of the delegation visiting 
Fiji, although she was consulted and interviewed by the delegation during its visit in her capacity 
as Director of the Fiji Human Rights Commission.

</p>
<p><b>II. POLITICAL AND LEGAL STRATEGY 
AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International level 
</b></p>
<p>7. Fiji is a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and has signed the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography. 
</p>
<p>8. It has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Fiji has acceded to the 
eight core Conventions of the International Labour Organization, including Convention 105 on 
the Abolition of Forced Labour (1957), but has not yet acceded to Convention 181 on Private 
Employment Agencies (1997). 
</p>
<p>9. Fiji is not a party to the 1989 International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries, which has been ratified or acceded by 30 States. 
While noting the limitations of this instrument, the Working Group promotes accession as an 
important step towards addressing the concerns of mercenarism. The Working Group is 
encouraged by statements of support for this measure from the executive, legislative and judicial 
branches of the Fijian interim Government, and extends its support and assistance for a 
speedy treaty action. The Working Group was informed of pending treaty action by Fiji on some 
12 United Nations instruments on counter-terrorism, and urges the authorities to consider adding 
treaty action on the 1989 Convention as a priority.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>10. One of the limitations of the 1989 Convention is that PMSCs and their employees fall into 
a grey area not specifically addressed. This demonstrates the need for appropriate national 
regulation and monitoring of the activities of these security companies with a view to ensuring 
the responsibilities of the State and the effective enjoyment of human rights. To this end, such 
national-level registration and licensing systems for PMSCs and employees should include the 
definition of minimum requirements for transparency and accountability of firms; the screening 
and vetting of personnel; and the establishment of a monitoring system, including parliamentary 
oversight. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour informed the Working Group of a 
</p>
<p>submission from the Ministry to the former Cabinet in 2004 concerning accession to the 1989 
Convention that did not make it past the subcommittee level. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/7/Add.3 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  National level 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Fiji Constitution of 1997 provides that the conduct of government shall be based on a 
number of principles, including full respect for the rights of all individuals, communities and 
groups.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>12. Section 12 of the Royal Fiji Military Forces Act (FMF Act) states that the President, acting 
on the advice of the Minister, must appoint a Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces 
to exercise military executive command of the Forces, subject to the control of the Minister. 
The FMF Act includes provisions under which soldiers, regardless of whether they are retired or 
in the reserves, in the territorial or regular forces, can be released for duty overseas. The Minister 
for Home Affairs must first define by legal notice published in <i>The</i> <i>Gazette</i>, after approval by the 
Cabinet and the President, as Commander in Chief, a purpose or duty that authorizes defence 
force involvement overseas (sects. 3 (3) and 3 (4)). This also means that the financing of such a 
venture must be lawfully approved (sect. 3 (4)). No officer or soldier of the FMF, whatever their 
status, can be allowed to proceed on duty overseas without the Minister&#8217;s approval (sect. 3 (4)). 
Only the President, upon the advice of the Minister of Home Affairs, can disband a section of the 
FMF or discharge from service any individual soldier to enable such soldier to serve overseas 
under someone else&#8217;s employment and control. This procedure has not been followed yet by 
either the FMF or the Minister of Home Affairs and his Cabinet.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group notes the existence of an Employment Ordinance, which states, in 
article 47 (1) of chapter 92, section on &#8220;Foreign contracts of service and contracts made abroad&#8221;, 
that when a contract made within Fiji relates to employment in another territory, the attestation 
of the contract must take place before an attesting officer before the employee leaves Fiji. It also 
stipulates that a medical examination must take place at the latest by the time the employee 
leaves Fiji, and enables the labour officer to require security by bond, and penalties including 
fines and imprisonment for inducing persons to proceed abroad under informal contract. 
</p>
<p>14. The Ministry of Labour informed the Working Group of the need for labour contracts to be 
attested and for the two parties thus to agree, and that the Ministry considers that it requires 
minimal conditions of a &#8220;Schedule 3&#8221; system to cover accommodation, pay, repatriation and 
compensation. However, the Ministry of Labour acknowledges that it uses outdated legislation 
from 1970 which is not sufficient. The Ministry of Labour specifically noted that it has a 
mandate to &#8220;attest&#8221; but not to &#8220;supervise&#8221; whether an individual is leaving for nursing or
</p>

</p>
<p>security work abroad. The system for the supervision of PSCs is to be created by the Ministry of 
Labour. The Ministry of Labour informed the Working Group of the envisioned enactment of an 
Employment Act as of October 2007, to include a &#8220;licensing&#8221; system, not only in enlisting but 
also in recruitment.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>15. In this regard, the Working Group notes the uncertainties surrounding the ability of the 
interim administration&#8217;s ability to adopt law, in light of the in effect disbanded bicameral 
parliament, the Senate and House of Representatives, since the December 2006 coup d&#8217;&#233;tat.<b>10</b> 
In consulting with the interim authorities, it noted the position of the Acting Chief Justice that in 
the current context, formative legislation should still be passed to address pressing needs and that 
such legislation by decree could later be reviewed and ratified once a democratically elected 
Parliament was in session. 
</p>
<p>16. If such legislative action would be considered in advance, the Working Group discussed 
with representatives of the interim Government the different options to transpose the obligations 
from the 1989 Convention into national legislation to include the amendment of the Penal Code 
and/or the Employment Act or the enactment of a special law to address the issues. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PRIVATE MILITARY AND SECURITY COMPANIES IN FIJI 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Situation of private military and security companies 
in Fiji and recruitment of individuals by private 
companies for work abroad 
</b></p>
<p>17. From its consultations with the interim Government, the Working Group noted that the 
interim Prime Minister registered concern as to whether former Fijian soldiers now working 
for PMSCs in Iraq would be considered &#8220;mercenaries&#8221;. The interim Minister of Foreign Affairs 
noted that the individuals who had left had not been contracted by States but had left in 
their individual and private capacity on the basis of casual agreements between parties. 
A representative of the Royal Fiji Military Forces noted that body&#8217;s concerns in terms of image, 
namely, that this unregulated activity could tarnish the reputation of the Fijian military, built 
inter alia on its contributions to peacekeeping operations worldwide. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  See clause 2.6.4.l (i), which covers &#8220;regulation enlisting &#8230; for foreign contracts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Clause 24 (t) concerns private employment. The Ministry of Labour also noted its cooperation 
with ILO and the commitment to review the Bill and incorporate some 22 ILO Conventions 
ratified, including the eight core Conventions. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  It also noted that on 1 April 2007, at the 116th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
(IPU), held in Bali, Indonesia from 29 April to 4 May, the IPU Governing Council decided to 
suspend the membership of the Parliament of Fiji. See www.ipu.org/press-e/bali5.htm. </p>

<p> A/HRC/7/7/Add.3 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group delegation was provided by the Ministry of Labour with a copy of a 
letter dated 1 February 2005, which the Ministry had addressed to the Secretary-General of the 
Parliament and which annexed &#8220;a list of the recruitment agencies and their offshore counterparts 
with their addresses. The list also gives relevant information such as occupations with rates of 
pay and the current number of Fiji nationals in Kuwait and Iraq&#8221;. 
</p><p>19. The document states that, as of early 2005, 838 Fijians were employed in Iraq and Kuwait, 
by four private military and security companies: (i) 358 employed by Public Warehousing Co. 
(Kuwait), through its local agent the Meridian Services (Fiji); (ii) 220 employed by Global Risks 
Strategies, through its local agent Global Risks Strategies (Fiji) Ltd; (iii) 160 employed by 
Armor Group Services Ltd (U.K.), with local agent Homeland Security Services Ltd (Fiji); and 
(iv) 100 employed by Triple Canopy Inc. (USA), with local agent Triple Canopy (Fiji). 
According to this document, all employees were provided with insurance and allowances and 
were guaranteed repatriation, while the Meridian recruits would have to cover 50 per cent of 
their own costs. 
</p>
<p>20. The Ministry of Labour also provided the Working Group delegation with updated 
documentation listing the employment status of Fijians and other details of five private military 
and security companies as of January 2006: (i) 250 were employed by Public Warehousing Co. 
(Kuwait); (ii) 250 were employed by Global Risks Strategies (Iraq); (iii) 181 were employed by 
Armor Group Services Ltd (Iraq); (iv) 62 were employed by Control Risks Group (Iraq); and 
(v) 73 were employed by Triple Canopy Inc. (Iraq). One particular item on this document was 
&#8220;Issues of Concern from Recruitment Process&#8221;, which states that 200 were recruited but 
unemployed in Kuwait and that 14,550 had been recruited in Fiji without available contracts in 
Kuwait. It also noted that Global Risk Strategies (Iraq) has experienced a total of four fatalities; 
two in action and two by natural causes. 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group also obtained in the course of its visit to Fiji copies of a number of 
employment contracts between private military and security companies and individuals. Notably, 
these contracts consistently included a governmental stamp by the Divisional Labour Officer 
Central in Suva. This was the case, for example, with contracts of PWC Logistics in Kuwait, 
which were also stamped by the Meridian Services Agency Suva in Fiji. These particular job 
offer letters listed a basic salary of KD 400 per month as a &#8220;squad leader&#8221;, as compared with 
KD 175 per month as a &#8220;trailor driver&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Having also consulted with senior members of the former Government in Fiji, the Working 
Group noted both the position of the former Prime Minister - that the Government had nothing to 
do with these recruitments - and the emphasis placed on the private nature of the arrangements 
between the PMSCs and individual Fijians. The Working Group was informed that as a policy, 
the Government did not stop anyone from going abroad for work and imposed no restrictions. 
At the same time, the Government was concerned to ensure proper contracts and insurance and 
adequately executed travel arrangements, with the Ministry of Labour in charge of oversight. 
</p>
<p>23. The former Minister of Labour provided some information on a &#8220;particularly 
disappointing case&#8221; concerning the company Meredian Services in Fiji which had received 
much media coverage. The director of this company allegedly promised to give work to 
some 15,000 to 20,000 people in the Middle East, notably in Kuwait. The company 
requested 150 Fiji dollars in advance to secure employment and is estimated to have collected </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.3 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>some 5 million Fiji dollars. The Acting Chief Justice informed the Working Group that many 
persons in Fiji borrowed money from their villages and obtained passport and adequate clothing 
only to realize that the offer was a fraud. However, while some 400 recruited Fijians were sent in 
a first batch, allegedly only some 200 actually obtained work. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group is concerned by the fact that this company was not registered with the 
authorities and by the lack of oversight by the Ministry of Labour or any other State organ. The 
Acting Police Commissioner informed the Working Group that investigations were conducted 
when some of those enlisted gave evidence. The Ministry of Labour was concerned that it was 
neither involved nor informed, and requested the judicial police to investigate despite the fact 
that it had not received complaints at the time. However, the Acting Police Commissioner 
observed that as the case featured no criminal element, merely elements of fraud, and was 
considered as &#8220;private dealing&#8221;, it was filed. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group is also concerned by the initial statements and positions of the 
Government in 2005, when the Minister of Labour stated: 
</p>
<p>  &#8220;The Government knows that more men are leaving for Kuwait and Iraq and it is a 
good thing, because it is providing employment for the unemployed. This is one solution to 
the increasing unemployment rate in the country today.&#8221;<b>11</b> </p>
<p>26. The Working Group learned that the then Minister of Labour visited Kuwait in 2005, 
stating that his Ministry supported workers travelling to Iraq and Kuwait, urging &#8220;coverage of 
insurance for work-related injuries and deaths, to be arranged by the employing companies and 
that is a mandatory part for the contracts which are attested by my ministry&#8221;.<b>12</b> The former 
Minister informed the Working Group that it was the number of complaints that prompted him to 
go to Kuwait, where he held a large meeting with some 150 to 200 Fijians, at which he learned 
that only half of them had jobs. He informed the Working Group that a number of Fijians had 
complained about not finding a job (and that some had resorted to criminal activities). He also 
referred to their experiences of non-fulfilment of payment and lack of insurance and reported 
that representatives of PMSCs allegedly confiscated their passports so they would not change 
over to another company. 
</p>
<p>27. The former Minister of Labour also informed the Working Group that he had visited the 
headquarters of PMSCs in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom, and that he 
&#8220;went to ensure that employment could continue, increase numbers, respect insurance and 
conditions&#8221;. While noting his support for enhanced regulation in Fiji, he also referred to the 
unemployment rates in Fiji, noting that if overly strict conditions were imposed, PMSCs would

<p>28. The Working Group takes note of a later, adjusted position of a subsequent Minister for 
Labour, who in 2006 called for people intending to work in Iraq to check with his ministry 
before signing any contract, stating the following: &#8220;We want to ensure that the recruitment 
operation is within the law. And if it is so, then we cannot stop people from seeking 
employment. But the Ministry should be able to study the contract of employment first.&#8221;<b>13</b> </p>
<p>29. The Working Group also noted the information from representatives of the Royal Fiji 
Military Forces (RFMF) on the significant role that RFMF soldiers played in United Nations 
peacekeeping operations and in the Army of the United Kingdom.<b>14</b> It also recognized that some 
serving members of the armed forces had resigned in order to work with private companies, 
including senior military personnel discharged for that purpose. The Working Group also 
received information from an RFMF representative that three former Ministers were currently 
running PMSCs, which could indicate a symbiotic relationship and a troubling &#8220;revolving-door&#8221; 
syndrome between political leaders and PMSCs, a situation observed by the Working Group in 
other contexts as well.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Working Group takes note of statements by several non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) to the effect that the Government may not wish to discourage persons from working in 
the field of security abroad, due to unemployment conditions in Fiji and the amount of 
remittances which these individuals can send to their families, who often live in rural areas of the 
country. The Citizens Constitutional Forum (CCF) has opposed the recruitment of former 
soldiers by PMSCs for profit-making security business in Iraq. CCF has called on the 
representatives of PMSCs to seriously reconsider whether this work is worthwhile in view of the 
death and serious injuries that have occurred and is likely to recur in future. CCF also noted the 
responsibility of the Fijian Government because it had encouraged the recruitment activities 
from the start.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Prior to its visit to Fiji, the Working Group had noted media reports that Global Risks 
Strategies, registered in the United Kingdom, had come to Fiji in 2003 to recruit personnel for 
security-related work in Iraq.<b>16</b> Homeland Security Limited had allegedly sent a recruiting team

<p>to Fiji seeking 70 men from the police, army or prison service to work as security guards in Iraq, 
and was reported to have recruited 181 Fijians by mid-2005.<b>17</b> Another 70 Fijians were allegedly 
working in Iraq with Triple Canopy, a United States corporation.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>32. In the course of its visit, the Working Group had an opportunity to meet with a number of 
representatives of PMSCs which have recruited Fijians for security work abroad. The head of 
one company&#8217;s operations in Fiji considered that the search for employment and better pay were 
the main reasons why thousands of Fijians were braving the dangers of Iraq. One representative 
informed the Working Group of his function as a &#8220;service provider&#8221;, for which he receives a 
salary/fee which usually amount to 7,500 Fiji dollars per month or less and an additional 
100 dollars per individual recruited to cover office rent and other expenses. To prepare a person 
for the work, a fee of 300 dollars is received, followed by 100 dollars per month for each month 
worked in Iraq. The companies have seen a decline since 2003 in the numbers of recruitments. 
In 2003, one company sent 560 persons for work in Iraq and has sent around 1,000 since then, 
while in 2007 only 10 persons were recruited for work in Iraq. Another PMSC employer said 
that his company had previously sent some 150 persons but that currently only 10 of those 
recruited through the company were working in Iraq. It was noted that many had left the 
companies and worked for other companies and that some applied through the Internet and went 
directly to Iraq through their own contacts. 
</p>
<p>33. One PMSC employer reported that the company had set some baseline criteria for 
recruitment: (i) ex-military or ex-policeman with at least three years of experience; (ii) birth 
certificate and other papers, over 23 and under 55; (iii) police clearance (criminal record 
checker), which the company pays for as well as the medical check-up. The representative stated 
that no training was dispensed in Fiji but that five days of training were provided upon arrival in 
Baghdad and that the AK-47 was the main weapon used in Iraq. While this PMSC employer 
representative stated that none of those recruited by his company had been killed, he noted that 
five persons who had left to work for another company had been killed, which had led to the 
imprisonment in Kuwait of the people who had hired them. </p>
<p>34. Employer representatives of PMSCs informed the Working Group generally of similar but 
also some differing procedures. One representative noted that he conducts physical and medical 
tests and assists recruits with their visa application, while another representative spoke of his 
good relations with the Australian Embassy in Fiji (recruits often travel by air through Sydney 
and Dubai). The representatives reported differing practices as to whether the employment 
contracts were signed abroad or in Fiji, signed by representatives of the mother company or 
signed on their behalf, and there were differing accounts as to the attestation by and contacts 
with the Ministry of Labour. As for working conditions, the range of remuneration varied 
from 1,500 to 3,000 dollars, with three to six months of work prior to leave and different levels

<p>of insurance policies and compensation. The representatives said that payments usually 
go through offices or banks in Dubai or London, and rarely directly to the families. 
One representative noted that a letter of release is required if the recruitment concerns military 
personnel, who may remain in the reserves with a corresponding impact on their pension and 
other rights; such release is not requested if it concerns a person currently in the reserves. The 
company can apparently write to the Army and provide the list of those wishing to be hired and 
the Army issues permissions. 
</p>
<p>35. As for the accounts by recruited PMSC employees received by the Working Group during 
the visit, the practices described above concerning the recruitment phase of their work were 
largely confirmed. It was confirmed that the employment agreements were routinely witnessed 
by official representatives of the Ministry of Labour in Fiji. Former employees described their 
travels to the Middle East on chartered planes, including via Korea and Dubai, and observed 
security personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Kenya, Uganda, Fiji, 
Pakistan, South Africa and Mexico. The type of security-related work once in Iraq included 
manning checkpoints, guarding electricity plants, static security, convoy security and personal 
security detail. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Effects of the activities of Fijians working for private military 
and security companies on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Working Group considers its mandate twofold as to its consideration of rights 
holders: (i) persons working for PMSCs may commit abuses and human rights violations while 
performing their security work in situations of violent or low-intensity conflict; and (ii) the 
persons employed by PMSCs often find themselves in vulnerable situations, with contractual 
irregularities, exploitation, arbitrary detention and other restrictions on their human rights and 
labour rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Consistent with the first set of issues, the Working Group is concerned at information 
collected about some aspects of the activities of Fijians recruited to work for private companies 
offering military assistance, consultancy and security services in situations of violence and 
armed conflict such as in Iraq. To exemplify the situation, the Working Group notes the 
experience recounted to it by a former Fijian soldier who served as a private security guard for a 
PMSC in Baghdad in 2006 and claimed to have witnessed shooting incidents while working in 
Iraq.<b>19</b> The person in question figures as a witness in a criminal court case taking place in the 
United States of America, over what he reported to the media and company executives as a 
series of incidents in Iraq during July 2006. The allegations concern random shootings and 
deliberate targeting of civilians and involve private contractor guards and former United States 
military personnel. The case reached the United States courts after an investigation was carried 
out by the United States Army and the company in question. A team of lawyers representing the 
PMSC and representing the officers implicated in the incidents met with the person in question,

<p>

</p>
<p>Mr. Naucukidi, in Fiji in May 2007 to take his statement.<b>20</b> Other accounts from this and other 
individuals provide insights as to how companies operate in Iraq without vehicle plates and no 
uniform (making it impossible to distinguish between PMSCs); use heavy weaponry and pose a 
challenge in terms of accountability and oversight. </p>
<p>38. Relevant to the other aspect of the Working Group mandate&#8217;s concern, it also addresses 
issues concerning the rights of individuals recruited for work with PMSCs. At the time of the 
visit, 21 Fijians had reportedly been killed while working for PMSCs in Iraq, with several others 
injured.<b>21</b> One much publicized incident took place in mid-April 2006, when four Fijian nationals 
working as security personnel in Iraq were killed in an ambush during a convoy-protection 
mission northbound towards Kirkuk in northern Iraq. 
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group has also received information on situations where Fijians recruited for 
these private security companies have been exploited. As mentioned above, thousands of Fijians 
have in recent years been lured into paying fees for prospective security work abroad which did 
not materialize. In other instances, the contracts were signed under fraudulent conditions, either 
immediately upon departure or upon arrival in the country of destination. After performing 
security work in countries abroad, many Fijians have experienced contractual irregularities and 
poor working conditions, including excessive working hours, partial or non-payment of salaries, 
ill-treatment and the neglect of basic needs such as access to medical services. A representative 
from the Trade Union considered that there is no proper legislation and oversight of the 
contractual arrangements, a lack which has led to unpleasant surprises. One Fijian contractor 
reportedly stated that the contract viewed in Fiji was different to the one signed in Iraq, where he 
earned approximately $1,200 monthly.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>40. The interim Attorney General of Fiji informed the Working Group that the wife of a person 
who had suffered a heart attack in Iraq had visited him. The insurance policy did not cover 
&#8220;natural death&#8221;, and since Hong Kong had been specified as the jurisdiction, there was limited 
opportunity for recourse. As far as abuses by PMSCs were concerned, if Fijians were mistreated 
or detained, international law and conventions should apply. NGO representatives told of 
experiences where a PMSC agent had gone to a family and attended the funeral. The family had 
accepted the explanation and had not wished to ruin the relations, as it was considered 
&#8220;traditional courtesy&#8221; to accept apologies without criticizing.

</p>
<p>41. The Working Group was informed of the limited reintegration measures available to 
Fijians who had performed security work abroad upon the return to their communities in Fiji. 
Such measures are necessary to prevent domestic violence and the spread of sexually 
transmittable diseases.<b>23</b> There appears to be no decent debriefing or process to deal with 
returnees, in particular sexual and other violence against women and children by those returning 
to Fiji. Among the repercussions when people return from security work abroad, there is 
violence against women in homes. NGO representatives informed the Working Group that no 
counselling is available and that there are no debriefings with trained psychologists. 
</p>
<p>42. One PMSC representative informed the Working Group of its insurance policy, which 
included medical treatment in London or Dubai, coverage of medical and emergency expenses, 
and a list of 60 detailed descriptions of injuries. The representative noted that claims had been 
paid out in full. However, that version contrasted with a number of accounts provided by 
PMSC employees. As to proceeding with claims, one individual referred to an exchange with a 
PMSC, when he had warned the PMSC that in 30 days he would institute action for some 20 to 
30 individuals. The company had sent him a threatening reply, was aware that the lawyer had 
spoken publicly about it and considered itself defamed. Another individual informed the 
Working Group of a claim submitted to the High Court of Fiji at Suva, Civil Jurisdiction, 
in 2006, against Armor Group Services Ltd on charges of termination of the plaintiffs&#8217; contract 
on unfounded allegations and unlawful detention for general damages of US$ 200,000. The 
plaintiff had also written to the British High Commission in Suva, which had responded by letter 
of 9 January 2006 &#8220;regarding your complaint against a British Company, the Armor Group 
Security Company that operates in Iraq&#8221;. The representative of the High Commissioner &#8220;advised 
to engage the services of a lawyer if you are looking to obtain redress from the above-mentioned 
company&#8221;.

<p><b>IV. SITUATION OF FIJIANS ALLEGEDLY RECRUITED 
AS MERCENARIES IN BOUGAINVILLE IN 
PAPUA NEW GUINEA 
</b></p>
<p>43. Traditional forms of mercenarism persist in the region, as demonstrated in cases where 
former Fijian soldiers were recruited in 2005 to undertake mercenary activities in Papua 
New Guinea on the autonomous island province of Bougainville. In November 2005, it was 
reported that five to nine former Fijian soldiers had entered PNG illegally and were arming and 
training a private militia in a rebel-held area on the island of Bougainville. The Fijians were 
reportedly training a group of at least 30 men, led by rebel leader Noah Musingku, in a camp 
at Tonu in Siwai district, South Bougainville. The rebel leader claims that the Fijians were 
security guards for his bank.<b>24</b> Three Fijians left PNG sometime in January 2007 and a month 
later four Fijians surrendered to the Bougainville Police, while one Fijian reportedly remains

</p>
<p>in Tonu. Since their surrender, the four Fijians have been held in custody at Buka police station 
and could face charges of belonging to an illegal army and drilling and training with an illegal 
army.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group was informed by a representative of the Royal Fiji Military Forces 
that the Army had taken special steps to distance itself from the situation. The acting Police 
Commissioner informed the Working Group of details of the events and of his experience of 
having been in the Solomon Islands at a time when 10 persons were recruited from Fiji and left 
via Honiara to the Solomon Islands towards Bougainville. In Honiara, the men were taken to a 
motel belonging to a Fijian businessman. Someone from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fiji 
recognized the men and alerted the High Commissioner to the Solomon Islands in Papua 
New Guinea. The police in the Solomon Islands were duly informed and placed the Fijians under 
house arrest for three days before immigration officers sent them back to Fiji, while one member 
of the group escaped. The persons recruited had been told that transfer would be facilitated by an 
agent in Honiara and that all of their expenses would be reimbursed. 
</p>
<p>45. A representative of the High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to Fiji informed 
the Working Group of its understanding of the events. The representative noted that in 
October 2005, some Fijians had left for Port Moresby for Bougainville pretending to be 
missionaries but in reality to perform security work for Noah Musingku. Mr. Musingku has run 
false pyramid schemes in Papua New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands, and styles himself as a 
&#8220;King of the Kingdom of South PNG/Bougainville&#8221;. However, the representative emphasized 
the position that Mr. Musingku is a con man, not a leader. Eight Fijians went to Bougainville, 
while three left voluntarily following action taken by the Government of Australia. A special 
envoy from the Government of Fiji travelled to Papua New Guinea, but the action was not 
successful and the individuals refused to leave. Three of them are now detained in Buka in 
Bougainville and have been charged with (i) illegal taking-up of arms; (ii) illegal possession of 
arms; and (iii) illegal immigration. One Fijian reportedly remains in Bougainville. The 10 Fijians 
in the Solomon Islands were intercepted by the PNG High Commissioner in the Solomon Islands 
and returned to Fiji, and should face charges. The representative noted that the reason why the 
police in Papua New Guinea have not taken action to intervene is due to the peace process and 
prior experiences. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Working Group notes that Fiji has an established tradition of well-trained, disciplined 
and highly skilled military and security personnel who perform security functions in various 
capacities worldwide. Several interlocutors confirmed their experiences that Fijians are reliable 
in hot spots and are very professional, stress-resistant and appreciated colleagues. The Working 
Group notes that security work is a major source of income for the country and for individuals

<p>and local communities; third only to a US$ 6 billion sugar industry and a US$ 2 billion tourism 
industry. Remittances of overseas work are crucial for many rural areas in Fiji. It appears to be 
this mixture of supply and incentives, coupled with a limited to non-existent legal framework, 
which has created a breeding ground for the recruitment of Fijians to work for PMSCs. 
</p><p>47. The Working Group is concerned by information it has received indicating that Fijians 
recruited by private security companies have been exploited. As indicated above, thousands of 
Fijians have in recent years been lured into paying fees for prospective security work abroad 
which did not materialize. The information received also indicates that in a number of cases, 
contracts were signed under fraudulent conditions, either immediately upon departure or upon 
arrival in the country of destination. Many Fijians have also experienced contractual 
irregularities and poor working conditions, including excessive working hours, partial or 
non-payment of salaries, ill-treatment and the neglect of basic needs such as access to medical 
services. 
</p>
<p>48. The Working Group is concerned by the absence or limited reintegration measures 
available to Fijians who have performed security work abroad upon the return to their 
communities in Fiji. 
</p><p>49. The Working Group is concerned at the absence of national legislation and measures in Fiji 
to effectively address these issues. It encourages the Fiji authorities to take positive action in 
order to ensure that private military and security companies in Fiji operate within a legal 
framework in full accordance with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group is also concerned by persistent forms of traditional mercenarism in 
the region, in particular by the situation in the autonomous island province of Bougainville in 
Papua New Guinea, where former Fijian soldiers were recruited in 2005 to undertake mercenary 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The Working Group wishes to submit the following recommendations:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Accession of Fiji to the 1989 International Convention against the Recruitment, 
Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Development of national legislation to address mercenaries, mercenary-related 
activities and the activities of private companies offering military assistance, consultancy 
and security services on the international market. This can take place through the 
introduction of such elements into the Penal Code and/or Employment Act, or through the 
elaboration of a separate comprehensive law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Establishment of a system for regulating, licensing, controlling and monitoring 
the activities of private security companies in order to provide effective oversight, whereby 
the authorities would maintain transparent registers of private security companies on all 
matters such as ownership, statutes, purposes and functions as well as a system of regular 
inspections to ensure accountability; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/7/Add.3 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b> (d) Certification of the services provided by private security companies and of their 
personnel training; and oversight by the Ministry of Security of entrance tests and recruit 
training and preparation in accordance with approved standards. Personnel training 
should cover United Nations rules on the use of firearms and on the protection of human 
rights, such as the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles 
on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Status checks on private security company directors, shareholders and 
executives, as well as all personnel, to ensure that they have not previously been implicated 
in human rights violations and that there are no conflicts of interest between posts held by 
members or former members of the military or police and their involvement in private 
security companies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Establishment of a &#8220;Commissioner for Private Military and Security 
Companies&#8221;, who could be a part, institutionally speaking, of the Ministry of Public 
Security, with a mandate to register and monitor private military and security companies 
operating in Fiji and receive complaints. The Working Group suggests that such a 
mechanism could undertake joint inspections with the Ministry of Labour, with a mandate 
to make announced and unannounced visits in this oversight role; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Adoption of measures to address issues of reintegration and post-traumatic 
stress disorder in individuals returning from security work abroad through the 
establishment of a comprehensive system of debriefing and professional counselling; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Adoption of measures by the competent authorities allowing them to act with 
speed and vigour on complaints submitted by individuals who have returned from Iraq, 
and to consider the complicity and responsibility of private security companies and 
individuals involved; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Accession to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, as these instruments would also strengthen the protection of Fijians contracted 
for security work abroad.
