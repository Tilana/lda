reserves are characterized by declining production rates, and our future oil and
natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and our 
ability to make distributions are highly
dependent on our success in economically finding or acquiring additional 
recoverable reserves and efficiently developing and exploiting our current 
reserves. Further, the rate of estimated decline of
our oil and natural gas reserves may increase if our wells do not produce as 
expected. We may not be able to find, acquire or develop additional reserves to 
replace our current and future production
at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our business, results of

Our future growth may be limited because we distribute all of our available cash
to our limited partners, and potential future disruptions in the financial 
markets may
prevent us from obtaining the financing necessary for growth and acquisitions.  
</I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we will distribute 
all of our available cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) to our 
limited partners, our growth may
not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand 
ongoing operations. Further, since we depend on financing provided by commercial
banks and other lenders and the issuance of
debt and equity securities to finance any significant growth or acquisitions, 
potential future disruptions in the global financial markets and any associated 
severe tightening of credit supply may
prevent us from obtaining adequate financing from these sources, and, as a 
result, our ability to grow, both in terms of additional drilling and 
acquisitions, will be limited. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Increases in the cost of or failure of costs to adjust downward for drilling 
rigs, service rigs, pumping services and other costs in drilling and completing
wells could
reduce the viability of certain of our development projects.  
</I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher oil and natural 
gas prices may increase the rig count and thus the cost of rigs and oil field 
services necessary to implement
our development projects while also decreasing their availability. Increased 
capital requirements for our projects will result in higher reserve replacement 
costs which could reduce cash available for
distribution. Higher project costs could cause certain of our projects to become
uneconomic and therefore not to be implemented, reducing our production and cash
available for distribution. Decreased
availability of drilling equipment and services could significantly impact the 
planned execution of our scheduled development program. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If commodity prices decline and remain depressed for a prolonged period, a 
significant portion of our development projects may become uneconomic and cause 
write downs of the
value of our oil and gas properties, which may adversely affect our financial 
condition and our ability to make distributions to our limited partners.  
</I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower oil and natural gas
prices may not only decrease our revenues, but also reduce the amount of oil and
natural gas that we can
produce economically. For example, the drastically lower oil and natural gas 
prices experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008 rendered more than half of the 
development projects we had planned at such
time uneconomic and resulted in a substantial downward adjustment to our 
estimated proved reserves. Further, deteriorating commodity prices may cause us 
to recognize impairments in the value of our
oil and natural gas properties. For example, in the year ended December&nbsp;31,
2013 we incurred impairment charges of $85.8&nbsp;million, of which 
$78.0&nbsp;million was driven largely by
commodity price changes. In addition, if our estimates of development costs 
increase, production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate, 
accounting rules may require us to write down, as
a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and
natural gas properties for impairments. We may incur impairment charges in the 
future related to depressed commodity prices, which could have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations in
the period taken. </FONT></P>

Fluctuations in price and demand for our natural gas and NGLs may force us to
shut in a significant number of our producing wells, which may adversely impact 
our revenues
and ability to pay distributions to our limited partners.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to great 
fluctuations in the prices we are paid for our natural gas due to a number of 
factors including regional
demand, weather, demand for NGLs which are recovered from our gas stream, and 
new natural gas pipelines. Drilling in shale resources has developed large 
amounts of new natural gas supplies, both from
natural gas wells and associated natural gas from oil wells, that have depressed
the prices paid for our natural gas, and we expect the shale resources to 
continue to be drilled and developed by our
competitors. We also face the potential risk of shut-in natural gas due to high 
levels of natural gas and NGL inventory in storage, weak demand due to mild 
weather and the effects of any economic
downturns on industrial demand. Lack of NGL storage in Mont Belvieu where our 
West Texas and New Mexico NGLs are shipped for processing could cause the 
processors of our natural gas to curtail or
shut-in our natural gas wells and potentially force us to shut-in oil wells that
produce associated natural gas. For example, following past hurricanes, certain 
Permian Basin natural gas processors
were forced to shut down their plants due to the shutdown of the Texas Gulf 
Coast NGL fractionators, requiring us to vent or flare the associated natural 
gas from our oil wells. There is no certainty
we will be able to vent or flare natural gas again due to potential changes in 
regulations. Furthermore we may encounter problems in restarting production of 
previously shut-in wells. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our commodity and interest rate derivative activities may limit our ability to 
profit from price gains, could result in cash losses and expose us to 
counterparty risk and as
a result could reduce our cash available for distributions.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered into, and
we expect in the future to enter into, oil and natural gas derivative contracts 
intended to offset the
effects of commodity price volatility related to a significant portion of our 
oil and natural gas production. Many derivative instruments that we employ 
require us to make cash payments to the extent
the applicable index exceeds a predetermined price, thereby limiting our ability
to realize the benefit of increases in oil and natural gas prices. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, we have entered into, and we may in the future enter into, interest 
rate swap contracts intended to offset the effects of interest rate volatility 
related to our outstanding
indebtedness under our revolving credit facility. These instruments require us 
to make cash payments to the extent applicable floating interest rates are less 
than our contracted fixed rates, thereby
limiting our ability to realize the benefit of declining interest rates. 
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is always risk that counterparties in any commodity or interest rate derivative 
transaction cannot or will not perform under our derivative contracts. If a 
counterparty fails to
perform and the derivative transaction is terminated, our cash flow and ability
to pay distributions could be adversely impacted. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
if our actual production and sales for any period are less than our expected 
production covered by derivative contracts and sales for that period (including 
reductions in
production due to involuntary shut-ins or operational delays) or if we are 
unable to perform our drilling activities as planned, we might be forced to 
satisfy all or a portion of our derivative
contracts without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying 
physical commodity, resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity. 
Under our revolving credit facility, we are
prohibited from entering into commodity derivative contracts covering all of our
production, and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease on our volumes 
not covered by commodity derivative
contracts. </FONT></P>

An increase in the differential between the West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices that we 
receive for our oil production sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant 
benchmark prices, such as WTI, that are
used for calculating derivative positions. The difference between the benchmark 
price and the price we receive is called a differential. Increases in the 
differential between the benchmark prices for
oil and the wellhead price we receive could adversely affect our operating 
results and financial condition. For example, our realized oil price decreased 
$3.84 per Bbl to $85.78 per barrel for the
year ended December&nbsp;31, 2012 from $89.62 per barrel for the year ended 
December&nbsp;31, 2011. This decrease in realized oil prices was primarily 
caused by a larger average oil differential
of $2.75 per barrel as well as a lower average WTI price. This increased oil 
differential was largely due to a significant increase in the Midland-
Cushing/WTI differential in 2012 compared to 2011.
Significant differentials could adversely affect our operating results and 
financial condition. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Due to regional fluctuations in the actual prices received for our natural gas 
production, the derivative contracts we enter into may not provide us with 
sufficient
protection against price volatility since they are based on indexes related to 
different and remote regional markets.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell our natural gas 
into local markets, the majority of which is produced in West Texas, Southeast 
New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle,
Central Oklahoma and Wyoming and shipped to the Midwest, West Coast and Texas 
Gulf Coast. These regions account for over 90% of our natural gas sales. 
Currently we use swaps on Waha, ANR-Oklahoma and
CIG-Rockies natural gas prices. While we are paid a local price indexed to or 
closely related to Waha, ANR-Oklahoma and CIG-Rockies, these indexes are heavily
influenced by prices received in remote
regional consumer markets less transportation costs and thus may not be 
effective in protecting us against local price volatility. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;17, 2012, 
the EPA approved final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other 
things, require additional
emissions controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, including
New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and 
volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") and a
separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants 
frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations 
require the reduction of VOC emissions from natural
gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions"
on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after 
January&nbsp;1, 2015. For well completion
operations occurring at such well sites before January&nbsp;1, 2015, the final 
regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to 
completion combustion devices, such as flares,
in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also establish 
specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks 
and other production equipment. We are currently
reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts. Compliance with

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;VII
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") and
the rules of the CFTC thereunder provide for statutory and regulatory 
requirements for
certain derivative transactions, broadly referred to as "swaps" and which 
include some oil and gas transactions, including oil and gas hedging 
transactions, and interest rate swaps, as well as
participants in swaps and various other aspects of the swaps markets. Swaps 
designated by the CFTC or falling within classes of swaps designated by the CFTC
are or will be required to be submitted for
clearing on a derivative clearing organization ("DCO") and, if accepted for 
clearing, cleared on the DCO. To date, the CFTC has designated only certain 
interest rate swaps and index credit default
swaps for mandatory clearing. Transactions in swaps accepted for clearing must 
be executed on a board of trade designated as a contract market or a swap 
execution facility if such swaps are made
available for trading on such a board of trade or swap execution facility. The 
Act provides an exception from application of the Act's clearing and trade 
execution requirements that certain commercial
end-users may elect for swaps they
use to hedge or mitigate their commercial risks ("End-User Exception"). Although

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event we do not qualify for the End-User Exception, we anticipate that, 
under regulations adopted under the Act and relevant DCO and other rules, we 
will be required to post
margin in the form of cash collateral for those of our derivative transactions 
constituting swaps (including our interest rate swaps and commodities-related 
swaps) that we clear on a DCO. Moreover,
the Act requires the CFTC and the federal regulators of banks and other 
financial institutions to adopt regulations imposing margin requirements for 
non-cleared swaps that, when adopted, could, in
certain circumstances, require us to post margin in the form of cash or other 
types of collateral for any non-cleared swaps into which we enter. Posting 
margin in the form of cash collateral with
respect to our swaps could cause liquidity issues for us by reducing our ability
to use our cash for capital expenditures, distributions to limited partners or
other partnership purposes. A
requirement to post margin, especially in the form of cash collateral, with 
respect to any cleared or non-cleared swaps we enter could reduce our ability to
execute strategic hedges to reduce
commodity price uncertainty and, thus, to protect cash flows. In addition, even 
if we are not required to post margin for our swaps or to post margin of only 
immaterial amounts, the banks and other
derivatives dealers who are the contractual counterparties to our swaps will be 
required to comply with the Act's new requirements, and the costs of their 
compliance will likely be passed on to
customers, including us, thus increasing our costs of engaging in hedging 
transactions, decreasing the benefits of those transactions to us and reducing 
our cash flows. We currently hedge only with
current or former lenders under our revolving credit facility, which have 
collateral in our oil and natural gas properties and do not currently require us
to post cash collateral. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
required by Title VII of the Act, the CFTC must also adopt limits on the 
positions that a party may hold in certain contracts relating to physical 
commodities. The CFTC has proposed
regulations that, when adopted, will set limits on the positions that a party 
may hold for its own account in specified core futures contracts relating to 
certain physical commodities, including NYMEX
contracts relating to WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas, as well as 
options and swaps that are economically equivalent to such future contracts, and
futures contracts, options contracts, swaps,
basis contracts and commodity index contracts linked to such futures contracts 
or such physical commodities. Under the proposed rules, such position limits 
would be subject to certain exemptions,
including one for positions that qualify as bona fide hedging positions under 
the proposed rule. If the rule is adopted as proposed and for any reason our 
contracts relating to such commodities, if
any, fail to qualify for an exemption from the position limits, our ability to 
execute strategic hedges to reduce commodity price uncertainty, and thus to 
protect cash flows, could be impaired. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the requirements of Title VII of the Act, the banking regulators have adopted
a rule that could require certain of the counterparties to our commodity 
derivative contracts to
spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities. Those 
separate entities could be our counterparties to our swaps and may not be as 
creditworthy as our current counterparties. If
such a counterparty were unable to, or failed to, perform its obligations under 
swaps to which we were party, our business, results of operations, financial 
condition and our ability to make cash
distributions to our limited partners could be adversely impacted. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

provisions of Title VII of the Act and the rules relating to derivative

derivative contracts, materially alter the terms on which we enter derivative 
contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we 
encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or
restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress has considered 
legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the 
disclosure of chemicals used by the oil
and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic 
fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the
completion of unconventional natural gas wells in shale formations, as well as 
tight conventional formations including many of those that Legacy completes and 
produces. This process involves the
injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to 
stimulate natural gas production. Sponsors of these bills have asserted that 
chemicals used in the fracturing process
could adversely affect drinking water supplies. In addition, some states have 
adopted and others are considering legislation to restrict hydraulic fracturing.
Several states including Texas and
Wyoming have adopted or are considering legislation requiring the disclosure of 
hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Public disclosure of chemicals used in the 
fracturing process, which could make it
easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate 
legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the 
fracturing process could adversely affect
groundwater. In addition any additional level of regulation could lead to
operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional 
regulatory burdens that could make it more
difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance 
and doing business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

effect of future sales of our units, or the availability of units for future

liquidity of the market for our units. Sales of substantial amounts of units, or
the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the 
prevailing market price of our units. Such
sales, or the possibility of such sales, could also make it difficult for us to 
sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem 
appropriate. As of July&nbsp;7, 2014, the
founding investors (the "Founding Investors") and their affiliates, including 
members of our management, own approximately 18% of our outstanding units. We 
granted the Founding Investors certain
registration rights to have their units registered under the Securities Act. 
Upon registration, these units will be eligible for sale into the market without
volume limitations. Because of the
substantial size of the Founding Investors' holdings, the sale of a significant 
portion of these units, or a perception in the market that such a sale is 
likely, could have a significant impact on the
market price of our units. </FONT></P>

Our acquisitions may prove to be worth less than we paid, or provide less than 
anticipated proved reserves, production or cash flow because of uncertainties in
evaluating
recoverable reserves, well performance and potential liabilities as well as 
uncertainties in forecasting oil and gas prices and future development, 
production and marketing costs.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful acquisitions 
require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable
reserves, development
potential, well performance, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs 
and potential environmental and other liabilities. Our estimates of future 
reserves and estimates of future production
for our acquisitions and related forecasts of anticipated cash flow therefrom, 
are initially based on detailed information furnished by the sellers and subject
to review, analysis and adjustment by
our internal staff, typically without consulting with outside petroleum 
engineers. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently 
uncertain and our proved reserves estimates and cash
flow forecasts therefrom may exceed actual acquired proved reserves or the 
estimates of future cash flows therefrom. In connection with our assessments, we
perform a review of the acquired properties
included in our acquisitions that we believe is generally consistent with 
industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or 
potential problems. In addition, our review may not
permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess 
their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we 
inspect a well, we do not always discover
structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. As a 
result of these factors, the purchase price we pay to acquire oil and natural 
gas properties may exceed the value we
realize. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also,
our reviews of the properties included in our acquisitions are inherently 
incomplete because it is generally not feasible to perform an in-depth review of
the individual properties
involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a 
detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or
potential problems, nor will it permit a
buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their
deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every 
well, and environmental problems, such as
groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an 
inspection is undertaken. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the fact that we 
are a limited partnership under Delaware law, it is possible, in certain 
circumstances, for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A change in our business or a 
change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes or otherwise
subject us to taxation as an entity. If we were treated as a corporation for 
U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our 
taxable income at the corporate tax rate,
which currently has a top marginal rate of 35%, and would likely pay state and 
local income tax at varying rates. Distributions to our limited partners would 
generally be taxed again as corporate
distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow 
through to our limited partners. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a 
corporation, our cash available to pay
distributions to our limited partners would be substantially reduced. Therefore,
treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the 
anticipated cash flow and after-tax return
to our limited partners likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of 
our units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, changes in current state law may subject us to entity-level taxation 
by individual states. Because of widespread state budget deficits and other 
reasons, several states are
evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the 
imposition of state income, franchise and other forms of taxation. For example, 
we are subject to an entity-level state tax
on the portion of our gross income that is apportioned to Texas. If any 
additional states were to impose a tax upon us as an entity, the cash available 
for distribution to our limited partners would
be reduced. </FONT></P>

The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present U.S. federal 
income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an 
investment in our limited partner
interests may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial 
interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time members of the U.S. 
Congress propose and consider substantive changes to
the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded 
partnerships. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and 
interpretations thereof may or may not be applied
retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the 
exception for us to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of
these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes 
could negatively impact the value of an investment in our limited partner
interests. </FONT></P>

Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil

legislation.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Obama 
Administration and members of the U.S. Congress have during past legislative 
sessions proposed changes that would, if
enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including 
the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently 
available to oil and natural gas exploration
and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, 
(i)&nbsp;the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural 
gas properties, (ii)&nbsp;the elimination of
current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii)&nbsp;the
elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and 
(iv)&nbsp;an extension of the
amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is 
unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and if enacted, how 
soon any such changes could become
effective. The passage of any legislation with similar changes in U.S. federal 
income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are 
currently available with respect to oil and
natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could increase the 
taxable income allocable to our unitholders and negatively impact the value of 
an investment in our units. </FONT></P>

any of their units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference 
between the amount realized and

of the total net taxable income they were allocated for a unit, which decreased 
their tax basis in that unit, will, in
effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if the unit is sold at a price 
greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price our unitholders 
receive is less than their original cost. A
substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, 
may be ordinary income to our unitholders due to the potential recapture items, 
including depreciation, depletion and
intangible drilling cost recapture. In addition, because the amount realized may
include a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their 
units, they may incur a tax liability
in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale. </FONT></P>

unable to opine as to the validity of such filing positions.
A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount 
of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of
these tax benefits or the amount of
gain on the sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our

seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units 
may not be reportable by the unitholder and
any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be 
fully taxable as ordinary income. Our counsel has not rendered an opinion 
regarding the treatment of a unitholder where our
units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of our units; 
therefore, unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the
risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short

to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers 
from borrowing their units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be considered to 
have technically terminated our partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
if there is a sale or
exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within
a twelve-month period. For purposes of determining whether the 50% threshold has
been met, multiple sales of the same
interest will be counted only once. Our technical termination would, among other
things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders, which 
would result in us filing two tax returns
(and our unitholders could receive two Schedules&nbsp;K-1 if relief was not 
available, as described below) for one fiscal year and could result in a 
deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in
computing our taxable income. In the case of a limited partner reporting on a 
taxable year other than a fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, the closing of 
our taxable year may also result in more
than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable
income for the year of termination. Our termination currently would not affect 
our classification as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes, but instead we would be treated as a new 
partnership for tax purposes. If treated as a new partnership, we must make new 
tax elections and could be subject to penalties if
we are unable to determine that a termination occurred. The IRS has announced a 
publicly traded partnership technical termination relief program whereby, if a 
publicly traded partnership that
technically terminated requests relief and such relief is granted by the IRS, 
among other things, the partnership will only have to provide one 
Schedule&nbsp;K-1 to unitholders for the year
notwithstanding two partnership tax years. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax treatment of
distributions on our Existing Preferred Units is uncertain. We will treat the 
holders of Existing Preferred Units
as partners for tax purposes and will treat distributions on the Existing 
Preferred Units as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will 
generally be taxable to the holders of Existing
Preferred Units as ordinary income. Although a holder of Existing Preferred 
Units could recognize taxable income from the accrual of such a guaranteed 
payment even in the absence of a contemporaneous
distribution, we anticipate accruing and making the guaranteed payment 
distributions monthly. Otherwise, the holders of Existing Preferred Units are 
generally not anticipated to share in our items of
income, gain, loss or deduction. Nor will we allocate any share of our 
nonrecourse liabilities to the holders of Existing Preferred Units. If the 
Existing Preferred Units were treated as indebtedness
for tax purposes, rather than as guaranteed payments for the use of capital, 
distributions likely would be treated as payments of interest by us to the 
holders of Existing Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

holder of Existing Preferred Units will be required to recognize gain or loss on

Existing Preferred Units sold. The amount realized generally will equal the sum 
of the cash and the fair market value of other property such holder receives in

among multiple partnership interests, the tax basis of an Existing Preferred

Existing Preferred Unit to acquire such Existing Preferred Unit. Gain or loss 
recognized by a holder of the Existing
Preferred Unit on the sale or exchange of an Existing Preferred Unit held for

in our Existing Preferred Units by tax-exempt investors, such as employee

Distributions to non-U.S. holders of our Existing Preferred Units will be 
treated as "effectively connected income" (which will subject holders to U.S. 
net income taxation and possibly the branch
profits tax) and will be subject to withholding taxes imposed at the highest 
effective tax rate applicable to such non-U.S. holders. If the amount of 
withholding exceeds the amount of U.S. federal
income tax actually due, non-U.S. holders may be required to file&nbsp;U.S.
federal income tax returns in order to seek a refund of such excess. The 
treatment of guaranteed payments for the use of
capital to tax exempt investors is not

legally available funds for such purpose. When issued and paid for in the manner
described in this registration statement, the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units

subject to federal, state or local laws or regulations that, in the reasonable 
determination of our general
partner, create a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any property
that we have an interest in because of the nationality, citizenship or other 
related status of any limited partner,
including a holder of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units, our general partner may 
redeem the limited partner interests held by the limited partner at their 
current market price. In order to avoid any
cancellation or forfeiture, our general partner may require each limited partner
to furnish information about his nationality, citizenship or related status. If 
a limited partner fails to furnish
information about his nationality, citizenship or other related status within 
30&nbsp;days after a request for the information or our general partner 
determines after receipt of the information that
the limited partner is not an eligible citizen, our general partner may elect to
treat the limited partner as a non-citizen assignee. A non-citizen assignee is 
entitled to an interest equivalent to
that of a limited partner for the right to share in allocations and 
distributions from us, including liquidating distributions. A non-citizen 
assignee does not have the right to direct the voting of
his limited partner interests and may not receive distributions in kind upon our
liquidation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Series&nbsp;A 
Preferred Units offered hereby are represented by a single certificate issued to
The Depository Trust Company (and
its successors or assigns or any other securities depositary selected by us) 
(the "Securities Depositary"), and registered in the name of its nominee 
(initially, Cede&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Co.). The
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units will continue to be represented by a single 
certificate registered in the name of the Securities Depositary or its nominee, 
and no holder of the Series&nbsp;A
Preferred Units will be entitled to receive a certificate evidencing such 
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units unless otherwise required by law or the Securities
Depositary gives notice of its intention to
resign or is no longer eligible to act as such and we have not selected a 
substitute Securities Depositary within 60 calendar days thereafter. Payments 
and communications made by us to holders of the
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units will be duly made by making payments to, and 
communicating with, the Securities Depositary. Accordingly, unless certificates 
are available to holders of the
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units, each purchaser of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units 
must rely on (i)&nbsp;the procedures of the Securities Depositary and its 
participants to receive distributions,
any redemption price, liquidation preference and notices, and to direct the 
exercise of any voting or nominating rights, with respect to such Series&nbsp;A 
Preferred Units and (ii)&nbsp;the
records of the Securities Depositary and its participants to evidence its 
ownership of such Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
long as the Securities Depositary (or its nominee) is the sole holder of the 
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units, no beneficial holder of the Series&nbsp;A 
Preferred Units will be
deemed to be a unitholder of us. The Depository Trust Company, the initial 
Securities Depositary, is a New York-chartered limited purpose trust company 
that performs services for its participants,
some of whom (and/or their representatives) own The Depository Trust Company. 
The Securities Depositary maintains lists of its participants and will maintain
the positions (i.e.,&nbsp;ownership
interests) held by its participants in the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units, 
whether as a holder of the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units for its own account or 
as a nominee for another holder of the
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequent

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

discussion contained in this prospectus otherwise indicates, the terms defined 
within this description apply
only to the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> General  </B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Series&nbsp;B 
Preferred Units represent limited partner interests in us. We may, without 
notice to or consent of the holders of
the then-outstanding Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units, authorize and issue 
additional Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units and Junior Securities (as defined below
under "&#151;Ranking") and, subject
to the limitations described under "&#151;Voting Rights," Senior Securities and 
Parity Securities (as defined below under "&#151;Ranking")). </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units entitle the holders thereof to receive cumulative 
cash distributions when, as and if declared by the board of directors of our 
general partner out of
legally available funds for such purpose. When issued and paid for in the manner
described in this registration statement, the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units 
offered hereby are fully paid and
nonassessable. Subject to the matters described under "&#151;Liquidation 
Rights," each Series&nbsp;B Preferred Unit generally has a fixed liquidation 
preference of $25.00 per Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Unit plus an amount equal to accumulated and unpaid distributions 
thereon to the date fixed for payment, whether or not declared. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units represent perpetual equity interests in us and, 
unlike our indebtedness, do not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal 
amount at a particular
date. As such, the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units rank junior to all of our 
current and future indebtedness and other liabilities with respect to assets 
available to satisfy claims against us. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are represented by a single certificate 
issued to the Securities Depositary (as defined under "&#151;Book-Entry System")
and registered
in the name of its nominee and, so long as a Securities Depositary has been 
appointed and is serving, no person acquiring Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units is 
entitled to receive a certificate
representing such Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units unless applicable law otherwise 
requires or the Securities Depositary resigns or is no longer eligible to act as
such and a successor is not
appointed. Please read "&#151;Book-Entry System." </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
as described below in "&#151;Change of Control," the Series&nbsp;B Preferred 
Units are not convertible into units or any other securities and do not have 
exchange rights
or are entitled or subject to any preemptive or similar rights. The 
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are not subject to mandatory redemption or to any 
sinking fund requirements. The Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Units are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at our option 
commencing on June&nbsp;15, 2019 or any time under limited circumstances. Please
read "&#151;Redemption." </FONT></P>

Unit plus an amount equal to all
accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of redemption, whether

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will give notice of 
any redemption by mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30&nbsp;days and not more
than 60&nbsp;days before
the scheduled date of redemption, to the holders of any Series&nbsp;B Preferred 
Units to be redeemed as such holders' names appear on our unit transfer books 
maintained by the Registrar and Transfer
Agent at the address of such holders shown therein. Such notice shall state: 
(i)&nbsp;the redemption date, (ii)&nbsp;the number of Series&nbsp;B Preferred 
Units to be redeemed and, if less than
all outstanding Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are to be redeemed, the number 
(and the identification) of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units to be redeemed from 
such holder, (iii)&nbsp;the redemption
price, (iv)&nbsp;the place where the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are to be 
redeemed and shall be presented and surrendered for payment of the redemption 
price therefor and (v)&nbsp;that
distributions on the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units to be redeemed will cease to 
accumulate from and after such redemption date. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
fewer than all of the outstanding Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are to be 
redeemed, the number of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units to be redeemed will be 
determined by us, and such
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units will be redeemed by such method of selection as 
the Securities Depositary shall determine, pro rata or by lot, with adjustments 
to avoid redemption of fractional
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units. So long as all Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units are 
held of record by the nominee of the Securities Depositary, we will give notice,
or cause notice to be given, to the
Securities Depositary of the number of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units to be 
redeemed, and the Securities Depositary will determine the number of 
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units to be redeemed from
the account of each of its participants holding such Series&nbsp;B Preferred 
Units in its participant account. Thereafter, each participant will select the 
number of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units
to be redeemed from each beneficial owner for whom it acts (including the 
participant, to the extent it holds Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units for its own 
account). A participant may determine to
redeem Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units from some beneficial owners (including the 
participant itself) without redeeming Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units from the 
accounts of other beneficial owners. </FONT></P>

Depositary on the redemption date. The Securities Depositary's normal procedures
provide for it to distribute the amount of the redemption price in same-day

expected to distribute such funds to the persons for whom they are acting as 
agent. </FONT></P>

any redemption price, liquidation preference and notices, and to direct the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set forth below is a 
summary of our cash distribution policy, including a description of the 
significant provisions of our partnership
agreement that relate to cash distributions as well as a description of 
restrictions on our ability to make cash distributions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Rationale for Our Cash 
Distribution Policy  </I></B></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cash distribution 
policy reflects a basic judgment that our limited partners will be better served
by distributing our available
cash rather than retaining it. The amount of available cash will be determined 
by our general partner for each fiscal quarter. Our cash distribution policy is 
consistent with the terms of our
partnership agreement, which requires that we distribute all of our available 
cash on a quarterly basis to our limited partners. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
our partnership agreement, available cash is defined generally to mean, cash on 
hand at the end of each quarter, plus working capital borrowings made after the 
end of the quarter,
less cash reserves determined by our general partner, at the date of 
determination of available cash for the quarter, to be necessary and appropriate
to provide for the conduct of our business (which
could include, but is not limited to, amounts reserved for capital expenditures,
including drilling and acquisitions, and our anticipated future credit needs),
comply with applicable law, any of our
debt instruments or other agreements, provide funds for distributions in respect
of existing preferred units or provide funds for distributions to our 
unitholders for any one of the upcoming four
quarters. Because we are not subject to an entity-level federal income tax, we 
have more cash to distribute to our preferred unitholders and our unitholders 
than would be the case if we were subject
to such tax. </FONT></P>

</UL>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guarantee 
that preferred unitholders or unitholders will receive quarterly distributions 
from us. Our cash distribution
policy is subject to limitations and restrictions, including the 
following:</FONT></P>

conduct of our business. The establishment

pay distributions. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

Further, we may enter into future debt
arrangements that could subject our ability to pay distributions to compliance 
with certain tests or ratios or otherwise restrict our ability to pay 
distributions. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that 
reinvest most or all of their
available cash to expand ongoing operations. We generally intend to rely upon 
external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit 
facility and issuances of debt and equity
securities, to fund a substantial portion of our acquisition expenditures and a 
portion of our development project capital expenditures. However, to the extent 
we are unable to finance growth
externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability 
to grow. </FONT></P>

described above, operating surplus does not reflect actual cash on hand that is

distribute as operating surplus cash we receive in the future from non-operating
sources such as asset sales, issuances of
securities and long-term borrowings that would otherwise be distributed as 
capital surplus. In addition, the effect of including (as described above) 
certain cash distributions on equity interests in
operating surplus will be
to increase operating surplus by the amount of any such cash distributions. As a

proceeds of working capital borrowings increase operating surplus and repayments
of working capital borrowings are generally operating expenditures (as described
below) and thus
reduce operating surplus when repayments are made. However, if a working capital
borrowing is not repaid during the twelve-month period following the borrowing, 
it will be deemed repaid at the end of
such period, thus decreasing operating surplus at such time. When such working 
capital borrowing is in fact repaid, it will be excluded from operating 
expenditures because operating surplus will have
been previously reduced by the deemed repayment. </FONT></P>

requires that we treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating 
surplus until the sum of all
available cash distributed since the first day of the fiscal quarter in which 
the Incentive Distribution Units are first issued equals the operating surplus 
from the first day of the fiscal quarter in
which the Incentive Distribution Units are first issued through the end of the 
quarter immediately preceding that distribution. Our partnership agreement 
requires that we treat any amount distributed
in excess of operating surplus, regardless of its source, as capital surplus. As
described above, operating surplus includes up to $140.0&nbsp;million, which 
does not reflect actual cash on hand
that is available for distribution to our limited partners. Rather, it is a 
provision that will enable us, if we choose, to distribute as operating surplus 
up to this amount of cash we receive in the
future from interim capital transactions that would otherwise be distributed as 
capital surplus. We do not anticipate that we will make any distributions from 
capital surplus. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partnership agreement
provides that estimated maintenance capital expenditures reduce operating 
surplus, but growth capital
expenditures, actual maintenance capital expenditures and investment capital 
expenditures do not. Maintenance capital expenditures are those capital 
expenditures made to maintain, over the long term,
the production levels of our oil and natural gas properties or the operating 
capacity of our other capital assets existing on the date of such expenditure. 
We expect that a primary component of
maintenance capital expenditures will be capital expenditures associated with 
the replacement of equipment and, to the extent required to maintain production,
oil and natural gas reserves (including
non-proved reserves attributable to undeveloped leasehold acreage), whether 
through the development, exploitation and production of existing oil and natural
gas properties or the acquisition or
development of a new oil or natural gas properties. Maintenance capital 
expenditures may also include interest (and related fees) on debt incurred and 
distributions on equity issued (including
incremental distributions on the Incentive Distribution Units) to finance all or
any portion of any replacement asset that is paid in respect of the period from 
the date that we enter into a binding
agreement to commence construction or development of a replacement asset until 
the earlier to occur of the date that any such replacement asset begins 
producing in paying quantities or is placed into
service, as applicable, and the date that it is abandoned or disposed of. 
Plugging and abandonment costs are also expected to constitute maintenance 
capital expenditures. Capital expenditures made
solely for investment purposes are considered maintenance capital expenditures.

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because our maintenance 
capital expenditures can be irregular, the amount of our actual maintenance 
capital expenditures may differ substantially from period to
period, which could cause similar fluctuations in the amounts of operating 
surplus, adjusted operating surplus and cash available for distribution to our 
limited partners if we subtracted actual
maintenance capital expenditures from operating surplus. To address this issue, 
the partnership agreement requires that an estimate of the average quarterly 
maintenance capital expenditures necessary
to maintain, over the long term, production levels of our oil and natural gas 
properties or the operating capacity of our other assets be subtracted from 
operating surplus each quarter as opposed to
the actual amounts spent. The amount of estimated maintenance capital 
expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by 
our general partner's board of directors. The
estimate will be made at least annually and whenever an event occurs that is 
likely to result in a material adjustment to the amount of our maintenance 
capital expenditures, such as a major
acquisition or the introduction of new governmental regulations that will impact
our business. The partnership agreement does not cap the amount of maintenance 
capital expenditures that our general
partner may estimate. For purposes of calculating operating surplus, any 
adjustment to this estimate will be prospective only. </FONT></P>

capital expenditures are defined in the partnership agreement as those capital 
expenditures with respect to acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect
will increase, over
the long term, the production of our oil and natural gas properties or the 
operating capacity of our other capital assets existing on the date of such 
expenditure. Examples of growth capital
expenditures include the acquisition of reserves or equipment, the acquisition 
of new leasehold interests, or the development, exploitation and production of 
an existing leasehold interest, to the
extent such expenditures are incurred to increase, over the long term, the 
production of our oil and natural gas properties or the operating capacity of 
our other capital assets existing on the date
of such expenditure. Growth capital expenditures also may include interest (and 
related fees) on debt incurred and distributions on equity issued (including 
incremental distributions on the Incentive
Distribution Units) to finance all or any portion of such capital improvement 
during the period from the date we enter into a binding obligation to acquire 
the related capital asset or commence the
related capital improvement until the earlier to occur of the date any such 
capital asset or capital improvement begins producing in paying quantities or is
placed into service, as applicable, or the

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Delaware Act, a
limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if, after the 
distribution, all liabilities of
the limited partnership, other than liabilities to partners on account of their 
partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is 
limited to specific property of the
partnership, would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited 
partnership. For the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a 
limited partnership, the Delaware Act provides that
the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors 
is limited shall be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to 
the extent that the fair value of that
property exceeds the nonrecourse liability. The Delaware Act provides that a 
limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the 
distribution that the distribution was in violation
of the Delaware Act shall be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of
the distribution for three years. Under the Delaware Act, a substituted limited 
partner of a limited partnership is
liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make 
contributions to the partnership, except that such person is not obligated for 
liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a
limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the partnership 
agreement. </FONT></P>

authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities 
for the consideration and on
the terms and conditions determined by our general partner without the approval 
of the unitholders, preferred unitholders or Incentive Distribution Unitholders.
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is possible that we will fund acquisitions through the issuance of additional 
units or other partnership securities. Holders of any additional units we issue 
will be entitled to share
equally with the then-existing holders of units in our distributions of 
available cash. In addition, the issuance of additional units or other 
partnership securities may dilute the value of the
interests of the then-existing unitholders, preferred unitholders or Incentive 
Distribution Unitholders in our net assets. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we
may also issue additional partnership securities that, as determined by our 
general partner, may have
special voting rights to which the units, preferred units or Incentive 
Distribution Units are not entitled. However, we may not issue additional 
Incentive Distribution Units or partnership securities
having terms substantially similar to Incentive Distribution Units without first
receiving the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 75% of the 
Outstanding Incentive Distribution
Units (other than any Incentive Distribution Units held our general partner, by 
the partnership or their respective controlled affiliates). Additionally, we may
not issue additional Series&nbsp;A
Preferred Units, Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units, Parity Securities or Senior 
Securities if the cumulative distributions payable on outstanding Series&nbsp;A 
Preferred Units or Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Units are in arrears unless we have received an affirmative vote
or consent of the holders of at least 66<SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL>% of the 
outstanding Series&nbsp;A Preferred Units and Series&nbsp;B Preferred Units. 
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
issuance of additional partnership securities, our general partner will be 
entitled, but not required, to make additional capital contributions to the 
extent necessary to maintain
its initial general partner interest in us. Since our March 2006 private equity 
offering and the related formation transactions our general partner has not 
elected to make additional capital
contributions to maintain its initial 0.1% general partner interest in us. Our 
general partner's initial interest in us has been, and will continue to be 
reduced, if we issue additional partnership
securities in the future and our general partner does not contribute a 
proportionate amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest. 
Moreover, our general partner will have the
right, which it may from time to time assign in whole or in part to any of its 
affiliates, to purchase units or other partnership securities whenever, and on 
the same terms that, we issue those
securities to persons other than our general partner and its affiliates, to the 
extent necessary to maintain the percentage interest of the general partner, 
including such interest represented by
partnership securities that existed immediately prior to each issuance. 
Unitholders, preferred unitholders and Incentive Distribution Unitholders will 
not have preemptive rights to acquire additional
units, preferred units, Incentive Distribution Units or other partnership 
securities. </FONT></P>

partner will have the right to convert its general partner interest and all of 
its Incentive Distribution Units, if any,

the event of removal of such a general partner under circumstances where cause 
exists or withdrawal of a general partner where that withdrawal violates our 
partnership agreement, a
successor general partner will have the option to purchase the general partner 
interest for a cash payment equal to the fair market value of such interest. 
Under all other circumstances where a
general partner withdraws or is removed by the limited partners, the departing 
general partner will have the option to require the successor general partner to
purchase the general partner interest of
the departing general partner for fair market value. In each case, this fair 
market value will be determined by agreement between the departing general 
partner and the successor general partner. If no
agreement is reached, an independent investment banking firm or other 
independent expert selected by the departing general partner and the successor 
general partner will determine the fair market
value. Or, if the departing general partner and the successor general partner 
cannot agree upon an expert, then an expert chosen by agreement of the experts

expert selected in the manner described in the
preceding paragraph. </FONT></P>

expenses it incurs or payments it
makes on our behalf and all other expenses allocable to us or otherwise incurred
by our general partner in connection with operating our business. These expenses
include salary, bonus, incentive
compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on
our behalf and expenses allocated to our general partner by its affiliates. The 
general partner is entitled to
determine in good faith the expenses that are allocable to us. </FONT></P>

required to keep appropriate books of our business at our principal offices. The
books will be maintained for
both tax and financial reporting purposes on an accrual basis. For tax and 
financial reporting purposes, our fiscal year is the calendar year. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will furnish or make available to record holders of units, preferred units or 
Incentive Distribution Units, within 120&nbsp;days after the close of each 
fiscal year, an annual
report containing audited financial statements and a report on those financial
statements by our independent public accountants. Except for our fourth quarter,
we will also furnish summary financial
information within 90&nbsp;days after the close of each quarter. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
will furnish each record holder of a unit, preferred units or Incentive 
Distribution Unit with information reasonably required for tax reporting 
purposes within 90&nbsp;days after
the close of each calendar year. This information is expected to be furnished in
summary form so that some complex calculations normally required of partners can
be avoided. Our ability to furnish
this summary information to unitholders, preferred unitholders and Incentive 
Distribution Unitholders will depend on the cooperation of unitholders, 
preferred unitholders and Incentive Distribution
Unitholders in supplying us with specific information. Every unitholder, 
preferred unitholder and Incentive Distribution Unitholder will receive 
information to assist him in determining his federal
and state tax liability and filing his federal and state income tax returns, 
regardless of whether he supplies us with information. </FONT></P>

</B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legacy Reserves&nbsp;LP 
may issue debt securities in one or more series, and Legacy Reserves Finance 
Corporation may be co-issuer of
one or more such series of debt securities. Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation 
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2011, is wholly 
owned by Legacy Reserves&nbsp;LP and has
no material assets or any liabilities other than as co-issuer of securities. Its
activities are limited to co-issuing debt securities and engaging in other 
activities incidental thereto. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
debt securities that we offer under a prospectus supplement will be direct, 
unsecured general obligations. The debt securities will be either senior debt 
securities or subordinated
debt securities. The debt securities will be issued under one or more separate 
indentures between us and a banking or financial institution, as trustee. Senior
debt securities will be issued under a
senior indenture, and subordinated debt securities will be issued under a 
subordinated indenture. Together, the senior indenture and the subordinated 
indenture are called the "indentures." The
indentures will be supplemented by supplemental indentures, the material 
provisions of which will be described in a prospectus supplement. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in this description, the words "we," "us," "our" and "issuers" refer 
jointly to Legacy Reserves&nbsp;LP and Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation, the 
term "issuer" refers to
either Legacy Reserves&nbsp;LP or Legacy Reserves Finance Corp., as the context 
requires, and the terms "Legacy" and "Legacy Reserves Finance Corp." refer 
strictly to Legacy Reserves&nbsp;LP and
Legacy Reserves Finance Corporation, respectively. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have summarized some of the material provisions of the indentures below. This 
summary does not restate those agreements in their entirety. A form of senior 
indenture and a form of
subordinated indenture have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement
of which this prospectus is a part. We urge you to read each of the indentures 
because each one, and not this
description, defines the rights of holders of debt securities. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalized
terms defined in the indentures have the same meanings when used in this
prospectus. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debt securities 
issued under the indentures will be our direct, unsecured general obligations. 
The senior debt securities will rank
equally with all of our other senior and unsubordinated debt. The subordinated 
debt securities will have a junior position to all of our senior debt. 
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following description sets forth the general terms and provisions that could 
apply to debt securities that we may offer to sell. A prospectus supplement and 
a supplemental indenture
relating to any series of debt securities being offered will include specific 
terms relating to the offering. These terms will include some or all of the

security to the accounts of persons that have accounts with the depositary 
("participants"). Those accounts will be
designated by the dealers, underwriters or agents with respect to the underlying
debt securities or by us if those debt securities are offered and sold directly 
by us. Ownership of beneficial
interests in a global security will be limited to participants or persons that 
may hold interests through participants. For interests of participants, 
ownership of beneficial interests in the global
security will be shown on records maintained by the applicable depositary or its
nominee. For interests of persons other than participants, that ownership 
information will be shown on the records of
participants. Transfer of that ownership will be effected only through those

take physical delivery of securities in

discretion determine not to have any debt securities of a series represented by 
one or more global securities. In that event, we will issue individual debt

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicts of interest 
exist and may arise in the future as a result of the relationships between our 
general partner and its affiliates
(including our Founding Investors), on the one hand, and our partnership and our
limited partners, on the other hand. The directors and officers of our general 
partner have fiduciary duties to manage
our general partner in a manner beneficial to its owners. At the same time, our 
general partner has a fiduciary duty to manage our partnership in a manner 
beneficial to us and our limited partners. </FONT></P>

a conflict arises between our general partner or its affiliates, on the one 
hand, and us or any other partner, on the other hand, our general partner will 
resolve that conflict.
Our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify and limit our general 
partner's fiduciary duties to the limited partners. Our partnership agreement 
also restricts the remedies available to
limited partners for actions taken that, without those limitations, might 
constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
general partner may, but is not required to, seek the approval of such 
resolution from the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general
partner. If our general
partner does not seek approval from the conflicts committee and the board of 
directors of our general partner determines that the resolution or course of 
action taken with respect to the conflict of
interest satisfies either of the standards set forth in the third and fourth 
bullet points above, then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, the 
board of directors acted in good faith, and
in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the 
partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the 
burden of overcoming such presumption. Unless the
resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our partnership 
agreement, our general partner or the conflicts committee may consider any 
factors it determines in good faith to consider when
resolving a conflict. When our partnership agreement requires that someone act 
in good faith, it requires that person to believe he is acting in the best 
interests of the partnership. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general partner is 
accountable to us and our limited partners as a fiduciary. Fiduciary duties owed
to limited partners by our
general partner are prescribed by law and the partnership agreement. The 
Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which we refer to in this 
prospectus as the Delaware Act, provides that
Delaware limited partnerships may, in their partnership agreements, modify, 
restrict or expand the fiduciary duties otherwise owed by a general partner to 
limited partners and the partnership. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
partnership agreement contains various provisions modifying and restricting the 
fiduciary duties that might otherwise be owed by our general partner. We have 
adopted these
restrictions to allow our
general partner or its affiliates to engage in transactions with us that would 
otherwise be prohibited by state-law fiduciary duty standards and to take into 
account the interests of other parties in
addition to our interests when resolving conflicts of interest. We believe this 
is appropriate and necessary because our general partner's board of directors 
has fiduciary duties to manage our general
partner in a manner beneficial to its owners, as well as to you. Without these 
modifications, the general partner's ability to make decisions involving 
conflicts of interest would be restricted. The
modifications to the fiduciary standards enable the general partner to take into
consideration all parties involved in the proposed action, so long as the 
resolution is fair and reasonable to us.
These modifications also enable our general partner to attract and retain 
experienced and capable directors. These modifications are detrimental to the 
limited partners because they restrict the
remedies available to limited partners for actions that, without those 
limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty, as described below, 
and permit our general partner to take into account
the interests of third parties in addition to our interests when resolving 
conflicts of interest. The following is a summary of the material restrictions 
of the fiduciary duties owed by our general
partner to the limited partners: </FONT></P>

<TD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Fiduciary duties are generally 
considered to include an obligation to act in good faith and with due care and 
loyalty. The duty of care, in the absence of a provision in a partnership
agreement providing otherwise, would
generally require a general partner to act for the partnership in the same 
manner as a prudent person would act on his own behalf. The duty of loyalty, in 
the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise, would
generally
prohibit a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership from taking any 
action or engaging in any transaction where a conflict of interest is 
present.</FONT></TD>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is a summary
of the material U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences that may be 
relevant to prospective
unitholders and, unless otherwise noted in the following discussion, is the 
opinion of Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP insofar as it describes legal conclusions with
respect to matters of U.S. federal income
tax law. Such statements are based on the accuracy of the representations made 
by our general partner and us to Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP, and statements of fact 
do
not represent opinions of Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP. To the extent this section 
discusses U.S. federal income taxes, that discussion is based upon current 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"), existing and proposed Treasury 
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and current 
administrative rulings and court decisions,
all of which are subject to change. Changes in these authorities may cause the 
tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below. 
Unless the context otherwise requires,
references in this section to "us" or "we" are references to Legacy 
Reserves&nbsp;LP and our operating subsidiaries. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
section does not address all U.S. federal, state and local tax matters that 
affect us or our unitholders. To the extent that this section relates to 
taxation by a state, local or
other jurisdiction within the United States, such discussion is intended to 
provide only general information. We have not sought the opinion of legal 
counsel regarding U.S. state, local or other
taxation and, thus, any portion of the following discussion relating to such 
taxes does not represent the opinion of Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP or any other 
legal counsel. Furthermore, this section
focuses on unitholders who are individual citizens or residents of the United
States, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar and who hold units as a 
capital asset (generally, property that is
held as an investment). This section has only limited application to 
corporations, partnerships (and entities treated as partnerships for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes), estates, trusts,
non-resident aliens or other unitholders subject to specialized tax treatment, 
such as tax-exempt institutions, non-U.S. persons, individual retirement 
accounts, employee benefit plans, real estate
investment trusts or mutual funds. Accordingly, we encourage each prospective 
unitholder to consult such unitholder's own tax advisor in analyzing the U.S. 
federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax
consequences particular to that unitholder resulting from his ownership or 
disposition of his units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
ruling has been or will be requested from the Internal Revenue Service (the 
"IRS") regarding any matter that affects us or our unitholders. Instead, we will
rely on opinions and
advice of Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP. Unlike a ruling, an opinion of counsel 
represents only that counsel's best legal judgment and does not bind the IRS or 
the courts. Accordingly, the opinions and
statements made herein may not be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS. 
Any contest of this sort with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the 
market for our units and the prices at
which such units trade. In addition, the costs of any contest with the IRS, 
principally legal, accounting and related fees, will result in a reduction in 
cash available for distribution to our
unitholders and our general partner and thus will be borne indirectly by our 
unitholders and our general partner. Furthermore, our tax treatment, or the tax 
treatment of an investment in us, may be
significantly modified by future legislative or administrative changes or court 
decisions. Any modifications may or may not be retroactively applied. 
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the reasons described below, Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP has not rendered an opinion 
with respect to the following specific U.S. federal income tax issues: 
(1)&nbsp;the treatment of a
unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of 
units (please read "&#151;Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership&#151;Treatment of 
Short Sales");
(2)&nbsp;whether our monthly convention for allocating taxable income and losses
is permitted by existing Treasury Regulations (please read "&#151;Disposition of
Units&#151;Allocations
Between Transferors and Transferees"); and (3)&nbsp;whether our method for 
depreciating Section&nbsp;743 adjustments is sustainable in certain cases 
(please read "Tax Consequences of Unit
Ownership&#151;Section&nbsp;754 Election" and "&#151;Uniformity of Units").

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the following 
paragraphs, we are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes
and, therefore, generally we
are not liable for U.S. federal income taxes. Instead, each of our unitholders 
is required to take into account his respective share of our items of income, 
gain, loss and deduction in computing his
U.S. federal income tax liability as if the unitholder had earned such income 
directly, even if no cash distributions are made to the unitholder. 
Distributions by us to a unitholder generally are not
taxable to the unitholder unless the amount of cash distributed to the 
unitholder exceeds the unitholder's tax basis in his units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;7704
of the Internal Revenue Code provides that publicly traded partnerships are, as 
a general rule, taxed as corporations. However, an exception, referred to as the
"Qualifying Income Exception," exists with respect to publicly traded 
partnerships of which 90% or more of the gross income for every taxable year 
consists of "qualifying income." Qualifying income
includes income and gains derived from exploration and production of certain 
natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and products thereof. Other types
of qualifying income include interest
(other than from a financial business), dividends, gains from the sale of real 
property and gains from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for
the production of income that otherwise
constitutes qualifying income. We estimate that less than 5% of our current 
gross income is not qualifying income; however, this estimate could change from 
time to time. Based upon and subject to this
estimate, the factual representations made by us and our general partner, and a 
review of the applicable legal authorities, Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP is of the 
opinion that at least 90% of our current
gross income constitutes qualifying income. The portion of our income that is 
qualifying income may change from time to time. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS, and the IRS has made no 
determination as to our status or the status of our operating companies for U.S.
federal income tax purposes or
whether our operations generate "qualifying income" under Section&nbsp;7704 of 
the Internal Revenue Code. Instead, we will rely on the opinion of Andrews 
Kurth&nbsp;LLP on such matters. It is the
opinion of Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP that we are classified as a partnership and 
each of our operating subsidiaries (other than the entity
employing our employees) is disregarded as an entity separate from us for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering its opinion,
Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP has relied on factual representations made by us and our

without limitation: </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither
we nor any of our partnership or limited liability company subsidiaries, have 
elected or will elect to be treated as a corporation; and </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for
each taxable year, including short taxable years occurring as a result of a 
constructive termination, more than 90% of our gross income has been and will be
income
that Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP has opined or will opine is "qualifying income" 
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that these representations have been true in the past and expect that 
these representations will continue to be true in the future. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we fail to meet the Qualifying Income Exception, unless such failure is 
determined by the IRS to be inadvertent and is cured within a reasonable time 
after discovery (in which case
the IRS may also
require us to make adjustments with respect to our unitholders or pay other 
amounts), we will be treated as if we had transferred all of our assets, subject
to liabilities, to a newly formed
corporation, on the first day of the year in which we failed to meet the 
Qualifying Income Exception, in return for stock in that corporation and then 
distributed that stock to our unitholders in
liquidation of their interests in us. This deemed contribution and liquidation 
should be tax-free to our unitholders and us so long as we, at that time, do not
have liabilities in excess of the tax
basis of our assets. Thereafter, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we were taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any 
taxable year, either as a result of a failure to meet the Qualifying Income 
Exception or otherwise, our
items of income, gain, loss and deduction would be reflected only on our tax 
return, rather than being passed through to our unitholders, and our net income 
would be taxed to us at corporate rates. In
addition, any distribution made to a unitholder would be treated as taxable 
dividend income, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and 
profits, or, in the absence of earnings and
profits, a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the unitholder's tax 
basis in our units, or taxable capital gain, after the unitholder's tax basis in
his units is reduced to zero.
Accordingly, taxation as a corporation would result in a material reduction in a
unitholder's cash flow and after-tax return and thus would likely result in a 
substantial reduction of the value of our
units. </FONT></P>

below under "&#151;Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder Taxes," neither we nor
our subsidiaries
treated as partnerships or otherwise disregarded for federal income tax purposes
will pay any U.S. federal income tax. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each
unitholder is required to report on
his income tax return his share of our income, gains, losses and deductions 
without regard to whether we make cash distributions to such unitholder.
Consequently, we may allocate income to a
unitholder even if that unitholder has not received a cash distribution. Each 
unitholder will be required to include in income his allocable share of our 
income, gains, losses and deductions for his
taxable year or years ending with or within our taxable year. Our taxable year 
ends on December&nbsp;31. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributions made by us 
to a unitholder generally will not be taxable to the unitholder for federal 
income tax purposes, except to the
extent the amount of any such cash distribution exceeds his tax basis in his 
units immediately before the distribution. Cash distributions made by us to a 
unitholder in an amount in excess of the
unitholder's tax basis in his units generally will be considered to be gain from
the sale or exchange of those units, taxable in accordance with the rules 
described under "&#151;Disposition of
Units" below. Any reduction in a unitholder's share of our liabilities, 
including as a result of future issuances of additional units, will be treated 
as a distribution of cash to that unitholder. To
the extent that cash distributions made by us cause a unitholder's "at risk" 
amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year, that unitholder must
recapture any losses deducted in previous
years. Please read "&#151;Limitations on Deductibility of Losses." </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
decrease in a unitholder's percentage interest in us because of our issuance of 
additional units will decrease his share of our nonrecourse liabilities, and 
thus will result in a
corresponding deemed distribution of cash. This deemed distribution may 
constitute a non-pro rata distribution. A non-pro
rata distribution of money or property, including a deemed distribution, may 
result in ordinary income to a unitholder, regardless of that unitholder's tax 
basis in its units, if the distribution
reduces the unitholder's share of our "unrealized receivables," including 
depreciation recapture, depletion recapture and/or substantially appreciated 
"inventory items," both as defined in
Section&nbsp;751 of the Internal Revenue Code, and collectively, 
"Section&nbsp;751 Assets." To the extent of such reduction, a unitholder will be
treated as having received his proportionate share
of the Section&nbsp;751 Assets and then having exchanged those assets with us in
return for an allocable portion of the non-pro rata distribution made to such 
unitholder. This latter deemed exchange
generally will result in the unitholder's realization of ordinary income in an 
amount equal to the excess of (1)&nbsp;the non-pro rata portion of that 
distribution over (2)&nbsp;the unitholder's
tax basis (generally zero) in the Section&nbsp;751 Assets deemed relinquished in
the exchange. </FONT></P>

liabilities, and (ii)&nbsp;decreased, but

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deduction by a 
unitholder of that unitholder's share of our losses will be limited to the 
lesser of (i)&nbsp;the tax basis such
unitholder has in his units, and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of an individual, estate,
trust or corporate unitholder (if more than 50% of the corporate unitholder's 
stock is owned directly or indirectly
by or for five or fewer individuals or some tax exempt organizations) to the 
amount for which the unitholder is considered to be "at risk" with respect to 
our activities. A unitholder subject to these
limitations must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that 
distributions cause the unitholder's at risk amount to be less than zero at the 
end of any taxable year. Losses
disallowed to a unitholder or recaptured as a result of these limitations will 
carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction in a later year to the extent
that the unitholder's tax basis or at
risk amount, whichever is the limiting factor, is subsequently increased. Upon 
the taxable disposition of
a unit, any gain recognized by a unitholder can be offset by losses that were 
previously suspended by the at risk limitation but may not be offset by losses 
suspended by the basis limitation. Any loss
previously suspended by the at risk limitation in excess of that gain would no 
longer be utilizable. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, a unitholder will be at risk to the extent of the tax basis of the 
unitholder's units, excluding any portion of that basis attributable to the 
unitholder's share of our
nonrecourse liabilities, reduced by (1)&nbsp;any portion of that basis
representing amounts otherwise protected against loss because of a guarantee, 
stop loss agreement or other similar arrangement
and (2)&nbsp;any amount of money the unitholder borrows to acquire or hold his 
units, if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us, is related 
to another unitholder or can look only
to the units for repayment. A unitholder's at risk amount will increase or 
decrease as the tax basis of the unitholder's units increases or decreases, 
other than tax basis increases or decreases
attributable to increases or decreases in the unitholder's share of our 
liabilities. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
at risk limitation applies on an activity-by-activity basis, and in the case of 
oil and natural gas properties, each property is treated as a separate activity.
Thus, a taxpayer's
interest in each oil or natural gas property is generally required to be treated
separately so that a loss from any one property would be limited to the at risk 
amount for that property and not the at
risk amount for all the taxpayer's oil and natural gas properties. It is 
uncertain how this rule is implemented in the case of multiple oil and natural 
gas properties owned by a single entity treated
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, for taxable years 
ending on or before the date on which further guidance is published, the IRS 
will permit aggregation of oil or natural gas
properties we own in computing a unitholder's at risk limitation with respect to
us. If a unitholder were required to compute his at risk amount separately with 
respect to each oil or natural gas
property we own, he might not be allowed to utilize his share of losses or 
deductions attributable to a particular property even though he has a positive 
at risk amount with respect to his units as a
whole. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to the basis and at risk limitations on the deductibility of losses, 
the passive loss limitations generally provide that individuals, estates, trusts
and some closely-held
corporations and personal service corporations may deduct losses from passive 
activities, which are generally defined as trade or business activities in which
the taxpayer does not materially
participate, only to the extent of the taxpayer's income from those passive 
activities. The passive loss limitations are applied separately with respect to 
each publicly-traded partnership.
Consequently, any passive losses we generate will only be available to offset 
our passive income generated in the future and will not be available to offset 
income from other passive activities or
investments, including our investments or a unitholder's investments in other 
publicly-traded partnerships, or a unitholder's salary or active business 
income. Passive losses that are not deductible
because they exceed a unitholder's share of income we generate may be deducted 
in full when he disposes of his entire investment in us in a fully taxable 
transaction with an unrelated party. The
passive loss limitations are applied after other applicable limitations on 
deductions, including the at risk rules and the basis limitation. </FONT></P>

purchaser's tax basis in our assets ("inside basis") under Section&nbsp;743(b) 
of the Internal Revenue Code to reflect the

bases of our assets at the time of the transfer to the transferee. The 
Section&nbsp;743(b) adjustment does not apply to a person who purchases units 
directly from us, and belongs only to the
purchaser and not to other unitholders. Please read, however, "&#151;Allocation

timing of these deductions may affect the uniformity of our units. Under our

units even if that position is not consistent with these and any other Treasury
Regulations or if the position would result in lower annual depreciation or

Kurth&nbsp;LLP is unable to opine as to the validity of any such alternate tax 
positions because there is no clear

Section&nbsp;754 election is advantageous if the transferee's tax basis in his 
units is higher than the units' share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets 
immediately prior to the
transfer. In that case, as a result of the election, the transferee would have, 
among other items, a greater amount of depreciation deductions and the 
transferee's share of any gain or loss on a sale
of assets by us would be less. Conversely, a Section&nbsp;754 election is 
disadvantageous if the transferee's tax basis in his units is lower than those 
units' share of the aggregate tax basis of
our assets immediately prior to the transfer. Thus, the fair market value of the
units may be affected either favorably or unfavorably by the election. A basis 
adjustment is required regardless of
whether a Section&nbsp;754 election is made in the case of a transfer of an 
interest in us if we have a substantial built-in loss immediately after the 
transfer, or if we distribute property and
have a substantial basis reduction. Generally a built-in loss or a basis 
reduction is substantial if it exceeds $250,000. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculations involved
in the Section&nbsp;754 election are complex and will be made on the basis of 
assumptions as to the fair market value of our assets
and other matters. For example, the allocation of the Section&nbsp;743(b) 
adjustment among our assets must be made in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Code. The IRS could seek to reallocate some
or all of any Section&nbsp;743(b) adjustment we allocated to our tangible assets
to goodwill instead. Goodwill, as an intangible asset, is generally either non-
amortizable or amortizable over a
longer period of time or under a less accelerated method than our tangible 
assets. We cannot assure our unitholders that the determinations we make will 
not be successfully challenged by the IRS or
that the resulting deductions will not be reduced or disallowed altogether. 
Should the IRS require a different basis adjustment to be made, and should our 
general partner determine the expense of
compliance exceeds the benefit of the election, we may seek permission from the 
IRS to revoke our Section&nbsp;754 election. If permission is granted, a 
subsequent purchaser of units may be
allocated more income than such purchaser would have been allocated had the 
election not been revoked. </FONT></P>

Consequences of Unit

entitled to deductions for the greater of either cost depletion or (if otherwise
allowable) percentage depletion
with respect to our oil and natural gas interests. Although the Internal Revenue
Code requires each unitholder to compute his own depletion allowance and 
maintain records of his share of the adjusted
tax basis of the underlying property for depletion and other purposes, we intend
to furnish each of our unitholders with information relating to this computation
for federal income tax purposes. Each

deduction limits, please read
"&#151;Deductions for Intangible Drilling and Development Costs,") a unitholder,
either directly or indirectly through certain related parties, may not be

75,000 barrels of oil (or the equivalent amount of natural gas) on average for 
any day during the taxable year or in the retail marketing of oil and natural 
gas products exceeding $5&nbsp;million
per year in the aggregate. Percentage depletion is calculated as an amount 
generally equal to 15% (and, in the case of marginal production, potentially a 
higher percentage) of the unitholder's gross
income from the depletable property for the taxable year. The percentage 
depletion deduction with respect to any property is limited to 100% of the 
taxable income of the unitholder from the property

A unitholder that qualifies as an independent producer may deduct percentage 
depletion only to the extent the unitholder's average net daily production of 
domestic crude oil, or the natural
gas equivalent, does not exceed 1,000 barrels. This depletable amount may be 
allocated between oil and natural gas production, with 6,000 cubic feet of 
domestic natural gas production regarded as
equivalent to one barrel of crude oil. The 1,000-barrel limitation must be 
allocated among the independent producer and controlled or related persons and 
family members in proportion to the respective
production by such persons during the period in question. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

addition to the foregoing limitations, the percentage depletion deduction 
otherwise available is limited to 65% of a unitholder's total taxable income

computed without the depletion allowance, net operating loss carrybacks, or 
capital loss carrybacks. Any percentage depletion deduction disallowed because 
of the 65% limitation may be deducted in the

computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under Section&nbsp;751 of the 
Internal Revenue Code to the extent
attributable to assets giving rise to depreciation recapture or other 
"unrealized receivables" or "inventory items" that we own. The term "unrealized 
receivables" includes potential recapture items,
including depreciation, depletion or IDC recapture. Ordinary income attributable
to unrealized receivables, inventory items and depreciation recapture may exceed
net taxable gain realized on the sale
of a unit and may be recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on 
the sale of a unit. Thus, a unitholder may recognize both ordinary income and a 
capital loss upon a sale of units. Net
capital loss may offset capital gains and no more than $3,000 of ordinary income

IRS has ruled that a partner who acquires interests in a partnership in separate
transactions must combine those interests and maintain a single adjusted tax 
basis for all those
interests. Upon a sale or other disposition of less than all of those interests,
a portion of that tax basis must be allocated to the interests sold using an 
"equitable apportionment" method, which
generally means that the tax basis allocated to the interest sold equals an 
amount that bears the same relation to the partner's tax basis in his entire 
interest in the partnership as the value of the
interest sold bears to the value of the partner's entire interest in the 
partnership. Treasury Regulations under Section&nbsp;1223 of the Internal 
Revenue Code allow a selling unitholder who can
identify units transferred with an ascertainable holding period
to elect to use the actual holding period of the units transferred. Thus, 
according to the ruling discussed above, a unitholder will be unable to select 
high or low basis units to sell as would be the
case with corporate stock, but, according to the Treasury Regulations, he may 
designate specific units sold for purposes of determining the holding period of 
units transferred. A unitholder electing
to use the actual holding period of units transferred must consistently use that
identification method for all subsequent sales or exchanges of our units. A 
unitholder considering the purchase of
additional units or a sale of units purchased in separate transactions is urged 
to consult his tax advisor as to the possible consequences of this ruling and 
application of the Treasury Regulations. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
simplifying conventions are contemplated by the Internal Revenue Code and most 
publicly-traded partnerships use similar simplifying conventions, the use of 
this method may not
be permitted under existing Treasury Regulations. Recently, however, the 
Department of the Treasury and the IRS issued proposed Treasury Regulations that
provide a safe harbor pursuant to which a
publicly-traded partnership may use a similar monthly simplifying convention to 
allocate tax items among transferor and transferee unitholders, although such 
tax items must be prorated on a daily
basis. Nonetheless, the proposed regulations do not specifically authorize the 
use of the proration method we have adopted. Existing publicly-traded 
partnerships are entitled to rely on those proposed
Treasury Regulations; however, they are not binding on the IRS and are subject 
to change until the final Treasury Regulations are issued. Accordingly, Andrews 
Kurth&nbsp;LLP is unable to opine on
the validity of this method of allocating income and deductions between 
transferee and transferor unitholders. If this method is not allowed under the 
Treasury Regulations, or only applies to
transfers of less than all of the unitholder's interest, our taxable income or 
losses might be reallocated among the unitholders. We are authorized to revise 
our method of allocation between

have terminated our tax partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon 
the sale or exchange of

interests in our capital and profits within a twelve-month period. For purposes 
of measuring whether the 50% has been met,
multiple sales of the same unit are counted only once. A constructive 
termination results in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders. In 
the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable
year other than a fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, the closing of our 
taxable year may result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss
being includable in such unitholder's

absence of uniformity, we may be unable to completely comply with a number of 
federal income tax requirements, both statutory
and regulatory. A lack of uniformity could result from a literal application of

Any non-uniformity could have a negative impact on the

partnership agreement permits our general partner to take positions in filing 
our tax returns that preserve the uniformity of our units even under

above. These positions may include reducing for some unitholders the 
depreciation, amortization or loss deductions to which they would otherwise be 
entitled or reporting a slower amortization of
Section&nbsp;743(b) adjustments for some unitholders than that to which they 
would otherwise be entitled. Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP is unable to opine as to 
validity of such filing positions. A
unitholder's basis in units is reduced by his share of our deductions (whether 
or not such deductions were claimed on an individual income tax return) so that 
any position that we take that
understates deductions will overstate the unitholder's basis in his units, and 
may cause the unitholder to understate gain or overstate loss on any sale of 
such units. Please read
"&#151;Disposition of Units&#151;Recognition of Gain or Loss" and "&#151;Tax 
Consequences of Unit Ownership&#151;Section&nbsp;754 Election." The IRS may 
challenge one or
more of any positions we take to preserve the uniformity of units. If such a 
challenge were sustained, the uniformity of units might be affected, and, under 
some circumstances, the gain from the sale
of units might be increased without the benefit of additional deductions.

gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation has been
proposed that would, if enacted, make significant changes to United States tax 
laws, including the elimination of
certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives relating to oil and natural gas 
exploration and production companies. Changes include, but are not limited to, 
(i)&nbsp;the repeal of the percentage
depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii)&nbsp;the 
elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs,
(iii)&nbsp;the elimination of the deduction
for certain domestic production activities, and (iv)&nbsp;an extension of the 
amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is 
unclear whether these or similar changes
will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become 
effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any 
other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax
laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently 
available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and 
any such change could increase the taxable
income allocable to our unitholders and negatively impact the value of an 
investment in our units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, 
including us, or an investment in our units, may be modified by administrative, 
legislative or judicial
interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time members of Congress 
propose and consider substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax
laws that affect the tax treatment of
certain publicly traded partnerships. We are unable to predict whether such 
changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. However, it is possible
that a change in law could affect us and
may be retroactively applied. Any such changes could negatively impact the value
of an investment in our units. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to U.S. 
federal income taxes, unitholders will be subject to other taxes, including 
state and local income taxes,
unincorporated business taxes, and estate, inheritance or intangibles taxes that
may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or owns
property or in which the unitholder is
a resident. We currently conduct business or own property in multiple states, 
most of which impose personal income taxes on individuals. Most of these states 
also impose an income tax on corporations
and other entities. Moreover, we may also own property or do business in other 
states in the future that impose income or similar taxes on nonresident 
individuals. Although an analysis of those
various taxes is not presented here, each prospective unitholder should consider
their potential impact on his investment in us. A unitholder may be required to 
file state income tax returns and to
pay state income taxes in any state in which we do business or own property, and
such unitholder may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those 
requirements. In some states, tax losses
may not produce a tax benefit in the year incurred and also may not be available
to offset income in subsequent taxable years. Some of the states may require us,
or we may elect, to withhold a
percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a unitholder who is not a
resident of the state. Withholding, the amount of which may be greater or less 
than a particular unitholder's income
tax liability to the state, generally does not relieve a nonresident unitholder 
from the obligation to file an income tax return. Amounts withheld may be 
treated as if distributed to unitholders for
purposes of determining the amounts distributed by us. Please read "&#151;Tax 
Consequences of Unit Ownership&#151;Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder 
Taxes." Based on current law and
our estimate of our future operations, we anticipate that any amounts required 
to be withheld will not be material. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is the responsibility of each unitholder to investigate the legal and tax 
consequences, under the laws of pertinent states and localities, of his 
investment in us. Andrews
Kurth&nbsp;LLP has not rendered an opinion on the state, local, or non-U.S. tax 
consequences of an investment in us. We strongly recommend that each prospective
unitholder consult, and depend on,
his own tax counsel or other advisor with regard to those matters. It is the 
responsibility of each unitholder to file all tax returns that may be required 
of him. </FONT></P>

income earned by individuals, estates, and trusts. The Department of the 
Treasury and the IRS have
issued proposed Treasury regulations applying the NIIT to guaranteed payments 
received for the use of capital, effective taxable years beginning after 
December&nbsp;31, 2013. In the case of an
individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (i)&nbsp;the individual's 
net investment income from all investments, or (ii)&nbsp;the amount by which the
individual's modified adjusted gross
income exceeds specified threshold levels depending on a unitholder's federal 
income tax filing status. In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be 
imposed on the lesser of
(i)&nbsp;undistributed net investment income, or (ii)&nbsp;the excess adjusted 
gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket 
applicable to an estate or trust begins. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holders of Existing 
Preferred Units will receive specific tax information from us, including a 
Schedule&nbsp;K-1 which generally
would be expected to provide a single income item equal to the preferred return.
See "Administrative Matters&#151;Information Returns and Audit Procedures"

rule requiring aggregation of partnership interests purchased in separate 
transactions, you may receive two Schedules&nbsp;K-1 if you hold units and

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment in our 
Existing Preferred Units by tax-exempt investors, such as employee benefit plans
and individual retirement accounts,
and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. Distributions to non-U.S. 
holders of our Existing Preferred Units will be treated as "effectively 
connected income" (which will subject holders to
U.S. net income taxation and possibly the branch profits tax) and will be 
subject to withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective tax rate 
applicable to such non-U.S. holders. If the amount of
withholding exceeds the amount of U.S. federal income tax actually due, non-U.S.
holders may be required to file&nbsp;U.S. federal income tax returns in order to
seek a refund of such excess. The
treatment of guaranteed payments for the use of capital to tax exempt investors 
is not certain. If you are a tax-exempt entity or a non-U.S. person, you should 
consult your tax advisor with respect to
the consequences of owning our Existing Preferred Units. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to U.S. 
federal income taxes, unitholders will (and holders of Existing Preferred Units 
may) be subject to other taxes,
including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes, and 
estate, inheritance or intangibles taxes that may be imposed by the various 
jurisdictions in which we conduct business or
owns property or in which the unitholder is a resident. Please read "Tax 
Consequences of Unit Ownership&#151;Entity-Level Collections of Unitholder 
Taxes" above. Based on current law and our
estimate of our future operations, we anticipate that any amounts required to be
withheld will not be material. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is the responsibility of each holder of Existing Preferred Units to investigate 
the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent states and 
localities, of his investment in
us. Andrews Kurth&nbsp;LLP has not rendered an opinion on the state, local, or 
non-U.S. tax consequences of an investment in us. We strongly recommend that 
each prospective Existing Preferred
unitholder consult, and depend on, his own tax counsel or other advisor with 
regard to those matters. It is the responsibility of each holder of Existing 
Preferred Units to file all tax returns that
may be required of him. </FONT></P>

such indemnification is against public

asserted by such director, officer or

court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by
