</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> pertinent universal and regional legal instruments for the promotion and

enshrined in<b> </b>conventions, recommendations, declarations and charters for the protection of 
cultural heritage adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the 
same emphasis, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights undertake to take steps, including those necessary for the conservation, 
development and diffusion of science and culture, in order to achieve full realization of the 
rights, as stipulated in article 15 of the Covenant, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of cultural diversity for the full realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other 
universally recognized instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that cultural diversity, flourishing within a framework of democracy, tolerance, 
social justice and mutual respect between peoples and cultures, is indispensable for peace and 
security at the local, national and international levels, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that cultural heritage is an important component of the cultural identity of 
communities, groups and individuals, and of social cohesion, so that its intentional destruction 
may have adverse consequences on human dignity and human rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Affirming</i> that intentional destruction of cultural heritage violates the principles of 
international law, the principles of humanity and the dictates of public conscience, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of the protection of cultural heritage and the commitment to 
fight against its intentional destruction in any form so that such cultural heritage may be 
transmitted to the succeeding generations,

contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved awareness and

</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> about continuing acts of intentional destruction of cultural

failure to take appropriate measures to prohibit, prevent, stop and punish any intentional 
destruction of cultural heritage of great importance for humanity, to the extent provided for by 
international law; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States to reinvigorate their efforts in taking appropriate measures to 
prevent, avoid, stop and suppress acts of intentional destruction of cultural heritage, wherever 
such heritage is located, both in peacetime and in the event of armed conflict, and to further 
enhance their national legislative, administrative, educational and technical measures in 
conformity with their international obligations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> all States, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental 
organizations and the media to promote a culture of tolerance and respect for the diversity of 
cultures, civilizations and religions and for cultural and religious sites, which represent an 
important aspect of the collective heritage of humankind; </p>

 <p></p>

relevant human rights bodies and mechanisms to pay due attention to the issue of promotion of 
cultural diversity and protection of cultural heritage as an important component of the promotion 
and protection of all human rights, including the full realization of cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to enhance 
consultations with the Council and cooperation with relevant international and regional 
organizations and bodies concerned with the issue of protection of cultural heritage in order to 
address human rights-related aspects of this issue; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring the 
present resolution to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, 
programmes and specialized agencies, as well as regional intergovernmental organizations, to 
solicit comments from them on the steps they have taken to promote and implement the present 
resolution, and to report to the Council at the ninth session of the Human Rights Council.
