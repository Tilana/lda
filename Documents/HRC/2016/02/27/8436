</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 
and constitutes the first report of Kishore Singh since his appointment as Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education. It focuses on the promotion of equality of opportunity 
in education. The report also provides an overview of additional concerns that the Special 
Rapporteur intends to study in the course of his mandate. 
</p>
<p> Ensuring equality of opportunity in education is an overarching principle that is 
reflected in core human rights treaties. States have the duty to adopt measures to eradicate 
discrimination and ensure equal access for all to education. The promotion of equality of 
opportunity in education both in law and in fact is an ongoing challenge for all States, and 
one that requires not only the elimination of discriminatory practices, but also the adoption 
of temporary special measures to bring about equality in fact with regard to education. The 
report first details core human rights standards provisions which establish the obligation to 
promote equal opportunities in education. It subsequently describes different sources of 
inequalities and different types of initiatives to address them. It concludes by formulating 
recommendations based on human rights standards.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 on 
the right to education. The Council, in its resolution, calls on the Special Rapporteur to 
gather, review and exchange information on obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to 
education and formulate recommendations on measures to promote and protect it. It also 
calls on the Special Rapporteur to make recommendations contributing to the realization of 
the Millennium Development Goals (particularly goals 2 and 3) as well as the Education for 
All goals, to integrate a gender perspective in his work, and to review the interdependence 
and interrelatedness of the right to education with other human rights. The Special 
Rapporteur has been requested to report annually to the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>2. This is the first thematic report presented by the Special Rapporteur, Kishore Singh, 
who took up his mandate in August 2010. The first section of the report addresses emerging 
concerns that the Special Rapporteur intends to examine during his three-year term. The 
other sections focus on the promotion of equality of opportunity in education: section III 
analyzes the importance of equality of opportunity in education; section IV details 
international human rights standards and norms establishing the duty to ensure equality of 
opportunity in education as well as important political commitments relating to this aim; 
section V examines national legal frameworks; section VI describes sources of inequalities 
and indicates measures usually adopted to address them; and section VII addresses the 
enforcement of laws protecting equal opportunity. Finally, section VIIII of the report 
proposes recommendations to strengthen equality of opportunity in education.  
</p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur engaged in informal 
consultations with State representatives, international organizations and non-governmental 
organizations in order to identify priority themes to be examined and plan his main 
activities. In particular, the Special Rapporteur attaches importance to maintaining close 
cooperation with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) as well as the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), since both play a 
leading role in the field of education and are essential partners for the dissemination of the 
work developed by the mandate. The Special Rapporteur has also initiated the process of 
cooperation with various civil society organizations working on matters relevant to his 
mandate. Through these various informal consultations, he gathered information used in his 
analysis of measures promoting equality of opportunity in education. 
</p>
<p>4. From August 2010 to March 2011, the Rapporteur participated in a number of public 
events concerning the right to education. In September 2010, he participated in the 
UNESCO Seminar on &#8220;Innovative Financing for Education&#8221; and in side events at the 
Millennium Development Goals Review Summit in New York focusing on the central 
contribution of education and the Goals. On both occasions, he emphasized the importance 
of legal instruments to ensure financial support to education. On 25 October, he presented 
the report of his predecessor to the General Assembly, and also outlined key priority themes 
that he intends to examine. In November 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in the 
Conference of Ministers of Education of French-speaking Countries (CONFEMEN) held in 
Dakar, which addressed the theme of quality in education. In December 2010, he was 
invited by the University of S&#227;o Paulo (Brazil) on the occasion of the human rights prize 
award ceremony, where he interacted with experts on human rights and education. During 
the same month, he participated in activities commemorating the 50th anniversary of 
UNESCO&#8217;s Convention against Discrimination in Education in Paris.   
</p>
<p>5. From 8 to 15 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur undertook his first country 
mission to Senegal (a separate report is submitted in this regard). On 1 March 2011 in New </p>


<p>York, the Rapporteur participated in a panel discussion entitled &#8220;Tackling Violence: 
securing quality education for women and girls&#8221;, organized on the occasion of the meeting 
of the Commission on the Status of Women. On 3 and 4 March 2011, he participated in the 
symposium of UNESCO Chairs on human rights, bioethics, peace democracy and tolerance 
(University of Bergamo, Italy). He also participated in a number of meetings on the 
Education for All (EFA) process in Paris and, from 22 to 24 March 2011, he participated in 
the 10th Meeting of the High-level Group on EFA in Jomtien, Thailand.    
</p>
<p><b> II. Main areas of concern 
</b></p>
<p>6. The centrality of education in human development is clear. The right to education as 
an internationally recognized right is all the more important as it is not only a human right 
in itself, but also essential for the exercise of other rights. While the international 
community is committed to achieving the right to basic education for all, the gap between 
commitment and reality remains significant and, if concrete and sustainable steps are not 
taken, this can easily widen. Understanding and removing obstacles that impede the 
enjoyment of all to the right to education are urgent challenges for the entire international 
community.  
</p>
<p>7. Since its establishment by the Commission on Human Rights in 1998, the mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur on the right to education has sought to identify obstacles to the 
right to education, and has provided conceptual and practical guidance on steps to be taken 
to ensure its realization. The Special Rapporteur intends to build on this work, while 
benefiting from the knowledge and experiences of those who are directly involved in the 
promotion of education at global, regional and local levels. The themes he intends to 
examine in the course of his mandate are highlighted below. While implementing these 
priorities, the Special Rapporteur also intends to give particular attention to the situation on 
the African continent, given the acute challenges faced by the region.  
</p>
<p> (a) Update on previous report on education in emergency situations: Despite 
efforts and international pledges to ensure full enjoyment of the right to education in areas 
affected by conflict and natural disasters, these situations are still central factors in the 
exclusion of children from schools, and in the deterioration of education. The General 
Assembly requested1 the Special Rapporteur to include in his report to the sixty-sixth 
session an update to the report2 on the right to education in emergencies.  
</p>
<p> (b) Financing education: The share of resources allocated to ensure the provision 
of education is frequently unstable and insufficient, deeply affecting the realization of this 
right. The Special Rapporteur will pay attention to legal and institutional mechanisms that 
ensure the provision of adequate resources for education. He also intends to look at 
innovative forms of financing education and to assess how the human rights normative 
framework may guide State action in these areas.  
</p>
<p> (c) Justiciability of the right to education: The protection of the right to 
education requires judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms that ensure rights holders&#8217; 
capacity to claim their rights at national, regional and global levels. The Special Rapporteur 
intends to examine the jurisprudence and enforcement mechanisms for protecting the right 
to education.  
</p>
<p> (d) Establishing minimum quality standards for education: The impact of recent 
expansion of enrolment in schools in many countries is seriously compromised by the 
</p>
<p>  
 1  See resolution 64/290. 
 2 A/HRC/8/10. </p>


<p>deterioration in the quality of education that schools currently provide. The Special 
Rapporteur intends to pay attention to the development and implementation of norms for 
quality education - both for public and private schools - with a focus on improving the 
conditions of the teaching profession and learning outcomes.  
</p>
<p> (e) Regulating private education: Private, religious or community schools 
comprise an important proportion of education systems around the world. With the limited 
capacity of public systems in some countries, private schools become the dominant source 
of education. The Special Rapporteur intends to examine standards and mechanisms that 
ensure all non-public educational entities comply with standards of human rights law and 
the objectives of human rights generally.  
</p>
<p> (f) Management of schools and human rights standards: The realization of the 
right to education involves the proper discharge of duties by public servants and private 
providers. The Special Rapporteur will study the main obstacles to the respect of human 
rights in the functioning and management of schools, and the standards and mechanisms 
that ensure that educational entities comply with human rights principles.  
</p>
<p> (g) Freedom from violence and the right to education: If schools play a central 
role in the prevention of violence and the promotion of a culture of peace, it is also true that 
violence can often take place in the school context with serious consequences for the 
enjoyment of the right to education. The Rapporteur intends to address the emerging 
concern of violence in schools in close collaboration with the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Equality of opportunity in education &#8211; an overarching 
principle  
</b></p>
<p>8. Despite the almost universal recognition of State obligations to provide universal 
primary education and fair access to secondary and higher education through all appropriate 
means, education is not fully accessible for many people around the world. The Special 
Rapporteur decided to dedicate his first thematic report to the promotion of equality of 
opportunity in education, considering its universal importance for the realization of the 
right to education. Developing countries face particularly acute challenges with regard to 
great social and economic inequalities, but developed countries also encounter challenges 
when attempting to ensure equal educational opportunities for all. Concerns relating to 
equality of opportunity in education are understood as relating both to guaranteeing equal 
opportunities in access to different levels of education as established by human rights 
norms, as well as equal opportunities to evolve within education systems.   
</p>
<p>9. The right to education is set out in article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, and is comprehensively elaborated in article 13 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in articles 28 and 29 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. As highlighted below, a number of other human rights treaties also 
expand on the right to education.3  
</p>
<p>10. Free and compulsory primary education is an inalienable right of every child, and a 
core obligation of States under international human rights treaties. The Education for All  
</p>
<p>  
 3 The right to education is also guaranteed by article 5 of the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, articles 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention on the 
Elimination Of All Forms Of Discrimination against Women, articles 30, 43 and 45 of the 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
and article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>


<p>process has furthered the global recognition of the duty to ensure every child receives free 
primary and basic education without discrimination or exclusion.  
</p>
<p>11. Beyond primary education, the right to education also extends to higher education; 
its enjoyment is subject to the criteria of merit or capacity, while respecting the 
fundamental principles of non-discrimination and equality. The obligations assumed by 
States under human rights treaties range from ensuring universal access to primary 
education to progressive access to secondary education and higher education on the basis of 
capacity. The right to education is not only recognized as an entitlement, but as a source of 
empowerment. </p>
<p>12. Efforts to universalize access to education over the last decades are underpinned by 
repeated political commitments. The EFA and Millennium Development Goals campaigns 
inspired expansions of primary education systems and created more education opportunities 
for girls. However, progress is fragile and uneven across regions and among population 
groups. Unprecedented disparities in access and quality emerge as the demand for 
education grows and education systems expand. Significant gaps remain even in the 
coverage of education as there are about 67 million children of primary school age who are 
out of school; while a larger number of adolescents (another 71 million), remain deprived 
of basic post-primary education.4 
</p>
<p>13. The experience of human rights monitoring mechanisms has identified many forms 
of discrimination and inequality that affect the enjoyment of the right to education. These 
range from clear legal inequalities in status and entitlements to policies that neglect the 
specific conditions of certain groups. The work of human rights treaty bodies over the last 
years has indicated areas of action at national and international levels to ensure equality of 
opportunity in education. Similarly, recommendations to States undergoing the universal 
periodic review process also address aspects such as guaranteeing the right to education to 
marginalized and under privileged groups, combating poverty, ensuring the right to 
education for all, removing gender-based imbalances in education, strengthening efforts to 
expand opportunities for (basic) education, etc.5  
</p>
<p>14. Challenges faced in achieving equality of opportunity in education were also 
described in reports submitted by States regarding implementation of the UNESCO 
Convention against Discrimination in Education6 &#8211; even in countries where educational 
opportunities are in general widely available, inequalities remain in the ability of all social 
groups to fully avail themselves of such opportunities. Social and cultural barriers and 
unequal opportunities manifested in access to quality education remain one of the most 
serious difficulties of national educational policies. Closing the attainment gap among 
children from different ethnic groups and differing socio-economic backgrounds appears as 
a common challenge in these reports.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>15. The need to guarantee &#8220;equal access of all levels of society to learning opportunities 
so as to implement the principles of inclusive education&#8221; was underlined in the conclusions 
and recommendations of the forty-eighth session of the International Conference on 
Education, in 2008. Considering that inclusive education is key to building inclusive 
societies,<b> </b>the Conference recommended that States &#8220;address social inequity and poverty

EX/36).  </p>


<p>levels as priorities as these are major obstacles to the implementation of inclusive education 
policies and strategies.&#8221; 7<b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. Recent EFA Global Monitoring Reports highlight that the enjoyment of the right to 
education is severely limited by the phenomena of marginalization and exclusion. In 2009, 
the report stated that &#8220;progress towards the EFA goals is being undermined by a failure of 
governments to tackle persistent inequalities&#8221; based on income, gender, location and 
ethnicity, language etc.8  In the subsequent year, the report focused on the issue of 
marginalization, and like its predecessor, indicated that &#8220;Governments are failing to address 
the root causes of marginalization in education&#8221;9  and showed how mutually reinforcing 
layers of disadvantage create extreme and persistent deprivation that undermine equal 
opportunities in education.10  
</p>
<p>17. A recent progress review of the Millennium Development Goals by UNICEF11 
focuses on the question of equity. The importance of equity in education should be 
recognized not only as regards the goals of universalizing basic education, but also with 
respect to &#8220;access to higher education for members of some special target groups, such as 
indigenous peoples, cultural and linguistic minorities, disadvantaged groups, peoples living 
under occupation and those who suffer from disabilities.&#8221;12  While equity in education is a 
worthy goal in itself, equity-enhancing policies and practices, particularly education as 
investment in human capital, can, in the long run, boost economic growth and help reduce 
poverty.13  
</p>
<p>18. Ensuring equal opportunities in education is also a key concern at the regional level. 
The Conference of Ministers of Education of the African Union has continued to reiterate 
the need to increase access to education, improve quality and relevance, and ensure equity. 
This is the underlying thrust of the Second Decade of Education for Africa (2006-2015), 
and the Framework for Action, adopted by African Ministers of Education. 
</p>
<p>19. Reports indicate that the EFA agenda is falling behind, and the prospects of 
achieving Millennium Development Goals 2 and 3 on universal primary education and 
gender equality, respectively, are also bleak. The target of universal primary education is 
unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Inequalities, stigmatization and discrimination linked to 
economic status, gender, ethnicity, language, location and disability are also holding back 
progress. Social and economic status and sex appear as major factors of marginalization in 
education, with girls and those living in poverty being the most affected. &#8220;Poverty and 
gender inequalities magnify other disadvantages, and close doors to education opportunity 
for millions of children.&#8221;14 
</p>
<p>20. In the face of all these challenges, it is important to examine State obligations under 
international human rights law relating to equality of opportunity in education, underlining

<p>the need for their fulfillment. As described below, equality and non-discrimination are 
fundamental human rights principles or obligations, and concerns regarding equality of 
opportunity in education are common to almost all international human rights treaties. 
Given the centrality of the principle for States, international human rights mechanisms have 
developed important guidance with regard to the establishment of legal and policy 
instruments to ensuring equal opportunities in education. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights standards and political commitments 
regarding equality of opportunity in education 
</b></p>
<p>21. Promoting and protecting the right to education and promoting equality and non-
discrimination are clearly interrelated duties in accordance with human rights norms. The 
decisions of several human rights bodies recognize the central role of education in ensuring 
the enjoyment of an equal protection of other human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> A. International human rights treaties  
</b></p>
<p>22. Equality of opportunity in education permeates most human rights treaties. As 
mentioned above, article 13 of the International Convention on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights clearly establishes every person&#8217;s right to free primary education, and State 
responsibilities to achieve the progressive realization of this right with respect to secondary 
education, and for higher education, on the basis of capacity. The Convention further 
indicates that fundamental education should be provided as far as possible for those who 
have not received or completed the whole period of their primary education. 
</p>
<p>23. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights details the core content 
and the obligations related to the right to education in its general comment No. 1315. It 
indicates that States have the principal responsibility for the direct provision of education, 
with core obligations clearly related to the principle of equality of opportunity, to ensure the 
right of access to public educational institutions and programmes on a non-discriminatory 
basis, and to provide primary education for all in accordance with article 13 (2) (a). 
</p>
<p>24. General comment No. 13 dedicates one section to the obligations related to the 
principles of non-discrimination and equality. The prohibition against discrimination 
&#8220;applies fully and immediately to all aspects of education and encompasses all 
internationally prohibited grounds of discrimination&#8221;. It further stipulates that &#8220;the adoption 
of temporary special measures intended to bring about de facto equality for men and 
women and for disadvantaged groups is not a violation of the right to non-discrimination 
with regard to education, so long as such measures do not lead to the maintenance of 
unequal or separate standards for different groups, and provided they are not continued 
after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved&#8221;. It also indicates that 
&#8220;sharp disparities in spending policies that result in differing qualities of education for 
persons residing in different geographic locations may constitute discrimination under the 
Covenant.&#8221;  Further, &#8220;States parties must closely monitor education &#8211;including all relevant 
policies, institutions, programmes, spending patterns and other practices &#8211; so as to identify 
and take measures to redress any de facto discrimination.&#8221;16  
</p>
<p>25. Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines the right of every 
child to education on the basis of equal opportunity. The Committee on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>  
 15  CESCR, general comment No. 13 (1999).  
 16 Ibid., paras. 34 and 37. </p>


<p>Child has recognized the need for identifying and giving priority to marginalized and 
disadvantaged groups of children, while not neglecting or diluting in any way the 
obligations which States parties have accepted under the Convention.17   
</p>
<p>26. General comment No. 1 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child highlights the 
fact that while equality of opportunity in education &#8220;is primarily a matter which relates to 
article 28 of the Convention, there are many ways in which failure to comply with the 
principles contained in article 29 (1) [concerning the aims of education] can have a similar 
effect.&#8221; The general comment goes on to outline how discrimination based on gender, 
disability, health status and race can hamper children&#8217;s equal access to education.18 
Furthermore, other general comments elaborated by the Committee address the need for 
temporary special measures to ensure equal access to education for indigenous children and 
equality of opportunity in education for children with disabilities.19  
</p>
<p>27. Other treaty bodies have also stressed obligations connected to ensuring equality of 
opportunity in education. Article 5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination protects the right to education and training for everyone without 
discrimination. In its general recommendations concerning specific groups, particularly in 
relation to discrimination against Roma and discrimination based on descent, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination addressed, inter alia, &#8220;measures in 
the field of education.&#8221; These elements especially address issues of access to education, 
quality of education, drop-out rates, and special measures to ensure inclusion of 
communities which face discrimination.20 The general recommendation on discrimination 
against non-citizens also places particular emphasis on access to and quality of education 
for non-citizens.21  
</p>
<p>28. Article 10 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women contains detailed provisions related to equality of opportunity in education 
and the equal rights of women and men in the field of education.&#8221; Furthermore, general 
recommendation No. 25, elaborated by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, which oversees the implementation of this treaty, explains that &#8220;the 
Convention requires that women be given an equal start and that they be empowered by an 
enabling environment to achieve equality of results.&#8221;22 In this regard, the Committee further 
specified that temporary special measures are necessary, not as an exception to the 
prohibition of discrimination, but as a central part of a strategy to achieve substantive or de 
facto equality between women and men.23 The Committee has also specifically referred to 
the equal rights of girls in the area of basic education in its general recommendation No. 28 
on the core obligations of States parties.24 
</p>
<p>29. Concerning equality between men and women, the Human Rights Committee has 
also interpreted articles 3 and 24 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
on equality between men and women, and on protection of children, respectively, as

<p>requiring States to provide information on &#8220;measures taken to ensure that girls are treated 
equally to boys in education.&#8221;25   
</p>
<p>30. Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifically 
mentions equality of opportunity as a general provision of the treaty, while article 24 
contains detailed provisions concerning the right of persons with disabilities to education 
&#8220;without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity.&#8221; Of particular importance is 
article 24.2 (b) which stipulates that States shall ensure that &#8220;persons with disabilities can 
access an inclusive, quality and free primary education and secondary education on an 
equal basis with others &#8230;.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>31. The International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families also protects the right to education on a basis of equality. Specifically, 
article 30 states that &#8220;each child of a migrant worker shall have the basic right of access to 
education on the basis of equality of treatment with nationals of the State concerned.&#8221; 
Articles 43 and 45 further emphasize equality of treatment for migrant workers and 
members of their families in relation to access to educational institutions, as well as 
vocational training.  
</p>
<p>32. Thus, equality of opportunity in education is clearly an overarching principle in most 
human rights treaties. It enjoins on the States parties to these treaties international 
obligations of a permanent nature for promoting and protecting the right to education, 
without discrimination or exclusion, in a way that it is fully respectful of equality of 
opportunity in education.  
</p>
<p><b> B. UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education 
</b></p>
<p>33. The UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education is a key instrument 
addressing the fundamental principles of non-discrimination and equality of opportunity in 
education. Adopted in 1960 and in force since 1962, it seeks not only to eliminate 
discrimination in education but also to adopt positive measures to promote equality of 
opportunity and treatment. Article 4 of the Convention specifically lays down the 
obligations of the States parties to the Convention  to &#8220;undertake [&#8230;] to formulate, develop 
and apply a national policy which, by methods appropriate to the circumstances and to 
national usage, will tend to promote equality of opportunity and of treatment in the matter 
of education&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>34. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has interpreted articles 2.2 
and 3 of the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights &#8220;in the light 
of the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education (&#8230;.)&#8221;.26 A statement of 
the joint expert group of UNESCO and the Committee highlights that in overcoming 
inequalities and eliminating disparities in education, emphasis should be placed on the 
inclusive dimensions of the right to education, which does not admit of any discrimination 
or exclusion.27

<p><b> C. Global political commitments  
</b></p>
<p>35. The global political commitments made by the international community at the 2000 
World Education Forum towards achieving the goals of EFA are well known. EFA is the 
most relevant international initiative for promoting equality of opportunity in education; its 
goals correspond to various provisions regarding the right to education as enshrined in 
international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>36. Reflecting the commitments adopted by world leaders in 2000 and set to be achieved 
by 2015, the Millennium Development Goals are amongst the most significant political 
commitments in recent history to tackle the most pressing challenges of our world, 
including serious concerns relating to education. Goal 2 calls on States to ensure that all 
children complete primary education, while Goal 3 calls on States to eliminate disparities 
between girls and boys in primary as well as secondary education. Progress towards these 
goals requires fully embracing equality of opportunity in education in the formulation, 
implementation and evaluation of education policies.  
</p>
<p>37. The challenge of ensuring equality in education is also a matter of specific concern 
in the Durban Declaration and the Programme of Action, adopted at the World Conference 
against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (2001), in 
which a key role was assigned to the right to education, in particular basic education. States 
are urged &#8220;to ensure equal access to education for all in law and in practice, and to refrain 
from any legal or any other measures leading to imposed racial segregation in any form in 
access to schooling.&#8221;28 The Programme of Action amply demonstrates the need for 
revitalizing action for non-discrimination and equality of opportunity in the field of 
education.  It urges States to ensure access to education for all without discrimination, to 
eliminate barriers to accessing education, to ensure education of good quality, to monitor 
the educational performance of children from disadvantaged groups, and to devote 
resources to addressing inequalities in educational outcomes for children.29   
</p>
<p>38. As regards equal opportunities for men and women, the Beijing Platform for Action, 
adopted at the Fourth World Conference for Women in 1995, includes women and 
education as one of the Platform&#8217;s 12 critical areas of concern, inter alia, recognizing that 
&#8220;equality of access to and attainment of educational qualifications is necessary if more 
women are to become agents of change.&#8221;30 The Platform for Action calls on Governments 
to, inter alia, &#8220;advance the goal of equal access to education by taking measures to 
eliminate discrimination in education at all levels,&#8221; and to &#8220;create a gender-sensitive 
educational system in order to ensure equal educational and training opportunities.&#8221;31 
</p>
<p><b> V. National legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>39. Pursuant to the legal obligations assumed by States under international human rights 
treaties, and following up on the political commitments they have undertaken, it is 
incumbent upon them to apply the principle of equality of opportunity in education through 
their national legal system. The place accorded to this principle in constitutions and other 
national legislation bears evidence to the way States incorporate their obligations into 
domestic law.

<p>40. Equality of opportunity and equal access to education are guaranteed in the 
constitutions of many countries in all regions. Constitutional provisions are noteworthy in 
several countries in Africa,32 Asia,33 Europe34 and Latin America.35  
</p>
<p>41. Constitutional law in various countries reflects concepts such as equal and adequate 
opportunities, or equal and reasonable opportunities, equitable public education, equal 
access to education, or equal conditions and opportunities, equal right to receive education, 
among others. This provides fertile grounds for action at the national level in the form of 
legislation, but also policies and programmes that ensure better opportunities for all.  
</p>
<p>42. The need to &#8220;identify steps to strengthen and harmonize, where necessary, the 
legislative framework within which the right to education is guaranteed&#8221; was recognized at 
various stages of the EFA process.36 As a consequence, a large number of countries have 
also developed or modernized their national legislation. Such laws establish the right to 
basic education, and include provisions on non-discrimination and equality of opportunity 
in education. This further demonstrates the importance accorded to the equality of 
opportunity in education in national legal systems.37 Moreover, in some countries, the 
regulatory frameworks for private educational institutions have also been developed as part 
of<b> </b>national legal frameworks protecting equal opportunities in education. 38 
</p>
<p>43. Additionally, other countries have enacted laws specifically addressing the 
principles of non-discrimination and equality of opportunity in education. Examples include 
the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (2000) in South 
Africa; the Law on Equality of Rights and Opportunities, Participation and Citizenship of 
Persons with Disabilities (2005) in France; the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (2005) in 
Norway, which establishes the function of Ombudsman on Equality and Anti-
</p>
<p>  
 32 Provisions for: &#8220;equal and adequate opportunities&#8221; are present in the constitutions of Nigeria and 
</p>
<p>Tanzania; &#8220;equal access to educational opportunities and facilities&#8221; in Liberia; &#8220;equal access to 
education&#8221; in Algeria and in Ivory Coast; and  &#8220;equal opportunity to attain the highest educational 
standards&#8221; in Uganda. 
</p>
<p> 33 Provisions for: &#8220;promoting with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker 
sections of the people&#8221; are contained in the constitution of India; &#8220;making quality education 
accessible to all&#8221; in the Philippines; &#8220;equal right to receive the fundamental education&#8221; in Thailand. 
</p>
<p> 34 Provisions for: &#8220;equal opportunity to receive educational services in accordance with their ability and 
special needs as well as the opportunity to develop themselves without being prevented by economic 
hardship&#8221; are in the constitution of Finland; &#8220;equality of opportunity in access to and success in 
schools&#8221; in Portugal; &#8220;equal access to education (instruction)&#8221; in France; and &#8220;the right to education 
for all&#8221; in Spain. 
</p>
<p> 35 Provisions for: &#8220;equal educational opportunities and access to education to all citizens to attain the 
highest level of education in accordance with their capacities&#8221; can be found in the constitution of 
Brazil; &#8220;equal opportunity to access higher education&#8221; in Ecuador; &#8220;equal opportunity to all citizens 
for schooling&#8221; in Suriname; &#8220;equal and free access to education for all Nicaraguans&#8221; in Nicaragua; 
&#8220;the right to learn and equal access and opportunities&#8221; in Paraguay; and &#8220;education with equal 
conditions and opportunities&#8221; in Venezuela.

the Equality Act (2006) in the United Kingdom which establishes a Commission for 
Equality and Human Rights and requires public authorities &#8220;to take proactive steps in 
promoting equality of opportunity between men and women&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>44. In order for legal instruments to be effective, they must offer the possibility of 
addressing the multiple dimensions of inequality in education, as well as the specific 
situation of different groups commonly excluded from the education system. Their 
enforcement requires a reliable and constantly updated data collection system that captures 
the various situations of unequal opportunities in education. In some cases, legal 
instruments expressly address the education of particularly vulnerable groups, such as 
indigenous groups. 39  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Promoting equality of opportunity in education 
</b></p>
<p>45. Addressing inequalities in education requires a clear understanding of its multiple 
and intersecting sources. Given the broad nature of sources of inequalities in education, it 
would be impossible to provide an exhaustive description, or analysis, of measures adopted 
with the declared aim of promoting equal opportunities in education. Moreover, measuring 
marginalization in education is inherently difficult. This section provides only an overview 
of key factors affecting equality of opportunity in education as well as some initiatives 
designed to counter barriers to achieving de facto equality of opportunity in education. 
</p>
<p>46. Poverty is one of the main obstacles to realizing the right to education. Similarly, 
education is recognized as a powerful lever to pull children out of poverty and empower 
them. Nationally and internationally agreed targets for poverty reduction will be missed, 
and inequalities among countries and within societies will widen, if progress towards 
Education for All is not accelerated. The magnitude of the challenge in promoting equal 
opportunities in education can be gauged by the fact that the number of people living in 
extreme poverty and hunger surpasses one billion.  
</p>
<p>47. Girls and women constitute the majority of those who remain deprived of education. 
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has repeatedly 
expressed concern in its concluding observations at the low level of education of women 
and girls, and the prevailing obstacles to their access to education at all levels, especially 
the secondary and tertiary levels. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the human 
rights framework is pivotal in the struggle against multiple forms of discrimination which 
women and girls in vulnerable and marginalized situations suffer. Educating women and 
girls should<i>, </i>a priori, be viewed as a human rights imperative, rather than undertaken solely 
because of the potential benefits to one&#8217;s children or to society.  
</p>
<p>48. Belonging to a minority group is also a factor for marginalization in education. 
Indeed, education opportunities of Afro-descendants in the Americas or Roma groups in 
Europe are the subject of important debates. Ensuring access to basic education on an 
equitable basis for children of ethnic and linguistic minorities is an obligation40  and also 
</p>
<p>  
 39 For example, the Indigenous Education Act (2000), Australia, provides for equitable and appropriate 
</p>
<p>educational outcomes for indigenous people, and their equal access to education.  
 40 The rights of national minorities to carry on their own educational activities, while remaining 
</p>
<p>respectful of &#8220;understanding the culture and language of the community as a whole&#8221; are provided in 
article 5.1(c) of the Convention against Discrimination in Education.  </p>


<p>one of the EFA goals. In this respect, the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to 
National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities provides a basis for action. The 
2008 United Nations Forum on Minority Issues was devoted to the right to education, and 
produced recommendations which apply to the situations of minorities globally with respect 
to the right to education.41 These are highly relevant to equality of opportunity in education 
for other disadvantaged groups. Indigenous groups also face important challenges when 
accessing education. In this regard, apart from core international human rights treaties, the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples42 provides a normative 
base for action.  </p>
<p>49. Other groups vulnerable to limited opportunities in education and requiring targeted 
support include persons with disabilities, children living in the street or without parental 
care, migrant workers and their families, refugees, internally displaced persons and those 
affected by natural disasters or conflict. Moreover, nomad populations,<b> </b> including pastoral 
populations who remain deprived of equal opportunities in education, deserve special 
attention, especially in Africa. 
</p>
<p>50. In all such circumstances, different types of barriers emerge as the central factors in 
the limited enjoyment of the right to education of these various population groups. 
Understanding these different obstacles and their inter-relationship is a permanent 
challenge for developing effective education policies to ensure non-discrimination and 
equal opportunities in education.  
</p>
<p>51. Even if international human rights standards do not provide specific policy 
prescriptions with regard to the vast possibilities of initiatives required to ensure equal 
opportunities in education, they establish a firm foundation for implementing and 
evaluating policy initiatives at the national level. Given the broad nature of sources of 
inequalities in education, it would be impossible to provide an exhaustive description or 
analysis of measures adopted with the declared aim of promoting equal opportunities in 
education.  
</p>
<p>52. An illustrative overview of key factors affecting equality of opportunity in 
education, as well as some initiatives designed to counter barriers to achieving de facto 
equality of opportunity in education are provided below. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Physical barriers 
</b></p>
<p>53. Inadequate public transportation and inadequate school facilities can be determinant 
factors in excluding students from the education system. Persons living in poverty are 
particularly affected; the concentration of communities living in poverty in remote areas or 
in areas that are poorly served by transportation is a key factor limiting their access to 
education institutions. This is particularly acute in rural areas where schools are not 
present.43 These obstacles are commonly addressed through support for transportation of 
students, and by bringing schools closer to communities, often through improvements in 
transport infrastructure and the construction and expansion of education establishments in 
poorly served locations. Strategies also include the establishment of boarding schools.  
</p>
<p>54. Threat of violence against girls on the way to and from schools limits their education 
opportunities: household surveys in many countries identify distance as a major factor in 
</p>
<p>  
 41 See Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues (A/HRC/10/11/Add.1).

<p>parents&#8217; decisions to keep daughters out of school, and concerns over security figure 
prominently.44   
</p>
<p>55. The lack of support for transportation and inadequate facilities can also be a 
determinant factor in the exclusion of students with disabilities from education systems. 
Inadequate public transportation and poor infrastructure in rural and urban areas still 
impede access to schools for persons with mobility restrictions and those who have 
impaired vision. Within schools, inadequately built classrooms and toilets can also restrict 
their use by students with disabilities45. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Financial barriers 
</b></p>
<p>56. Surveys in various countries point to financial constraints &#8211; direct and indirect costs 
of schooling &#8211; as a central reason for children being out of school or dropping out.46 Tuition 
fees appear as the most obvious financial obstacle, and the accumulation of indirect costs, 
such as those related to transportation, school materials, uniform and other indirect 
contributions, undermine access to education opportunities. Besides, disparities in the 
provisions for public education contribute to unequal opportunities for many students 
receiving education in poorly resourced schools, as compared to well-resourced ones. 
</p>
<p>57. Even if primary or basic education were to be accessible free of cost, such access 
cannot be universalized effectively unless financial support in the form of grants and 
bursaries is provided to the children who are excluded, in particular those who are victims 
of extreme poverty.47 Furthermore, targeting elimination of child labour in order to 
safeguard mandatory education is particularly relevant.  
</p>
<p>58. While significant efforts have been undertaken to improve access to free primary 
schooling, less efforts have been made in relation to higher levels of education. Students 
with limited resources therefore have very limited prospects to progress to secondary 
education and beyond.  States have the responsibility to alleviate this financial burden and 
ensure that secondary education is generally available and accessible to all, as well as 
ensure equal access to higher education on the basis of merit or capacity48. 
</p>
<p>59. A number of in-kind incentives, such as school meal programmes, especially in 
poverty-stricken areas, are implemented in order to ensure that income deprivation or 
poverty in general does not result in exclusion from schools. In broad terms, State 
investment in social-protection policies and its contribution to alleviating the burden on 
families and child poverty plays an important role in the promotion of education.  
</p>
<p>60. As poverty and social exclusion remain the major barriers to achieving the EFA, the 
use of direct financial support (through fellowship schemes, conditional cash transfers, or 
</p>
<p>  
 44 Ibid., p. 177. Furthermore, the lack of separate toilets for girls and boys in schools increases the risk 
</p>
<p>of abuse and ultimately may contribute to the exclusion of girls from schools.

introduction of free education&#8221;; and  (c) &#8220;Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on 
the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of 
free education&#8221;.  </p>


<p>social assistance support for children of school age, for example) can be effective in 
enlarging access to education.  
</p>
<p>61. Affirmative action and promotional measures are highly important for addressing 
the educational needs of those living in poverty.49 Such measures may be suitable in cases 
of long-standing or historical and persisting forms of discrimination. The systemic 
exclusion of specific groups from higher levels of education can also be addressed through 
the adoption of temporary special measures. These might range from the establishment of 
enrolment quotas to the offer of financial incentives targeted to particularly vulnerable 
groups.  
</p>
<p>62. The right to education establishes the obligation of States to undertake promotional 
measures including through the introduction of financial support schemes. Article 13 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights proposes the establishment 
of &#8220;an adequate fellowship system&#8221; among its provisions on the right to education,50 while 
the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 13 on the right to education states that &#8220;the 
requirement that &#8216;an adequate fellowship system shall be established&#8217; should be read with 
the Covenant's non-discrimination and equality provisions; the fellowship system should 
enhance equality of educational access for individuals from disadvantaged groups.&#8221;51  
</p>
<p><b> C. Linguistic and cultural barriers 
</b></p>
<p>63. The lack of education in mother-tongue or native languages is often a source of 
exclusion. This is particularly relevant for minorities and migrants. Estimates indicate that 
around 221 million children speak a different language at home from the language of 
instruction in school, limiting their ability to develop foundations for later learning.52 The 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, 
Religious and Linguistic Minorities, establishes in article 4(3) that States should take 
appropriate measures so that, wherever possible, persons belonging to minorities may have 
adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue or to have instruction in their mother 
tongue. Moreover, available experience shows that a child learns better in his or her mother 
tongue in the formative stages and initial period of education.  
</p>
<p>64. Countries with numerous local languages where the official language is not the same 
as that used at home face particular challenges in establishing educational policies and 
language rights. The Forum on Minority Issues recommended that States take appropriate 
measures, wherever possible, to ensure that persons belonging to minorities may have 
adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue or to have instruction in their mother 
tongue. These measures are deemed to be most critical at the preschool and primary school 
levels, but may extend to subsequent stages of education.53 Respecting the richness of 
linguistic and cultural diversity, education policies in today's globalized world should give 
high consideration to mother-tongue-based, multilingual education.   
</p>
<p>  
 49  As provided for in the Education Law (2003),<b> </b>Peru, in order to guarantee equity in education, the 
</p>
<p>State should promote positive action and compensate for inequalities resulting from economic, 
geographical and social factors which have an adverse impact on the exercise of the right to 
education. The Education Act (2005) of Czech Republic also contains provisions on affirmative 
measures. 
</p>
<p> 50 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education lays down the criteria of &#8220;merit or need&#8221;  
with respect to &#8220;grant of scholarships or other forms of assistance to pupils&#8221; (article 3(c)).

<p><b> VII.  Legal enforcement of equality of opportunity  
</b></p>
<p>65. Judicial systems play an essential role in protecting and enforcing the right to 
education as an entitlement. The enforcement of legal mechanisms guaranteeing equality of 
opportunity in education is crucial in safeguarding such entitlement. In the case of violation 
of the right to education and denial of equality of opportunity, everyone must be able to 
have recourse before courts or administrative tribunals on the basis of international legal 
obligations as well as to existing constitutional provisions on the right to education. 
Decisions by courts across regions demonstrate how courts have upheld the right to 
education and equality of opportunities in education. Case law from several countries 
shows that individuals can claim their entitlement to equality of opportunity in education.  
</p>
<p>66. In the historic ruling of <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> the Supreme Court of the 
United States of America emphatically declared that separate educational facilities for 
white and black children are &#8220;inherently unequal&#8221;. Even where physical facilities and other 
objective factors are equal, a segregated school system denies equal educational 
opportunities to the minority group.54  Other cases have noted that &#8220;providing public 
schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State,&#8221; and &#8220;education is perhaps the 
most important function of State and local governments.&#8221;55 The right to equal educational 
opportunity in mixed-race and mixed-gender schools has since been codified through the 
establishment of the Equal Educational Opportunities Act.56  
</p>
<p>67. In India, jurisprudence also underlines State obligations relating to the right to 
education and the equality of educational opportunities. The Supreme Court of India has 
interpreted the provisions on equality before the law in article 14 of India&#8217;s Constitution to 
promote equality <i>in law</i> and <i>in fact</i>. Equality in law must ultimately find its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre in 
equality in fact.57 A Constitution Bench of the Indian Supreme Court held that &#8220;What is 
fundamental, as an enduring value of our polity, is guarantee to each of equal opportunity to 
unfold the full potential of his personality. [&#8230;] The philosophy and pragmatism of 
universal excellence through equality of opportunity for education and advancement across 
the nation is part of our founding faith and constitutional creed.&#8221;58 
</p>
<p>68. In 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled that by excluding pupils on an 
economic basis, schools violate their right to education.59 The Constitutional Court of South 
Africa held that &#8220;affirmative action in education, which would give preference to 
previously disadvantaged persons to gain admission (to university), is allowed by section 
9(2) of the Constitution.&#8221;60 Other rulings from the same court in South Africa also protect 
the right to education and language rights.61  
</p>
<p>69. Regional human rights systems have also adopted decisions relevant for the 
protection of equal opportunities in education. The European Court of Human Rights 
recently held that the right to education was violated by the placement of a Croatian

<p>national of Roma origin in Roma-only classes, rather than ethnically &#8216;mixed&#8217; classes.62 
Even the applicant had attended &#8216;Roma-only&#8217; schools at other times. The Court noted that 
there was a lack of a systemic and structured approach to the integration of Roma children 
into mainstream classes. 
</p>
<p>70. Administrative tribunals and national human rights institutions also reinforce 
judicial and quasi-judicial mechanisms to safeguard the equality of opportunities in 
education and right to education. In another case relating to schools dedicated to Roma 
children, the Equal Treatment Authority of Hungary concluded63 that not only were 
authorities responsible for the local system that segregated students, in violation of the 
principle of equal treatment, but those who tolerated or assisted the maintenance of existing 
segregation schemes also violated the law. National human rights institutions also have an 
important role to play. In Mauritius, for example, the ombudsperson has the authority to 
investigate any type of educational discrimination. The Equality and Anti-Discrimination 
Ombudsman, in Norway, and the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman, in Sweden, also have 
such competence. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>It is clear that normative action aimed at achieving equality of opportunities in 
education, both in law and in fact<i>,</i> needs to be intensified. The application of the 
principle of equality of opportunity in education, which is common to various 
international human rights treaties, calls for greater emphasis on the fulfilment of 
State obligations.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur puts forward the following recommendations for the 
promotion of equal opportunities in education on the basis of a human rights 
framework: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure adequate legal protection to the right to education and its equal 
enjoyment in all its inclusive dimensions:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>States should incorporate their obligations under international human rights 
conventions into their domestic legal order. Governments should recognize the 
key importance of adequate legal frameworks on equality of opportunity in 
education in line with international standards for ensuring such equality. A 
strong regulatory framework for public and private education systems 
grounded in the principle of equality of opportunity provides the essential basis 
for the establishment of an entire range of programmes and policies aiming at 
ensuring equality of opportunity;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Address multiple forms of inequality and discrimination through 
comprehensive policies:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Given the mutually reinforcing nature of different forms of discrimination and 
inequality in the context of education, States should address multiple forms of 
inequality and discrimination through comprehensive policies. Prevailing 
disparities in access to education &#8211; between boys and girls, and between rich 
and poor regions &#8211;must be given special consideration, recognizing that good 
policies backed by a commitment to equality can make a difference. Policy

<p><b>measures must respond to the need for making learning accessible for the most 
marginalized and vulnerable;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure adequate resource allocation:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Having regard to the specific needs of those who are victims of marginalization 
and exclusion as well as to the elimination of geographic disparities in the 
provision of education, States must ensure adequate allocation of resources 
where they are needed most. Resources should be earmarked adequately for 
fellowships, bursaries and grants, along with investments in social protection, 
bearing in mind the need to address marginalization and exclusion, and 
educational dimensions of poverty reduction strategies;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Support mechanisms promoting the enforcement of the right to 
education:</b>  
</p>
<p><b>States should ensure adequate support to independent national human rights 
institutions, as these can greatly contribute to identifying inequalities and 
addressing relevant situations of violation of the right to education&#8217;;    
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Take a human-rights perspective for moving forward the Education For 
All (EFA) agenda:</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>In order to strengthen effectiveness in combating marginalization and exclusion 
as part of the EFA process, high emphasis should be placed on human rights 
obligations, and the responsibility of States to ensure the right to basic 
education for all. Such approach would provide leverage in moving the EFA 
agenda further and would foster the central role of education in accelerating 
progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Promote integrated follow-up to concluding observations adopted by the 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies, and to recommendations to States 
resulting from the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council:</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Integrated follow-up to concluding observations adopted by the United Nations 
human rights treaty bodies and to recommendations emerging from the 
Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council would contribute to 
better ensuring equality of opportunity in education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Enhance international assistance and cooperation:</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Major inequalities in the enjoyment of the right to education occur in countries 
facing severe resource constraints. Thus, adequate and sustainable 
international assistance and cooperation also play a central role in the 
elimination of inequalities  Assistance should be provided, bearing in mind 
human rights obligations and political commitments, including the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, as well as Goal 8 on developing a global 
partnership for development;   
</b></p>
<p><b>International organizations, notably UNESCO and UNICEF, play a key role in 
the field of education. They can show the way forward by encouraging public 
debate on issues deemed to be of critical importance, and play an important 
role in promoting equality-enhancing policies and exchange of experiences on 
successful practices in the promotion of equality of opportunities.  In that spirit, 
technical assistance to countries in the most difficult situation must be 
prioritized; </b></p>


<p><b> (h) Strengthen collaboration with academic institutions and civil society 
organizations:</b>   
</p>
<p><b>Fostering inclusive education implies active engagement of civil society. The 
intellectual community and the civil society play a central role in promoting 
better understanding of inequalities in education. The advocacy work of these 
stakeholders is vital to ensuring widespread attention to issues for ensuring 
equality of opportunity in education.
