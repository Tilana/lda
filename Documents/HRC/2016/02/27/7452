</p>
<p>report on Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Slovenia: Botswana, Italy and Viet Nam. 
</p>

<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Slovenia reiterated that human rights were among the key 
</p>
<p>principles upon which the Republic of Slovenia was built. It reported that since the 
</p>
<p>submission of its national report, the participation of women in the national assembly and in 
</p>
<p>the Government had increased. Since mid-October an important new draft of a law on 
</p>
<p>same-sex civil partnerships was under public discussion.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the Government had substantially reduced the backlog in 
</p>
<p>reporting to the human rights treaty bodies and added that in July 2014, Slovenia had 
</p>
<p>submitted its third report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>(ICCPR) and its initial report under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities (CRPD). It had also just submitted an updated common core document.  
</p>
<p>7. Some areas where Slovenia has achieved significant progress since 2010 were 
</p>
<p>highlighted. The delegation underscored the measures taken to resolve the status of persons 
</p>
<p>erased from the register of permanent residents. A law regulating their status was passed in 
</p>
<p>2010 and gave the erased the possibility to regulate their status and obtain permanent 
</p>
<p>residence permits from the erasure onwards. A special compensation scheme took effect in 
</p>
<p>June 2014, according to which a beneficiary can claim compensation. </p>


<p>8. Slovenia stated it had further reduced court backlogs to the point where they could 
</p>
<p>no longer be considered a systemic problem.  
</p>
<p>9. Touching upon austerity measures, the delegation assured they were carefully re-
</p>
<p>examined with a view to minimizing the impact on the most vulnerable. Social transfers 
</p>
<p>played a very important role in poverty reduction in Slovenia.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation addressed questions received in advance of the interactive dialogue, 
</p>
<p>first providing additional information regarding questions received from the Czech 
</p>
<p>Republic, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland on the erased and presenting the concrete measures in the Compensation 
</p>
<p>Act.  
</p>
<p>11. On the questions received in advance from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland about the Roma, 
</p>
<p>the delegation referred to the improvement in the housing conditions of the Roma, which is 
</p>
<p>a priority of the National Programme of Measures for Roma for the period 2010&#8211;2015 and 
</p>
<p>with progress reached in many Roma settlements during recent years.  
</p>
<p>12. On trafficking in human beings, in response to inquiries by the Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, the delegation reiterated the importance it attaches to the issue. The delegation 
</p>
<p>asserted that the National Coordinator reports annually to the Government and the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly on preventive measures and assistance to all victims of trafficking.  
</p>
<p>13. In answering Belgium on discrimination against the children of same-sex couples in 
</p>
<p>schools, based on their family&#8217;s sexual orientation, the delegation, in presenting relevant 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising activities, highlighted a book &#8220;My name is Damjan&#8221; on lesbian, gay, 
</p>
<p>bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons that all secondary school students were 
</p>
<p>receiving during the current school year. In responses to the question of Spain, it explained 
</p>
<p>that the Slovenian Ministry of Health and the blood transfusion service were currently 
</p>
<p>considering their existing practices, with a view to adapting it to both medical requirements 
</p>
<p>for ensuring a high level of protection for recipients of blood and the principle of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination.  
</p>
<p>14. In addressing a question from Mexico, the delegation reiterated that in Slovenia, 
</p>
<p>gender equality is a right, a goal and a horizontal principle permeating all spheres of life of 
</p>
<p>both women and men during all periods of life. Slovenia further specified the position of 
</p>
<p>women in the labour market, whereby the wage gap is among the lowest in Europe, i.e. 
</p>
<p>approximately 2.5 per cent in 2012. He also presented an important awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>project in regard to combating violence against women: &#8220;VESNA &#8212; to live a life free of 
</p>
<p>violence.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation addressed questions by Norway about overcrowding in Slovene 
</p>
<p>prisons, explaining that overcrowding was only an issue in one prison during a short time 
</p>
<p>period and was being remedied by various measures. Regarding the ruling of the European 
</p>
<p>Court on Human Rights foreign currency deposits in Ljubljanska Banka, the Government 
</p>
<p>had appointed a working group for its implementation and was preparing an action plan, 
</p>
<p>which will be presented to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe by mid-
</p>
<p>January 2015. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation also emphasized that discussions on the strengthening of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Ombudsperson are currently ongoing, in order to qualify for Group A accreditation 
</p>
<p>status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
</p>
<p>Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>17. The delegation addressed questions by Belgium, explaining that interministerial 
</p>
<p>coordination procedures were under way regarding ratification of the Optional Protocol to </p>


<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on a communications 
</p>
<p>procedure and that ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearance  (ICPPED) was under discussion in Slovenia, as was 
</p>
<p>also the ratification of the amendment to article 8 of the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD).

</p>
<p>25. Malaysia appreciated the measures to implement the recommendations accepted

</p>
<p>27. Morocco noted the information on the implementation of previously accepted 
</p>
<p>recommendations and measures to strengthen the institutional framework, notably through 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Ombudsman. It welcomed amendments to the criminal code and 
</p>
<p>measures to incorporate human rights education into school programmes and training 
</p>
<p>modules. </p>


<p>28. The Netherlands welcomed progress regarding the efficiency of the legal system and 
</p>
<p>the backlog of cases. It commended the efforts on gender equality and violence against 
</p>
<p>women, stressing the importance of protecting women and girls and improving the 
</p>
<p>treatment of minorities. 
</p>
<p>29. New Zealand welcomed the opportunity to discuss human rights issues of shared 
</p>
<p>concern and recognized the challenges faced. It offered to share its own experiences in 
</p>
<p>dealing with the issue of domestic violence with Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>30. Nicaragua highlighted Slovenia&#8217;s progress in combating trafficking in persons, in 
</p>

<p>made in terms of gender equality and the empowerment and increased participation of 
</p>
<p>women in decision-making.

</p>
<p>33. Pakistan called for further efforts to address discrimination against religious and 
</p>
<p>ethnic minorities, particularly regarding health, education and the prevention of torture by 
</p>
<p>law enforcement agencies. It echoed concerns raised by the Committee on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of Racial Discrimination over inadequate prosecution of racially motivated offences. 
</p>
<p>34. The Philippines welcomed Slovenia&#8217;s efforts to fight trafficking in persons and 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of migrants. It stressed that adequate resources are needed for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of programmes on family violence, children and youth, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and against discrimination.  
</p>
<p>35. Poland welcomed efforts by Slovenia to comply with the recommendations accepted 
</p>
<p>during the first cycle of the universal periodic review. However, it expressed concern 
</p>
<p>regarding the juvenile justice system and the situation of children from minority groups.  
</p>
<p>36. Portugal welcomed efforts to enhance the role of women in society and the labour 
</p>
<p>market and the plan to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which 
</p>
<p>represented progress towards ending violence against women and girls. It commended the 
</p>
<p>efforts to combat discrimination. 
</p>
<p>37. The Republic of Moldova inquired about the effects of applying the upgraded police 
</p>
<p>restraining orders. It noted with appreciation the steps taken by Slovenia to prevent and 
</p>
<p>combat trafficking in persons. 
</p>
<p>38. The Russian Federation noted Slovenia&#8217;s efforts to protect human rights. It noted, 
</p>
<p>however, that the situation of Roma remained problematic and the special legal status and 
</p>

<p>41. Serbia encouraged Slovenia to continue its efforts in implementing the

</p>
<p>42. Sierra Leone commended Slovenia for setting up robust legal and institutional 
</p>

<p>economic situation. It encouraged Slovenia to bring the Office of the Ombudsman into line 
</p>
<p>with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>43. Slovakia commended Slovenia for ratifying several international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments and for its efforts to improve the integration of Roma and combat

</p>
<p>settlements and ensuring funding for Roma teaching assistants.  
</p>
<p>44. Spain welcomed Slovenia&#8217;s institutional structure to combat discrimination, but 
</p>

</p>
<p>faced by minorities. 
</p>
<p>48. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia welcomed the ratification of 
</p>
<p>international human rights instruments and the progress made since the first cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review regarding &#8220;erased&#8221; persons and the consultative body for the 
</p>
<p>situation of persons from former Yugoslav republics. It requested information on 
</p>
<p>monitoring and corrective measures concerning discrimination against Roma. 
</p>
<p>49. Tunisia noted the ratification of regional and international instruments, the amended 
</p>
<p>constitution and criminal code and the efforts made against human trafficking and racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination. It encouraged Slovenia to reform the Human Rights Ombudsman to comply 
</p>
<p>with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>50. Turkey asked for more information on the resolution on the national social 
</p>

</p>
<p>Slovenia&#8217;s determination to resolve the issue of &#8220;erased persons&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. Ukraine recognized Slovenia&#8217;s commitment to human rights and its efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve the institutional and legislative framework, including the ratification of 
</p>
<p>international instruments. It noted the steps taken to protect persons with a disability,and 
</p>
<p>encouraged Slovenia to continue related programmes and to allocate resources for their 
</p>
<p>implementation.  
</p>
<p>52. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland noted the steps taken to 
</p>
<p>resolve the status of &#8220;erased&#8221; persons. It encouraged Slovenia to make further efforts for the 
</p>
<p>restoration of their rights and to close legal gaps in that regard. It also encouraged measures 
</p>
<p>to eliminate discrimination against Roma. </p>


<p>53. Regarding the rights of the Roma population, the delegation of Slovenia recalled that 
</p>
<p>Roma had special protection under the constitution and through the 2007 Roma Community 
</p>
<p>Act. A national programme of measures for Roma for the period 2015&#8211;2020 was being 
</p>
<p>developed to follow up on the existing one and would focus on living conditions, 
</p>
<p>employment, social inclusion, health, culture and languages. 
</p>
<p>54. Recognizing the ongoing challenge of human rights and social inclusion, the 
</p>
<p>delegation noted a significant improvement, owing to government efforts and those of the 
</p>
<p>international community and non-governmental organizations. Dialogue between the 
</p>
<p>Government and communities had improved. Targeted programmes included community 
</p>
<p>policing and training for police officers, and the first female Roma police officer had 
</p>
<p>entered the police force. 
</p>
<p>55. School classes were not segregated; Roma children were part of the mainstream 
</p>
<p>education system. However, under the strategy for the education of Roma, Roma teaching 
</p>
<p>assistants were employed to improve achievements and attendance at school, and provided 
</p>
<p>a bridge between the school and national authorities and the Roma community. 
</p>
<p>56. The delegation asserted that few Roma settlements did not have access to water, 
</p>
<p>following the enforcement of legislation requiring every settlement with more than 50 
</p>
<p>permanent residents to have a public water supply. Remaining problems were being 
</p>
<p>resolved, following recommendations by the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation. Slovenia was considering elevating the right to water to the 
</p>
<p>constitutional level. 
</p>
<p>57. Slovenia drew attention to the role of the Government Council for Issues concerning 
</p>
<p>the National Communities of Members of Nations of the Former SFRY in Slovenia as a 
</p>
<p>consultative body.  
</p>
<p>58. Recalling that 25,000 people had been &#8220;erased&#8221; from the register of permanent 
</p>
<p>residents, Slovenia noted that their change in status had not affected their citizenship, but 
</p>
<p>had had an impact on their enjoyment of the rights accorded only to residents. Thirteen 
</p>
<p>thousand persons had had their status restored, while others had returned to their own 
</p>
<p>nations. The Act Regulating the Legal Status of Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in 
</p>
<p>Slovenia covered all &#8220;erased&#8221; groups and their children, including those living abroad, and 
</p>
<p>the Act on Compensations for Persons Erased from the Register of Permanent Residents 
</p>
<p>applied to all persons, irrespective of the success of their residence claim. The delegation 
</p>
<p>recognized that the system still faced challenges, with large numbers of cases and the 
</p>
<p>legislation being challenged before the Constitutional Court. However, prejudice against 
</p>
<p>&#8220;erased&#8221; persons had reduced dramatically. 
</p>
<p>59. The delegation emphasized that in Slovenia, hate speech, promoting intolerance and 
</p>
<p>xenophobia were crimes and resulted in prosecution; however, Slovenia did not experience 
</p>
<p>a lot of hate speech against minorities or religious intolerance. 
</p>
<p>60. Returning to the promotion of gender equality, the delegation reiterated that the 
</p>
<p>situation had improved significantly in the media, politics and the public sector, where 70 
</p>
<p>per cent of judges were women, but noted ongoing challenges in the corporate sector, 
</p>
<p>where only 5 per cent of chief executives were women. 
</p>
<p>61. Legislation and programmes had been adopted, in conjunction with the police and 
</p>
<p>social services, to combat gender-based and domestic violence and to raise awareness of 
</p>
<p>that issue. 
</p>
<p>62. Italian and Hungarian minorities had special constitutional status; they were 
</p>
<p>allocated two seats in the parliament and at least four public prosecutors were required to 
</p>
<p>have good knowledge of either the Italian or Hungarian languages. Funding was also 
</p>
<p>allocated to minority languages within the education system and the media.  </p>


<p>63. Children&#8217;s rights were enshrined in the constitution and various acts, and were 
</p>
<p>protected within the education system and a special department had also been established 
</p>
<p>under the Human Rights Ombudsman. In criminal proceedings, the law provided for free 
</p>
<p>and impartial legal assistance for children who were witnesses or victims of crime and 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of crime over the age of 16 were prosecuted under a juvenile justice system, in 
</p>
<p>line with international standards. 
</p>
<p>64. Regrettably, some children had experienced poverty as a result of the recent 
</p>
<p>economic crisis. Social transfers, school grants, free school lunches, subsidies, free access 
</p>
<p>to health care for children and adolescents were ways in which Slovenia had sought to 
</p>
<p>mitigate the impact of the crisis on children. The 2015 budget would take into account the 
</p>
<p>need for ongoing provision of social assistance. 
</p>
<p>65. Regarding the rights of the elderly, the delegation explained that a special office 
</p>
<p>would be established under the new coalition agreement and that it was recognized that 
</p>
<p>elderly persons were a vulnerable group. Despite the financial crisis, pensions had not 
</p>
<p>decreased and there was a highly developed network of public and private care homes. 
</p>
<p>66. Responding to queries on trafficking in persons, Slovenia confirmed that it 
</p>

</p>
<p>contain a full ban on corporal punishment. 
</p>

<p>in support of minority groups each year. For example, a bilateral agreement between 
</p>

</p>
<p>national culture programme.

</p>
<p>rights, describing the universal periodic review process as an opportunity for constructive 
</p>
<p>dialogue. It stated that it would endeavour to tackle new challenges and recurring 
</p>
<p>recommendations and issues, following up immediately on the second cycle of the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review through discussions with all stakeholders.
