</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,

Human Rights Council and the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that lack of political will remains the core factor in the failure by States to 
translate the commitments of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action into concrete 
action and tangible results, in particular with respect to honouring the memory of the victims of 
historic injustices and past tragedies caused by slavery, the slave trade, the transatlantic slave 
trade, apartheid, colonialism and genocide, and also underlining that Africans and people of 
African descent, Asians and people of Asian descent and indigenous peoples were victims of 
these injustices and tragedies and continue to be victims of their consequences, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> some positive developments in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p> 1<i>. Regrets</i> the persisting lack of political will to take decisive steps to combat racism in 
all its forms and manifestations and to concretely move away from denials about the persistence 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Welcomes</i> the landmark and historic formal apology by the Government of Australia 
for the past laws and policies that inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on its aboriginal 
peoples;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> Governments that have not done so to issue formal apologies to the victims of 
past and historic injustices and to take all necessary measures to achieve healing and 
reconciliation;  
</p>
<p> 4<i>. Endorses </i>the report of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent<b>1</b> 
on its eighth session;  
</p>
<p> 5<i>. Welcomes </i>the convening of the first part of the sixth session of the Intergovernmental 
Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action in January 2008, and requests it to continue to provide guidance to the Working Group of 
Experts on People of African Descent;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also</i> <i>welcomes </i>the convening of the first part of the first session of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards in February 2008, and requests the 
Ad Hoc Committee, at the second part of its first session, to heed, as a matter of priority, the 
instruction and decision of the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance to prepare complementary international standards to 
strengthen and update international instruments against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance in all their aspects;
