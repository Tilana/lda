BHP BILLITON RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
·       Response efforts at Samarco continue with good progress being made on community resettlement, community
health and environment restoration.
·       There were no fatalities at our operated sites in the 2016 financial year.
·       Underlying EBITDA(1) of US$12.3 billion and an Underlying EBITDA margin(2) of 41% for the 2016 financial
year, despite weaker commodity prices which had a negative impact of US$10.7 billion.
·       Productivity gains of US$437 million(3) achieved for the period and we remain on track for US$2.2 billion of
gains over the two years to the end of the 2017 financial year. Conventional petroleum, grade-adjusted Escondida,
Western Australia Iron Ore and Queensland Coal unit cash costs(4) declined by 30%, 22%, 19% and 15%
respectively.
·       Capital and exploration expenditure declined by 42% to US$6.4 billion and is expected to decrease further to
US$5.0 billion in the 2017 financial year (BHP Billiton share)(5). On a cash basis, capital and exploration
expenditure was US$7.7 billion and is forecast to decline to US$5.4 billion in the 2017 financial year.
·       Reduction in operating costs, the flexibility in our investment program and a targeted reduction of working
capital supported free cash flow(2) of US$3.4 billion.
·       Our balance sheet remains strong, with net debt(2) of US$26.1 billion broadly unchanged from December 2015.
·       The Board has determined to pay a final dividend of 14 US cents per share, which is covered by free cash flow
generated in the current period. In accordance with the Group's dividend policy, this comprises the minimum payout
of 8 US cents per share and an additional amount of 6 US cents per share, reflecting continued balance sheet
strength and strong free cash flow during the period.

Results for the year ended 30 June 2016
BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Mackenzie, said: "The last 12 months have been challenging for both
BHP Billiton and the resources industry. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate the resilience of our portfolio and the
diverse ways in which we can create value for shareholders despite low commodity prices. Unit cash costs across
the Group declined 16 per cent and with increased capital efficiency, supported free cash flow generation of US$3.4
billion despite weaker commodity prices. Next year, we expect another US$1.8 billion of productivity gains as our
new Operating Model helps sustain momentum, delivering more than US$7 billion of free cash flow based on
current spot prices and a forecast reduction in net debt.
"The strength of our cash flow generation and balance sheet is reflected in the final dividend of 14 US cents per
share, which comprises the minimum implied by our payout ratio and a top up from excess cash in line with the
capital allocation framework. We continue to pursue capital-efficient latent capacity opportunities which will support
volume growth of up to four per cent next year, excluding our Onshore US assets where we continue to defer activity
to maximise value. In addition, we have progressed high-return growth projects, with investment decisions on the
Mad Dog 2 and Spence Growth Option projects expected by the end of next calendar year.
"Over the past five years we have actively reshaped our portfolio, and we are confident we have the right mix of
commodities, assets and opportunities to create substantial value over time. While commodity prices are expected to
remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities,
particularly oil and copper."
In relation to Samarco, he added: "All of us at BHP Billiton remain deeply saddened by the Samarco tragedy. The
Company is fully committed to the Framework Agreement and its programs to remediate and compensate for the
impacts of the Samarco dam failure. Good progress is being made on community resettlement, community health
and environment restoration."
We remain committed to supporting Samarco with the recovery of the communities and environment
Responding to the tragedy following the failure of the Fundão tailings dam at Samarco on 5 November 2015
remains a priority for BHP Billiton. Sadly, authorities have confirmed 19 fatalities, of which five were members of the
community and 14 were people who were working on the dams at the time of the dam failure.
On 2 March 2016, Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco), Vale S.A (Vale) and BHP Billiton Brasil LTDA (BHP Billiton
Brasil) entered into an agreement with the Federal Government of Brazil, the States of Espirito Santo and Minas
Gerais and certain other public authorities (Brazilian Authorities) (Framework Agreement). Further details are
provided in note 7 Significant events on pages 39 to 46.
Samarco and its shareholders continue to believe that the Framework Agreement provides the appropriate long-term
framework to remediate and compensate for the impacts of the Samarco dam failure. As set out by the Framework
Agreement, a private autonomous foundation has been created to implement the socioeconomic and environmental
programs in the Agreement. Samarco has initiated 90 per cent of the 41 programs prescribed by the Framework
Agreement, with good progress being made on most programs including community resettlement, education,
community health and compensation.
Approximately two-thirds of the houses and buildings in the Mariana and Barra Longa region, outside of the
communities to be resettled, have been completely rebuilt or restored. Samarco has been active in addressing the
environmental impact of the dam failure. Samarco is building a series of dykes downstream of Fundão to capture
sediment and reduce turbidity. A compensation program has been developed under the Framework Agreement to
ensure affected people receive fair and reasonable compensation. Preliminary compensation has already been paid
to those most severely impacted.
Samarco has confirmed it is unlikely to have in place the necessary approvals to restart its operations in this
calendar year. While technical studies carried out to date indicate operations can restart safely, this will only occur
when stabilisation work has been completed to a satisfactory standard and all regulatory approvals are granted and
accepted by the relevant authorities and communities.
BHP Billiton Brasil, Vale and Samarco have jointly commissioned an external investigation into the cause of the
dam failure. Our understanding is that the findings from the investigation will be available in the next few weeks.
BHP Billiton has committed to publicly releasing those findings, and to sharing the results with other resources
companies.
The health and safety of our people and the communities in which we operate always come first
In the 2016 financial year there were no fatalities at our operated sites and there was a significant decrease in high
potential incidents. While this is encouraging, we continue to strive to make our workplace safer. We are replicating
successful in-field leadership programs across our assets, which delivers a structured and improved approach to in-
field verification of critical controls and safety engagement. The Group reported a Total Recordable Injury Frequency
of 4.3 per million hours worked.
Robust free cash flow in a period characterised by weaker commodity prices
BHP Billiton delivered Underlying EBITDA of US$12.3 billion and an Underlying EBITDA margin of 41 per cent in
the 2016 financial year, despite significantly weaker prices across all our major commodities which had a negative
impact of US$10.7 billion.
The Group achieved US$437 million of productivity gains, or US$2.0 billion excluding the impact of grade decline at
Escondida. Further improvements continue to be realised across the portfolio and we remain on track to deliver
US$2.2 billion of gains, or US$3.8 billion excluding the impact of grade decline at Escondida, over the two years to
the end of the 2017 financial year.
During the period, Conventional petroleum, Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO), and Queensland Coal unit cash
costs declined by 30 per cent, 19 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. Escondida unit costs increased by 11 per
cent but excluding the impact of grade decline, unit costs decreased by 22 per cent. Historical cash costs and
guidance for the 2017 financial year are summarised in the following table:

(i) 2017 financial year guidance is based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.71 and USD/CLP 698.
The Group reported Underlying attributable profit of US$1.2 billion, while the Attributable loss of US$6.4 billion
includes US$7.7 billion of exceptional items (after tax) related to: an impairment charge of US$4.9 billion against the
carrying value of the Onshore US assets; US$2.2 billion for the financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the
Group's income statement; and US$570 million for global taxation matters.
The Group continued to focus on capital productivity and exercise flexibility in its investment program in response to
market conditions, which led to a 40 per cent decline in capital and exploration expenditure to US$7.7 billion (cash
basis). Combined with the reduction in operating costs and a targeted reduction of working capital, the Group
delivered free cash flow of US$3.4 billion. Capital and exploration expenditure of US$5.4 billion (cash basis) is
planned for the 2017 financial year, before rising to US$6.2 billion (cash basis) in the 2018 financial year.
We maintained our strong balance sheet, finishing the period with net debt broadly unchanged at US$26.1 billion
(31 December 2015: US$25.9 billion; 30 June 2015: US$24.4 billion). The gearing ratio(2) ended the period at 30.3
per cent (31 December 2015: 29.7 per cent; 30 June 2015: 25.7 per cent). We expect net debt to decline in the 2017
financial year from current levels.
Disciplined application of the capital allocation framework to maximise shareholder value
Strict adherence to our capital allocation framework balances value creation, cash returns to shareholders and
balance sheet strength in a transparent and consistent manner.
First, capital expenditure has been appropriately prioritised to maintain safe and stable operations.
Second, our balance sheet strength has been maintained with both cash flow and gearing metrics within our target
ranges, liquidity of US$16 billion and a long-dated debt maturity profile.
Third, the dividend policy provides a minimum 50 per cent payout of Underlying attributable profit at every reporting
period, assuming our operations have sufficient capital allocated to maintain integrity and the balance sheet is
strong. In accordance with this, the minimum dividend payment for the period is 8 US cents per share.
Fourth, reflecting robust free cash flow during the period, the Board has determined to pay an additional amount of 6
US cents per share, taking the final dividend to 14 US cents per share. The Board considers cash returns in excess
of the minimum implied by the dividend payout ratio at every reporting period. We have also continued to invest in
growth and the remaining excess free cash flow of US$1.3 billion has been directed to further strengthen the
balance sheet during the second half of the 2016 financial year.
The Group's productivity focus and consistent investment in latent capacity opportunities will support volume growth
in the 2017 financial year of five per cent in copper, up to four per cent in iron ore, and three per cent in metallurgical
coal. We expect growth in total copper equivalent production of up to four per cent for the 2017 financial year(7),
excluding our Onshore US assets where we have chosen to defer development activity for value given the current
low commodity price environment.
Strongly positioned to grow shareholder value
While we remain confident in the outlook for our commodities, our capital allocation framework and strong balance
sheet provide us with the flexibility and financial strength to pursue a diverse range of opportunities to create
shareholder value even without a significant recovery in prices.
We continue to make considerable improvements to productivity. The new Operating Model is already accelerating
the replication of best practices across the organisation and will support the expected delivery of a further US$1.8
billion of productivity gains and increasing free cash flow in the 2017 financial year.
Capital-efficient latent capacity options could add more than 10 per cent to current production(7). The Group has
made significant progress with these options including: approval of the Escondida Los Colorados Extension copper
project in June 2016; commissioning of the Spence Recovery Optimisation project which commenced in June 2016,
additional capacity at WAIO's Jimblebar mining hub to be completed during the December 2016 quarter; and the
development of the Southern Mine Area at Olympic Dam which will continue into the 2017 financial year. We will
also maximise the value of our high-quality Onshore US assets in a disciplined manner as prices recover.
Our growth projects have continued to progress as planned. Board approval will be sought in relation to Mad Dog 2
and the Spence Growth Option before the end of the 2017 calendar year. The Brownfield Expansion (BFX) project at
Olympic Dam, which is part of the staged expansion approach to approximately 280 ktpa, is now at concept study
phase and we continue to receive encouraging results from the heap leach trials which will enable growth beyond
this to 450 ktpa of copper.
We are accelerating our counter-cyclical exploration program and plan to invest approximately US$800 million in
exploration in the 2017 financial year. In Petroleum, exploration drilling has commenced in Trinidad and Tobago
and in the Gulf of Mexico following positive results at Shenzi North during the 2016 financial year.
Finally, we expect technology will unlock resources and lower the Group's cost base, with a broad range of
opportunities identified at a number of our major assets that should create substantial value over time.
Outlook
Economic outlook
Global growth over the remainder of the 2016 calendar year is expected to remain modest and subject to downside
risks, including the uncertain economic consequences of 'Brexit'. World trade is still expanding more slowly than
global GDP growth, principally reflecting weak business investment and soft demand for consumer durables. Global
growth is forecast to remain between 3 and 3.5 per cent in the 2017 calendar year, while global trade should
accelerate modestly.
The rate of growth in the Chinese economy appears to have stabilised and we expect that Government policy will
remain supportive, in line with the authorities' GDP growth target of between 6.5 and 7 per cent for the 2016
calendar year. Over the medium term, China is expected to grow more slowly. The Government's reform program
will improve productivity but this will only partially offset the impact of an expected decline in the workforce and the
maturation of the economy's structure. Reform will proceed in a cautious but sustained manner as the authorities
seek to improve the efficiency of capital allocation, reduce excess capacity in sectors such as coal and steel while
boosting the role of consumer demand and maintaining support for employment.
Commodities outlook
Crude oil prices fell at the start of the 2016 calendar year on growing OPEC supply, rising inventories and resilient
United States production. The market has since begun to rebalance due to declining production in the United States,
unplanned supply outages elsewhere and strong non-OECD demand growth. While the market will continue to
rebalance in the short term, economic uncertainty and high inventory levels are likely to keep prices volatile but
range bound. The long-term outlook remains healthy, underpinned by rising demand from the petrochemical
industry, a growing transport sector in developing countries and natural field decline.
The domestic gas price in the United States weakened following strong production and subdued heating demand
due to a mild winter. This resulted in record inventory levels. In the short term, seasonal demand for cooling offers
some price support, but high inventories are likely to prevent significant price appreciation. Longer term, natural field
decline and increasing demand underpinned by the environmental, operational and economic advantages of gas in
power generation and other applications will support higher prices.
Copper prices continue to be affected by growing supply on the back of improving levels of productivity and slightly
weaker rates of demand growth. In the short to medium term, new and expanded production should keep the market
well supplied, notwithstanding announced cuts to higher-cost production. Longer term, the copper outlook remains
positive as demand is supported by China's shift towards consumption in addition to the scope for substantial growth
in other emerging markets. A deficit is expected to emerge as grade decline and limited high-quality development
opportunities constrain the industry's ability to cheaply meet growing demand.
Global steel production has been weak in the first half of the 2016 calendar year compared to the prior year as most
regions saw a contraction in output, with the exception of India. Chinese steel production increased in the June 2016
quarter aided by improving construction demand, however this is expected to soften over the rest of the calendar
year. Longer term, Chinese crude steel production is expected to peak between 935 Mt and 985 Mt in the middle of
next decade. Global scrap availability will also increase over time and substitute pig iron as a steel making input.
The iron ore price has trended higher since the conclusion of the Lunar New Year holidays, driven by a rebound in
the Chinese construction sector, region specific output restrictions and the moderation of seaborne supply growth.
The appetite of mills to build iron ore inventories will remain low in the near term due to the availability of port stocks.
In the short to medium term, the cost curve should continue to flatten as new seaborne supply ramps up. In the
future, the marginal producer's cost structure should determine the long-term price.
The recent rise in metallurgical coal prices has been driven by seasonal demand, China's domestic coal capacity
controls and temporary supply disruptions in Queensland. Near term, prices are expected to trend lower as new
projects come online in Australia and Mozambique and more than offset the withdrawal of uneconomic high-cost
seaborne supply. The longer-term outlook remains robust as the supply of premium hard coking coals is projected to
become scarce and demand is driven by steel production growth in emerging markets, particularly India.

To provide clarity into the underlying performance of our operations, Underlying attributable profit and Underlying
EBITDA are set out in the following tables. While we have reported Underlying EBIT as a key non-IFRS measure of
operating results in past periods, we believe focusing on Underlying EBITDA more closely reflects the operating
cash generative capacity and hence the underlying performance of our business.

(i) Displayed as US$ to A$1 based on common convention.
Depreciation, amortisation and impairments
Depreciation, amortisation and impairments declined by US$1.1 billion during the 2016 financial year to US$8.9
billion. This reflects a decline in non-exceptional item impairment charges of US$618 million in the current year. In
addition, depreciation and amortisation charges decreased by US$497 million primarily due to a reduction in the
depreciable asset base at Onshore US resulting from the exceptional item impairment charges previously recorded.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs increased by US$410 million to US$1.0 billion. This reflected higher benchmark interest rates and
the issue of multi-currency hybrid notes during the 2016 financial year, and a gain on the early redemption of the
Petrohawk Energy Corporation Senior Notes in the prior period.
Taxation expense
The Group's adjusted effective tax rate(2), which excludes the influence of exchange rate movements and
exceptional items, was 35.8 per cent (2015: 31.8 per cent). The increase in the 2016 financial year primarily reflects
the relative higher proportion of profit from Australian petroleum assets (which are subject to a higher rate of tax due
to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax) in the Group's overall profit compared to the prior year. The adjusted effective
tax rate is expected to be in the range of approximately 35 to 40 per cent for the 2017 financial year.

(i) Average realised price: crude and condensate oil US$39/bbl (2015: US$68/bbl); US natural gas US$2.16/Mscf

(ii) Other includes: inflation; fuel and energy; asset sales; other items. Other items includes Onshore US rig

Total petroleum production for the 2016 financial year decreased by six per cent to 240 MMboe.
·     Conventional production increased by one per cent to 131 MMboe as new production wells at Atlantis, Mad Dog
and Pyrenees and higher gas demand at Bass Strait, offset natural field decline across the portfolio and the
divestment of our gas business in Pakistan.
·     Onshore US production declined by 13 per cent to 109 MMboe largely as a result of the decision to defer
development activity in the Black Hawk and Hawkville.
Total petroleum production for the 2017 financial year is expected to decrease to between 200 and 210 MMboe.
·     Conventional volumes to decrease to between 123 and 127 MMboe due to the divestment of our gas business in
Pakistan, a planned 35 day maintenance shutdown at Atlantis in the September 2016 quarter, deferral of infill drilling
in the Gulf of Mexico for value and natural field decline.
·     Onshore US volumes to decline to between 77 and 83 MMboe as a result of lower capital expenditure and
development activity as we continue to balance near-term cash flow performance and long-term value maximisation.
The decrease in total petroleum controllable cash costs reflects: a US$365 million reduction in total operating costs;
a US$208 million reduction in exploration expense primarily attributable to the completion of the Trinidad and
Tobago seismic program and higher capitalisation rate of other exploration spend; and a US$104 million decrease
in business development. Conventional unit costs(4) decreased by 30 per cent to US$8.53 per barrel as a result of
lower lifting, labour and maintenance expenses, but is expected to increase to approximately US$10 per barrel in
the 2017 financial year as a result of lower volumes and planned maintenance at Atlantis.
Petroleum capital expenditure for the 2016 financial year declined by 50 per cent to US$2.5 billion. This included
US$1.2 billion of Onshore US drilling and development expenditure, of which US$380 million related to a reduction
in capital creditors. Our Onshore US operated rig count has been reduced to four however completion activity in the
Black Hawk resumed late in the June 2016 quarter.
Increased shale drilling and completions efficiency during the period was reflected in a significant improvement in
drill time and completion techniques in the Black Hawk and Permian. Drilling times improved by 19 per cent to 15
days per well in the Black Hawk and by 22 per cent to 26 days per well in the Permian.

Petroleum capital expenditure of approximately US$1.4 billion is planned in the 2017 financial year. This includes
conventional capital expenditure of US$0.8 billion which is focused on life extension projects at Bass Strait and
North West Shelf. Onshore US capital expenditure is expected to be approximately US$0.6 billion with development
activity tailored to market conditions.

(i) Includes land acquisition, site preparation, drilling, completions, well site facilities, mid-stream infrastructure and
pipelines.
(ii) Can vary between periods based on changes in rig activity and the inventory of wells drilled but not yet
completed at period end (62 net drilled and uncompleted wells at the end of the 2016 financial year).
Petroleum exploration expenditure for the 2016 financial year was US$590 million, of which US$273 million was
expensed. Activity for the period was largely focused on our core areas in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the
Caribbean and the Northern Beagle sub-basin off the coast of Western Australia, where we acquired additional
acreage, seismic data and increased drilling activity. Our exploration activity has increased in the Gulf of Mexico
following the positive exploration well results at Shenzi North. The Group is also encouraged by early indications
from the deepwater Le Clerc well in Trinidad and Tobago which encountered gas in multiple zones. While the focus
is on a commercial oil discovery, these results support further appraisal of the basin. We are pursuing high-quality oil
plays in our three priority basins and a US$700 million exploration program is planned for the 2017 financial year as
we accelerate testing of our future growth opportunities.

Total copper production for the 2016 financial year decreased by eight per cent to 1,580 kt.
·     Escondida production decreased by 20 per cent to 979 kt despite a 28 per cent decline in grades.
·     Pampa Norte production increased by one per cent to 251 kt.
·     Olympic Dam production increased by 63 per cent to 203 kt reflecting improved smelter and mill utilisation
following the Svedala mill outage in the prior period and higher grades.
·     Antamina production increased by 36 per cent to 146 kt due to higher grades and mill throughput.
Total copper production for the 2017 financial year is expected to increase by five per cent to 1.66 Mt.
·     Escondida production to increase by nine per cent to 1,070 kt enabled by the commissioning of the Escondida
Water Supply (EWS) project and the ramp-up of the Los Colorados Extension (LCE) project, with volumes weighted
to the second half of the 2017 financial year.
·     Pampa Norte production to increase with the commissioning of the Spence Recovery Optimisation project which
is expected to ramp-up during the September 2016 quarter and achieve an annualised production rate of
approximately 200kt from the December 2016 quarter.
·     Olympic Dam production to remain broadly unchanged from the 2016 financial year.
·     Antamina production to decrease by 11 per cent to 130 kt as the planned mining sequence moves through lower
copper grades and zones of high zinc content. Zinc production is expected to increase from 55 kt to approximately
90 kt in the 2017 financial year.
We will continue to unlock latent capacity across our copper assets. Following the approval of the US$180 million
(100 per cent basis) LCE project, first production is expected in the second half of the 2017 financial year adding
incremental capacity of approximately 200 ktpa in the 2018 financial year. In the medium term, the Spence Growth
Option has the potential to extend mining operations by more than 50 years and increase copper capacity by
approximately 200 ktpa. Final Board review is expected in the second half of the 2017 calendar year.
Unit cash costs at our operated copper assets increased by nine per cent to US$1.20 per pound during the 2016
financial year due to anticipated grade decline at Escondida. This was six per cent lower than prior guidance of
US$1.27 per pound and was underpinned by a significant reduction in absolute costs. In addition, Olympic Dam unit
cash costs declined by 29 per cent to US$1.38 per pound as a result of productivity-led cost improvements and a
further reduction in labour and contractor costs. In the 2017 financial year unit cash costs at our operated copper
assets are expected to decline by 12 per cent to US$1.05(4) per pound.
Escondida's Underlying EBITDA declined by US$2.3 billion in the 2016 financial year and reflected lower realised
prices and grade-related volume decline. This was partially offset by a US$369 million (US$269 million post tax)
increase in estimated recoverable copper contained in the sulphide leach pad following the successful completion
of the Escondida Bioleach Pad Extension project and productivity initiatives.
Escondida's unit cash costs increased by 11 per cent to US$1.12 per pound. This was seven per cent lower than
guidance due to a significant reduction in absolute costs and productivity initiatives. On a grade-adjusted basis, unit
costs declined by 22 per cent to US$0.79 per pound. In the 2017 financial year, Escondida unit costs are expected
to decline by 11 per cent to US$1.00 per pound(4) largely reflecting higher concentrate throughput as a result of
EWS commissioning and ongoing productivity improvements.

which has been treated as an exceptional item.
Total iron ore production for the 2016 financial year decreased by two per cent to 227 Mt.
·     Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) production increased by two per cent to a record 257 Mt (100 per cent basis),
as the Jimblebar mining hub operated at full capacity and utilisation at the Newman ore handing plant improved.
·     Samarco production was 11 Mt (100 per cent basis). Mining and processing operations remain suspended
following the dam failure. Sales from the final shipment of pellets were settled in the June 2016 quarter.
Total iron ore production for the 2017 financial year is expected to increase to between 228 and 237 Mt, excluding
production from Samarco. WAIO production is forecast to increase to between 265 and 275 Mt (100 per cent basis)
with volumes weighted to the last three quarters of the financial year.
The 24 month rail renewal and maintenance program, which will support the integrated supply chain's long-term
reliability, is progressing on schedule. Along with our focus on productivity and the ramp-up of additional capacity at
the Jimblebar mining hub, this should deliver an increase in system capacity to 290 Mtpa in the 2019 financial year.
The installation of the new primary crusher and additional conveying capacity at Jimblebar is expected to be
completed in the December 2016 quarter, with all associated spend included within WAIO's long-term average
annual sustaining capital expenditure of approximately US$4 per tonne.
WAIO unit cash costs declined by 19 per cent to US$15 per tonne, underpinned by reductions in labour and
contractor costs, increased equipment productivity, lower diesel prices and consumption and a stronger US dollar. In
the 2017 financial year, unit costs are expected to decline a further seven per cent to US$14 per tonne(4).

Metallurgical coal production increased by one per cent to 43 Mt and energy coal production decreased by 16 per
cent to 34 Mt in the 2016 financial year.
·     Record metallurgical coal production at five Queensland Coal mines and first production from the Haju mine in
Indonesia, offset the cessation of production at Crinum and a convergence event at the Broadmeadow mine.
·     Energy coal production declined following the divestment of the San Juan Mine, operational rescheduling at
New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) and unfavourable weather at NSWEC and Cerrejón.
Metallurgical coal production of 44 Mt and energy coal production of 30 Mt(8) is expected for the 2017 financial year.
·     Higher wash-plant and truck utilisation at Queensland Coal will offset the planned divestment of IndoMet Coal.
On 7 June 2016, BHP Billiton entered into an agreement to sell its 75 per cent interest in IndoMet Coal.
·     Productivity improvements at NSWEC will partially offset the divestment of our New Mexico Coal assets, with the
divestment of Navajo Coal completed on 29 July 2016. BHP Billiton will continue to manage Navajo Coal in
accordance with the Mine Management Agreement until 31 December 2016. Excluding New Mexico Coal, energy
coal volumes are expected to increase approximately 10 per cent.
Queensland Coal unit cash costs declined by 15 per cent to US$55 per tonne, supported by increased equipment
and wash-plant utilisation, lower labour and contractor costs, lower diesel prices and a stronger US dollar. In the
2017 financial year, unit costs are expected to decline further to US$52 per tonne(4) reflecting continued productivity
improvements. NSWEC unit costs decreased by two per cent to US$41 per tonne despite lower volumes and are
expected to decline a further seven per cent to US$38 per tonne(4) in the 2017 financial year.

US$35 million (2015: US$101 million) related to Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group and Cerrejón.
Group and unallocated items
Underlying EBITDA expense decreased by US$273 million to US$171 million in the 2016 financial year. The
decrease reflected a US$170 million reduction in corporate overheads, lower operating costs at Nickel West, and a
prior period self-insurance claim related to the mill outage at Olympic Dam of US$238 million. This was partially
offset by weaker average realised prices received by Nickel West.
Corporate overheads have now declined approximately 40 per cent since the 2012 financial year.
Resources and reserves assessment
BHP Billiton is confirming revised resources and reserves estimates for Samarco following the dam failure and will
provide updated information in due course.
The financial information on pages 27 to 46 has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. This news release
including the financial information is unaudited. Variance analysis relates to the relative financial and/or production
performance of BHP Billiton and/or its operations during the 2016 financial year compared with the 2015 financial

The following footnotes apply to this Results Announcement:
(1)   Underlying attributable profit, Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA are used to reflect the underlying
performance of BHP Billiton. We believe that these non-IFRS measures provide useful information, but should not
be considered as an indication of, or as an alternative to, Attributable (loss)/profit as an indicator of actual operating
performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. In past periods we have reported Underlying
EBIT as a key non-IFRS measure of operating results. We believe focusing on Underlying EBITDA more closely
reflects the operating cash generative capacity and hence the underlying performance of our business. Underlying
EBITDA is the key measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our segments and make
decisions on the allocation of resources and is more relevant to capital intensive industries with long-life assets.
·      Underlying attributable profit is Attributable (loss)/profit excluding discontinued operations and any exceptional
items and non-controlling interest in exceptional items.
·      Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation, discontinued operations and any exceptional
items. Underlying EBIT is reported before net finance costs and taxation benefit/(expense) of US$184 million (2015:
US$418 million) related to equity accounted investments and excludes exceptional items of US$1,227 million (2015:
US$ nil) related to share of loss from equity accounted investments.
·      Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT before depreciation, amortisation and impairments of US$8,871 million
for the 2016 financial year (2015: US$9,986 million). Underlying EBITDA is reported before net finance costs and
taxation benefit/(expense), depreciation, amortisation and impairments related to equity accounted investments of
US$476 million (2015: US$786 million) and excludes exceptional items of US$1,227 million (2015: US$ nil) related
to share of loss from equity accounted investments.
(2)   Further non-IFRS measures are defined as follows and comparatives exclude discontinued operations unless
otherwise stated:
·      Adjusted effective tax rate - comprises Total taxation benefit/(expense) excluding exceptional items and
exchange rate movements included in taxation benefit/(expense) divided by (Loss)/profit before taxation and
exceptional items.
·      Net operating assets - represents operating assets net of operating liabilities including the carrying value of
equity accounted investments and predominantly excludes cash balances, loans to associates, interest bearing
liabilities and deferred tax balances. The carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity accounted
method represents the balance of the Group's investment in equity accounted investments, with no adjustment for
any cash balances, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances of the equity accounted investment.
·      Underlying basic earnings per share - represents underlying attributable profit per basic share.
·      Underlying EBITDA margin - comprises Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product EBITDA, divided by
revenue excluding third party product revenue.
Other financial measures are defined as follows:
·      Free cash flow - comprises net operating cash flows less net investing cash flows.
·      Gearing ratio - represents the ratio of net debt to net debt plus net assets.
·      Net debt - comprises Interest bearing liabilities less Cash and cash equivalents for the total operations within the
Group at the reporting date.
(3)   Represents productivity-led volume efficiencies, operating cash cost efficiencies and exploration and business
development savings. Productivity-led volume efficiencies refer to volume increases, excluding volume increases
from major capital projects, multiplied by the prior period Underlying EBITDA margin. Operating cash cost
efficiencies refer to the reduction in costs, excluding the impact of volume, price-linked costs, exchange rates,
inflation, fuel and energy, non-cash costs, one-off items, asset sales, ceased and sold operations and other items.
Exploration and business development savings refers to the reduction in total exploration and business
development costs including capitalised exploration.
(4)   Conventional petroleum unit cash costs exclude inventory movements, freight, and third party and exploration
expense; WAIO, Queensland Coal and NSWEC unit cash costs exclude freight and royalties; Escondida unit cash
costs exclude freight and treatment and refining charges and are net of by-product credits. 2017 financial year unit
cost guidance is based on exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.71 and USD/CLP 698. Escondida grade-adjusted unit
cost is shown on a grade-equivalent basis relative to the 2015 financial year, as grades declined by 28 per cent in
the 2016 financial year. Other forward-looking guidance is based on internal exchange rate assumptions.
(5)   "Cash basis" capital and exploration expenditure represents purchases of property, plant and equipment plus
exploration expenditure from the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. "BHP Billiton share" capital and exploration
expenditure represents the "cash basis", plus BHP Billiton's share of equity accounted investments, less capitalised
deferred stripping and non-controlling interests.
(6)   The 30 June 2015 information in this report has been presented on a continuing operations basis to exclude the
contribution from assets that were demerged with South32, unless otherwise noted. The prior period's contribution of
the South32 assets to the Group's results are disclosed as discontinued operations within the Group's financial
statements.
(7)   Copper equivalent production growth based on 2016 financial year average realised prices.
(8)   Energy Coal guidance excludes production from the Navajo Coal mine.
Forward-looking statements
This release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding: trends in commodity prices and
currency exchange rates; demand for commodities; plans, strategies and objectives of management; closure or
divestment of certain operations or facilities (including associated costs); anticipated production or construction
commencement dates; capital costs and scheduling; operating costs and shortages of materials and skilled
employees; anticipated productive lives of projects, mines and facilities; provisions and contingent liabilities; tax and
regulatory developments.
Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as 'intend', 'aim', 'project', 'anticipate',
'estimate', 'plan', 'believe', 'expect', 'may', 'should', 'will', 'continue', 'annualised' or similar words. These statements
discuss future expectations concerning the results of operations or financial condition, or provide other forward-
looking statements.
These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. Readers are cautioned
not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.
For example, our future revenues from our operations, projects or mines described in this release will be based, in
part, upon the market price of the minerals, metals or petroleum produced, which may vary significantly from current
levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a
particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing operations.
Other factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, costs or production output
and anticipated lives of operations, mines or facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the
minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on
the market prices of the minerals, petroleum or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in some of
the countries where we are exploring or developing these projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes,
changes in environmental and other regulations and political uncertainty; labour unrest; and other factors identified
in the risk factors discussed in BHP Billiton's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
(including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F) which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, the Group does not undertake any obligation to publicly
update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events.
Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.
Non-IFRS financial information
BHP Billiton results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) including Underlying
EBIT and Underlying EBITDA which are used to measure segment performance. This release may also include
certain non-IFRS and other financial measures including Adjusted effective tax rate, Free cash flow, Gearing ratio,
Net debt, Net operating assets, Underlying attributable profit, Underlying basic (loss)/earnings per share, Underlying
EBIT margin and Underlying EBITDA margin. These measures are used internally by management to assess the
performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of our resources and assess operational
management. Non-IFRS and other financial measures have not been subject to audit or review and should not be
considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity.
No offer of securities
Nothing in this release should be construed as either an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell BHP
Billiton securities in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a recommendation or advice by BHP Billiton.

have not been independently verified. No representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy, completeness or
reliability of the information. This release should not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by BHP

Notes to the Financial Information

The financial information included in this document for the year ended 30 June 2016 is unaudited and has been
derived from the draft financial report of the BHP Billiton Group for the year ended 30 June 2016. The financial
information does not constitute the Group's full statutory accounts for the year ended 30 June 2016, which will be
approved by the Board, reported on by the auditors, and subsequently filed with the UK Registrar of Companies and
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
The financial information set out on pages 27 to 46 for the year ended 30 June 2016 has been prepared on the basis
of accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2015 financial
statements contained within the Annual Report of the BHP Billiton Group.
The comparative figures for the financial years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 are not the statutory accounts
of the BHP Billiton Group for those financial years. Those accounts have been reported on by the company's auditor
and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The reports of the auditor were (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a
reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the reports and
(iii) did not contain a statement under Section 498(2) or (3) of the UK Companies Act 2006.
All amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated. The BHP Billiton Group's presentation currency
and the functional currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the principal currency of the
economic environment in which it operates. Amounts in this financial information have, unless otherwise indicated,
been rounded to the nearest million dollars.

Notes to the Financial Information
1. Segment reporting
The Group operated four reportable segments during FY2016 aligned with the commodities that we extract and
market, reflecting the structure used by the Group's management to assess the performance of the Group:
Reportable segmentPrincipal activities
Petroleum
Copper
Iron Ore
Coal
Exploration, development and production of oil and gas
Mining of copper, silver, lead, zinc, molybdenum, uranium and gold
Mining of iron ore
Mining of metallurgical coal and thermal (energy) coal
The segment reporting information for comparative periods has been presented on a continuing operations basis to
exclude the contribution from assets that were demerged with South32.
Group and unallocated items includes Functions, other unallocated operations including Potash (previously
disclosed in the former Petroleum and Potash reportable segment), Nickel West and consolidation adjustments.
Comparative information for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 have been restated for the effects of
the change in the reporting related to Potash. Revenue not attributable to reportable segments also comprises the
sale of freight and fuel to third parties. Exploration and technology activities are recognised within relevant
segments.

(a) Underlying EBIT is earnings before net finance costs, taxation, discontinued operations and any exceptional
items. Underlying EBIT is reported before net finance costs and taxation benefits/(expense) related to equity
accounted investments and excludes exceptional items related to equity accounted investments. Underlying
EBITDA is Underlying EBIT before depreciation, amortisation and impairments.
(b) Total segment assets and liabilities of each commodity represents operating assets net of operating liabilities
including the carrying amount of equity accounted investments and predominantly excludes cash balances, loans to
associates, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances. The carrying value of investments accounted for
using the equity method represents the balance of the Group's investment in equity accounted investments, with no
adjustment for any cash balances, interest bearing liabilities and deferred tax balances of the equity accounted
investment.
2. Exceptional items

Samarco Mineração SA (Samarco) dam failure
The exceptional loss of US$2,450 million (before tax) related to the Samarco dam failure in November 2015
comprises the following:
Year ended 30 June 2016
Share of loss relating to the Samarco dam failure
Impairment of the carrying value of the investment in Samarco

(a) BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda has adjusted its investment in Samarco to US$ nil (resulting from US$(655) million share
of loss from Samarco and US$(525) million impairment), recognised a provision of US$(1,200) million for potential
obligations under the Framework Agreement and together with other BHP Billiton entities incurred US$(70) million
of direct costs in relation to the Samarco dam failure. US$(572) million of the US$(1,200) million provision
represents an additional share of loss from Samarco with the remaining US$(628) million recognised as provision
expense. Refer to note 7 Significant events for further information.
Impairment of Onshore US assets
The Group recognised an impairment charge of US$4.9 billion (after tax benefit) against the carrying value of its
Onshore US assets in the year ended 30 June 2016. The impairment reflects changes to price assumptions,
discount rates and development plans. This follows significant volatility and much weaker prices experienced in the
oil and gas industry which have more than offset our substantial productivity improvements.
Global taxation matters
Global tax matters include amounts provided for unresolved tax matters and other claims for which the timing of
resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain.

(a) The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the
aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc
outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton Employee Share
Ownership Plan Trust and the BHP Billiton Employee Equity Trust.
(b) The conversion of options and share rights would decrease the loss per share for the year ended 30 June 2016
and therefore its impact has been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation (2015: 160,116
antidilutive shares; 2014: 183,181 antidilutive shares).

of 15 million of dilutive securities has been taken into account for the year ended 30 June 2015 and 17 million
shares for the year ended 30 June 2014. The Group's only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards
granted under employee share ownership plans.
(c) Each American Depositary Share represents twice the earnings for BHP Billiton ordinary shares.

(a) 5.5 per cent dividend on 50,000 preference shares of £1 each determined and paid annually (30 June 2015: 5.5
per cent; 30 June 2014: 5.5 per cent).
The Dual Listed Company merger terms require that ordinary shareholders of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton
Plc are paid equal cash dividends on a per share basis. Each American Depositary Share (ADS) represents two
ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc. Dividends determined on each ADS represent twice the
dividend determined on BHP Billiton ordinary shares.
Dividends are determined after period-end in the announcement of the results for the period. Interim dividends are
determined in February and paid in March. Final dividends are determined in August and paid in September.
Dividends determined are not recorded as a liability at the end of the period to which they relate. Subsequent to
year-end, on 16 August 2016 BHP Billiton determined a final dividend of 14.0 US cents per share (US$746 million),
which will be paid on 20 September 2016 (30 June 2015: final dividend of 62.0 US cents per share - US$3,301
million, 30 June 2014: final dividend of 62.0 US cents per share - US$3,301 million).
BHP Billiton Limited dividends for all periods presented are, or will be, fully franked based on a tax rate of 30 per
cent.

7. Significant events - Samarco dam failure
On 5 November 2015, the Samarco Mineração S.A (Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil,
experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings, flooding the community of Bento
Rodrigues and impacting other communities downstream (the Samarco dam failure). Refer to pages 2 and 3 for
further details.
Samarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Limitada (BHP Billiton Brasil) and Vale S.A (Vale). BHP Billiton
Brasil's 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Billiton Brasil
does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead records the
investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Billiton Brasil recognises its 50 per cent share of
Samarco's profit or loss and adjusts the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment
continues until the investment carrying value is reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses
only recognised to the extent that BHP Billiton Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses, or when future investment
funding is provided. After applying equity accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for
impairment.
Any charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Billiton Brasil or other BHP Billiton entities
are recognised 100 per cent in the Group's results.
The financial impacts of the Samarco dam failure on the Group's income statement, balance sheet and cash flow
statement for the year ended 30 June 2016 are shown in the table below and have been treated as an exceptional
item. The table below does not include BHP Billiton Brasil's share of the results of Samarco prior to the Samarco
dam failure, which is disclosed in the note 3 Interests in associates and joint venture entities, along with the
summary financial information related to Samarco as at 30 June 2016.

(a) BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda has adjusted its investment in Samarco to US$ nil (resulting from US$(655) million share
of loss from Samarco and US$(525) million impairment) and recognised a provision of US$(1,200) million for
potential obligations under the Agreement (defined on page 41). US$(572) million of the US$(1,200) million
provision represents an additional share of loss from Samarco with the remaining US$(628) million recognised as
provision expense.
(b) As the investment carrying value has been adjusted to US$ nil, additional share of Samarco losses (US$572
million) and Samarco dam failure provision expense (US$628 million) are included in the provision for Samarco
dam failure. This reflects BHP Billiton Brasil's US$1,200 million potential legal funding obligation to the Foundation
as a result of the Agreement.
(c) Samarco currently does not have profits available for distribution and is legally prevented from paying previously
declared and unpaid dividends.
At the half year ended 31 December 2015, the Group assessed the recoverability of its investment in light of
uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of ongoing future operations. As a result, an impairment charge of
US$525 million was recognised, reducing the investment balance to US$ nil.
As described below, the Group has recognised a provision of US$1.2 billion at 30 June 2016 in respect of BHP
Billiton Brasil's potential obligation under the Agreement (defined on page 41). This reflects the ongoing uncertainty
surrounding the nature and timing of a potential restart of Samarco's operations. In doing so, the Group has
recognised BHP Billiton Brasil's share of all losses recognised by Samarco to 30 June 2016.

Dam failure provisions and contingencies
As at 30 June 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil has identified provisions and contingent liabilities arising as a consequence
of the Samarco dam failure as follows:
Environment and socio-economic remediation
Framework Agreement
On 2 March 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil, together with Samarco and Vale, entered into a Framework Agreement
(Agreement) with the Federal Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain
other public authorities to establish a Foundation that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic
programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. On 5 May 2016,
the Agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Appeal suspending the public civil claim disclosed below.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office appealed the ratification of the Agreement and on 30 June 2016, the Superior Court
of Justice in Brazil issued an interim order (Interim Order) suspending the 5 May 2016 ratification of the Agreement.
Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil have appealed the Interim Order before the Superior Court of Justice.
The term of the Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the
Agreement have been performed. Under the Agreement, Samarco is responsible for funding the Foundation with
calendar year contributions as follows:
·     R$2 billion (approximately US$620 million) in 2016, less the amount of funds already spent on, or allocated to,
remediation and compensation activity;
·     R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2017;
·     R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2018; and
·     R$500 million (approximately US$155 million) for a special project to be spent on sewage treatment and landfill
works from 2016 to 2018.
Annual contributions for each of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 will be in the range of R$800 million (approximately
US$250 million) and R$1.6 billion (approximately US$500 million), depending on the remediation and
compensation projects which are to be undertaken in the particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed
under the Agreement. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Agreement, each
of Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil has potential funding obligations under the Agreement in proportion to its 50 per cent
shareholding in Samarco.
Mining and processing operations remain suspended following the dam failure. Samarco is currently progressing
plans to resume operations, however significant uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of ongoing future
operations remain. In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Billiton Brasil
has recognised a provision of US$1.2 billion before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2016, in respect of its
potential obligations under the Agreement.
The measurement of the provision requires the use of estimates and assumptions and may be affected by, amongst
other factors, potential changes in scope of work required under the Agreement including further technical analysis,
costs incurred in respect of programs delivered, resolution of uncertainty in respect of operational restart, updates to
discount and foreign exchange rates, resolution of existing and potential legal claims and the status of the
Agreement. As a result, future actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to
key assumptions and estimates could result in a material impact to the amount of the provision in future reporting
periods.
On 28 July 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil approved US$134 million to support the Foundation, in the event that Samarco
does not meet its funding obligations under the Agreement. Any support to the Foundation provided by BHP Billiton
Brasil will be offset against the provision for the Samarco dam failure recognised at 30 June 2016.
Legal
The following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities:
BHP Billiton Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by
individuals, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian federal
and state courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale and Samarco. The lawsuits
include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other
laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including rehabilitation costs, compensation to
injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and
injunctive relief. These legal proceedings include civil public actions filed by state prosecutors in Minas Gerais
(claiming damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$2.3 billion), public defenders in Minas Gerais (claiming
damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$3.1 billion) and state prosecutors in Espírito Santo (claiming damages
of approximately R$2 billion, US$620 million). Given the preliminary status of all these proceedings, and the
duplicative nature of the damages sought in these proceedings and the R$20 billion (US$6.2 billion) and R$155
billion (US$48 billion) claims noted below, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a
reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil.
In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by
numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.
Public civil claim
Among the claims brought against BHP Billiton Brasil, is a public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government
of Brazil, States of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and other public authorities on 30 November 2015, seeking the
establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately US$6.2 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and
damages.
On 2 March 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil, together with Samarco and Vale, entered into the Agreement. Ratification of
the Agreement by the Federal Court of Appeal on 5 May 2016 suspended this public civil claim. However, it was
reinstated on 30 June 2016 upon issue of the Interim Order by the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil. As noted
above, BHP Billiton Brasil has recognised a provision as of 30 June 2016 of US$1.2 billion after tax and discounting
in respect of its potential obligations under the Agreement. While an appeal has been commenced against the
Interim Order, given the status of the appeal it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or
a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil in relation to the R$20 billion (approximately
US$6.2 billion) claim.
Federal Public Prosecution Office claim
BHP Billiton Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3
May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$48 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in
relation to the Samarco dam failure. Given the preliminary status of these proceedings, it is not possible at this time
to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP Billiton Brasil.
Class action complaint
In February 2016, a putative class action complaint (Complaint) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York on behalf of purchasers of American Depository Receipts of BHP Billiton Ltd and Plc between
25 September 2014 and 30 November 2015 against BHP Billiton Ltd and Plc and certain of its current and former
executive officers and directors. The Complaint asserts claims under U.S. federal securities laws and indicates that
the plaintiff will seek certification to proceed as a class action.
The amount of damages sought by the plaintiff on behalf of the putative class is unspecified. Given the preliminary
status of this matter, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of
potential future exposures to BHP Billiton.
Other claims
Additional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure may be brought against BHP
Billiton Brasil and possibly other BHP Billiton entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.
BHP Billiton's potential liabilities, if any, resulting from other pending and future claims, lawsuits and enforcement
actions relating to the Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies sought in the
various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this time and therefore a provision has not been recognised
and nor has any contingent liability been quantified for such matters.
Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP
Billiton's business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.
BHP Billiton Insurance
BHP Billiton has third party liability insurance for claims related to the Samarco dam failure made directly against
BHP Billiton Brasil or other BHP Billiton entities. Such claims may be externally insured up to US$360 million (when
adjusted for BHP Billiton Brasil's interest in Samarco). External insurers have been advised of the Samarco dam
failure although no formal claim has currently been made under the policy. At 30 June 2016 an insurance receivable
has not been recognised for any potential recoveries under insurance arrangements.
Commitments
Under the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Billiton Brasil does not have an existing obligation to
fund Samarco.
On 28 July 2016, BHP Billiton Brasil made available a short-term facility to Samarco of up to US$116 million to carry
out remediation and stabilisation work and support Samarco's operations. Funds will be released to Samarco only
as required and subject to the achievement of key milestones.
Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision, accounted
for at that time.
The following section includes disclosure required by IFRS of Samarco Mineração SA's provisions, contingencies
and other matters arising from the dam failure.
Samarco
Dam failure related provisions and contingencies
As at 30 June 2016 Samarco has identified provisions and contingent liabilities arising as a consequence of the
Samarco dam failure as follows:
Environment and socio-economic remediation
Framework Agreement
On 2 March 2016, Samarco, together with Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil, entered into a Framework Agreement
(Agreement) with the Federal Attorney General of Brazil, the States of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain
other public authorities to establish a Foundation that will develop and execute environmental and socio-economic
programs to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure. On 5 May 2016,
the Agreement was ratified by the Federal Court of Appeal suspending the public civil claim disclosed below.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office appealed the ratification of the Agreement and on 30 June 2016, the Superior Court
of Justice in Brazil issued an interim order (Interim Order) suspending the 5 May 2016 ratification of the Agreement.
Samarco, Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil have appealed the Interim Order before the Superior Court of Justice.
The term of the Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the
Agreement have been performed. Under the Agreement, Samarco is responsible for funding the Foundation with
calendar year contributions as follows:
·     R$2 billion (approximately US$620 million) in 2016, less the amount of funds already spent on, or allocated to,
remediation and compensation activity;
·     R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2017;
·     R$1.2 billion (approximately US$370 million) in 2018; and
·     R$500 million (approximately US$155 million) for a special project to be spent on sewage treatment and landfill
works from 2016 to 2018.
Annual contributions for each of the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 will be in the range of R$800 million (approximately
US$250 million) and R$1.6 billion (approximately US$500 million), depending on the remediation and
compensation projects which are to be undertaken in the particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed
under the Agreement.
As at 30 June 2016, Samarco has a provision of US$2.4 billion before tax and after discounting, in relation to its
obligations under the Agreement based on currently available information. The measurement of the provision
requires the use of estimates and assumptions and may be affected by, amongst other factors, potential changes in
scope of work required under the Agreement including further technical analysis, costs incurred in respect of
programs delivered, resolution of uncertainty in respect of operational restart, updates to discount and foreign
exchange rates, resolution of existing and potential legal claims and the status of the Agreement. As a result, future
actual expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to key assumptions and estimates
could result in a material impact to the amount of the provision in future reporting periods.
Other
As at 30 June 2016, Samarco has recognised provisions of US$172 million, in addition to its obligations under the
Agreement, based on currently available information. The magnitude, scope and timing of these additional costs are
subject to a high degree of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated that it anticipates that it will incur future costs
beyond those provided. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a significant period and changes to key
assumptions could result in a material change to the amount of the provision in future reporting periods. Any such
unrecognised obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their
magnitude or possible timing of payment. Accordingly, it is also not possible to provide a range of possible
outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures at this time.
Legal
Samarco has been named as defendant in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, NGOs,
corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian federal and state courts following the Samarco dam failure.
These lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian
environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies, including rehabilitation
costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses,
moral damages and injunctive relief. These legal proceedings include civil public actions filed by state prosecutors
in Minas Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$7.5 billion, US$2.3 billion), public defenders in Minas
Gerais (claiming damages of approximately R$10 billion, US$3.1 billion), and state prosecutors in Espírito Santo
(claiming damages of approximately R$2 billion, US$620 million). Given the preliminary status of all these
proceedings, and the duplicative nature of the damages sought in these proceedings and the R$20 billion (US$6.2
billion) and R$155 billion (US$48 billion) claims noted below, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of
possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco.
In addition, government investigations of the Samarco dam failure by numerous agencies of the Brazilian
government have commenced and are ongoing.
Public civil claim
Among the claims brought against Samarco, is a public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil,
States of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais and other public authorities on 30 November 2015, seeking the establishment
of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately US$6.2 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages.
On 2 March 2016, Samarco, together with Vale and BHP Billiton Brasil, entered into the Agreement. Ratification of
the Agreement by the Federal Court of Appeal on 5 May 2016 suspended this public civil claim. However, it was
reinstated on 30 June 2016 upon issue of the Interim Order by the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil. As noted
above, Samarco has recognised a provision as of 30 June 2016 of US$2.4 billion before tax and discounting in
respect of its potential obligations under the Agreement. While an appeal has been commenced against the Interim
Order, given the status of the appeal it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a
reliable estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco in relation to the R$20 billion (approximately US$6.2
billion) claim.
Federal Public Prosecution Office claim
Samarco is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May
2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$48 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in
relation to the Samarco dam failure. Given the preliminary status of these proceedings, it is not possible at this time
to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for Samarco.
Other claims
Other pending lawsuits and investigations are at the early stages of proceedings. Until further facts are developed;
court rulings clarify the issues in dispute, liability and damages; trial activity nears, or other actions such as possible
settlements occur, it is not possible to arrive at a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of Samarco's obligations
arising from these matters and therefore Samarco has not recognised a provision or quantified a contingent liability.
Additional claims may be brought against Samarco. A provision has not been made by Samarco for claims yet to be
filed. Given the significant uncertainties surrounding possible outcomes it is not possible for Samarco to arrive at a
range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of the liability for any unfiled claims.
Samarco Insurance
Samarco has standalone insurance policies in place with Brazilian and global insurers. Samarco has notified
insurers including those covering property, project and liability risks. Insurers have appointed loss adjusters or
claims representatives to investigate and assist with the claims process. The respective adjustment processes for
these policies continues. An insurance receivable has not been recognised by Samarco for any recoveries under
insurance arrangements at 30 June 2016.
Samarco non-dam failure related contingent liabilities
The following non-dam failure related contingent liabilities pre-date and are unrelated to the Samarco dam failure.
Samarco is currently contesting both of these matters in the Brazilian courts. Given the status of the proceedings, the
timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain. BHP Billiton entities have no legal obligation
related to these matters.
Brazilian Social Contribution Levy
Samarco has received tax assessments for the alleged non-payment of Brazilian Social Contribution Levy for the
calendar years 2008 to 2014 totalling approximately R$3.9 billion (approximately US$1.2 billion).
Brazilian corporate income tax rate
Samarco has received tax assessments for alleged incorrect calculation of Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ) in respect
of the 2000 to 2002 and 2007 to 2014 income years totalling approximately R$3.3 billion (approximately US$1.0
billion).
8. Subsequent events
As announced on 11 August 2016, the Group has agreed with the New South Wales Government to cease
progression of the Caroona Coal Project and will receive A$220 million (approximately US$170 million) due to
cancellation of the related exploration licence.
Other than the matters outlined above or elsewhere in this financial information, no matters or circumstances have
arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the operations,
results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods.
