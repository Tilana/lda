stock and determine its rights and
preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on 
specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility
in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate 
purposes, could
make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company, or 
could adversely affect the rights of the Company&#146;s common stockholders by 
restricting dividends on the Common Stock, diluting the voting power of the 
Common Stock,
impairing the liquidation rights of the Common Stock or delaying or preventing a
change in control without further action by the stockholders. As a result of 
these and other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse 
impact on
the market price of the Common Stock. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and 
stability in the
composition of the Board of Directors and that could make it more difficult to 
acquire control of the Company by means of a tender offer, open market 
purchases, a proxy contest or otherwise. The Company expects that these 
provisions, which are
summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate 
takeover bids. These provisions also are designed to encourage persons seeking 
to acquire control of the Company to first negotiate with the Board of 
Directors, which the
Company believes may result in an improvement of the terms of any such 
acquisition in favor of the Company&#146;s stockholders. However, they also give
the Board of Directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some 
stockholders may favor. A
description of these provisions is set forth below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-

by the Secretary at the request in writing of stockholders holding shares 
representing at least 20% of the voting power of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote on the
matter for which such meeting is to be called. The holders of a majority of the

which such meeting is called. </P>

of Common Stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval. 
The
Company may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes, 
including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporation 
acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but 
unissued shares of
common stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain 
control of the Company by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or 
otherwise. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

fullest extent that the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware, as the 
same
exists or may be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability
of directors, no person who is or was a director of the Company will be 
personally liable to the Company or any of its stockholders for monetary damages
for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt;
font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, with certain
exceptions, the Bylaws require that the Company indemnify its directors and 
officers to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law and that the Company 
pay such expenses in advance. The Company also expects to maintain 
directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance. The Company believes 
that these indemnifications
provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors 
and executive officers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-

indemnification
provisions in the Company&#146;s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may 
discourage stockholders from bringing&nbsp;a lawsuit against directors for 
breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may have the effect of reducing
the likelihood
of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such 
action, if successful, might otherwise benefit the Company and its stockholders.

limitation, copies of minutes of
meetings or written consents of the full Board) given to the members of the

the same time such materials and information are furnished to such members of 
the Board, and
(iii) provide the Board Observer with all rights to attend (whether in person or
by telephone or other means of electronic communication as reasonably requested 
by the Board Observer) such meetings as a member of the Board.&nbsp;The Board 
Observer
shall agree to maintain the confidentiality of all information, whether written 
or oral, and proceedings of the Board and to enter into, comply with, and be 
bound by, in all respects, the terms and conditions of a confidentiality 
agreement,
substantially in the form attached hereto as <U>Annex A</U> (the 
&#147;<U>Confidentiality Agreement</U>&#148;); <I>provided, however</I>, upon
request from a Holder or such Holder&#146;s Affiliates, the Board Observer shall
provide, on a
confidential basis, such non-public material and information to such Holder and 
their Affiliates; <I>provided</I> that such Holder and their Affiliates have 
agreed to comply with and be bound by, in all respects, the Confidentiality
Agreement.&nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, the recipient of such confidential 
information from the Board Observer (whether a Holder or a Holder Affiliate) may
further provide such information to (i) any other Holder or Holder Affiliate and
(ii) any
legal counsel that has been engaged by such recipient to discuss such matters or
information; <I>provided</I>, that any such recipient in clause (i) agrees and 
acknowledges in writing that they are bound by the provisions of the 
Confidentiality
Agreement.&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;<U>Affiliates</U>&#148; 
shall mean any affiliate, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Notwithstanding any rights to be granted or provided to
the Board
Observer hereunder, the Company reserves the right to exclude the Board Observer
from access to any material or meeting or portion thereof if the Board 
reasonably determines, in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, that such 
access would (A)
adversely affect the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its 
counsel, (B) serve to waive the work product doctrine or any other similarly 
protective privilege or doctrine or (C) result in a conflict of interest between
the Company and
any Holder; <U>provided,</U> <U>however</U>, that (i) such exclusion shall be 
limited to the portion of the material and/or meeting that is the basis for such
exclusion and shall not extend to any portion of the material and/or meeting 
that does not
involve or pertain to such exclusion and (ii) the Company shall provide written 
notice, which such written notice may be provided by e-mail, to a Board Observer
at any time that the Board Observer is to be excluded from access to any 
material or
meeting or portion thereof and the basis for such exclusion, which notice will 
be provided reasonably in advance of such exclusion to the extent practicable, 
and if such exclusion is based on a conflict of interest with one or more but 
less than all
Holders then the Company will use good faith efforts to provide such access or 
information to those Holders (or a single alternative designee thereof) with 
whom such conflict of interest does not exist. </P>
