<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 10/12, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory 
Committee to undertake a study on discrimination in the context of the right to food, 
including identification of good practices of anti-discriminatory policies and strategies, and 
to report on it to the thirteenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. At its first session, the Advisory Committee established a drafting group on the right 
to food, consisting of Jos&#233; Bengoa Cabello, Chinsung Chung, Latif H&#252;seynov, Jean Ziegler 
and Mona Zulficar. Two preliminary background papers entitled &#8220;The tragedy of Noma&#8221; 
(A/HRC/AC/3/CRP.3) and &#8220;Peasant farmers and the right to food: a history of 
discrimination and exploitation&#8221; (A/HRC/AC/3/CRP.5) were presented during the third 
session of the Committee. Taking into account the discussion during the Committee&#8217;s 
session, the drafting group decided upon a conceptual framework of the study, which was 
presented in the plenary. In its recommendation 3/4, the Advisory Committee assigned the 
preparation of the study to the drafting group and requested that a preliminary report be 
presented to the Committee at its fourth session. The present study on discrimination in the 
context of the right to food is the outcome of that process. 
</p>
<p>3. In this introduction, it is necessary to present the international legal framework 
concerning the right to food and non-discrimination.  
</p>
<p>4. The right to food is a human right that protects the right of all human beings to live 
in dignity, free from hunger. It is protected under international humanitarian law and human 
rights, including in the ICESCR (art. 11), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) (art. 12) and the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child (CRC) (arts. 24 and 27). As defined by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights in its general comment No.12 (1999), the right to adequate food is realized 
when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, has physical and 
economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement. Inspired by this 
definition, the right to food has been defined as: 
</p>
<p>the right to have regular, permanent and unrestricted access, either directly or by 
means of financial purchases, to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and 
sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the 
consumer belongs, and which ensures a physical and mental, individual and 
collective, fulfilling and dignified life free of fear (A/HRC/7/5, par. 17). 
</p>
<p>5. The right to food is, above all, the right to be able to feed oneself in dignity. It 
includes the rights of vulnerable and discriminated groups to have access to land, small-
scale irrigation and seeds, credit, technology and local and regional markets in rural areas, 
to traditional fishing areas, to a sufficient income and to social security and social 
assistance to enable a person to live in dignity.  
</p>
<p>6. Under international law, Governments are bound to respect, protect and fulfil the 
right to food. These three levels of obligations were defined by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comment No.12, and endorsed by 
consensus by the States, when the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) adopted the Right to Food Guidelines in November 2004.  
</p>
<p>7. The principle of non-discrimination is a cardinal principle of international law. It has 
been enshrined in identical provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. According 
to article 2, paragraph 2, of the latter covenant, each State party is obliged to guarantee that 
the rights enunciated in the present Covenant are exercised without discrimination of any </p>


<p>kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status. In article 14(2) of the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), States agreed to take measures 
&#8220;to eliminate discrimination against women in rural areas in order to ensure, on a basis of 
equality of men and women, that they participate in and benefit from rural development 
and, in particular, shall ensure to such women the right: [...] to enjoy adequate living 
conditions, particularly in relation to housing, sanitation, electricity and water supply, 
transport and communications.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>8. In its general comment No.20, on non-discrimination in economic, social and 
cultural rights, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights defined 
discrimination as any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential 
treatment that is directly or indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination and 
which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or 
exercise, on an equal footing, of Covenant rights (para. 7). 
</p>
<p>9. The Committee insisted on the obligation for State parties to eliminate all 
discrimination, both formally and substantively. For the Committee, eliminating formal 
discrimination requires ensuring that a State&#8217;s constitution, laws and policy documents do 
not discriminate on prohibited grounds; for example, laws should not deny equal social 
security benefits to women on the basis of their marital status. In the context of the right to 
food, it obliges States to revise their legislation, in particular laws dealing with access to 
food, social assistance or productive resources, to ensure that they do not include any 
discriminatory provision (see general comment No.12, para. 18). 
</p>
<p>10. Merely addressing formal discrimination will not ensure substantive equality as 
envisaged and defined by article 2(2). The effective enjoyment of Covenant rights is often 
influenced by whether a person is a member of a group characterized by the prohibited 
grounds of discrimination. Eliminating discrimination in practice requires paying sufficient 
attention to groups of individuals who suffer historical or persistent prejudice instead of 
merely comparing the formal treatment of individuals in similar situations. States parties 
must therefore immediately take the necessary measures to prevent, diminish and eliminate 
the conditions and attitudes that cause or perpetuate substantive or de facto discrimination; 
for example, ensuring that all individuals have equal access to adequate food and to the 
means of its procurement, including women and girl children and persons living in informal 
settlements and rural areas.  
</p>
<p>11. The present study on discrimination in the context of the right to food has three main 
parts. The first part will present examples of discrimination in the context of the right to 
food, including discrimination in terms of legislation, inequalities between regions and 
discrimination against the most marginalized and vulnerable groups. The second part will 
focus on anti-discriminatory policies and strategies, which are or could be pursued in order 
to address discrimination. The last part addresses good practices that are currently being 
implemented by States and other actors to address discrimination and inequalities.  </p>


<p><b> II. Discrimination in the context of the right to food  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination in terms of region, markets, prices, subsidies, resources 
and infrastructure services 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Regional inequalities and the increasing marginalization of the most vulnerable 
groups 
</b></p>
<p>12. There is little, if any, improvement in the situation of the poorest regions of the 
world in terms of poverty and hunger reduction. Overall, prior to the economic and food 
crisis, the number of people in developing regions living in extreme poverty &#8211; on less then 
$1.25 a day at 2005 prices &#8211; decreased from 1.8 billion in 1990 to 1.4 billion in 2005. Once 
the data have been disaggregated on regions, this encouraging development reveals less 
ground for optimism. The decline in the number of people living in extreme poverty is 
largely attributable to China.1 More than half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa 
remains below the poverty line. Similarly, Southern Asia, while registering certain 
progress, still has 39 per cent of its population living in extreme poverty.2  
</p>
<p>13. An infamous record was broken in 2009: more than 1 billion people were 
undernourished worldwide.3 According to FAO, the Asia and Pacific region had the largest 
number of hungry people (642 million), followed by sub-Saharan Africa (264 million). The 
latter has the largest prevalence of undernourishment relative to its population size (32 per 
cent).4 As an effect of the escalating food prices, four regions of the world have seen 
percentage increases in undernourishment in relation to 2004-2006, namely sub-Saharan 
Africa, Oceania, Southern Asia (India excluded) and Eastern Asia.5 
</p>
<p>14. In addition to the food and financial crises, the environmental crisis should not be 
forgotten. Climate change is expected to affect the poorest regions with the highest level of 
chronic hunger worst.6 It is asserted that climate change and biofuels development will 
affect the four dimensions of food security: availability, accessibility, stability and 
utilization, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.7  
</p>
<p>15. Existing inequalities between the world&#8217;s regions and the vulnerability of the poorest 
members of developing countries should therefore continue to deepen as a result of three 
concomitant crises: the food crisis, the economic crisis and the environmental crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Markets, prices, resources and infrastructures services 
</b></p>
<p>16. According to the market economy model, higher food prices should represent an 
incentive for farmers, including those from the developed world, and trigger an increase in 
production. In reality, however, the developing world increased cereal production by less 
than 1 percent in 2008 and production actually decreased in most developing countries.8

<p>17. As FAO and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) point out 
in recent studies, reality challenges the market economy theory and its rule of supply and 
demand.9 Higher output prices are not sufficient to trigger an expansion in food supplies. 
Smallholders, the majority of farmers in developing countries, have limited market 
participation. Recent decades of structural adjustment policies and declining investment in 
agriculture have resulted in a lack of access to resources &#8211; modern agricultural inputs and 
credit, poor marketing and transport infrastructure, rudimentary technology, ineffective 
rural services and institutions, which pose serious limitations to market participation of 
small farms. In addition, while higher food prices do not trickle down to the farm gate 
where smallholders have often to sell their products, higher input costs do. Those that reap 
the benefits of higher food prices are large commercial farmers in developed and food-
exporting countries.10 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The role of agricultural trade, subsidies and international companies in the context of 
the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>18. It is becoming increasing clear that the current international trade regime favours 
developed countries and creates disadvantages for developing States, particularly in the 
agriculture sector. A report of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development, for example, &#8220;asserts that small-scale farmers 
and rural livelihoods are negatively affected by agricultural trade and that the poorest 
developing countries are net losers under most trade liberalization scenarios.11  
</p>
<p>19. It is also generally accepted that subsidies granted to farmers in the industrialized 
world play an important role in this context. Support to producers in the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2008 was estimated at EUR 
182 billion, equivalent to 21 per cent of aggregate gross receipts of OECD farm 
producers.12 Subsidized food and agriculture products arrive on the markets of developing 
states as cheap imports with which local products cannot compete. As a consequence of 
dumping practices, smallholders have less income and fewer resources to buy seeds and 
fertilizers, which in turn affects their agricultural production, and consequently their 
livelihood. Subsidies also produce long-term sectorial distortions in developing countries. 
Given the availability of cheap subsidized products obtainable through trade, there is a 
general disincentive to invest in agriculture. Undeniably, the past 30 years have witnessed 
serious under-investment in the agricultural sector of developing countries because of the 
growing perception of the unprofitability of agriculture.13  
</p>
<p>20. Linked to the serious human rights challenges posed by dumping practices is the 
market domination of a few large transnational corporations. Already in 2004, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to food warned about the high concentration of control by few 
multinational firms in all sectors of the food chain: production, trade, processing, 
marketing, retail (E/CN.4/2004/10).

<p><b> B. Discrimination against peasants 
</b></p>
<p>21. Hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, and among the rural 
population it is the peasant farmers, small landholders, landless workers, fisherfolk, hunters 
and gatherers who suffer disproportionately. The United Nations Millennium Development 
Project Task Force on Hunger has shown that 80 percent of the world&#8217;s hungry live in rural 
areas.14 Some 50 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry are smallholder farmers who depend 
mainly or partly on agriculture for their livelihoods, but lack sufficient access to productive 
resources such as land, water and seeds. Another 20 per cent of those suffering from hunger 
are landless families who survive as tenant farmers or poorly paid agricultural labourers and 
often have to migrate from one insecure, informal job to another. Another 10 per cent of the 
world&#8217;s hungry live in rural communities from traditional fishing, hunting and herding 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Smallholder peasants, rural producers, toxins, fertilizers and genetically modified 
seeds 
</b></p>
<p>22. Around 50 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry live on small plots of land and produce 
crops for subsistence and/or sale on local markets. Many face problems because they live in 
remote areas or on marginal lands that are vulnerable to drought and natural disasters, while 
good, fertile land tends to be concentrated in the hands of wealthier landowners. For 
example, most of the fertile lands of central Guatemala are part of huge plantations, while 
the majority of smallholder farmers and indigenous people are left to cultivate the steep 
slopes of Guatemala&#8217;s mountainous regions (see E/CN.4/2006/44/Add.1). The same is true 
in other countries, such as Bolivia (A/HRC/7/5/Add.2) and Ethiopia 
(E/CN.4/2005/47/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>23. Together with land, peasants need seeds in order to secure their food security. Until 
recently, they were free to use seeds for replanting, selling or exchange. But this freedom is 
now threatened by a few transnational corporations that control the seed market and their 
patents on improved or genetically modified seeds (A/64/170). A third of the entire global 
seed market is in the hands of just 10 corporations, including Aventis, Monsanto, Pioneer 
and Syngenta. Monsanto alone controls 90 per cent of the global market in genetically 
modified seeds. 
</p>
<p>24. Another 20 percent of the world&#8217;s hungry are not small farmers, but landless people. 
Most of these people work as tenant farmers or agricultural labourers. Tenant farmers 
usually have to pay high rents and have little security of possession from season to season. 
Agricultural labourers usually work for extremely low wages that are insufficient to feed 
their families and often have to migrate from one insecure, informal job to another.15 This is 
for example the case in Bangladesh (E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.1) and Guatemala 
(E/CN.4/2006/44/Add.1).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Peasants and single-crop production 
</b></p>
<p>25. Since colonization, political and economic elites have largely imposed single-crop 
production to local rural populations, a process that continued after independence, in the 
name of neo-liberal free-trade policies. Instead of benefiting small peasants, this process 
favours highly mechanized agriculture and the interests of transnational corporations. In

</p>
<p>2001. </p>


<p>Brazil, for example, the extreme concentration of land in the huge estates of rich 
landowners (latifundios) is largely explained by colonization and the fact that more 
recently, export-oriented agriculture has not allowed redistributive agrarian reforms. For 
many countries, this means increasing dependency on international markets, with 
detrimental effects on the livelihood of rural population when prices go down. This was for 
example the case in Ethiopia when coffee prices went down (E/CN.4/2005/47/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>26. In recent years, the phenomenon of the &#8220;global land grab&#8221; has added a new 
dimension to these concerns, with the potential to involve an unprecedented degree of land 
expropriation, forced evictions and displacements. With the expansion of biofuels 
production since 2003 and the global food crisis in 2008, the revival of the strategy of 
foreign investors, both Governments and companies, to buy or secure long-term leases of 
productive land in other countries can have detrimental effects on local farmers, if land 
used by small farmers is sold or leased to foreign investors. The most famous case is the 
deal between the company Daewoo and the Government of Madagascar, on a lease of 1.3 
million hectares of land &#8211; or third of arable land of the country. The same phenomenon is 
witnessed in many other countries, with an estimated number of 180 land deals existing at 
varying stage of negotiation.16  
</p>
<p><b> 3. People living from traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities 
</b></p>
<p>27. Around 10 per cent of the world&#8217;s hungry subsist through fishing, hunting and 
herding activities. In many countries, the traditional way of life of these people and their 
means of livelihood are threatened by competition over productive resources, leading to 
increasing hunger and malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>28. There are two types of fish production; fish captured in the wild from the sea or 
inland waters (capture fisheries); and fish farmed in the sea or inland waters (aquaculture). 
Both are now driven to industrialization, privatization and export-orientation, which end up 
depriving local people of their traditional rights of access to fishing resources. People 
subsisting on hunting activities in forest and hill areas are also increasingly marginalized in 
many parts of the world. Many have lost their access to traditional forest livelihoods and 
food resources through the creation of forest reserves or because of development projects 
such as dams, power plants, coal mines and mineral industries; many remain without access 
to food or to government services. Finally, conflicts over land and water are also increasing 
between pastoralists and crop farmers. The complementarities between pastoralists and 
farmers have been lost in many countries, as farmers tend their own small animals and are 
less eager to allow pastoralists to graze their herds in the fields after the harvest. This is for 
example the case in Ethiopia (see E/CN.4/2005/47/Add.1) and the Niger (see 
E/CN.4/2002/58/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> C. The right to food and the urban poor 
</b></p>
<p>29. With the size of urban population continuing to rise, the absolute number of urban 
poor and undernourished also continues to increase. Intra-urban differences reveal levels of 
inequalities and malnutrition rather than an average that provides one single estimate of 
</p>
<p>

May 2009, &#8220;Outsourcing`s third wave. Rich food importers are acquiring vast tracts of poor countries&#8217; 
farmland. Is this beneficial foreign investment or neocolonialism?&#8221; </p>


<p>poverty.17 Recent trends have shown that, for the poor living in urban areas, a dependence 
on cash-based incomes increases together with a decrease in reliance on surrounding 
natural resources.18 Access to food-producing resources and access to healthy ways of 
acquiring, developing and consuming staples are crucial for food to be secured by the 
disenfranchised themselves. 
</p>
<p>30. Countries continue to assume that food security is equivalent to food shortage. 
African states, for example, continue to spend a large share of resources on meeting the 
needs of the urban poor rather than investing in productive sectors, such as agriculture and 
the generation of off-farm and urban employment.19 The pursuit of social goods should not 
be separated from the management of public expenditures. Moreover, while Government 
provision of food aid through social safety nets is usually administered equally to 
households that reach certain poverty lines, it does not address discrimination stemming 
from inequalities within the households. Lastly, the recent food crisis, which affected 
disproportionately the urban poor, showed that the need to avoid the negative impact on 
local production and consumer prices of imported food aid by reducing dependency on the 
latter, providing a mechanism to manage price volatility and encouraging the distribution of 
crops from surplus regions to deficit regions. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p>31. The intersection between women's rights and the right to food provides a rich 
overview of a number of interrelated dimensions of discrimination against women related 
to access to land, property and markets, which are inextricably linked to access to 
education, employment, health care and political participation. On a global scale, women 
cultivate more than 50 per cent of all food grown.20 Women nonetheless account for 70 per 
cent of the world&#8217;s hungry and are disproportionately affected by malnutrition, poverty and 
food insecurity. Governments are not living up to their international commitments to 
protect women from discrimination, as the gap between de jure equality and de facto 
discrimination continues to persist and resist change. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Rural women, access to land, production and markets 
</b></p>
<p>32. Women&#8217;s access to control and ownership of land or property are crucial for the 
purpose of strengthening their security and livelihood. It is important to understand the 
multiple factors - laws, inheritance, marital status and agrarian reform policies - that impede 
women's equal access to land and the way these affect women by virtue of their gender at 
the level of individual, community and nation.21 Despite representing the majority of the 
agricultural workforce and production, women are estimated to have access to/control 5 per 
cent of land globally.22 The World Food Program estimates that de facto female-headed 
households form an estimated 25 per cent of total rural households signalling the

<p>multiplicity of women, from single parents, widows, wives of migrant workers to women 
migrant workers.23 
</p>
<p>33. Rural households continue to acquire land through inheritance laws that emanate 
from customary legal regimes currently premised on reaffirming women's unequal access to 
and control over land. Because land is mediated through husbands, fathers, brothers or sons, 
women's land rights are negotiated within unequal power relationships and are not assumed 
to be general entitlements. This underscores the importance of legal and cultural reform to 
restore the balance of power relationships within the family. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Women and access to education, employment and health care 
</b></p>
<p>34. Rural women have the world&#8217;s lowest levels of schooling and the highest rates of 
illiteracy in all developing regions; twice as many women suffer from malnutrition as men, 
and girls are twice as likely to die from malnutrition as boys. Numerous studies underscore 
the social costs of rural women&#8217;s lack of education and assets, linking them directly to high 
rates of malnutrition, infant mortality and, in some countries, HIV/AIDS infection. There 
are also high economic costs: wasted human capital and low labour productivity that stifle 
rural development and progress in agriculture, and ultimately threaten food security. 
Discrimination against women in the context of the right to adequate food is a culmination 
of all other aspects of discrimination that stifle women&#8217;s rights to equality and 
empowerment.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Discrimination against children  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Malnutrition and health care 
</b></p>
<p>35. In addition to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the CRC establishes the international protection and care framework for children. Seen in 
line with food, health and care as three conditions to achieve nutritional security, the 
Convention includes provisions that protect the right to nutrition. Reality remains 
nonetheless bleak. In 2008, 8.8 million children born across the world died before their fifth 
birthday.24 More than one third of child deaths worldwide are attributed to malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>36. Children&#8217;s food security is negatively affected in situations where more powerful 
individuals and groups hold disproportionate shares of resources and property. This is 
exacerbated by ineffective systems for the monitoring and sanctioning of property rights 
and sustainable resources by Governments, the pressures and incentives of privatization and 
kinship-based customary institutions, which lack effective mechanisms to back up the 
interest of weaker groups and individuals, particularly children.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child labour 
</b></p>
<p>37.  158 million children, or one child in six, aged between 5 and 14 years, are involved 
in child labour. In sub-Saharan Africa this phenomenon concerns one child in three, 
compared to only one in 20 in the region of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. Children living in the poorest households and rural 
areas are the most likely to be involved in child labour. An overwhelming majority of those 
burdened with household chores are girls. Although between 2002 and 2006, globally, child 
labour fell by 11 per cent, a number of factors have made agricultural child labour

<p>particularly difficult to tackle and reduce. These include the large numbers of girls and boys 
starting to work at an early age, the hazardous nature of the work, lack of regulation, the 
lack of visibility of their work, the denial of education and the effects of poverty, as well as 
ingrained attitudes and perceptions about the role of children in rural areas.25 According to 
the International Labour Organization (ILO), any sustainable solution to child labour 
problems in agriculture will require national Governments, international organizations, 
donor agencies and civil society organizations to give priority to agriculture and rural 
development, so that farmers are able to obtain fair prices for their products. National 
governments, international organizations, donor agencies and civil society organizations 
should pay special attention to the elimination of hazardous child labour in their work 
related to agricultural policy. The elimination of child labour also requires dealing with 
issues affecting adult agricultural workers, since child labour is linked to adult poverty. 
Policy coherence on child labour must centre on the concept of promoting decent work. 
Poverty reduction strategies at the country level should support the elimination of child 
labour. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Discrimination against refugees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Malnutrition in refugee camps 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 
the World Food Programme (WFP) (which is ensuring access to food in camps) are 
confronted with a dramatic problem: a lack of financial means to ensure adequate food for 
refugees and internally displaced persons. Important efforts are being made by Europe, the 
United States and other developed countries to provide assistance and food aid in 
emergencies. However, despite the unrelenting commitment of WFP, there are serious 
funding shortfalls for some of its emergency programmes, threatening the lives of millions 
of people in Africa.  
</p>
<p>39. The problem is by no means new (A/HRC/4/30 and A/HRC/7/5). But it has become 
dramatically worse with the explosion of world market prices for staple foods: rice, maize 
and wheat in particular. In some camps managed by UNHCR, over 80 per cent of all 
children under 10 years of age suffer from anaemia and are incapable of following UNHCR 
school programmes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Hunger Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>40. In recent decades, millions of people have crossed international borders and many 
have tried to reach developed countries to escape pervasive hunger, especially people living 
in sub-Saharan Africa (see A/HRC/7/5).  
</p>
<p>41. Most people fleeing from hunger are refused entry and protection in other countries 
because they do not qualify as refugees in the traditional and legal sense. Most of them are 
detained and held in processing or detention centers, before being forcibly repatriated to 
their own countries. European Governments have created an institution called Frontex, with 
patrol boats, aeroplanes and helicopters from Spain, Italy, Finland and Portugal operating 
along the borders of Mauritania, Senegal and Cape Verde to intercept boats and return them 
immediately to shore.  
</p>
<p>  
 25 See &#8220;For agriculture without child labour: the harvest for the future&#8221;, International Partnership for 
</p>
<p>Cooperation on Child Labour in Agriculture, at 
http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Agriculture/International_Partnersgip_IPCLA/lang--en/index.htm </p>


<p>42. But refugees from hunger are not migrants. They do not move voluntarily, but out of 
a state of necessity (A/62/289). They are forced to flee. Especially when famine strikes a 
whole country or a whole region (for example the 2005 famine in the Sahel zone of sub-
Saharan Africa), refugees from hunger have no other choice but to flee across international 
borders. Hunger is an immediate threat to their lives and those of their families. They 
should therefore be protected, not rejected. The need to strengthen protection for people 
forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger was recognized by the General 
Assembly in its resolution 62/164 on the right to food. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Other vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>43. Indigenous people face exclusion and discrimination that have an impact on their 
right to food. In Guatemala for instance, while half of all Guatemala children under the age 
of 5 are stunted, malnutrition is much higher among indigenous children, with 70 per cent 
stunted in their growth compared to 36 per cent of non-indigenous children 
(E/CN.4/2006/44/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>44. The right to food of indigenous people often depends closely on their access to and 
control over their lands and other natural resources in their territories. The fact that their 
right to food is so frequently denied and is so much related to their traditional way of living 
explain why a number of indigenous organizations have expressed their deep concerns over 
the obstacles and challenges that their communities face in fully enjoying this right. As 
stated in the Declaration of Atitl&#225;n, at the First Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Global Consultation on 
the Right to Food in April 2002, in Guatemala: 
</p>
<p>The denial of the right to food for indigenous peoples not only denies our physical 
survival, but also denies us our social organization, our cultures, traditions, 
languages, spirituality, sovereignty, and total identity; it is a denial of our collective 
indigenous existence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>45. Hunger and malnutrition are largely explained by unequal power relations that 
systematically disadvantage minorities. As Sylvie Brunel has noted: 
</p>
<p>From the beginning of time, in the history of humankind, minorities (political, ethnic 
or religious) have always been the first to suffer from hunger, in the same way that 
all populations, victims of a status considered inferior, find themselves placed on the 
bottom rung of the social ladder.26 
</p>
<p><b> III. Anti-discriminatory policies and strategies  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The question of land and agrarian reform   
</b></p>
<p>46. To realize fully the right to food, more attention needs to be paid to agrarian reform 
that benefits landless peasants and small-scale land holders and promotes security of tenure 
and access to land.  While the &#8220;death&#8221; of agrarian reform was proclaimed in the 1970s, and 
few efforts were made to conduct land reform programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s, 
</p>
<p>  
 26 S. Brunel, &#8220;La Faim dans le monde ; comprendre pour agir&#8221;, 1999, p. 11. </p>


<p>land reform returned to the international agenda in 1996 (see A/57/356). In the Rome 
Declaration on World Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action, land reform 
constituted a key part of stated commitments.27 In the declaration of the International 
Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development organized by FAO and the 
Government of Brazil in March 2006, 95 States recognized that one important way to 
ensure the fulfilment of the right to food was to establish appropriate land reform to secure 
access to land for marginalized and vulnerable groups, and to adopt adequate legal 
frameworks and policies to promote traditional and family agriculture.28 
</p>
<p>47. Land reforms in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, China and 
Cuba have had a significant impact on reducing poverty and hunger and increasing 
economic growth (see A/HRC/7/5/Add.3). In India, the states with the steepest declines in 
poverty from 1958 to 1992 were those that implemented land reform (see 
E/CN.4/2006/44/Add.2). In general, based on the evidence of agrarian reforms instituted in 
more than 60 countries since the end of the Second World War, land reform has worked 
when reforms have been genuinely transformative and redistributive, when quality land has 
really been distributed to the landless and poor peasants and when rural power structures 
have been broken. More recently, the move towards transformative and redistributive 
agrarian reform has been successfully chosen by the Government of Bolivia (see 
A/HRC/7/5/Add.2). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promotion of different forms of cooperation and association; vertical 
and horizontal networks between producers and consumers 
</b></p>
<p>48. To address the ever increasing inequalities caused by the current world trading 
system, civil society organizations are promoting new forms of cooperation and association, 
vertical and horizontal networks between producers and consumers. The most important 
movement in this field is the movement for food sovereignty. 
</p>
<p>49. The concept of food sovereignty has been created by La Via Campesina in 1996, in 
response to the trade liberalization of agriculture. Since 1996, the concept has gained 
support in both rural and urban communities, in the south and in the north. During the 
World Forum on Food Sovereignty, held in March 2007 in Ny&#233;l&#233;ni, Mali, more than 500 
representatives of organizations of peasants/family farmers, artisanal fisher folk, indigenous 
peoples, landless peoples, rural workers, migrants, pastoralists, forest communities, women, 
youth, consumers, environmental and urban movements from more than 80 countries 
adopted the Declaration of Ny&#233;l&#233;ni, in which they defined food sovereignty as: 
</p>
<p>The right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through 
ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food 
and agriculture systems. It puts those who produce, distribute and consume food at 
the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and 
corporations. (&#8230;) Food sovereignty prioritises local and national economies and 
markets and empowers peasant and family farmer-driven agriculture, artisanal - 
fishing, pastoralist-led grazing, and food production, distribution and consumption 
based on environmental, social and economic sustainability. Food sovereignty 
promotes transparent trade that guarantees just income to all peoples and the rights 
of consumers to control their food and nutrition.

<p><b> C. The rights of peasants  
</b></p>
<p>50. The background paper on peasant farmers and the right to food: a history of 
discrimination and exploitation (A/HRC/AC/3/CRP.5), presented at the third session of the 
Advisory Committee, concluded that smallholder farmers, landless people, tenant farmers, 
agricultural labourers and people living from traditional fishing, hunting and herding 
activities were among the most discriminated people and the first victims of violations of 
the right to food in many parts of the world.  
</p>
<p>51. These people are victims of many violations of the right to food.29 Every year, 
thousands of them are victims of land expropriation, forced evictions and displacements, 
many as a consequence of mining activities, logging, building dams and highways, or 
expanding industrial agriculture, a situation which could reach an unprecedented level with 
the new &#8220;global land grab&#8221; phenomenon. While being forcibly evicted or displaced, these 
people also lose their right to live in rural societies with cultural and local agricultural 
values, such as solidarity. They are also often excluded from their local markets, owing to 
market deregulation in their countries and cheap imports coming from the global north as a 
result of dumping practices, and lose access to seeds, confiscated by transnational 
corporations. When they organize themselves against these violations, they are often 
criminalized, arbitrarily arrested and detained or physically attacked by private or State 
police forces, which constitute other violations of their fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Peasants, like all human beings, benefit from the protection of the rights enshrined in 
the universal instruments for the protection of human rights, in particular the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. Many of these rights offer significant protection to the rights of 
peasants.30 But these instruments remain clearly insufficient to protect fully the rights of 
peasants and address de facto discrimination against peasants, who have been historically 
and socially discriminated in many countries, in accordance with the definition of 
discrimination put forward by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.31 
</p>
<p>53. In June 2008, after more than seven years of consultation with its members 
organizations, La Via Campesina adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Peasants &#8211; Men 
and Women (see annex, below)32 and presented it as a response to the world food crisis 
before the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in 2009.33 The declaration of 
La Via Campesina is an important example of anti-discriminatory strategy that could 
improve the protection of the right to food. It follows the structure of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of indigenous Peoples. Its first article gives a definition of a 
peasant, which includes small-scale farmers, landless peasants and non-agricultural 
households in rural areas, whose members are engaged in fishing, making crafts for the 
local market or providing services, and other rural households of pastoralists, nomads, 
peasants practising shifting cultivation, hunters and gatherers, and people with similar 
livelihoods.

<p>54. The declaration adopted by La Via Campesina reaffirms the rights to life and to an 
adequate standard of living (art. 3); the right to freedoms of association, opinion and 
expression (art. 12) and the right to have access to justice (art. 13). In addition, it recognizes 
new rights that could reinforce the protection of peasants against discrimination. These 
include the right to land and territory (art. 4); the right to seeds and traditional agricultural 
knowledge and practice (art. 5); the right to the means of agricultural production (art. 6); 
the right to information and agricultural technology (art. 7); the freedom to determine prices 
and markets for agricultural production (art. 8) ; the right to the protection of local 
agricultural values (art. 9); the right to biological diversity (art. 10); and the right to 
preserve the environment (art. 11). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Legal and social protection of rural women  
</b></p>
<p>55. Because the sustainability of food supplies and income-generation are limited by 
lack of credit services and market access, rural areas particularly carry the burden of high 
levels of physical activity to ensure food availability.34  Women improve the food security 
of their household through (a) their access to income-generating activity and (b) through 
ensuring food availability.  Technologies designed to meet women's needs have proven 
particularly useful in increasing productivity and shortening physically demanding labour 
to help relieve women in their heavy burdens.35  Alternative sources of cooking fuels have 
proven to shorten preparation and storage of foods and decrease the need for daily firewood 
collection, for example.  Equitable rights to land for women in both developed and 
developing countries point to the success of rural (and urban) small businesses run by 
women (compared to male counterparts) so much that banks and service industries actively 
support women's entrepreneurial initiatives. 
</p>
<p>56.  The right to control, access, and manage land is tied to a woman's right to exercise 
financial independence, earn a livelihood, and subsequently provide a livelihood for herself 
and her household. Agrarian reform policies which are 'gender-blind' continue to exclude 
women from entitlements to land.36 States undergoing agrarian reform or land redistribution 
schemes must uphold the equal right of women to land, regardless of marital status.  
Women usually do not have their names on land-use certificates (whether jointly with their 
husbands or individually), which decreases their ability to apply for mortgage or credit.   
Many rural women, as documented systematically in Sub-Saharan Africa, envisage the 
legal difficulty that they cannot hold title to land, although they are given the right to till the 
land and erect a home on a piece of land allocated to the household head.37 Countries that 
have adopted CEDAW have strengthened the legal framework of equality with respect of 
the human rights of women by repealing laws deemed discriminatory to women. However, 
elimination of discrimination against women requires not only changes in institutions, laws 
and regulations, but more importantly cultural practices that are part of the process that 
creates and perpetuates such discrimination. Governments must show political will to

<p>enforce the rule of law and bridge the gap between de jure equality and de facto 
discrimination, including by affirmative action.  
</p>
<p>57.  A rights-based approach to trade liberalization, focusing on protecting vulnerable 
individuals and groups is important to lead Governments to engage in public consultations 
with stakeholders including women subsistence farmers and those most affected by food 
insecurity. Governments, in their mandates to respect, protect and fulfil must ensure that 
women without purchasing power are enabled to face episodes of high prices or market 
disruptions without continuing chronic hunger or asset shedding that would erode their 
future productivity and jeopardize their livelihoods (and the livelihoods of those who 
depend on them).  
</p>
<p>58.  According to the World Health Organization, the health of women and girls is of 
particular concern because, in many societies, they are disadvantaged by discrimination 
rooted in socio-cultural factors. For example, women and girls face increased vulnerability 
to HIV/AIDS. Since women play an essential role in food security, it is widely known that 
the health of women is important for the health of their societies. Underweight and 
malnourished mothers are more likely to give birth to underweight babies who end up 
having mental or physical disorders. To enhance women&#8217;s right to food and right to health 
in order to break the vicious circle, all barriers depriving women from proper health care, 
housing, potable water, sanitation and healthy food must be removed. Studies also show 
that income earned and managed by women is positively correlated to economic and 
nutritional well-being for the entire household.38  Women are more likely to spend their 
incomes on food and children&#8217;s needs.  Research has shown that a child&#8217;s chances of 
survival increase by 20 per cent when the mother controls the household budget.39  
</p>
<p><b> E. Legal and social protection of other vulnerable groups exposed to the 
risk of hunger and its other human rights implications 
</b></p>
<p>59. Among the most vulnerable groups to hunger and malnutrition are children and 
indigenous people (see above). It is not surprising that their extreme vulnerability has led 
States to increase their legal protection at the international, regional and national levels.  
</p>
<p>60. More than one third of child deaths worldwide are attributed to malnutrition. A key 
indicator of chronic malnutrition is stunting - when children are too short for their age 
group compared to the WHO child growth standards. About 178 million children globally 
are stunted, resulting from not enough food, a vitamin- and mineral-poor diet, and disease. 
As growth slows down, brain development lags and stunted children learn poorly. Although 
fewer children are undernourished today than in the 1990s, one out of four children 
(143 million) under the age of five in the developing world is still underweight and only 
38 per cent of children under six months are exclusively breastfed.40 School meals 
programmes in developing countries constitute a recommended strategy that provides better 
nutrition and improves access to education for children (see below section. IV.D) The 
United Nations Millennium Project Hunger Task Force (HTF) has recently recommended 
continued breast-feeding until age of two as one of the three pillars expected to reduce 
malnutrition in children under the age of five.  In an attempt to reduce the vulnerabilities of 
those affected by malnutrition, HTF makes clear that household composition and size,

<p>maternal education, household assets and the agro-ecosystem play important roles in 
determining the nutritional status of children, particularly in developing countries.     
</p>
<p>61. Until recently, the international framework for the protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples was relatively weak, the only international instrument offering specific 
protection being ILO Convention No. 169. Addressing the continued vulnerability of 
indigenous people, despite the existing legal framework, the Human Rights Council 
adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples at its first 
session (resolution 2006/2, annex); the declaration was then adopted by the General 
Assembly in September 2007. The declaration is particularly relevant to the right to food. It 
recognizes that indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination and rights over land 
and resources, acknowledging the historical injustices of colonization but also addressing 
the contemporary threats posed by economic globalization, offering protection of traditional 
knowledge, biodiversity and genetic resources, and setting limits to the activities of third 
parties on the territories of indigenous communities without their consent. This new 
instrument, even if it is not a treaty, represents an important new tool that indigenous 
peoples can use to claim their rights, including their right to food, and seek appropriate 
remedies in case of violations. Since its adoption in 2007, it has inspired new constitutions 
in Bolivia and Ecuador; the whole declaration, or part of it, has been incorporated in 
national laws. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Peasant agriculture, identity, certificates of product origin and 
products with identity 
</b></p>
<p>62. The global fight against hunger has mobilized various relevant actors. The 
international movement of peasants, La Via Campesina, defends the rights of peasants and 
rural women by &#8220;promoting gender parity and social justice in fair economic relations; the 
preservation of land, water, seeds, and other resources; food sovereignty; and sustainable 
agricultural production based on small- and medium-sized producers.&#8221;41 Legal groups such 
as the Permanent People&#8217;s Tribunal on the Right to Food and the Rule of Law in Asia 
investigate the protection of food and water rights.42 The Asia Pacific Forum on Women, 
Law and Development mobilizes women to resist &#8220;the corporate control of food, 
agriculture, and the lives of women and their communities.&#8221;43 In Burkina Faso, the 
Welthungerhilfe and the farmers&#8217; organization Zood Noma teach farmers cultivation and 
farming techniques. It also works with bank cooperatives to ensure that farmers have access 
to microcredit, especially for income-generating activities and for food during the dry 
season.44 
</p>
<p><b> B. Forms of cooperation, including cooperatives, associations, trade unions 
and cooperatives of women producers/consumers

remote area of India who &#8220;are practicing an agriculture that is ecologically sound, keeps the

methods that used not a single drop of irrigation or chemical fertilizers and pesticides, yet 
still delivered surplus produce. In addition to training women in over 70 villages to employ 
this type of farming, these women work with the Deccan Development Society to help 
women form women&#8217;s sanghams (associations) &#8220;that decide their own crops, set up 
community grain banks that collect surplus produce and sell it at lower than market rates to 
below-poverty-level members who have no lands, or have not managed to grown enough 
food.&#8221;45 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promoting clean agriculture: the fight against toxic foods and 
genetically modified seeds 
</b></p>
<p>64. Parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants46 agreed to 
limit the use of harmful chemicals to &#8220;environmentally sound&#8221; purposes47 and prevent the 
production and use of pesticides or industrial chemicals with Persistent Organic 
Pollutants.48 International networks such as the Pesticide Action Network49 and the 
International Persistent Organic Pollutants Elimination Network50 have had a tremendous 
impact on curtailing the use of chemicals that harm the world&#8217;s food supply.

<p>65. Efforts are also being made to control the use of genetically modified seeds. Japan 
made health testing of genetically modified foods mandatory by April 200151 and the 
implementation of genetically modified-free labels and Government regulations in 
countries such as Austria, Italy and Germany have already proved to be quite effective.52 In 
2009, Ireland announced plans to ban the cultivation of genetically modified plants and 
introduce a voluntary genetically modified-free label for food53 and France announced that 
it would create voluntary &#8220;GMO-free&#8221; labelling schemes to help conventional agricultural 
producers to distinguish their produce in the market.54 Austria also submitted a proposal,55

<p> 52 Since Germany introduced its genetically modified -free &#8220;Ohne Gentechnik&#8221; label in May 2008 for 
meat, fish, poultry, eggs and dairy produce, sales of genetically modified-free milk have dramatically 
increased. GM-Free Ireland, press release, Ireland adopts GM-Free Zone Policy&#8221;, r 2009,

<p> 53 This includes meal, poultry, eggs, fish, crustaceans and dairy produce made without the use of 
genetically modified animal feed.

<p>co-signed by Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, 
Slovenia and the Netherlands, for the Council of the European Union to allow national bans 
on genetically modified crops.56  Hundreds of leading food brands (including the largest 
dairy coop, Friesland Campina) and dozens of leading retailers (including the largest, 
Carrefour) in Europe now offer premium meat, fish, eggs, poultry eggs and dairy produce 
made without the use of GM feedstuffs. Leading food manufacturers, retailers, processors, 
distributors, farmers, seed breeders and consumers in the United States have set up a joint 
venture called the Non-GMO Project.57 
</p>
<p><b> D. Education systems and food security, including school meals and other 
systems of combating malnutrition and the promotion of healthy food 
</b></p>
<p>66. As part of its commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 2007 
Bolivia launched the Zero Malnutrition National Programme to combat malnutrition, 
monitor the nutrition and health of the children and distribute food supplements. As part of 
the initiative, Plan International, based in the United Kingdom, trained roughly 1,500 
women as madres vigilantes (&#8220;mindful mothers&#8221;), who then returned to their respective 
communities to monitor child nutrition and educate other women about better eating and 
cooking habits.58 Such programmes can certainly address malnutrition and related diseases, 
such as noma (see A/HRC/AC/3/CRP.3). The Government of Bolivia, with the support of 
WFP, also runs children&#8217;s centres that provide children with breakfast, lunch, and two 
snacks.59 
</p>
<p>67. The Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture 
administers the National School Lunch Program, which provides daily &#8220;nutritionally 
balanced, low-cost or free lunches&#8221; to more than 30.5 million children in over 101,000

laws on the basis of the High Council&#8217;s recommendations. Combat Monsanto, &#8220;France prepares

</p>
<p> 55 The text of the proposal states: &#8220;Given the unsatisfactory situation and the negative attitude towards 
GMOs in large parts of the population in many member states, the time has come to find a new 
approach to deal with the authorization and use of GMOs in agriculture (&#8230;) The soundest legal 
solution we can envisage is a set of minor amendments of relevant EU legislation, which should 
introduce the right of an individual member state to restrict or prohibit indefinitely the cultivation of 
authorised GMOs in its territory.&#8221;  Council of the European Union, &#8220;Genetically Modified

access to education for children, improve rural economies and help local farmers.64 In 2009, 
the Partnership for Child Development at Imperial College London launched a project 
aimed at helping Governments &#8220;to run school meal programmes using locally-sourced food, 
providing regular orders and a reliable income for local farmers&#8221; in Mali, Nigeria, Ghana, 
Malawi and Kenya.65 
</p>
<p><b> E. Microfinance for poor women  
</b></p>
<p>69. The African Women Food Farmer Initiative of the Hunger Project was the first 
microfinance programme in Africa developed to target women food producers, and the first 
to result in officially recognized rural banks owned and operated by rural women. Since its 
inception in 1999, the Hunger Project has disbursed loans to about 75,000 partners in 
Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Senegal and Uganda. A total 
of 18 Rural Banks now operate as independent, community-owned and women-led rural 
financial institutions. The Project has disbursed nearly $7.9 million to various communities, 
42 per cent of which has been distributed by the Rural Banks.66  
</p>
<p>70. The Kenya Women Finance Trust Ltd. (www.kwft.org), established in 1981 as the 
largest and only microfinance institution exclusively for women, ensures that women 
entrepreneurs have access to credit and promotes savings mobilization among its 100,000 
members from seven of Kenya&#8217;s eight provinces. By December 2008, it was responsible for 
247,538 active loans. Al Tadamun Microfinance Foundation in Egypt provides group 
guaranteed microfinance exclusively for women.  By December 2009, it had 91,000 active 
borrowers and a portfolio of LE60 million or US$ 10.9 million. 
</p>
<p>71. Kiva (www.kiva.org) is a person-to-person microlending website that links 
individual lenders to rural entrepreneurs around the world, especially in Africa. Lenders 
browse through profiles of entrepreneurs and women farmers that are uploaded to the Kiva 
website, and lend them funds using their credit cards. Kiva then provides the funds to the 
beneficiaries.

<p><b> F. Good practices relating to the urban poor  
</b></p>
<p>73. Belo Horizonte is the fourth largest city in Brazil, estimates from the early 1990s 
concluded that 38 per cent of families68 and 44 percent69 of children live under the poverty 
line. The city government created the Municipal Secretariat of Supplies to tailor an 
integrated policy addressing malnutrition and hunger. Programmes cover (a) policies that 
assist poor families and individuals at risk by supplementing their food intake; (b) 
partnering with private food suppliers to bring food to areas previously neglected by 
commercial establishments; and (c) increase food production and supply through technical 
and financial incentives given to small-scale producers to link rural producers and urban 
consumers.70 A 20-member council with representatives from the government sector, labour 
unions, food producers/consumers, and non-governmental organizations advised the 
Secretariat on project directions. 
</p>
<p>74. Much of the Secretariat&#8217;s success is also due to the decentralization of social 
programmes that were previously managed at a federal level (school meals were provided 
in this manner, for example). Decentralization allows for savings (for example, 
transportation costs) and opens up space for production by local suppliers. Finally, ensuring 
local participation and commitment conveys a sense of ownership to the communities of 
Belo Horizonte. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. Existing inequalities between the world&#8217;s regions and the vulnerability of the 
poorest members of developing countries are deepening as a result of three 
concomitant crises: the food crisis, the economic crisis and the environmental crisis. 
For the first time in history, more than 1 billion people are undernourished 
worldwide. The people most vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition include poor rural 
families, the urban poor, women, children, refugees, indigenous people and other 
minorities. Most of these people are hungry because they suffer from many forms of 
discrimination.

<p><b>ensure that Government policies are sufficiently well formulated in order to address 
the needs of the most vulnerable people living in both rural and urban areas. These 
policies and reforms should be designed, implemented and monitored with the 
participation of all stakeholders, including the most vulnerable people and civil society 
organizations. Concrete strategies to eliminate discrimination against women require 
not only changes in institutions and laws, but more importantly in cultural practices 
that create and perpetuate such discrimination. School meals programmes and 
combating child labour should be essential components of strategies to eliminate 
chronic malnutrition among children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>77.  To improve the realization of the right to food and combat discrimination, 
more attention needs to be paid to agrarian reform that benefits small-scale land 
holders and promotes security of tenure and access to land, particularly for women.  
The concept of food sovereignty offers an important new form of cooperation and 
association between producers and consumers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>78. One of the most important new developments in the protection against 
discrimination in the context of the right to food was the adoption of the Declaration 
on the Rights of Peasants &#8211; Women and Men by La Via Campesina, in June 2008. The 
analysis made by the authors of the declaration has gained pertinence since the world 
food crisis. The Advisory Committee believes that it is time to undertake a 
preliminary study on the significance and importance of a possible new instrument on 
the rights of peasants and other people living in rural areas, including from 
traditional fishing, hunting and herding activities.  </b></p>


<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Declaration of Rights of Peasants - Women and Men  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Document adopted by the Via Campesina International 
Coordinating Committee in Seoul, March 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Peasants of the World need an International Convention on 
the Rights of Peasants,  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>Almost half of the people in the world are peasants.  Even in the high-tech world, people 
eat food produced by peasants. Small-scale agriculture is not just an economic activity; it 
means life for many people. The security of the population depends on the well-being of 
peasants and sustainable agriculture. To protect human life it is important to respect, protect 
and fulfil the rights of the peasants. In reality, the ongoing violations of peasants' rights 
threaten human life. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Violations of Peasants' Rights 
</b></p>
<p>Millions of peasants have been forced to leave their farmland because of land grabs 
facilitated by national policies and/or the military. Land is taken away from peasants for the 
development of large industrial or infrastructure projects, extracting industries like mining, 
tourist resorts, special economic zones, supermarkets and plantations for cash crops. As a 
result, land is increasingly concentrated in a few hands.  
</p>
<p>States neglect the farm sector and peasants receive inadequate income from their 
agriculture production. 
</p>
<p>Monocultures for the production of agrofuels and other industrial uses are promoted in 
favor of agribusiness and transnational capital; this has devastating impacts on forests, 
water, the environment and the economic and social life of peasants.  
</p>
<p>There is an increasing militarization and a number of armed conflicts in rural areas with 
severe impacts on the full realization of civil rights of peasants.  
</p>
<p>As they lose their land, communities also lose their forms of self-government, sovereignty 
and cultural identity.  
</p>
<p>Food is increasingly used for speculation purposes. 
</p>
<p>The peasants' struggle is criminalised.  
</p>
<p>Slave labor, forced labor and child labor are still found in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>Women's and children's rights are the most affected. Women are victims of psychological, 
physical and economic violence. They are discriminated in their access to land and 
productive resources, and marginalized in decision making.  
</p>
<p>Peasants have lost many local seeds. Biodiversity is destroyed by the use of chemical 
fertilizers, hybrid seeds and genetically modified organisms developed by the transnational 
corporations.  </p>


<p>Access to health services and to education is decreasing in rural areas and peasants&#8217; 
political role in society is undermined.  
</p>
<p>As a result of these violations of peasants' rights, today millions of peasants live in hunger 
and suffer malnutrition. This is not because there is not enough food in the world, but 
because food resources are dominated by transnational corporations. Peasants are forced to 
produce for export instead of producing food for their communities.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The policies of neo-liberalism worsen the violations of Peasants' Rights 
</b></p>
<p>The violations of peasants' rights are on the rise because of the implementation of 
neoliberal policies promoted by the World Trade Organisation, Free Trade Agreements 
(FTAs), other institutions and many governments in the North as well as in the South. The 
WTO and FTAs force the opening of markets and prevent countries from protecting and 
supporting their domestic agriculture. They push for the deregulation in the agriculture 
sector.  
</p>
<p>Governments of developed countries and transnational corporations are responsible for 
trade dumping practices. Cheap subsidised food floods local markets thus forcing peasants 
out of business.    
</p>
<p>The WTO and other institutions force the introduction of food such as GMOs and the 
unsafe use of growth hormones in meat production. Meanwhile, they prohibit the marketing 
of healthy products produced by peasants through sanitary barriers.  
</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has implemented structural adjustment programs 
(SAPs) leading to massive cuts in subsidies for agriculture and social services.   Countries 
have been forced to privatize state companies and to dismantle support mechanisms in the 
agricultural sector.  
</p>
<p>National and international policies directly or indirectly give priority to transnational 
corporations or food production and trade. TNCs also practice biopiracy and destroy 
genetic resources and biodiversity cultivated by peasants. The capitalist logic of 
accumulation has dismantled peasant agriculture.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. The struggle of the Peasants to uphold and protect their Rights 
</b></p>
<p>Facing these realities, peasants all over the world are struggling to live.  All over the world, 
thousands of peasant leaders are being arrested because they are fighting to protect their 
rights and livelihood. They are being brought to court by unfair justice systems, incidents of 
massacre, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and detention, and political persecution 
and harassment are common.   
</p>
<p>The global food crisis in 2008 precipitated and exacerbated by policies and transnational 
corporations (which unilaterally act according to their own self-interest) clearly shows the 
failure in promoting, respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights of peasants. This affects 
all people in the world, in developed and developing countries. While peasants work hard 
to ensure the sustainability of seeds and food, the violation of the rights of peasants 
damages the world&#8217;s capability to feed itself.   
</p>
<p>The struggle of the Peasants is fully applicable to the framework of international human 
rights which includes instruments, and thematic mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, 
that address the right to food, housing rights, access to water, right to health, human rights 
defenders, indigenous peoples, racism and racial discrimination, women&#8217;s rights. These 
international instruments of the UN do not completely cover nor prevent human rights 
violations, especially the rights of the peasants. We see some limitations in the International </p>


<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) as an instrument to protect 
peasants' right. Also, the Charter of the Peasant- produced by the UN in 1978, was not able 
to protect peasants from international liberalization policies. The other international 
conventions, which also deal with peasants' rights, can not be implemented either. These 
conventions include: ILO Convention 169, Clause 8-J Convention on Biodiversity, Point 
14.60 Agenda 21, and Cartagena Protocol.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The Peasants need an International Convention on the Rights of 
Peasants 
</b></p>
<p>Because of the limitations of those conventions and resolutions, it is important to create an 
international instrument to respect, protect, fulfil, and uphold peasants' rights -- the 
International Convention on the Rights of Peasants (ICRP). There are already conventions 
to protect vulnerable groups of people, such as indigenous peoples, women, children and 
migrant workers. The ICRP will articulate the values of the rights of peasants, which will 
have to be respected, protected and fulfilled by governments and international institutions. 
The ICRP will be supplemented by optional protocols to ensure its implementation. 
</p>
<p>During the Regional Conference on Peasants' Rights in April 2002, Via Campesina 
formulated the Declaration of the Rights of Peasants through the process of a series of 
activities, including the Workshop on Peasants' Rights in Medan North Sumatra on 2000, 
the Conference of Agrarian Reform in Jakarta April 2001, the Regional Conference on 
Peasants' Rights held in Jakarta in April 2002 and the International Conference of Via 
Campesina also held in Jakarta, in June 2008. The text of the declaration is attached to this 
document. It should form the basis of the ICRP, to be elaborated by the United Nations, 
with the full participation of Via Campesina and other representatives of civil society.  
</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the support of the people who are concerned with the peasants' 
struggle and the promotion and protection of the rights of peasants. </p>


<p><b>  Declaration of Rights of Peasants, Women and Men  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Peasants of the World need an International Declaration on the Rights 
of Peasants 
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Declaration, 
</b></p>
<p>Affirming that peasants, men and women, are equal to all other people and, in the exercise 
of their rights, should be free from any form of discrimination, including discrimination 
based on race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, wealth, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, as well as the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, affirm the 
universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights, civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social,  
</p>
<p>Emphasizing that in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
States have undertaken to ensure the realization of the right to an adequate standard of 
living for ourselves and our family, including the right to food, and our right to be free from 
hunger through the genuine agrarian reform, 
</p>
<p>Emphasizing that according to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, all Indigenous peoples, including peasants, have the right to self-determination and 
that by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development, having the right to autonomy or self-
government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means 
for financing their autonomous functions, 
</p>
<p>Recalling that many peasants all over the world have fought throughout history for the 
recognition of the rights of peasants and for just and free societies, 
</p>
<p>Considering that the current agricultural conditions threaten the lives of peasants, 
worsening the environment, decreasing peasants' productivity and decreasing the livelihood 
of the peasants, 
</p>
<p>Considering that peasants&#8217; conditions are worsening  because of governments&#8217; exclusion of 
peasants from policy decision making, because of the use of military, and/or paramilitary 
groups to displace peasants and allowing transnational corporations to exploit natural 
resources, 
</p>
<p>Considering that capitalist globalization imposed through some international agreements 
has had a strong negative impact on the peasant sector, 
</p>
<p>Considering that peasants struggle with their own resources and with other groups who 
support the peasants&#8217; demands for life, environmental protection and increasing 
productivity, 
</p>
<p>Considering the increasing concentration of the food systems in the world in the hands of 
few transnational corporations, 
</p>
<p>Considering that peasants constitute a specific social group which is vulnerable so that the 
realization of the rights of peasants require special measures to truly respect, protect and 
fulfil the human rights of peasants enshrined in international human rights law, </p>


<p>Acknowledging that small-scale peasant agriculture, fishing, livestock rearing can 
contribute to mitigate the climate crisis and to secure a sustainable food production for all, 
</p>
<p>Reminding States to comply with and effectively implement all their obligations as they 
apply to peasants under international instruments, in particular those related to human 
rights, in consultation and cooperation with the peasants, 
</p>
<p>Believing that this Declaration is an essential step forward the recognition, promotion and 
protection of the rights and freedoms of peasants, including the elaboration and adoption of 
an International Convention on the Rights of Peasants, 
</p>
<p>Recognizing and reaffirming that peasants are entitled without discrimination to all human 
rights recognized in international law,

<p>A peasant is a man or woman of the land, who has a direct and special relationship with the 
land and nature through the production of food and/or other agricultural products. Peasants 
work the land themselves, rely above all on family labour and other small-scale forms of 
organizing labour. Peasants are traditionally embedded in their local communities and they 
take care of local landscapes and of agro-ecological systems. 
</p>
<p>The term peasant can apply to any person engaged in agriculture, cattle-raising, 
pastoralism, handicrafts-related to agriculture or a related occupation in a rural area. This 
includes Indigenous people working on the land.  
</p>
<p>The term peasant also applies to landless. According to the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO 1984) definition[1], the following categories of people are considered 
to be landless and are likely to face difficulties in ensuring their livelihood: 1. Agricultural 
labour households with little or no land; 2. Non-agricultural households in rural areas, with 
little or no land, whose members are engaged in various activities such as fishing, making 
crafts for the local market, or providing services; 3. Other rural households of pastoralists, 
nomads, peasants practising shifting cultivation, hunters and gatherers, and people with 
similar livelihoods.
