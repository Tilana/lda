<i> Deeply concerned at </i>the actions by Israel undermining the sanctity and inviolability of 
</p>
<p>religious sites in the Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem,

</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all policies and measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, 
</p>
<p>including those limiting access of Palestinians to their properties and holy sites particularly in 
</p>
<p>Occupied East Jerusalem, on the basis of national origin, religion, sex, age or any other 
</p>
<p>discriminatory ground, which are in grave violation of the Palestinian People's civil, political, 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights; 
</p>

</p>
<p>the separation Wall, changing the demographic and geographic character of East Jerusalem, the 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the freedom of movement of the Palestinian citizens of East Jerusalem, as well as 
</p>

</p>
<p>Conventions, and to allow Palestinian citizens and worshippers unhindered access to their 
</p>
<p>properties and religious sites therein; </p>
<p>4. <i>Also demands </i>that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately cease all digging and 
</p>
<p>excavation works and activities beneath and around Al-Aqsa Mosque and its vicinity, and refrain 
</p>
<p>from any acts or operations that may endanger the structure or foundations or change the nature 
</p>

</p>
<p>Jerusalem; </p>
<p>5. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, pursuant to
