<p><b>A/HRC/23/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.13-14147 
</p>
<p>1. France is deeply committed to the universal periodic review. This unique process not 
only enables each State to give an account of the measures it has taken to improve the 
human rights situation in its territory and evaluate remaining challenges, but also to share 
examples of good practice and make recommendations to other States. France considers the 
universal periodic review to be an essential tool, whose follow-up and recommendations are 
of a continuing nature. With this in mind, France will submit a midterm report in 2015 on 
the implementation of the recommendations made during the universal periodic review in 
January 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. France has carefully considered the 165 recommendations it received. All of the 
ministers concerned participated in the drafting of the replies to the recommendations and 
the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights was consulted during the process. 
</p>
<p>3. This addendum is divided into several parts. It is supplemented by an annex 
explaining the positions taken by France in respect of each of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>4. France accepts the recommendations whose wording and intention it supports, as 
well as those it has already implemented. 
</p>
<p>5. France does not accept the recommendations that it is not in a position to implement 
for legal or constitutional reasons, whose content it does not support, or whose claims it 
rejects.

the scope of the universal periodic review.
