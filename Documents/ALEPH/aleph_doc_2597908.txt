REPORT

SUMMARY 
Over the last six months Magontec has experienced a steady 
improvement in underlying profitability in all its operating 
activities. It is very pleasing to see that the impact of our 
efforts and investments of the last 24 months have begun 
to bear fruit. At the same time we are closing in on the 
commencement date for production at Magontec Qinghai, 
where our new 56,000 metric tonne per annum magnesium 
alloy production plant is located in Qinghai Province, PRC.
I
mportantly, as the 
Magontec business 
gears up for a major 
expansion at Qinghai, 
there have been no 
serious accidents at 
any of the primary 
magnesium alloy, magnesium alloy 
recycling or magnesium anode 
manufacturing facilities.
As in previous years foreign exchange 
fluctuations have had a very 
pronounced impact on the Magontec 
Profit & Loss account. Underlying cash 
generation is considerably stronger than 
the Reported Profit After Tax number 
suggests. Gross Profit rose 25.6% over 
the previous corresponding period and 
the margin on sales rose from 8.7% to 
11.2%. Magontec has also experienced 
a strong improvement in EBIT margins, 
the result of a continuing focus on costs 
and the benefits of operational leverage 
as volumes grow, particularly in the 
higher margin businesses.

Over the last 12 months and in the 
coming period we expect to continue 
to see our businesses expand in new 
regions and through new distribution 
channels. The Magontec business 
platform is now well positioned to 
further expand activities and generate 
new revenues and profits.
While volume growth has not been 
accessible in all areas (in fact sales of 
magnesium alloys to Chinese domestic 
customers have declined) we have 
broadly been able to improve processes 
and production techniques to generate 
higher margins. Furthermore the 
overall business is considerably more 
flexible than it was 12 months ago 
and better able to manage the order 
flow volatility that is common in the 
magnesium metals and downstream 
anode manufacturing businesses. In the 
coming months we expect to introduce 
new machinery and processing 
technologies, which will allow Magontec 
to continue to improve competitiveness.
Group cash flow, shown in the tables 
in the financial report, demonstrates 
the strength of the improvement in 
Magontec’s combined businesses. 
Underlying operational cash flow rose 
from A$1.2 million in the six months 
to 30 June 2015 to A$2.4 million in 
the six months to 30 June 2016. As 
expenditure on the major new facility 
in Qinghai draws to a close we are 
examining opportunities to re-enter the 
magnesium alloy recycling market in 
Asia and looking at new opportunities 
in the Americas. While re-cycling is 
not a high margin business it is an 
essential product offering. Magnesium 
die casters, our principal customers, 
convert between 40% and 70% of 
the material they buy from Magontec 
into scrap. These companies require 
a regional magnesium alloy recycling 
option to optimise the economics of 
downstream manufacturing activities 
and to maintain a competitive position 
relative to other materials.

QINGHAI MAGNESIUM ALLOY 
CAST HOUSE PROJECT
At the Golmud facility in Qinghai 
Province PRC, Magontec continues to 
commission equipment in anticipation 
of delivery of liquid pure magnesium 
from the electrolytic smelter of Qinghai 
Salt Lake Magnesium (QSLM) our 
partner and largest shareholder. As 
shareholders will be aware, QSLM has 
constructed an electrolytic smelter 
with annual output capacity of 100,000 
metric tonnes of pure magnesium. 
Adjacent to this facility Magontec has 
constructed a magnesium alloy cast 
house with the capacity to take 56,000 
metric tonnes per annum of QSLM’s 
planned output.
In the 3 months since our last 
communication to shareholders, the 
Magontec Qinghai commissioning 
team have focused on preparing the 
Phase A ingot casting line (the first 
line to be installed), together with the 
automated cooling and packaging line, 
for production.
We have already cast many tonnes of 
ingots in four trials and, notwithstanding 
some minor adjustments now taking 
place, we are pleased to report that 
our newly installed equipment has 
performed well and will be ready to 
receive material from QSLM when 
the electrolytic smelter is also hot 
commissioned. Magontec’s new 
magnesium alloy cast house will receive 
raw material in liquid form, directly from 
the QSLM electrolytic cells.
For operational reasons we have 
decided to bring forward the installation 
of the fourth ingot casting line so that 
our Magontec Qinghai team can focus 
on bringing the entire magnesium alloy 
cast house into a fully commissioned 
state, including regulatory approvals, 
by the end of September 2016. We 
have decided that this will be a more 
efficient way of managing the overall 
commissioning process and will allow 
us to conduct trials on all four Magontec 
Qinghai production lines as liquid pure 
magnesium becomes available from the 
hot commissioning and early production 
stages of the QSLM electrolytic smelter.
While there remains much work for the 
Magontec Qinghai commissioning team 
to do, it is pleasing to have completed a 
number of successful trials on the first 
magnesium alloy ingot casting line prior 
to full and final installation of production 
and electronic control equipment in this 
most important investment.
The critical phase of the project now 
moves to the hot commissioning of 
other parts of the smelter complex, 
owned and operated by Magontec’s 
partner, QSLM. The first stage of the 
process is brine purification. This has 
been fully commissioned and is now 
ready for production. The second 
stage comprises two 50,000mtpa 
dehydration units, perhaps the most 
complex part of the process. Unit #1 
has been cold commissioned and will 
commence hot commissioning by the 
end of August 2016. Unit #2 will start 
cold commissioning shortly thereafter. 
The final production stage (prior to 
delivery of raw material to the Magontec 
magnesium alloy cast house) is the 
electrolytic, or reduction, cell house. 
This stage comprises 68 reduction 
cells. It was completed some months 
ago and has been cold commissioned. 
Currently it is undergoing trials using 
MgCl2 supplied from an outside source. 
By this method Magontec Qinghai has 
been receiving small supplies of pure 
magnesium for its own magnesium 
alloy cast house trials over the last 
few months.
While we are close to commercial 
production of material from our new 
cast house it seems likely that there will 
be a slow ramp up of supply; from a few 
tonnes a day in the fourth quarter 2016 
to a few thousand tonnes in the first half 
of 2017.

EXECUTIVE 
CHAIRMAN’S 
REPORT
continued
The hot commissioning process is 
unpredictable and while Magontec is 
in large part prepared for commercial 
production in its own cast house, 
the delivery of liquid magnesium in 
commercial quantities is via a large 
complex project and the timetable 
remains subject to variation.
through the enforcement of VAT 
payments. We expect this to level 
the playing field for Magontec in both 
domestic and international markets. 
The commencement of production 
of magnesium alloys at Qinghai is 
also expected to further enhance 
Magontec’s competitive position.
OPERATIONS – ASIA
The overall Chinese 
magnesium alloy business has 
made another strong positive 
contribution and is tracking 
ahead of budget for the first 
half of calendar year 2016. 
At the EBIT level this business 
unit is now over 40% ahead 
of the first half of 2015.
In China our Shanxi-based primary 
magnesium alloy manufacturing 
operations continue to perform well.
This improvement has been driven by 
further production efficiencies and the 
absence of one-off costs associated 
with the closure of the Suzhou recycling 
facility. Compared with the first half 
of 2015, volumes in the period under 
review have fallen by 18%, in part 
because of the Suzhou closure but also 
because we have selectively withdrawn 
from areas of the Chinese domestic 
market where credit risk is deemed 
to be too high. Indeed in the first half 
of 2016 we have taken another bad 
debt expense of A$202,000. Chinese 
domestic sales have also suffered from 
a decline in demand from electronics 
manufacturers and a slight slowing in 
the broader consumer market.
In the six months to 30 June 2016 
we have continued to witness heavy 
discounting by our domestic Chinese 
magnesium alloy competitors. This has 
been an ongoing issue for Magontec. 
As a publicly listed Australian company 
competing with private Chinese 
entities Magontec does not operate 
on the same tax and commercial 
footings. However, we have begun to 
see greater efforts on the part of the 
Chinese tax authorities, particularly
The magnesium anode business, 
supplying cathodic corrosion 
protection devices to Asian water 
heater manufacturers, has also enjoyed 
a strong first half with volumes rising 
by 19% delivering a sharply improved 
contribution to group profitability. 
Manufacturing efficiency gains have 
allowed our Chinese business to 
penetrate new markets in Asia and 
in the Americas. This growth in 
volumes has had a positive impact 
on margins despite lower average 
selling prices. In the months ahead we 
will be embarking on a new round of 
automation in our Chinese factories 
to further reduce costs and improve 
competitiveness. We will also begin to 
introduce higher performance anodes 
into the high-end Chinese water heater 
sector. A theme over the coming years 
will be the shift to a more consumer-
orientated market in Asia. Demand 
for high quality consumer products 
will likely grow the average value of 
Magontec’s domestic anode unit sales 
as the balance of our Asian sales moves 
towards higher end products.
OPERATIONS – EUROPE 
AND NORTH AMERICA
Magontec’s European magnesium 
alloy recycling operations experienced 
a strong first half with volumes and 
profitability well ahead of 2015. In 
Western Europe our German factory 
has experienced steady volumes and 
benefitted from production efficiency 
gains, achieved over the last 18 
months, through a combination of new 
investment in plant and machinery 
and changes to operating processes. 
Further enhancements to production 
efficiency are anticipated in the coming 
12 months, although of a lower order.
Despite efficiency gains there remains 
spare capacity at this facility as currency 
values have enhanced international 
trade in scrap magnesium alloys at
6
the expense of domestic European 
processors. This is a cyclical event 
and may change again in the coming 
months. Importantly, Magontec in 
Germany is among the lowest cost 
magnesium alloy recyclers in the region 
and is well placed to benefit from rising 
volumes across the European industry. 
In the first 6 months of 2016 magnesium 
alloy imports from China into Europe 
have risen by nearly 12% compared 
with a 6% increase in overall Chinese 
export volumes.
Magontec’s Romanian 
magnesium alloy recycling 
business has continued 
to improve its output and 
production metrics quarter on 
quarter for the last 12 months.
In the six months to 30 June 2016 
Romanian recycling volumes were up 
by over 37% compared with the first half 
of 2015, delivering a strong contribution 
to group EBIT.
The European magnesium anode 
business has also experienced a 
strong improvement on the previous 
corresponding period. As we have 
noted in previous commentaries, this 
is an extremely competitive sector. 
Our response has been to broaden 
our marketing activities into new 
regions, particularly the Middle East, 
to improve production efficiencies and 
address new distribution channels 
into traditional markets. While volumes 
have increased by just 3% over the 
previous corresponding period, profit 
contribution at the EBIT level was 
positive, a pleasing and commendable 
turnaround for a business that was 
loss making in 2014 and the first half 
of 2015. There remains significant 
scope for further improvement in this 
business unit. We have invested heavily 
in marketing and new equipment and 
will continue to improve our offering 
and competitiveness in European 
and Middle Eastern markets in 2016 
and  2017.

Accounting earnings reconciliation
The reported net profit after tax 
of $81,000 for the 6 months to 
30 June 2016 was well ahead of the 
loss of $428,000 recorded in the 
prior corresponding period. When 
adjusted to exclude unrealised FX 
movements, this improvement was 
further enhanced as the Australian 
dollar strength as at 30 June 2016 
had a negative impact.
In addition, the current half saw the 
recognition of a A$202,000 bad debt 
provision with respect to a debtor in 
China. The weak macroeconomic 
environment in the PRC means that 
Magontec continues to focus on credit 
risk management in this region. This 
includes utilising debtor insurance 
where available and considered 
appropriate as well as tightening 
credit limits to certain customers.

FINANCIAL REPORT
D
uring the 6 months 
to 30 June 2016, 
Magontec performed 
strongly on an 
operational level with 
the consolidated 
gross margin coming 
in at 11.2% (30 June 2015: 8.7%). This 
improvement was broad based and the 
company continues to benefit from a 
combination of production efficiencies 
and greater economies of scale from 
increased volumes across both the 
metal and anode businesses.
This drove an uplift in underlying 
operating cash flow generation to 
$2.4 million for the half, a large increase 
over the prior corresponding period. 
This is the key metric that management 
monitors internally. This figure excludes 
working capital movements that can 
have a large impact on overall operating 
cash flow for any given period, but are 
generally only a reflection of timing 
differences.

Balance sheet, working capital 
and banking facilities 
Magontec’s balance sheet gearing was 
30.6% as at 30 June 2016 on a net 
debt to net debt + equity basis (31 Dec 
2015: 25.5%). Although this ratio has 
increased slightly due to higher debtors 
and inventory at balance date, it remains 
within our expectations when compared 
with historical levels.
Magontec’s banking partners continue 
to remain supportive of the business. 
During April 2016, the RMB 20m 
facility provided by Communications 
Bank in China was renewed and the 
company retains $5.8 million of head 
room on its existing facilities in addition 
to $6.2 million of cash on the balance 
sheet at the end of period.

PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE YEARS
Over the next 12 months our focus 
will be on the final commissioning and 
commencement of production at the 
Magontec Qinghai magnesium alloy 
cast house. When this facility comes 
on stream Magontec will be in a 
position to market a highly competitive 
product to its customer base all over 
the World. While our primary concern 
is the safe and successful start-
up of this very complex project we 
look forward to offering generic and
The outlook for Magontec’s downstream 
magnesium businesses is also 
bright. Investment in automation has 
allowed Magontec to compete more 
aggressively in the magnesium cathodic 
corrosion markets all over the World. 
This process has considerable scope 
for further improvements and, with 
both our Asian and European anode 
businesses generating positive cash, 
we are in a strong position to continue 
to reinvest and put a greater distance 
between our business and those of our 
competitors, in terms of quality, price 
and service.
There remain some very significant 
hurdles ahead for Magontec and our 
markets will remain challenging and 
competitive. Our Chinese business 
operates in markets that are volatile 
and subject to considerable economic 
pressures. In Europe our recycling 
business has seen a reduction in 
volumes presenting challenges for our 
German facility in particular. Our major 
customers worldwide are the OEMs and 
Tier 1 manufacturers in the automotive 
industry, which have considerable 
challenges of their own including 
product recalls and high environmental 
targets. Some of these are good for 
Magontec and others not so good. The 
outlook for a major Magontec customer, 
Takata, is as yet unknown.
It is not possible at this stage, prior to 
the commencement of the Magontec 
Qinghai Project, to give any earnings 
guidance. The start-up phase at 
Qinghai incorporates a number of risks 
that are difficult to assess with any 
great confidence. However, as long 
term shareholders and followers of 
Magontec will recognise, there has been 
much improvement in the underlying 
businesses over the last 12 months.

specialist magnesium alloys that boast 
a lower embedded CO2 than any other 
magnesium material offered anywhere 
else in the World. Our customers in 
Europe, the Americas and Asia have 
displayed great enthusiasm for this 
new product and we look forward to 
commencing process and material 
qualification trials in the second half of 
2016. Our largest customers are in the 
automotive industry where embedded 
CO2, along with CO2 emissions, is an 
area of increasing focus.
As we have discussed in previous 
commentaries Magontec has expended 
much effort and capital to reform its 
operating base over the last 3 years so 
that it can manage the challenges in 
key markets with greater confidence. 
We have invested heavily in new sales 
and marketing personnel to better 
access our customers and to develop 
new sales channels. Developing a more 
sophisticated approach to markets 
and production processes allows us to 
manage costs and exploit opportunities 
more effectively.
Over the next few years, as the 
industry’s only truly global magnesium 
alloy manufacturer and distributor, 
Magontec has a number of unique 
opportunities. We have examined 
opportunities to broaden our offering 
through exploiting and further 
developing our comprehensive 
magnesium alloy intellectual property 
portfolio. In addition to the AE family 
of alloys, where much progress has 
been made in recent years, Magontec 
is now the owner of a number of 
additional patents that were previously 
the property of CAST CRC, a research 
entity with whom Magontec had a long 
standing association until its closure 
in 2015. The future of Magontec 
research, which plays an important 
part in delivering higher margins to 
our magnesium alloy manufacturing 
business, now lies with a global group 
of universities and research foundations 
who choose to collaborate with one of 
the World’s leading magnesium alloy 
businesses. We will also develop a new 
research group in association with our 
Chinese partners at QSLM, who are 
keen to invest in new technologies and 
new opportunities to exploit the unique 
characteristics of magnesium metals.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of Compliance
The half-year financial report is a general purpose financial 
report prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 
and AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting. Compliance with 
AASB 134 ensures compliance with International Financial 
Reporting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting. The 
half-year financial report does not include notes of the type 
normally included in an annual financial report and should be 
read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 
31 December 2015.
Basis of Preparation
This report has been prepared on the basis of historical cost 
and, except where stated, does not take into account changing 
money values or current valuations of non-current assets. Costs 
are based on the fair values of consideration given in exchange 
for assets. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, unless 
otherwise noted.
The accounting policies and methods of computation adopted in 
the preparation of the 30 June 2016 half-year financial report are 
consistent with those adopted and disclosed in the Company’s 
annual financial report for the financial year ended 31 December 
2015.
There are no material changes to the Group’s accounting 
policies.

taxes incurred in foreign jurisdictions are not sheltered by these 
Australian tax losses and are governed by relevant tax legislation 
in the various foreign jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
3. DIVIDENDS

(1)
The capital reserve is a historical reserve from 2002 that arose after calculation of the outside equity interest in the (as it then was) Australian 
Magnesium Investments Pty Ltd consolidated entity.
 The foreign currency translation reserve is a result of translating overseas subsidiaries from their functional currency to the presentation 
currency of Australian dollars.
  The expired options reserve captures the balance of unexercised options on their expiry date from the appropriate share capital account.
 The actuarial reserve represents the cumulative amount of actuarial gains/(losses) on the Group’s unfunded defined benefit pension obligation 
as well as movements in deferred tax assets and financial instruments that need to be recognised in “Other comprehensive income” (OCI).
(2)
The opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve was increased by $1.3m from the numbers previously reported at 31 December 
2015 due to a reclassification from retained earnings. This adjustment related to the period to 31 December 2012 and had no impact on the overall 
equity balance.

As at 30 June 2016, the company was in breach of its debt covenant ratio requirements with Commerzbank.
As such, all amounts owing to Commerzbank are deemed repayable on demand and classified as current liabilities in accordance with IFRS.
Notwithstanding this breach, Management remains confident of the ongoing support of Commerzbank for the following reasons:
– such a breach, although a documentary breach, would not cause the Company to be viewed as an unacceptable credit risk;
 –  the Company will enjoy the continued support of its lenders as evidenced by such support in historical circumstances where the same breach
has occurred;
– the Company has a sound working relationship with the Bank; and
– apart from the covenant breach in question, the Company conducts its facilities according to arrangements.
