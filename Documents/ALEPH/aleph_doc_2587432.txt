<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously disclosed 
in Note&nbsp;4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
included in
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarter ended 
June&nbsp;30, 2012, we identified an error in our previously issued financial 
statements for the year
ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2012 
related to the recognition of assets for insurance recoveries related to legal 
and other costs, which we have concluded
should not have been recorded because they were not probable of recovery. In 
addition to the adjustments in 2011 and 2012 related to the assets for insurance
recoveries, we recorded other adjustments
related to the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 and the three months 
ended March&nbsp;31, 2012 to correct for errors for repair and maintenance 
costs, income taxes, discontinued
operations, and the allocation of net income attributable to noncontrolling 
interest. Upon assessing the materiality of these errors in accordance with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC")
Staff Accounting Bulletins Nos.&nbsp;99 and 108, we determined that these 
errors, collectively, were immaterial to the prior year financial statements. 
Since the correction of prior financial
statements for immaterial errors does not require our previously filed reports 
to be amended, the audited consolidated financial statements included in 
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s Annual Report on
Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and the unaudited 
quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements included in 
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s Quarterly Report
on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2012, both of which are 
also incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the 
accompanying prospectus, have not
been corrected for these errors. </FONT></P>

Cayman Islands exempted company and Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. is a Swiss corporation.

respective officers and directors may be residents of various jurisdictions 
outside the U.S. All or a substantial portion of the assets of 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. and Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. and the
assets of these persons may be located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be 
difficult for investors to effect service of process within the U.S. upon these

judgment obtained against these persons that is predicated upon the civil 
liability provisions of U.S. federal securities laws. Transocean&nbsp;Inc. has 
agreed to be served with process with respect
to actions based on offers and sales of the notes. To bring a claim against 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc., you may serve Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s Corporate Secretary,

the Securities Act. There is no treaty between the United States and the Cayman 
Islands providing for enforcement of
judgments, and there are grounds upon which Cayman Islands courts may not 
enforce judgments of U.S. courts. In general, Cayman Islands courts would not 
enforce any remedies if they are deemed to be
penalties, fines, taxes or similar remedies. </FONT></P>

expected to reduce the customer's non-productive time. Each newbuild is also

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

contemplate that each newbuild would be contracted with the customer for a term 
of 10&nbsp;years. These contracts, which are expected to commence in 2015 and 
2016 following shipyard
construction and mobilization, would contribute an estimated total backlog of 
$7.6&nbsp;billion, excluding mobilization. The capital investment for these four
newbuilds is estimated at
$3.0&nbsp;billion, excluding capitalized interest. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

are also in discussions, subject to mutual agreement between us and the

the customer that would own the
newbuilds, whereby the customer would provide a portion of the financing for the
newbuilds (and the customer would participate in profits from the newbuilds 
under such an alternative arrangement). We
have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to the drilling 
services for the customer, the newbuilds, the construction of the newbuilds or 
the alternative financing arrangements, and

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Macondo Well 
Update.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had discussions 
with the U.S. Department of Justice seeking to resolve certain civil and 
criminal claims of
the United
States related to the Macondo incident for $1.5&nbsp;billion over a period of 
years. The parties have been unable to come to an agreement on a settlement. 
There are a number of issues that the
parties would need to resolve in order to reach any settlement, including 
whether such settlement would include or exclude claims under the Natural 
Resource Damage Assessment Process under the Oil
Pollution Act of 1990, the time period for payment, and the factual basis of a 
plea. If we were to enter into a settlement including such payment terms, we 
would not expect that any incremental charge
to earnings related to any such settlement would be required over our previously
announced $2.0&nbsp;billion reserve for Macondo-related claims. There can be no 
assurance that the parties will enter
into agreements on the terms described or at all, nor any assurance regarding 
the timing of such agreements, the effect of such agreements on other claims 
arising out of the Macondo incident or that
any court approvals required as conditions of such agreements will be obtained.

prior to the February 2012 announcement of the settlement between BP America 
Production&nbsp;Co. ("BP") and the Plaintiff's Steering Committee ("PSC"), BP 
proposed a settlement
to us. Later that month, but before the announcement of the preliminary BP/PSC 
settlement, we suggested a settlement of all claims of the plaintiffs 
represented by the PSC. The PSC responded with a
settlement proposal. We made no counterproposal to either BP or the PSC after 
receiving their respective proposals. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
have been no settlement discussions with either the PSC or BP since February 
2012. The settlement amounts proposed by both BP and the PSC were each far in 
excess of the amount
contemplated by our current settlement discussions with the Department of 
Justice. Both of these proposed amounts also far exceeded the amounts we had 
been willing to consider for a settlement with
either the PSC or BP. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard Jackup 
Divestiture.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our asset
strategy to increase our focus on High-Specification Floaters and Jackups, on
September&nbsp;9, 2012 we entered into definitive agreements with Shelf Drilling
International Holdings,&nbsp;Ltd. to sell in a series of related transactions 37
Standard Jackups, including the </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>GSF 
Baltic</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>, and one swamp barge. Of the 38 drilling units, 31 are operating, five 
are stacked and two are being reactivated. The aggregate sales price
is approximately $1.05&nbsp;billion, including seller financing of 
$195&nbsp;million, and is subject to certain working capital and other 
adjustments. The seller financing consists of perpetual
preference shares in the parent company of Shelf Drilling International that 
will be entitled to dividends that are cumulative and payable in kind at 10% per
annum, generally subject to adjustments
escalating up to 14% over time, and are subject to mandatory redemption upon 
certain specified events, including an initial public offering or change of 
control of Shelf Drilling International. The
agreements relating to the transactions contemplate termination fee payments by 
both parties in the event that, under specified circumstances, the transactions 
are not consummated. The transactions
are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012, subject to certain 
conditions. The parent company of Shelf Drilling International is a newly formed
company sponsored equally by Castle
Harlan,&nbsp;Inc., Lime Rock Partners and CHAMP Private Equity and Shelf 
Drilling International is a newly formed company that will own these drilling 
units. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
completion of such transactions on the terms described above, we expect to 
recognize a loss on the overall transactions, and we expect such loss to be 
significant. As of
June&nbsp;30, 2012, the aggregate carrying amount of the long-lived assets 
included in the sale transactions was approximately $1.4&nbsp;billion. The sales
price includes approximately
$200&nbsp;million related to the net current assets associated with the 
transactions. Our total aggregate consolidated goodwill as of June&nbsp;30, 2012
was $3.1&nbsp;billion, a portion of which
is expected to be allocated to the group to be disposed of in the transactions 
based upon the disposal group's fair value relative to our fair value. 
Additionally, we expect to incur between
$120&nbsp;million and $140&nbsp;million of tax, personnel-related and other 
transaction costs associated with the transactions. We also have agreed to 
provide transition and other services to the
purchasers in the transactions and the costs to us of providing such services 
may exceed the amounts we receive as compensation for providing such services. 
</FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
in the third quarter of 2012 we have committed to discontinue operations in the 
Standard Jackup and swamp barge markets. As a result, we would also reclassify 
our seven
remaining stacked Standard Jackups to assets held for sale in September 2012. As
of June&nbsp;30, 2012, the aggregate carrying amount of the seven remaining 
Standard Jackups was approximately
$165&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

Ultra-Deepwater Floaters and a Midwater Floater. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
currently expect estimated out of service days to increase by approximately 
50&nbsp;days in 2012 and 210 days in 2013, as compared to our most recently 
published estimates of the
out of service days as of July&nbsp;18, 2012. The increase in 2012 out of 
service days is primarily due to unexpected repairs on a Harsh Environment 
semisubmersible. With respect to 2013 out of
service days, approximately 50% is due to the acceleration of a shipyard from 
2014 and approximately 30% is due to shipyard scope changes. Changes in 
estimated planned out of service time are based on
a variety of factors, some of which are not within our control, including 
(1)&nbsp;modifications or upgrades to a rig as a result of contract or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Risks Related to the Notes  
</B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> The notes are obligations 
exclusively of Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd., as guarantor, and not of 
Transocean Inc.'s subsidiaries or Transocean Ltd.'s other
subsidiaries, and payments to holders of the notes will be effectively 
subordinated to the claims of such subsidiaries' creditors.  </B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes are obligations
exclusively of Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd., as guarantor of the notes, 
and not of Transocean Inc.'s
subsidiaries or Transocean Ltd.'s other subsidiaries. Each of Transocean Inc. 
and Transocean Ltd. is a holding company and, accordingly, substantially all of 
their respective operations are conducted
through their subsidiaries. As a result, Transocean Inc.'s and Transocean Ltd.'s
cash flow and Transocean Inc.'s ability to service its debt, including the 
notes, and Transocean Ltd.'s ability to
satisfy its guarantee obligations are dependent upon the earnings of their 
respective subsidiaries and on the distribution of earnings, loans or other 
payments by such subsidiaries to Transocean Inc.
and Transocean Ltd. The subsidiaries of Transocean Ltd. are separate and 
distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay 
any amounts due on the notes or to make funds
available to them to do so. In addition, contractual provisions or laws, as well
as such subsidiaries' financial condition and operating requirements, may limit 
Transocean Inc.'s or Transocean Ltd.'s
ability to obtain from such subsidiaries the cash each needs to pay its 
respective debt service or guarantee obligations, including payments on or with 
respect to the notes. Transocean Inc.,
Transocean Ltd. and their respective subsidiaries will be permitted under the 
terms of the indenture governing the notes to incur additional indebtedness or 
otherwise enter into agreements that may
restrict or prohibit subsidiaries of Transocean Inc. or Transocean Ltd. from the
making of distributions, the payment of dividends or the making of loans to 
Transocean Inc. or Transocean Ltd.
Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd. cannot assure you that the agreements 
governing the current and future indebtedness of their respective subsidiaries 
or other agreements of Transocean Inc.,
Transocean Ltd. or their respective subsidiaries will permit such subsidiaries 
to provide Transocean Inc. or Transocean Ltd. with sufficient dividends, 
distributions or loans to fund payments on the
notes when due or, in the case of Transocean Ltd., to satisfy any guarantee 
obligations. We have agreed to provide the U.S. Department of Justice reasonable
prior notice before making substantial cash
payments out of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries, other than in the ordinary 
course of business. In addition, holders of the notes will have a junior 
position to the claims of creditors and
securityholders of our subsidiaries on their assets and earnings, including 
claims and potential claims against our subsidiaries relating to the Macondo 
well incident. In addition, the indenture
allows Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd. to create new subsidiaries and invest
in their subsidiaries, all of whose assets you will not have any claim against. 
As of June&nbsp;30, 2012, Transocean
Inc.'s subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities had outstanding 
approximately $1.9&nbsp;billion of indebtedness, excluding intercompany 
indebtedness. Transocean Inc. is currently
considering a secured credit facility that would be guaranteed by Transocean 
Ltd. and the Transocean Inc. subsidiaries that would provide the collateral for 
such facility. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes represent 
unsecured obligations of Transocean Inc. Accordingly, any secured creditor of 
Transocean Inc. will have claims that
are superior to your claims as holders of the notes to the extent of the value 
of the assets securing that other indebtedness. Similarly, the guarantees of the
notes will not be secured by any assets
of Transocean Ltd. and will effectively rank junior to any secured debt of 
Transocean Ltd., as the guarantor, to the extent of the value of the assets 
securing the debt. In the event of any
distribution or payment of assets of Transocean Inc. or Transocean Ltd. in any 
foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or
similar proceeding, secured
creditors of Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd., respectively, will have a 
superior claim to their respective collateral. If any of the foregoing events 
occur, we cannot assure you that there will be
sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes or with respect to any 
guarantee. Holders of the notes will participate ratably with all holders of 
unsecured senior indebtedness of Transocean Inc.
and Transocean Ltd., and with all of Transocean Inc.'s and Transocean Ltd.'s 
other general senior creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each 
holder or creditor, in the remaining assets
of Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd. As a result, holders of notes may receive
less, ratably, than secured creditors of Transocean Inc. and Transocean Ltd. The
terms of the indenture limit
Transocean Inc.'s ability to create, assume or allow to exist any debt secured 
by a lien upon the drilling rigs or drillships of Transocean Inc. However, these
limitations are subject to numerous
exceptions. See "Description of the Notes and Guarantees&#151;Certain 
Covenants." In addition, the terms of the indenture do not limit Transocean 
Ltd.'s ability to create, assume or allow to
exist any liens on assets of Transocean Ltd. to secure any debt. As of 
June&nbsp;30, 2012, Transocean Ltd. and Transocean Inc. had no outstanding 
secured debt, and Transocean Inc.'s subsidiaries and
consolidated variable interest entities had aggregate secured debt obligations 
of $1.3&nbsp;billion. Transocean Inc. is currently considering a secured credit 
facility that would be guaranteed by
Transocean Ltd. and the Transocean Inc. subsidiaries that would provide the
collateral for such facility. See "Summary&#151;Recent 
Developments&#151;Potential Secured Credit Facility."
As of June&nbsp;30, 2012, a subsidiary of Transocean Services AS had outstanding
secured debt obligations of an aggregate of $989&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each series of the notes 
comprises a new issue of securities for which there is currently no public 
market. If the notes are traded
after their initial issuance, they may trade at
a discount from their initial public offering price, depending on prevailing 
interest rates, the market for similar securities, the interest of securities 
dealers in making a market and the number of
available buyers, our performance and financial condition and other factors. To 
the extent that an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the 
liquidity and trading prices for the notes
may be harmed. Thus, you may not be able to liquidate your investment rapidly, 
or at all. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of the notes do
not prevent us from incurring indebtedness, paying dividends and other 
distributions, repurchasing securities
or entering into a variety of acquisition, change-of-control, refinancing, 
recapitalization or other highly leveraged transactions. As a result, we could 
enter into a variety
of transactions that could increase the total amount of our outstanding

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table 
presents our historical ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the six-month 
period ended
June&nbsp;30, 2012 and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2011. As previously disclosed in 
Note&nbsp;4 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements 
included in Transocean Ltd.'s
Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2012, we 
identified an error in our previously issued financial statements for the year 
ended December&nbsp;31,
2011 and the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2012 related to the recognition 
of assets for insurance recoveries related to legal and other costs, which we 
have concluded should not have been
recorded because they were not probable of recovery. In addition to the 
adjustments in 2011 and 2012 related to the assets for insurance recoveries, we 
recorded other adjustments related to the years
ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2010 and the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 
2012 to correct for errors for repair and maintenance costs, income taxes, 
discontinued operations, and the
allocation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Upon assessing
the materiality of these errors in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting 
Bulletins Nos.&nbsp;99 and 108, we
determined that these errors, collectively, were immaterial to the prior year 
financial statements. Since the correction of prior financial statements for 
immaterial errors does not require our
previously filed reports to be amended, the audited consolidated financial 
statements included in Transocean Ltd.'s Annual Report on Form&nbsp;10-K for the
year ended December&nbsp;31,
2011, which is also incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and 
accompanying prospectus, have not been corrected for these errors. </FONT></P>

ratio of earnings to fixed charges was less than 1.0x for the six months ended 
June&nbsp;30, 2012 and for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 since
total fixed charges exceeded adjusted earnings in each of the periods by 
$316&nbsp;million and $5.5&nbsp;billion, respectively. </FONT></DD></DL>

 <P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have computed the ratios of earnings to fixed charges shown above by dividing 
earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, "earnings" is the amount resulting 
from adding
(a)&nbsp;income from continuing operations before income tax expense, 
(b)&nbsp;fixed charges, (c)&nbsp;amortization of capitalized interest, and 
(d)&nbsp;distributed earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates; and then subtracting (1)&nbsp;capitalized interest, (2)&nbsp;equity 
in earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and (3)&nbsp;the 
noncontrolling interest in
pre-tax income of subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. "Fixed 
charges" is the amount resulting from adding (a)&nbsp;interest expense, 
(b)&nbsp;amortization of debt
discount or premium, (c)&nbsp;capitalized interest and (d)&nbsp;an estimate of 
the interest component of rent expense. Interest expense excludes interest on 
unrecognized tax benefits related to
uncertain tax positions, as such amounts are recognized in income tax expense 
and are immaterial. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ratios of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the six-
month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2012 and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 are the same as the ratios of 
earnings to fixed charges because we had no preferred stock outstanding for any 
of the periods presented. </FONT></P>

</B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes will be issued 
under an indenture dated December&nbsp;11, 2007, among Transocean&nbsp;Ltd., 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. and
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, as supplemented, which will 
be further supplemented by a supplemental indenture dated as of the closing date
of this offering. We have summarized
selected portions of the indenture, the supplemental indenture and the notes 
below. This summary is not complete and is subject to, and qualified by 
reference to, all of the provisions of the
indenture, the supplemental indenture and the notes. We urge you to read the 
indenture, the supplemental indenture and the notes because these documents 
define your rights as holders of the notes. In
this summary, "we," "our" and "us" means Transocean&nbsp;Inc. only, unless we 
indicate otherwise or the context indicates otherwise. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> General  </B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each series of notes will
constitute a single series of senior debt securities under the indenture. The 
principal amount of the 2017
notes and 2022 notes will be initially limited to $750,000,000 and $750,000,000,
respectively. We may, from time to time, without giving notice to or seeking the
consent of the existing holders of the
notes, issue additional notes having the same ranking, interest rate, maturity 
and other terms as notes issued in this offering, except for the issue date and 
public offering price. Any additional
notes having such similar terms together with the previously issued notes will 
constitute a single series of debt securities under the indenture. We may also 
from time to time repurchase the notes in
open market purchases, by tender offer or in negotiated transactions without 
prior notice to holders. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
2017 notes will mature on October&nbsp;15, 2017 and will bear interest at the 
rate of 2.500% per annum. The 2022 notes will mature on October&nbsp;15, 2022 
and will bear interest
at the rate of 3.800% per annum. Interest on each series of notes will accrue 
from September&nbsp;13, 2012. Interest on each series of notes will be paid 
semi-annually on April&nbsp;15
and October&nbsp;15, commencing April&nbsp;15, 2013, to the holders of record at
the close of business on the April&nbsp;1 and October&nbsp;1 immediately 
preceding the applicable interest
payment date. Interest on each series of notes will be computed on the basis of 
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any interest payment date, redemption date or the maturity date of the notes is 
not a business day at any place of payment, then payment of the principal, 
premium, if any, and
interest may be made on the next business day at that place of payment. In that 
case, no interest will accrue on the amount payable for the period from and 
after the applicable interest payment date,
redemption date or maturity date, as the case may be. </FONT></P>

Moody's or S&amp;P ceases to provide a rating of the notes of a series for a 
reason beyond our control, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to 
obtain a rating of such series of notes from a
substitute rating agency, to the extent one exists, and if a substitute rating 
agency exists, for purposes of determining any increase or decrease in the 
interest rate on the notes of a series
pursuant to the tables above (a)&nbsp;such substitute rating agency will be 
substituted for the last rating agency to provide a rating of such series of 
notes but which has since ceased to provide
such rating, (b)&nbsp;the relative rating scale used by such substitute rating 
agency to assign ratings to senior unsecured debt will be determined in good 
faith by an independent investment banking
institution of national standing appointed by us and, for purposes of 
determining the applicable ratings included in the applicable table above with 
respect to such substitute rating agency, such
ratings will be deemed to be the equivalent ratings used by Moody's or S&amp;P, 
as applicable, in such table and (c)&nbsp;the interest rate on the notes of such

case may be, such that the interest rate equals the interest rate payable on the

percentage, if any, set forth opposite
the rating from such substitute rating agency in the applicable table above 
(taking into account the provisions of clause&nbsp;(b) above) (plus any 
applicable percentage resulting from a decreased

provides a rating of the notes of a series, any subsequent increase or decrease 
in the interest rate of such series of notes
necessitated by a reduction or increase in the rating by the agency providing 
the rating shall be twice the percentage set forth in the applicable table 
above. For so long as none of Moody's, S&amp;P or a

interest rate on the notes of such series will increase to, or remain at, as the
case may be, 2.00% above the interest rate
payable on the notes of such series on the date of their initial issuance. If 
Moody's or S&amp;P either ceases to rate the notes for reasons within our

publicly available for reasons within our control, we will not be entitled to 
obtain a rating from a substitute rating agency and the increase or decrease in

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in 
Euroclear's and Clearstream's names on the
books of their respective depositaries which in turn will hold such positions in
customers' securities accounts in the names of the nominees of the depositaries

specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. </FONT></P>

Ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be limited to DTC 
participants (i.e.,&nbsp;persons that have
accounts with DTC or its nominee) or persons that may hold interests through DTC
participants including Euroclear and Clearstream. Ownership of beneficial 
interests in a global security will be shown

themselves DTC participants). </FONT></P>

long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, DTC or

security under the indenture. Except as described below, owners of beneficial 
interests in a global security will not be entitled to have notes represented by
that global security registered in their
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in 
definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders of the notes

payments made on account of beneficial interests in a global security or for 
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial

amounts proportionate to
their beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant global 
security as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that 
payments by participants to owners of beneficial
interests in a global security held through those participants will be governed 
by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities
held for the accounts of customers in

</B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following discussion 
summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the 
purchase, ownership and
disposition of the notes. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury Regulations promulgated under 
the Code, court decisions, published
positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and other applicable 
authorities, all as in effect on the date of this document and all of which are 
subject to change or differing
interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to
holders of the notes who purchase the notes in the initial offering at their
"issue price" and hold the notes as
"capital assets" within the meaning of Section&nbsp;1221 of the Code. For this 
purpose only, the "issue price" of the notes is the first price at which a 
substantial amount of the notes are sold for
cash to persons other than bond houses, brokers or similar persons or 
organizations acting in the capacity of
underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. For purposes of this discussion, 
"holder" means either a U.S. holder (as defined below) or a non-U.S. holder (as 
defined below) or both, as
the context may require. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder generally

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain circumstances 
(see "Description of the Notes and Guarantees&#151;Interest Rate Adjustment"), 
we may be obligated to
pay additional interest on the notes as a result of adjustments to the credit 
ratings assigned to the notes. Special rules, including rules for variable rate 
debt instruments ("VRDIs") and for
contingent payment debt instruments ("CPDIs"), apply to debt instruments that 
provide for payments that vary or are contingent upon a specified event, 
including an interest rate that varies based on
the credit quality of the issuer. It is unclear how these rules apply to the 
notes. We believe and intend to take the position that the notes should be 
treated as VRDIs rather than CPDIs, and the
discussion below assumes that the notes will be treated as VRDIs. It is 
possible, however, that the IRS could assert that the notes should be treated as
CPDIs, which could materially and adversely
affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss with respect to 
a U.S. holder's investment in the notes. Under the CPDI rules, a U.S. holder 
might be required to accrue income at a </FONT></P>

difference between amounts actually received in a taxable year and projected 
payments, and to treat any gain on a

Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the sale, 
exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note will result in 
taxable gain or loss to a U.S. holder
equal to the difference between (1)&nbsp;the amount of cash plus the fair market
value of any other property received by the holder in the sale, exchange, 
redemption or other taxable disposition
(excluding amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest, which will be 
taxed as described under "&#151;Payments of Interest on the Notes," above) and 
(2)&nbsp;the holder's adjusted tax
basis in the note. A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in a note will generally 
equal the holder's original purchase price for the note. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain
or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable 
disposition of a note will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-
term capital gain or
loss if the note is held for more than one year. A reduced tax rate on capital 
gain generally will apply to long term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. 
holder. There are limitations on
the deductibility of capital losses. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual U.S. holders 
that own "specified foreign financial assets" with an aggregate value in excess 
of $50,000 are generally
required to file an information statement along with their tax returns, 
currently on Form&nbsp;8938, with respect to such assets. "Specified foreign 
financial assets" include any financial accounts
held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-
U.S. issuer (which would include the notes) that are not held in accounts 
maintained by
financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals
living abroad and to certain married individuals. Treasury Regulations have been
proposed that would extend this
reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed 
of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets 
based on certain objective criteria. U.S.
holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to 
substantial penalties. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors 
regarding the effect, if any, of this
legislation on their ownership and disposition of the notes. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to our Cayman 
Islands counsel, Ogier, there is currently no Cayman Islands income or profits 
tax, withholding tax, capital
gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by a 
holder in respect of any income, gain or loss derived from holding notes. We 
have obtained an undertaking from the Governor
in Cabinet of the Cayman Islands under the Tax Concessions Law (as amended) 
that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in the Cayman Islands 
imposing tax computed on profits or income, or
computed on any capital assets, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature 
of estate duty or inheritance tax, that tax will not until May&nbsp;31, 2019 
apply to us or to any of our operations or
our shares, notes, debentures or other obligations. Therefore, there should be 
no Cayman Islands tax consequences with respect to holding notes; however, if 
notes are taken into the Cayman Islands in
original form, they will be subject to stamp duty up to CI$250.00 per note.

the basis of that agreement, Switzerland has introduced a withholding tax on 
interest payments and other similar income paid by a paying agent within 
Switzerland to an individual
resident in an EU
member state. The withholding tax is withheld at a rate of 35%, with the option

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

recently signed treaties with Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria providing,
among other things, for a
final withholding tax. The treaties, which are in the process of legislative 
approval in the respective contracting states, may enter into force on 
January&nbsp;1, 2013 and might be followed by
similar treaties with other European countries. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to the treaties, a Swiss paying agent may levy a final withholding tax on 
capital gains and on certain income items derived therefrom, including from the 
notes. The final
withholding tax will substitute the ordinary income tax due by an individual 
resident of a contracting state on such gains and income items. In lieu of the 
final withholding, individuals may opt for a
voluntary disclosure of the relevant capital gains and income items to the tax 
authorities of their state of residency. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
regards the regularization of specific assets defined in the treaties and held 
by individuals of a contracting state with a Swiss paying agent prior to the

treaties, such individuals may opt either for a one-off payment substituting the
tax liability in the state of residency with regard to such assets or for the

assets to the tax authority of the state of residency. </FONT></P>

sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial 
public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus supplement. Any 
notes sold by the
underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount from the initial 
public offering price of up to 0.35% and 0.40% of the principal amount of the 
2017 notes and 2022 notes, respectively. Any
such securities dealers may resell any notes purchased from the underwriters to 
certain other brokers or dealers at a discount from the initial public offering 
price of up to 0.25% of the principal
amount of the notes. If all the notes are not sold at the initial offering 
price, the underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling

the underwriters intend to make a market in the notes of each series but are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice.

connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell notes in

transactions and purchases to
cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the 
underwriters of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in 
the offering. Stabilizing transactions
consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or 
retarding a decline in the market price of the notes while the offering is in

underwriters and their respective affiliates are financial institutions engaged 
in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and 
investment banking,
financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal 
investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the 
underwriters and their respective affiliates have,
from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial 
advisory and investment banking services for Transocean Inc. and Transocean 
Ltd., for which they received or will receive
customary fees and expenses. Some of the underwriters are affiliates of lenders 
under our credit facility, including the agents under that facility, and agents 
and lenders under our subsidiaries'
lending arrangements and are expected to be agents and lenders under our 
potential secured credit facility. Although we intend to use the net proceeds 
from this offering to fund all or part of the
costs associated with the construction of four newbuilds, as described under 
"Summary&#151;Recent Developments&#151;Potential Newbuild Drillships," to the 
extent we do not enter into
such drilling contracts with the customer, and do not construct the newbuilds 
or, to the extent we do not require the full amount of proceeds for such 
construction, we would instead apply the net
proceeds from this offering to the repayment of debt and for general corporate 
purposes outside of Switzerland, and this may include repayment of debt owed to 
underwriters. In the ordinary course of
their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective 
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt
and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own 
account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and 
securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of Transocean Inc. or Transocean Ltd. If any of the underwriters or 
their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of those 
underwriters or their affiliates routinely hedge,
and certain other of those underwriters may hedge, their credit exposure to us 
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these 
underwriters and their affiliates would hedge
such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase
of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, 
including potentially the
notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could 
adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The 
underwriters and their respective affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent 
research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time 
hold, or recommend to clients that they
acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transocean&nbsp;Ltd., 
through its subsidiaries, is the leading international provider of offshore 
contract drilling services for oil
and gas wells. As of September&nbsp;14, 2010, we owned, had partial ownership 
interests in or operated 139 mobile offshore drilling units. As of this date, 
our fleet consisted of 45
High-Specification Floaters (Ultra-Deepwater, Deepwater and Harsh Environment 
semisubmersibles and drillships), 26 Midwater Floaters, 10 High-Specification 
Jackups, 55 Standard
Jackups and three Other Rigs. In addition, we had three Ultra-Deepwater Floaters
under construction. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe our mobile offshore drilling fleet is one of the most modern and 
versatile fleets in the world. Our primary business is to contract our drilling 
rigs, related equipment and
work crews predominantly on a dayrate basis to drill oil and gas wells. We 
specialize in technically demanding segments of the offshore drilling business 
with a particular focus on deepwater and harsh
environment drilling services. We also provide oil and gas drilling management 
services on either a dayrate basis or a completed-project, fixed-price (or 
"turnkey") basis, as well as drilling
engineering and drilling project management services, and we participate in oil 
and gas exploration and production activities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> The Macondo well incident 
could result in increased expenses and decreased revenues, which could 
ultimately have a material adverse effect on us.  </I></B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous lawsuits have 
been filed against us and unaffiliated defendants related to the Macondo well 
incident, and we expect additional
lawsuits to be filed. We may be subject to claims alleging that we are jointly 
and severally liable, along with BP p.l.c. and its affiliates (collectively, 
"BP") and others, for damages arising from
the Macondo well incident. We expect to incur significant legal fees and costs 
in responding to these matters. We may also be subject to governmental fines or 
penalties. Although we have excess
liability insurance coverage, our personal injury and other third-party 
liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and overall aggregate 
policy limits. In addition, we have also been
placed on notice by the Macondo well operator that it intends to make a claim on
our excess liability coverage. Such a claim, if paid, could limit the amount of 
coverage otherwise available to us.
There can be no assurance that our insurance will ultimately be adequate to 
cover all of our potential liabilities in connection with these matters. For a 
discussion of the potential impact of the
failure of the Macondo well operator to honor its indemnification obligations to
us, see "We could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated 
statement of financial position, results of
operations and cash flows to the extent any of the operator's indemnification 
obligations to us are not enforceable or the operator does not indemnify us" 
below. If we ultimately incur substantial
liabilities in connection with these matters with respect to which we are 
neither insured nor indemnified, those liabilities could have a material adverse
effect on us. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a result of the incident, our business will be negatively impacted by the loss 
of revenue from the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Deepwater Horizon</I></FONT><FONT 
SIZE=2>. The backlog
associated with the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Deepwater Horizon</I></FONT><FONT 
SIZE=2> drilling contract was approximately $590&nbsp;million through the end of
the contract term in 2013. We do not
carry insurance for loss of revenue. In addition, we expect an increase of 
approximately $180&nbsp;million in operating and maintenance expenses in 2010 
comprised primarily of approximately
$70&nbsp;million of insurance deductibles, approximately $30&nbsp;million of 
higher insurance premiums, approximately $36&nbsp;million of additional legal 
expenses related to lawsuits and
investigations, net of insurance recoveries, and approximately $44&nbsp;million 
of additional costs primarily related to our internal investigation of the 
Macondo well incident, including consultant
costs, travel costs and other miscellaneous costs. We may also experience 
increased operating and maintenance expenses resulting from changing regulations
and practices related to the Macondo well
incident. The uncertainties and contingencies resulting from the incident, which
have resulted in a reduction of our credit rating by two rating agencies, could 
result in further reductions of our
credit ratings by the rating agencies or could have a material adverse effect on
our ability to access the debt and equity markets, any of which could ultimately
have an adverse impact on our
liquidity in the future. Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard&nbsp;&amp;

relationship with BP, one of which was the operator on the Macondo well, could

for insurance or difficulty in obtaining coverage and the diversion of 
management's attention from our other operations

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined response 
team was unable to stem the flow of hydrocarbons from the Macondo well prior to 
the sinking of the rig. The
resulting spill of hydrocarbons has been the most extensive in U.S. history. 
According to its public filings, as of June&nbsp;30, 2010, the operator had 
already recognized a pre-tax
charge of $32.2&nbsp;billion in relation to the spill, and we expect the 
operator will continue to incur substantial costs related to the spill for the 
foreseeable future. Under the drilling
contract for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Deepwater Horizon</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, 
the Macondo well operator has agreed to indemnify us with respect to certain 
matters, and we have agreed to indemnify
the operator with respect to certain matters. We could ultimately experience a 
material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows to the
extent that BP does not honor its indemnification obligations, including by 
reason of financial or legal restrictions, or our insurance policies do not 
fully cover these amounts. In response to our
demand to BP to honor its indemnity obligations, BP's outside counsel has stated
that BP could not yet determine that it was obligated to defend or indemnify us 
under the contract and that BP has
reserved its rights in that regard. The letter also claims that the operator may
not be obligated to defend or indemnify us based on various arguments, including
alleged breach of contract and gross
negligence or other factors, such as in the event our actions materially 
increased the risks to, or prejudiced the rights of, BP. The interpretation and 
enforceability of this contractual indemnity
depends upon the specific facts and circumstances involved in this case, as 
governed by applicable laws. The question may ultimately need to be decided by a
court or other proceeding which will need
to consider the specific contract language, the facts and applicable laws.

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. government has 
implemented a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in the U.S. 
Gulf of Mexico. Some
operators have claimed that the moratorium is a force majeure event under their 
drilling contracts that allows them to terminate these contracts. We do not
believe that a force majeure event exists
and are in discussions with our customers. In some instances, we have negotiated
special lower standby dayrates with our customers for rigs in the U.S. Gulf of 
Mexico for the period in which the
moratorium is in effect but have also agreed to extend the terms of these 
contracts. The moratorium may result in a number of rigs being moved, or 
becoming available for movement to locations outside
of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which could potentially reduce dayrates worldwide 
and negatively affect our ability to contract our rigs that are currently 
uncontracted or coming off contract. The
moratorium may also decrease the demand for drilling services and negatively 
affect dayrates, </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
the issuance of the moratorium, new governmental safety and environmental 
requirements applicable to both deepwater and shallow water operations have been
adopted. The new
safety and environmental guidelines and regulations for drilling in the U.S. 
Gulf of Mexico that the U.S. government has already issued, and any further new 
guidelines or regulations the U.S.
government may issue or any other steps the U.S. government may take, could 
disrupt or delay operations, increase the cost of operations or reduce the area 
of operations for drilling rigs in U.S.
offshore areas. Other governments could adopt similar moratoria and take similar
actions relating to implementing new safety and environmental regulations. 
Additional governmental regulations and
requirements concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and 
training requirements could increase the costs of our operations, increase 
certification and permitting requirements, increase
review periods and impose increased liability on offshore operations. 
Legislation pending before the U.S. Congress would impose some of these 
regulations and requirements. Additionally, increased
costs for our customers' operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, along with 
permitting delays, could affect the economics of currently planned exploration 
and development activity in the area and
reduce demand for our services, which could ultimately have a material adverse 
affect on our revenue and profitability. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Departments of
Homeland Security and Interior have begun a joint investigation into the cause 
or causes of the Macondo well
incident. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 
Regulation, and Enforcement (the "BOE") share jurisdiction over the 
investigation into the incident. In connection with the
investigation, we have received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General 
of the Department of Interior for certain information. In addition, an 
investigation has been commenced by the Chemical
Safety Board, and the President of the United States has established the 
National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling 
to, among other things, examine the relevant
facts and circumstances concerning the cause or causes of the Macondo well 
incident and develop options for guarding against future oil spills associated 
with offshore drilling. In addition, we have
participated in hearings related to the incident before various committees and 
subcommittees of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United 
States. These hearings may result in changes
in laws and regulations, such as the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic 
Resources Act of 2010 recently passed by the House of Representatives, that may 
have a material adverse effect on the level
of liability that we expect in connection with the Macondo well incident.

June&nbsp;28, 2010, we received a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice 
("DOJ") asking us to meet with them to discuss our financial responsibilities in
connection with the
Macondo well incident and requesting that we provide them certain financial and 
organizational information. The letter also requested that we provide the DOJ 
advance notice of certain corporate
actions involving the transfer of cash or other assets outside the ordinary 
course of business. After preliminary discussions with the DOJ, we have 
voluntarily agreed to provide them with
30&nbsp;days notice prior to repurchasing any additional shares under our share

and credit combined with losses in worldwide equity markets led to an extended 
worldwide economic recession. A slowdown in economic activity caused by the 
recession reduced worldwide demand
for energy and resulted in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas 
prices. Crude oil prices have declined from record levels in July 2008 and 
natural gas prices have also experienced sharp
declines. Declines in commodity prices, along with difficult conditions in the 
credit markets, have had a negative impact on our business, and this impact 
could continue or worsen. Demand for our
services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels
that are directly affected by trends in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas
prices. Demand for our services is
particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production 
activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas 
companies, including national oil companies.
Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices could depress the 
immediate levels of exploration, development, and production activity. 
Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and
natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer 
major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development 
projects. Lower levels of activity
result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could 
have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Additionally, 
these factors may adversely impact our
statement of financial position if they are determined to cause an impairment of
our goodwill or intangible assets or of our long-lived assets or our assets held
for sale. The worldwide
financial and economic downturn may also adversely affect the ability of 
shipyards to meet scheduled deliveries of our newbuild and other shipyard 
projects. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continued economic 
downturn and related instability in the global financial system has had, and may
continue to have, an impact on
our business and our financial condition. Our ability to access the capital 
markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to 
access such markets, which could have an impact
on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The 
economic downturn has impacted lenders participating in our credit facilities 
and our customers, and an extended or
worsening economic downturn may cause them to fail to meet their obligations to 
us. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I> Our business depends on the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business depends on 
the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in 
offshore areas worldwide. Oil
and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices 
significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher commodity prices do
not necessarily translate into increased
drilling activity since customers' expectations of future
commodity prices typically drive demand for our rigs. Also, increased 
competition for customers' drilling budgets could come from, among other areas,
land-based energy markets in Africa,
Russia, Western Asian countries, the Middle East, the U.S. and elsewhere. The 
availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative 
production costs, the stage of reservoir
development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers' 
drilling campaigns. Worldwide military, political and economic events have 
contributed to oil and gas price volatility and
are likely to do so in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offshore contract
drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, 
none of which has a dominant market
share. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. 
Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which 
qualified contractor is awarded a job,
although rig availability and the quality and technical capability of service 
and equipment may also be considered. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and gas price 
levels and volatility. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply 
and high dayrates,
followed by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Changes 
in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of 
excess rig supply intensify the competition
in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. 
Since the onset of the worldwide financial and economic downturn, we have 
experienced weakness in our Midwater Floater,
High-Specification Jackups and Standard Jackup markets. We have idled rigs, and 
may in the future idle additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate contracts in 
response to market
conditions. We cannot predict when any idled or stacked rigs will return to 
service. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
prior periods of high utilization and dayrates, industry participants have 
increased the supply of rigs by ordering the construction of new units. This has
typically resulted in
an oversupply of drilling units and has caused a subsequent decline in 
utilization and dayrates, sometimes for extended periods of time. There are 
numerous high-specification rigs and
jackups under contract for construction. The entry into service of these new 
units will increase supply and could curtail a strengthening, or trigger a 
reduction, in dayrates as rigs are absorbed into
the active fleet. Any further increase in construction of new drilling units 
would likely exacerbate the negative impact on utilization and dayrates. Lower 
utilization and dayrates could adversely
affect our revenues and profitability. Prolonged periods of low utilization and 
dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain 
classes of our drilling rigs or our
goodwill balance if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available
to management at the time, indicate that the carrying values of these rigs, 
goodwill or other intangible assets may not
be recoverable. </FONT></P>

customer in 2009 was BP, accounting for 12% of our 2009 operating revenues. See 
"The Macondo well incident could result in

customer could, at least in the short term,
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our operating and 
maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in 
operating revenues. Costs for operating
a rig are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being 
earned. In addition, should our rigs incur idle time between contracts, we 
typically will not reduce the
staff on those rigs because we will use the crew to prepare the rig for its next
contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be 
immediate as portions of the crew may be
required to prepare rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are 
assigned to active rigs or dismissed. In addition, as our rigs are mobilized 
from one geographic location to another, the
labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In 
general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and 
inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate
depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and 
condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the 
scope and length of contract preparation required
and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are
amortized. </FONT></P>

Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the

termination at the option of the customer
typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various 
circumstances such as non-performance, as a result of downtime or impaired 
performance caused by equipment or
operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure 
events. Many of these events are beyond our control. During periods of depressed
market conditions such as the current
economic downturn, we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking 
to repudiate their contracts, including through claims of non-performance. Our 
customers' ability to perform
their obligations under their drilling

backlog includes signed drilling contracts and, in some cases, other definitive

liquidity issues, and these liquidity issues could increase if commodity prices

working in Angola, the U.K. and Norway are represented by, and some of our

collective bargaining agreements. Many of these represented individuals are 
working under agreements that are subject to ongoing salary negotiation in 2010.
These negotiations could result in higher
personnel expenses, other increased costs or increased operation restrictions as
the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the 
union members. Additionally, the unions
in the U.K. sought an interpretation of the application of the Working Time 
Regulations to the offshore sector. The Employment Tribunal issued its decision 
in favor of the unions and held, in part,
that offshore workers are entitled to 28&nbsp;days of annual leave. Such 
decision has been overturned on appeal by the Employment Appeal Tribunal, but 
the unions have appealed this decision of the
Court of Session. A hearing was held in June 2010, but a decision is not 
expected until at least September 2010. The application of the Working Time 
Regulations to the offshore sector could result in
higher labor costs and could undermine our ability to obtain a sufficient number
of skilled workers in the U.K. Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. 
Congress that could encourage additional
unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such

as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss
of production, loss of well control, punch-throughs, craterings, fires and 
natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms. In particular, the 
South China Sea, the Northwest Coast of
Australia and the Gulf of Mexico area are subject to typhoons, hurricanes or 
other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis, and our

capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Damage 
to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through 
oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled
fires. We may also be subject to property, environmental and other damage claims
by oil and gas companies. Our insurance policies and contractual rights to 
indemnity may not adequately cover losses,
and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. 
Consistent with standard industry practice, our customers generally assume, and 
indemnify us against, well control and
subsurface risks under dayrate contracts. Under all of our current drilling 
contracts, the operator indemnifies us for pollution damages in connection with 
reservoir fluids stemming from operations
under the contract; and we indemnify the operator for pollution from substances 
in our control that originate from the rig (e.g.,&nbsp;diesel used onboard the 
rig or other fluids stored onboard the
rig and above the water surface). Also, under all of our current drilling 
contracts, the operator indemnifies us against damage to the well or reservoir 
and loss of subsurface oil and gas and the cost
of bringing the well under control. However, our drilling contracts are 
individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from the 
operator against the liabilities discussed above
can vary from contract to contract, </FONT></P>

U.S. Gulf of Mexico and war perils worldwide. We also self-insure coverage for 
expenses to ADTI and CMI related to well control and redrill liability for well 
blowouts. Also, pollution and
environmental risks generally are not totally insurable. We maintain a 
$125&nbsp;million per occurrence deductible for damage to our offshore drilling 
equipment. However, in the event of a total
loss of a drilling unit there is no deductible. We also maintain per occurrence

enterprise value after a loss. Our insurance
coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from 
all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations. Our coverage 
includes annual aggregate policy limits. As
a result, we retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits. We 
generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually 
required, and certain other claims may also not be
reimbursed by insurance carriers. Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to
incur substantial costs. In addition, we could decide to retain substantially 
more risk in the future. Moreover, no
assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the
future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against 
certain risks. As of September&nbsp;3,
2010, all of the rigs that we owned or operated were covered by existing

"Endangerment Finding," does not impose any requirements on industry or other 
entities directly; however, after
the rule's January&nbsp;14, 2010 effective date, the EPA will be able to 
finalize motor vehicle GHG standards, the effect of which could reduce demand 
for motor fuels refined from crude oil.
Finally, according to the EPA, the final motor vehicle GHG standards will 
trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources. 
As a result, the EPA has proposed to tailor
these programs such that only stationary sources, including refineries that emit
over 25,000 tons of GHG emissions per year, will be subject to air permitting 
requirements. In addition, on
September&nbsp;22, 2009, the EPA issued a "Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse 
Gases" final rule. This rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring 
operators of stationary sources emitting
more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to 
inventory and report their GHG emissions annually on a facility-by-facility 
basis. Further, proposed legislation has been
introduced in the U.S. Congress that would establish an economy-wide cap on 
emissions of GHGs in the U.S. and would require most sources of GHG emissions to
obtain GHG emission "allowances"
corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. Moreover, in 2005, the Kyoto 
Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
which establishes a binding set of emission
targets for greenhouse gases, became binding on all those countries that had 
ratified it. International discussions are currently underway to develop a 
treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after its
expiration in 2012. </FONT></P>

will be treated as a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, for U.S. 
federal income tax purposes if
either (1)&nbsp;at least 75% of its gross income for any taxable year consists 
of certain types of "passive income" or (2)&nbsp;at least 50% of the average 
value of the corporation's assets
produce or are held for the production of those types of "passive income." For 
purposes of these tests, "passive income" includes dividends, interest and gains
from the sale or exchange of investment
property and certain rents and royalties, but does not include income derived 
from the performance of services. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that we have not been and will not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable
year. Based upon our operations as described herein, our income from offshore 
contract drilling
services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining 
whether we are a PFIC. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our offshore
contract drilling services should not
constitute "passive income," and the assets that we own and operate in

assets. </FONT></P>

material respects from the terms of our
drilling contracts with customers. No assurance can be given that the IRS or a

could determine that we are a PFIC. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders 
would face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless a 
shareholder makes certain
elections available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which 
elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder), such
shareholder would be liable to pay U.S.
federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income
upon the receipt of excess distributions (as defined for U.S. tax purposes) and 
upon any gain from the disposition of
our shares, plus interest on
such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably
over the shareholder's holding period of our shares. In addition, under 
applicable statutory provisions, the
preferential 15% tax rate on "qualified dividend income," which applies to 
dividends paid to non-corporate shareholders prior to 2011, does not apply to 
dividends paid by a foreign
corporation if the foreign corporation is a PFIC for the taxable year in which 
the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a Swiss 
corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of 
countries throughout the world. Consequently,
we are subject to tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between the 
countries in which we operate. Our income taxes are based upon the applicable 
tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries
in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in 
these countries. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
income tax returns are subject to review and examination. We do not recognize 
the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be 
disallowed upon challenge
by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational
structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key 
subsidiaries in certain countries; or if
the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is 
adverse to our structure; or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, 
particularly in the U.S., Norway or Brazil,
our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially 
and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely 
affected. For example, there is considerable
uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or 
business within the U.S. (or maintaining a permanent establishment under an 
applicable treaty), so we cannot be certain
that the IRS will not contend successfully that we or any of our key 
subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (or, when 
applicable, maintained or maintains a permanent
establishment in the U.S.). If we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered
to have been engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. (when applicable, 
through a permanent establishment), we could
be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the 
portion of our earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business during the 
period in which this was considered to
have occurred, in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for 
that period could increase substantially, and our earnings and cash flows from 
operations for that period could be
adversely affected. </FONT></P>

future earnings are, or are projected

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiss law allows our 
shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of 
directors without additional
shareholder approval, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing 
registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two 
years. Our current authorized share capital
expires on December&nbsp;18, 2010. Additionally, subject to specified 
exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to 
subscribe for new issuances of shares. Swiss law also
does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to 
different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. In the 
event we need to raise common equity capital at
a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares
(currently CHF&nbsp;15, equivalent to U.S. $15 based on a foreign exchange rate 
of CHF&nbsp;1.00 to $1.00 on
September&nbsp;14, 2010), we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to 
decrease the par value of our shares or issue another class of shares with a 
lower par value. Any reduction in par value
would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not
subject to Swiss withholding tax. Swiss law also reserves for approval by 
shareholders certain corporate actions over
which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For
example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. These Swiss law 
requirements relating to our capital management
may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility 
would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
we are not successful in our efforts to make distributions, if any, through a 
reduction of par value or, after January&nbsp;1, 2011, make distributions, if 
any, out of qualifying
additional paid-in capital as shown on Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s standalone Swiss 
statutory financial statements, then any dividends paid by us will generally be
subject to a Swiss federal
withholding tax at a rate of 35%. Payment of a capital distribution in the form 
of a par value reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, we 
may not be able to meet the legal
requirements for a reduction in par value. On August&nbsp;13, 2010, the 
Commercial Register of the Canton of Zug rejected our application to register 
the first of four planned partial par value
reductions previously approved by our shareholders in an amount of CHF&nbsp;0.86
per issued share, equal to approximately U.S. $0.86 (using an exchange rate of 
U.S. $1.00 to CHF&nbsp;1.00 as of
the close of trading on September&nbsp;14, 2010). The Commercial Register's 
rejection is related to the fact that Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. has been served in 
Switzerland with several complaints from
lawsuits filed in the U.S. We continue to believe that all prerequisites for the
registration of the first par value reduction have been satisfied and have 
appealed the decision of the Commercial
Register. Without effective registration of the applicable par value reduction, 
we will not be able to proceed with the payment of the first or any subsequent 
installment of our cash distribution to
shareholders. The Swiss </FONT></P>

the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the

additional paid-in capital available for us to pay out as distributions will be

capital as shown on Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s standalone Swiss statutory financial

withholding taxes. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
present Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital 
reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a 35% Swiss 
withholding tax on the difference
between the repurchase price and the par value. At our 2009 annual general 
meeting, our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to 3.5&nbsp;billion 
Swiss francs of our shares for cancellation
(the "Share Repurchase Program"). On February&nbsp;12, 2010, our board of 
directors authorized our management to implement the Share Repurchase Program. 
We may repurchase shares under the Share
Repurchase Program via a second trading line on the SIX from institutional 
investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the Swiss 
withholding tax. Alternatively, in relation to the
U.S. market, we may repurchase shares under the Share Repurchase Program using 
an alternative procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the 
Share Repurchase Program via a "virtual
second trading line" from market players (in particular, banks and institutional
investors) who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the Swiss 
withholding tax. There may not be
sufficient liquidity in our shares on the SIX to repurchase the amount of shares
that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the SIX. In 
addition, our ability to use the "virtual
second trading line" is limited to the share repurchase program currently 
approved by our shareholders, and any use of the "virtual second trading line" 
with respect to future share repurchase
programs will require the approval of the competent Swiss tax and other 
authorities. We may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to
repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on
either the "virtual second trading line" or, in the future, a SIX second
trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to Swiss withholding 
taxes. We have agreed not to repurchase any additional shares under the Share 
Repurchase Program without 30&nbsp;days'
notice to the DOJ. See "Many investigations are ongoing in connection with the

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have computed the ratios of earnings to fixed charges shown above by dividing 
earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, "earnings" is the amount resulting 
from adding
(a)&nbsp;income from continuing operations before income tax expense, 
(b)&nbsp;fixed charges, (c)&nbsp;amortization of capitalized interest, and 
(d)&nbsp;distributed earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates; and then subtracting (a)&nbsp;capitalized interest, (b)&nbsp;equity 
in earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates, and (c)&nbsp;the 
noncontrolling interest in
pre-tax income of subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. "Fixed 
charges" is the amount resulting from adding (a)&nbsp;interest expense, 
(b)&nbsp;amortization of debt
discount or premium, (c)&nbsp;capitalized interest and (d)&nbsp;and an estimate 
of the interest component of rent expense. Interest expense excludes interest on
unrecognized tax benefits related
to uncertain tax positions, as such amounts are recognized in income tax expense
and are immaterial. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
ratios of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the six-
month period ended June&nbsp;30, 2010 and for each of the years in the
five-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2009 are the same as the ratios of 
earnings to fixed charges because we had no preferred stock outstanding for any 
of the periods presented. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debt securities 
covered by this prospectus will be the general unsecured obligations of 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc.
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. may issue two types of debt securities, senior or 
subordinated. The exact terms of the debt securities will be described in a 
prospectus supplement. The senior debt securities
will be issued under an indenture dated December&nbsp;11, 2007, among 
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd., Transocean&nbsp;Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National 
Association, as trustee, as supplemented. We refer
to such indenture as the senior indenture. The senior debt securities will be 
guaranteed by Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. The subordinated debt securities will be 
issued under an indenture that will be
entered into with a trustee and will be described in the prospectus supplement 
for those debt securities. We refer to any such indenture as a subordinated 
indenture. The subordinated debt securities
may be guaranteed by Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. We refer to the senior indenture and 
the subordinated indentures collectively as the indentures. The indentures are 
substantially identical, except for
provisions relating to subordination. The senior debt securities will constitute
senior debt and will rank equally with all of Transocean&nbsp;Inc.'s unsecured 
and unsubordinated debt. The
subordinated debt securities will be subordinated to, and thus have a junior 
position to, Transocean&nbsp;Inc.'s senior debt (as defined with respect to the 
series of subordinated debt securities)
and may rank equally with or senior or junior to Transocean&nbsp;Inc.'s other 
subordinated debt that may be outstanding from time to time. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have summarized material provisions of the indentures and the debt securities 
below. This summary is not complete. We have filed the senior indenture and the 
form of subordinated
indenture with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement, and you should
read the indentures for provisions that may be important to you. Please read 
"Where You Can Find More Information." </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indentures do not limit the amount of debt 
securities that may be issued under that indenture, and do not limit the
amount of other
unsecured debt or securities that Transocean&nbsp;Inc. may issue. 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. may issue debt securities under the indentures from time to
time in one or more series, each in an amount
authorized prior to issuance. The indentures also give Transocean&nbsp;Inc. the 
ability to reopen a previous issue of a series of debt securities and issue 
additional debt securities of that series. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless
we inform you otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the indentures 
do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of 
the debt securities
in the event Transocean&nbsp;Inc. participates in a highly leveraged transaction
or upon a change of control. The indentures also do not contain provisions that 
give holders the right to require
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. to repurchase their securities in the event of a decline in
its credit ratings for any reason, including as a result of a takeover, 
recapitalization or similar restructuring or
otherwise. </FONT></P>

Transocean&nbsp;Inc.

Transocean&nbsp;Inc. under the subordinated indenture and
the debt securities issued thereunder. Unless otherwise set forth in the 
applicable prospectus supplement, Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s guarantee of the 
Transocean&nbsp;Inc. senior debt securities will
be an unsecured obligation of Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. and will rank equally with 
all of its other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. Unless otherwise set forth 
in the applicable prospectus supplement,
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd.'s guarantee of the Transocean&nbsp;Inc. subordinated debt 
securities will be an unsecured obligation of Transocean&nbsp;Ltd., subordinated

payment in full of all Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. senior debt. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Swiss Code of 
Obligations (the "Swiss Code"), the prior approval of a general meeting of 
shareholders is generally required
to authorize, for later issuance, the issuance of shares, or rights to subscribe
for, or convert into, shares (which rights may be connected to debt instruments 
or other obligations). In addition, the
existing shareholders will have preemptive rights in relation to such shares or 
rights in proportion to the respective par values of their holdings. The 
shareholders may, with the affirmative vote of
shareholders holding 66<SUP>2</SUP>/<SMALL>3</SMALL>% of the voting rights and a
majority of the par value of the shares represented at the general meeting, 
withdraw or limit the preemptive rights for valid
reasons (such as a merger, an acquisition or any of the reasons authorizing the 
board of directors to withdraw or limit the preemptive rights of shareholders in
the context of an authorized capital
increase as described below). </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the general meeting of shareholders has approved the creation of authorized or 
conditional capital, it thereby delegates the decision whether to withdraw or 
limit the preemptive and
advance subscription rights for valid reasons to the board of directors. Our 
articles of association provide for this delegation with respect to our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Dividends and Other Distributions
</B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Swiss law, 
dividends may be paid out only if we have sufficient distributable profits from 
the previous fiscal year, or if we
have freely distributable reserves, each as will be presented on our audited 
annual standalone statutory balance sheet. Payments out of our share capital (in
other words, the aggregate par value of
our registered share capital) in the form of dividends are not allowed; however,
payments out of registered share capital may be made by way of a capital 
reduction. Such a capital reduction requires
the approval of shareholders holding a majority of the votes cast at the general
meeting of shareholders (not counting abstentions and blank or invalid ballots).
A special audit report must confirm
that claims of our creditors remain fully covered despite the reduction in the 
share capital recorded in the commercial register. Upon approval by the general 
meeting of shareholders of the capital
reduction, the board of directors must give public notice of the capital 
reduction resolution in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce three times and 
notify creditors that they may request, within
two months of the third publication, satisfaction of or security for their 
claims. On August&nbsp;13, 2010, the Commercial Register of the Canton of Zug 
rejected our application to register the
first of four planned partial par value reductions previously approved by our 
shareholders in an amount of CHF&nbsp;0.86 per issued share, equal to 
approximately U.S. $0.86 (using an exchange rate
of U.S. $1.00 to CHF&nbsp;1.00 as of the close of trading on September&nbsp;14, 
2010). The Commercial Register's rejection is related to the fact that 
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd. has been served in
Switzerland with several complaints from lawsuits filed in the U.S. We continue 
to believe that all prerequisites for the registration of the first par value 
reduction have been satisfied and have
appealed the decision of the Commercial Register. Without effective registration
of the applicable par value reduction, we will not be able to proceed with the 
payment of the first or any subsequent
installment of our cash distribution to shareholders. Qualifying additional 
paid-in capital may only be paid out as dividends to shareholders following 
approval by the shareholders of a
reclassification of such qualifying additional paid-in capital as freely 
distributable reserves (to the extent permissible under the Swiss Code). The 
affirmative vote of shareholders
holding a majority of the votes cast at a general meeting of shareholders (not 
counting abstentions and blank or invalid ballots) must approve reserve 
reclassifications and distributions of dividends.
The board of directors may propose to shareholders that a dividend or other 
distribution be paid but cannot itself authorize the distribution. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the Swiss Code, if our general reserves amount to less than 20% of our share 
capital recorded in the commercial register (</FONT><FONT 
SIZE=2><I>i.e.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, 20%
of the aggregate par value of our registered capital), then at least 5% of our 
annual profit must be retained as general reserves. The Swiss Code and our 
articles of association permit us to accrue
additional general reserves. In addition, we are required to create a special 
reserve on our audited annual standalone statutory balance sheet in the amount 
of the purchase price of shares repurchased
by us or our subsidiaries or predecessors, which amount may not be used for 
dividends or subsequent repurchases. </FONT></P>

auditor must confirm that a proposal made by the board of directors to 
shareholders regarding the appropriation of our
available earnings conforms to the requirements of the Swiss Code and our 
articles of association. Dividends are usually due and payable shortly after the
shareholders have passed a resolution
approving the payment, but shareholders may also resolve at the annual general 
meeting of shareholders to pay dividends in quarterly or other installments. The
articles of association provide that
dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date become
our property and are allocated to the general reserves. Dividends paid are 
subject to Swiss withholding tax, all or
part of which can potentially be reclaimed under the relevant tax rules in 
Switzerland or double taxation treaties concluded between Switzerland and 
foreign countries. Distributions of cash or
property that are based upon a capital reduction are not subject to Swiss 
withholding tax. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dividends,
if declared by us, are expected to be declared, subject to applicable 
limitations under Swiss law, in U.S. dollars, or in Swiss francs, and 
shareholders may be given the right
to elect to be paid any such dividends in U.S. dollars or Swiss francs. Other 
distributions must be declared in Swiss francs; however, shareholders may be 
provided with the option to elect to be paid
in U.S. dollars or Swiss francs. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swiss Code limits our
ability to hold or repurchase our own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only 
repurchase shares if and to
the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves are available, as 
described above under "&#151;Dividends and Other Distributions." The aggregate 
par value of all of our shares held by
us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of the registered share capital. 
However, we may repurchase our own shares beyond the statutory limit of 10% if 
the shareholders have passed a resolution at
a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to 
repurchase shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are 
dedicated for cancellation. Any shares
repurchased pursuant to such an authorization will then be cancelled at the next
general meeting upon the approval of shareholders holding a majority of the 
shares represented at the general meeting.
Repurchased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to 
vote at a general meeting of shareholders but are entitled to the economic 
benefits generally associated with the shares. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Swiss Code and 
our articles of association, we must hold an annual, ordinary general meeting of
shareholders within six
months after the end of our fiscal year for the purpose, among other things, of 
approving the annual financial statements and the annual business report, and 
the annual election of directors for the
class whose term has expired. The invitation to general meetings must be 
published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce at least 20 calendar days 
prior to the relevant general meeting of
shareholders. The notice of a meeting must state the items on the agenda and the
proposals of the board of directors and of the shareholders who demanded that a 
shareholders meeting be held or that an
item be included on the agenda and, in case of elections, the names of the 
nominated candidates. No resolutions may be passed at a shareholders meeting 
concerning agenda items for which proper notice
was not given. This does not apply, however, to proposals made during a 
shareholders meeting to convene an extraordinary shareholders meeting or to 
initiate a special investigation. No previous
notification will be required for proposals concerning items included on the 
agenda or for debates as to which no vote is taken. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual
general meetings of shareholders may be convened by the board of directors or, 
under certain circumstances, by the auditor. A general meeting of shareholders 
can be held anywhere. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect to set the record date for each general meeting of shareholders on a date
not more than 20 calendar days prior to the date of each general meeting and 
announce the date of the
general meeting of shareholders prior to the record date. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B> Extraordinary General Meetings of
Shareholders  </B></FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extraordinary general 
meeting may be called upon the resolution of the board of directors or, under 
certain circumstances, by the
auditor. In addition, the board of directors is required to convene an 
extraordinary general meeting of shareholders if so resolved by the general 
meeting of shareholders, or if so requested by
shareholders holding an aggregate of at least 10% of the shares, specifying the 
items for the agenda and their proposals, or if it appears from the stand-alone 
annual statutory balance sheet that half
of our share capital and reserves are not covered by our assets. In the latter 
case, the board of directors must immediately convene an extraordinary general 
meeting of shareholders and propose
financial restructuring measures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

association, any shareholder may request that an item be included on the agenda 
of a general meeting of
shareholders. Such shareholder may also nominate one or more directors for 
election. A request for inclusion of an item on the agenda or a nominee must be 
in writing and received by us at least 30
calendar days prior to the anniversary date of the proxy statement in connection
with our last general meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that if the 
date of the general meeting of
shareholders is more than 15&nbsp;days before or 30&nbsp;days after the 
anniversary date of the last annual general meeting of shareholders, such 
request must instead be made by the tenth day
following the date on which we have made public disclosure of the date of the 
general meeting of shareholders. The request must specify the relevant agenda 
items and motions, together with evidence of
the required shares recorded in the share register, as well as any other 
information as would be required to be included in a proxy statement pursuant to
the rules of the SEC. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT

carries one vote at a general meeting of shareholders. Voting rights may be 
exercised by shareholders registered in
our share register or by a duly appointed proxy of a registered shareholder, 
which proxy need not be a shareholder. Our articles of association do not limit 
the number of shares that may be voted by a
single shareholder. Shareholders wishing to exercise their voting rights who 
hold their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee should follow the 
instructions provided by such bank, broker or
other nominee or, absent instructions, contact such bank, broker or other 
nominee for instructions. Shareholders holding their shares through a bank, 
broker or other nominee will not automatically be
registered in our share register. If any such shareholder wishes to be 
registered in our share register, such shareholder should contact the bank, 
broker or other nominee through which it holds our
shares. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury
shares, whether owned by us or one of our majority-owned subsidiaries, will not 
be entitled to vote at general meetings of shareholders. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
respect to the election of directors, each holder of shares entitled to vote at 
the election has the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares 
held by him for as
many persons as there are directors to be elected. The directors are divided 
into three classes, with only one class being up for election each year. Our 
articles of association do not provide for
cumulative voting for the election of directors. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to our articles of association, the shareholders generally pass resolutions by 
the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented and voting at the 
general meeting of
shareholders (broker nonvotes, abstentions and blank and invalid ballots will be
disregarded), unless otherwise provided by law or our articles of association. 
However, our articles of association
provide that directors may be elected at a general meeting of shareholders by a 
plurality of the votes cast by the shareholders present in person or by proxy at
the meeting. Our Corporate Governance
Guidelines have a majority vote policy that provides that the board may nominate
only those candidates for director who have submitted an irrevocable letter of 
resignation which would be effective
upon and only in the event that (1)&nbsp;such nominee fails to receive a 
sufficient number of votes from shareholders in an uncontested election and 
(2)&nbsp;the board accepts the resignation. If
a nominee who has submitted such a letter of resignation does not receive more 
votes cast "for" than "against" the nominee's election, the corporate governance
committee must promptly review the
letter of resignation and recommend to the board whether to accept the tendered 
resignation or reject it. The board must then act on the corporate governance 
committee's recommendation within
90&nbsp;days following the certification of the shareholder vote. The board must
promptly disclose its decision regarding whether or not to accept the nominee's 
resignation letter. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
acting chair may direct that elections be held by use of an electronic voting 
system. Electronic resolutions and elections are considered equal to resolutions
and elections taken by
way of a written ballot. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiss
companies may be acquired by an acquirer through the direct acquisition of the 
share capital of the Swiss company. With respect to corporations limited by 
shares, such as
Transocean&nbsp;Ltd., the Merger Act provides for the possibility of a so-called
"cash-out" or "squeeze-out" merger if the acquirer controls 90% of the
outstanding shares. In these limited circumstances, minority shareholders of the
company being acquired may be compensated in a form other than through shares of
the acquiring company (for instance,
through cash or securities of a parent company of the acquiring company or of 
another company). For business combinations effected in the form of a statutory 
merger or demerger and subject to Swiss
law, the Merger Act provides that if the equity rights have not been adequately 
preserved or compensation payments in the transaction are
unreasonable, a shareholder may request the competent court to determine a

liquidation (after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) is distributed

value of shares held, but this surplus is subject to Swiss withholding tax of 
35%. However, as of January&nbsp;1, 2011, new rules apply for paid-in capital 
surplus. Our shares carry no

provisions are intended to
enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the

may have the effect of discouraging actual
or threatened changes of control by limiting certain actions that may be taken 
by a potential acquirer prior to its having obtained sufficient control to adopt
a special resolution amending our
articles of association. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
articles of association provide that our board of directors will be divided into
three classes serving staggered three-year terms. Under the Swiss Code, 
directors may at
any time, with or without cause, be removed from office by resolution of the 
shareholders at a general meeting of shareholders, provided that a proposal for 
such resolution has been put on the agenda
for the meeting in accordance with the requirements of the Swiss Code and our 
articles of association. Our articles of association provide that a decision of 
the shareholders at a general meeting to
remove a director requires the vote of shareholders holding at least

at that meeting. </FONT></P>

to the applicable provisions of the SESTA, any person that acquires shares of an

third parties), exceed the threshold of

shares of such company. A company's articles of
association may either eliminate this provision of the SESTA or may raise the 
relevant threshold to 49% ("opting-out" or "opting-up," respectively). Our 
articles of association
do not contain an opting-out or opting-up provision. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If underwriters are used 
in the sale, the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account.
The underwriters may resell
the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including 
negotiated transactions, at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices 
determined at the time of sale. Underwriters may
offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates 
represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more 
firms acting as underwriters. Unless the issuer
informs you otherwise in the prospectus supplement, the obligations of the 
underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions, 
and the underwriters will be obligated to
purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The 
underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and 
any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed
or paid to dealers. </FONT></P>
<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
and after an offering through underwriters, the underwriters may purchase and 
sell the securities in the open market. These transactions may include
overallotment and stabilizing
transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in 
connection with the offering. The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid, in
which selling concessions allowed to syndicate
members or other broker-dealers for the offered securities sold for their 
account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if such offered securities are 
repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or
covering transactions. These activities may stabilize, maintain or otherwise 
affect the market price of the offered securities, which may be higher than the 
price that might otherwise prevail in the
open market. If commenced, these activities may be discontinued at any time.

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT 
SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
an issuer uses dealers in the sale of securities, it will sell the securities to
them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at 
varying prices determined
by the dealers at the time of resale. The dealers participating in any sale of 
the securities may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the 
Securities Act of 1933 with respect to any sale
of those securities. The issuer will include in the prospectus supplement the

If so, the third parties may use securities pledged by the issuer or borrowed 
from the issuer or others to settle those

out any related open borrowings of shares. </FONT></P>
