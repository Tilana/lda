General Assembly, including deciding on the objectives of the Review Conference, the level at 
which the Review Conference shall be convened, regional preparatory initiatives, date and 
venue;

</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the Durban Review Conference will be undertaken on the basis of 
and with full respect for the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and that there will be 
no renegotiation of the existing agreements contained therein; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides </i>that the review will concentrate on the implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, including further actions, initiatives and practical
