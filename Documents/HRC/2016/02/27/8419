<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, to the Human 
Rights Council, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 16/4. The document 
provides summaries of the communications on specific cases addressed by the Special 
Rapporteur to States, as well as summaries of the replies by States received and their 
observations thereon. 
</p>
<p>2. The cases raised by the Special Rapporteur in this addendum include 
communications sent between 20 March 2010 and 31 March 2011. The addendum contains 
summaries of responses received from States until 13 May 2011. Most of the responses by 
States refer to communications sent by the Special Rapporteur between March 2010 and 
March 2011. However, some of the responses are to cases addressed by him in earlier 
reporting periods. While the summaries of these responses are included in this report, the 
summaries of the cases to which they refer will be found in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s reports 
from preceding years (see A/HRC/14/23/Add.1, A/HRC/11/4/Add. 1 and 
A/HRC/7/14/Add. 1 covering the previous three years, or visit

<p><b>  Appel urgent 
</b></p>
<p>4. Le 19 avril 2010, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale, conjointement avec le Pr&#233;sident du 
Groupe de Travail sur les Disparitions Forc&#233;es ou Involontaires et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur 
la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, a envoy&#233; un 
appel urgent concernant les faits suivants : le dimanche 11 avril 2010, de nombreuses 
familles de disparus, arborant des pancartes, des photos de disparus ainsi que des foulards, 
se seraient r&#233;unies devant le Minist&#232;re de la justice pour manifester leur col&#232;re suite aux 
d&#233;clarations all&#233;gu&#233;es du Pr&#233;sident de la Commission Nationale Consultative pour la 
Promotion et la Protection des Droits de l&#8217;Homme (CNCPPDH), selon lesquelles 
l&#8217;&#233;tablissement de la v&#233;rit&#233; sur le sort des disparus serait irr&#233;alisable. Il a &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; 
rapport&#233; que trois membres de l&#8217;organisation non-gouvernementale SOS Disparu(e)s 
auraient essay&#233; d&#8217;acc&#233;der au Minist&#232;re pour r&#233;it&#233;rer une demande d&#8217;audience et transmettre 
le message des familles demandant l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;enqu&#234;tes effectives sur le sort des 
disparus, mais elles auraient &#233;t&#233; intercept&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;entr&#233;e du b&#226;timent par un policier de 
service et des agents en civils qui leur auraient interdit de passer et leur auraient ordonn&#233; de  
d&#233;poser les photos et le foulard de l&#8217;association, ce qu&#8217;ils auraient refus&#233; de faire. Ensuite, 
de nombreux agents en civil se seraient introduits parmi les manifestants et auraient 
commenc&#233; &#224; disperser brutalement la foule, malmenant et bousculant les femmes et les 
personnes &#226;g&#233;es pr&#233;sentes dans le rassemblement.   
</p>
<p>5. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant &#224; l&#8217;usage excessif de la force par les forces de 
l&#8217;ordre contre ces manifestants pacifiques, et ce dans l&#8217;exercice de leur droit &#224; la libert&#233; 
d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression et &#224; la libert&#233; de rassemblement pacifique. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>6. Dans une lettre en date du 25 mai 2010, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que dans la 
matin&#233;e du 11 avril 2010, un groupe de plusieurs personnes, abordant pancartes et photos, 
s'est regroup&#233; devant le si&#232;ge du Minist&#232;re de la Justice.  
</p>
<p>7. Ce rassemblement a &#233;t&#233; canalis&#233; par les fonctionnaires charg&#233;s de l'ordre public 
jusqu'au moment o&#249; le groupe a investi la voie publique mitoyenne du Minist&#232;re, 
occasionnant un encombrement de la circulation et bloquant ainsi, toutes les voies de 
communication des alentours.  
</p>
<p>8. Les agents de l'ordre public ont alors invit&#233; les personnes ainsi regroup&#233;es &#224; se 
disperser. Ce que la majorit&#233; d'entre eux a finalement accept&#233;, sauf un petit groupe de 
quelques personnes qui ont persist&#233; dans leur attitude.  
</p>
<p>9. Par contre et contrairement &#224; ce qui &#224; &#233;t&#233; all&#233;gu&#233;, les personnes qui se sont 
regroup&#233;es devant le Minist&#232;re n'ont jamais subi de mauvais traitements de la part des 
agents de l'ordre public lesquels, dans un premier temps, les ont simplement invit&#233;s &#224; se 
disperser puis, devant le refus d'obtemp&#233;rer, ont proc&#233;d&#233; &#224; leur dispersion.  
</p>
<p>10. Il convient de noter, par ailleurs, qu'aucune personne pr&#233;tendant avoir subi une 
quelconque violence n'a d&#233;pos&#233; de plainte devant quelque autorit&#233; que ce soit. C'est 
pourquoi, aucune enqu&#234;te n'a &#233;t&#233; ouverte &#224; ce sujet.  
</p>
<p>11. Il y a lieu de souligner, enfin, que la question des disparus a fait l'objet d'un 
m&#233;morandum de r&#233;f&#233;rence adress&#233; par le Gouvernement alg&#233;rien aux Haut Commissariat 
des Nations Unies aux Droits de l'Homme, relatif &#224; l'irrecevabilit&#233; des communications 
introduites devant le Comit&#233; des droits de l'homme, en rapport avec la mise en &#339;uvre de la 
charte pour la paix et la r&#233;conciliation nationale. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
</b></p>
<p>12. Le 11 mai 2010, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale, conjointement avec le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial 
sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et d&#8217;expression, a envoy&#233; 
une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant la situation de MM. <b>Mustapha Benfodil, Adlane Meddi, 
Sa&#239;d Khatibi et Hakim Addad</b>. MM. Benfodil, Meddi et Khatibi sont les animateurs du 
groupe &#171; Bezzzef &#187; qui d&#233;nonce les atteintes aux libert&#233;s en Alg&#233;rie &#224; travers des actions 
publiques pacifiques et son r&#233;seau social sur internet. M. Addad est le Secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du 
Rassemblement Action Jeunesse (RAJ), une association socioculturelle ayant pour objectifs 
la sensibilisation et la mobilisation des jeunes aux probl&#232;mes sociaux, ainsi que la 
promotion d&#8217;activit&#233;s culturelles et des droits de l&#8217;homme. 
</p>
<p>13. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 3 mai 2010, &#224; l'occasion de la Journ&#233;e mondiale de 
la libert&#233; de presse, un rassemblement pacifique aurait &#233;t&#233; organis&#233; par Bezzzef devant les 
locaux de la t&#233;l&#233;vision nationale (Entreprise nationale de t&#233;l&#233;vision-ENTV) &#224; Alger afin de 
revendiquer le droit &#224; la libert&#233; d'expression en Alg&#233;rie. 
</p>
<p>14. MM. Benfodil, Meddi, Khatib et Addad auraient &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;s par la police pour &#171; 
attroupement non autoris&#233; &#187; et transf&#233;r&#233;s au commissariat de police du boulevard  des 
Martyrs &#224; Alger. Ils auraient &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233;s au sujet du rassemblement avant d&#8217;&#234;tre lib&#233;r&#233;s le 
m&#234;me jour. 
</p>
<p>15. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant au fait que les arrestations de Messieurs 
Benfodil,  Meddi, Khatib et Addad soient li&#233;es &#224; leurs activit&#233;s non violentes de promotion 
et de protection des droits de l&#8217;homme. </p>

<p><b>  R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>16. Dans une lettre en date du 5 octobre 2010, le Gouvernement a inform&#233; que le 3 mai 
2010, est apparu, sur un site internet un communiqu&#233; intitul&#233; &#171; lib&#233;rons L&#8217;ENTV &#187;, 
appelant une manifestation devant l'entreprise nationale de la t&#233;l&#233;vision alg&#233;rienne. 
</p>
<p>17. Le m&#234;me jour, un attroupement devant le si&#232;ge de cette entreprise a commenc&#233; &#224; se 
constituer men&#233; per trois personnes, en l'occurrence MM. Benfodil Mustapha, Meddi 
Adlane et Addad Hakim.  
</p>
<p>18. Pour &#233;viter tout d&#233;rapage, les agents de la police judiciaire ont interpell&#233; les sus 
nomm&#233;s pour v&#233;rification d'identit&#233; et examen de situation. Le jour m&#234;me, ils ont &#233;t&#233; 
lib&#233;r&#233;s. 
</p>
<p>19. Aucune poursuite judiciaire n'a &#233;t&#233; exerc&#233;e contre ces personnes.  
</p>
<p>20. De la m&#234;me fa&#231;on, aucune plainte n'a &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e par ces personnes devant la 
Justice, pour quelque motif que ce soit. 
</p>
<p><b>  Lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation 
</b></p>
<p>21. Le 24 ao&#251;t 2010, la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale, conjointement avec le Pr&#233;sident-
Rapporteur du Groupe de Travail sur les Disparitions Forc&#233;es ou Involontaires, le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8217;opinion et 
d&#8217;expression et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, 
inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, a envoy&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation concernant l&#8217;interdiction impos&#233;e 
aux m&#232;res de disparu(e)s de se r&#233;unir pacifiquement et la r&#233;pression brutale d&#8217;une 
manifestation pacifique. 
</p>
<p>22. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, dans la matin&#233;e du 4 ao&#251;t 2010, un large groupe de 
gendarmes et de policiers auraient barr&#233; l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; la place Addis Abeba &#224; Alger, si&#232;ge de la 
Commission nationale consultative de promotion et de protection des droits de l&#8217;homme, 
dans le but d&#8217;emp&#234;cher des m&#232;res de disparu(e)s de se rassembler pacifiquement devant 
cette instance, comme elles le font tous les mercredis depuis le 2 ao&#251;t 1998. 
</p>
<p>23. Une semaine plus tard, le 11 ao&#251;t 2010, une quarantaine de m&#232;res de disparu(e)s et 
de sympathisants auraient tent&#233; de se r&#233;unir &#224; nouveau. Des policiers et gendarmes auraient 
alors fait usage de la force pour r&#233;primer cette manifestation. M. Slimane Hamitouche 
aurait &#233;t&#233; jet&#233; &#224; terre par plusieurs policiers et aurait re&#231;u de leur part des coups de poings &#224; 
la t&#234;te et des coups de pieds. Mme Nassera Dutour aurait &#233;galement &#233;t&#233; frapp&#233;e par 
plusieurs policiers et souffrirait aujourd&#8217;hui de courbatures et d&#8217;h&#233;matomes sur les bras et 
les jambes. Me Amine Sidhoum, qui venait au secours de Mme Nassera Dutour, aurait &#233;t&#233; 
projet&#233;e &#224; terre avec force et rou&#233;e de coups. Mmes El Boathie et Lekhal auraient &#233;t&#233; 
train&#233;es par terre par leur foulard. Cette derni&#232;re, asthmatique et souffrant de probl&#232;mes de 
thyro&#239;de, se serait &#233;vanouie et aurait &#233;t&#233; transport&#233;e &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital. M. Ferhati Hac&#232;ne se serait 
&#233;galement &#233;vanoui lors de cette r&#233;pression brutale et aurait eu de violents maux de t&#234;te le 
lendemain. D&#8217;autres avocats pr&#233;sents, ainsi que des militants de la Ligue alg&#233;rienne des

</p>
<p><b>  R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>26. Dans une lettre en date du 1er d&#233;cembre 2010, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que lors 
du rassemblement du 11 ao&#251;t 2010, quatre personnes virulentes ont &#233;t&#233; interpell&#233;es par les 
forces de police pour les v&#233;rifications d'usages, sans pour autant faire l'objet de violences. Il 
s'agit des nomm&#233;s Melis Arab, Amine Kellou, Imad Boubekeri et Moh Slimane 
Hamitouche. Ce dernier, qui a &#233;t&#233; &#233;galement interpell&#233; au cours des rassemblements des 4 
et 18 ao&#251;t, pour son comportement r&#233;calcitrant et hostile envers les agents de l'ordre public, 
n'a fait l'objet d'aucune violence, avant d'&#234;tre relax&#233; sur instruction de M. le Procureur de la 
R&#233;publique de c&#233;ans, pr&#233;alablement avis&#233; par les services de police.  
</p>
<p>27. Les services de la s&#251;ret&#233; n'ont, &#224; aucun moment, r&#233;prim&#233; les regroupements des 
m&#232;res des disparus. L'intervention des policiers qui ont particip&#233; aux services de l'ordre, 
s'est limit&#233;e &#224; l'application des moyens l&#233;gaux en leur qualit&#233; de force publique investie des 
missions de r&#233;tablissement de l'ordre dans le cadre de la loi en vigueur. Ils se sont acquitt&#233;s 
de leur travail avec une certaine fermet&#233;, mais en faisant preuve de beaucoup de doigt&#233; et 
de tact surtout &#224; l'&#233;gard des femmes et des personnes &#226;g&#233;es.  
</p>
<p>28. Aussi, le fait de faire appel au personnel f&#233;minin et leurs &#233;quipes relevant des 
services de la s&#233;curit&#233; publique et non pas des &#233;l&#233;ments des unit&#233;s r&#233;publicaines de s&#233;curit&#233;, 
habituellement &#233;quip&#233;s de moyens d'intervention, d&#233;note la vigilance des services de la 
s&#251;ret&#233; et l'assouplissement des mesures d'intervention entreprises envers les protestataires, 
pr&#233;f&#233;rant la canalisation du groupe, que de recourir &#224; d'autres moyens, en raison de la 
maitrise de la situation au regard du nombre r&#233;duit de personnes. Le r&#233;sultat qu'il n'ait &#233;t&#233; 
enregistr&#233; aucun d&#233;p&#244;t de plaintes ou d'&#233;vacuation en direction d'h&#244;pitaux en raison de 
l'absence de tout cas de blessure en t&#233;moigne. 
</p>
<p>29. Il est &#224; signaler que les personnes ayant introduit lesdites all&#233;gations, &#224; savoir 
Nacera Dultour, El Boathie Lekhal, Amine Sidhoum et Ferhati H&#224;c&#232;ne, consid&#233;r&#233;es comme 
membres actifs de la pseudo association &#171; SOS Disparus &#187;, entit&#233; qui n'a aucune existence 
juridique, veulent nuire &#224; la r&#233;putation des services de s&#233;curit&#233; d'une part, et tenter de faire 
entendre leur &#171; cause &#187; en d&#233;clin depuis la promulgation des dispositions de la Charte pour 
la paix et la R&#233;conciliation nationale.  
</p>
<p>30. La Gendarmerie nationale n&#8217;a mis en place aucun dispositif, durant les 
manifestations des familles de disparus devant le si&#232;ge de la Commission Nationale 
Consultative de Promotion et de Protection des Droits de l'Homme, les 4, 11 et 18 ao&#251;t 
</p><p>2010. Ce que confirme &#233;galement la Direction g&#233;n&#233;ral de la S&#251;ret&#233; Nationale, qui indique 
qu'il s'agit de surcro&#238;t d'un secteur intra-muros, du ressort exclusif des attributions des 
services de police.  
</p>
<p>31. De ce qui pr&#233;c&#232;de, il ressort que ces all&#233;gations d&#233;montrent l'&#233;chec et le discr&#233;dit des 
instigateurs de cette d&#233;marche inopportune, ayant pour objectif de nuire la r&#233;putation des 
services de s&#233;curit&#233; d'une part, et de tenter de faire entendre leur &#171; voix &#187; en d&#233;clin et ayant 
perdu toute cr&#233;dibilit&#233; et ce, depuis la promulgation des dispositions de la Charte pour la 
paix et la R&#233;conciliation nationale.  
</p>
<p>32. Enfin, il est &#224; signaler que la base l&#233;gale ayant pr&#233;valu &#224; l'interdiction des 
rassemblements des familles de disparus devant le si&#232;ge de la Commission Nationale des

<p>40. El 1 de octubre de 2010, el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n del 
derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, y el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron una carta de alegaciones 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el 
asesinato del Sr. Adams Ledesma Valenzuela en una villa de emergencia o barrio 
desfavorecido de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires. El Sr. Ledesma, de 41 a&#241;os, de nacionalidad 
boliviana, trabajaba como reportero del semanario comunitario Mundo Villa y preparaba la 
apertura del canal de televisi&#243;n Mundo TV Villa, que emitir&#237;a su se&#241;al por cable a hogares 
de la comunidad. El Sr. Ledesma era asimismo un l&#237;der comunitario de larga trayectoria en 
el barrio. 
</p>
<p>41. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el s&#225;bado 4 de septiembre, en la barriada 31 Bis 
de Retiro en Buenos Aires, el Sr. Ledesma habr&#237;a recibido una llamada para ayudar a un 
vecino a reparar un desperfecto el&#233;ctrico, pero al salir de su casa fue asesinado. Familiares 
del periodista habr&#237;an sido amenazados por personas desconocidas cuando intentaban 
ayudarlo en el lugar de los hechos, as&#237; como durante el funeral, en ambos casos inst&#225;ndolos 
a salir de la localidad. 
</p>
<p>42. El Sr. Ledesma sol&#237;a informar sobre problemas que afectaban al barrio, como las 
malas condiciones sanitarias y desperfectos en las v&#237;as p&#250;blicas. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, 
en junio de 2010, el Sr. Ledesma habr&#237;a anunciado el lanzamiento del canal de televisi&#243;n y 
habr&#237;a adelantado que pretend&#237;a hacer periodismo de investigaci&#243;n para informar acerca de 
personajes conocidos que llegaban a comprar droga a la villa. 
</p>
<p>43. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por el asesinato del Sr. Adams Ledesma Valenzuela 
y por la posibilidad que este hecho pudiera estar relacionado con sus actividades de 
promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular con su labor como

<p><b>  Austria

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>48. On 1 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding an alleged plan to 
assassinate Mr. <b>Farid Tukhbatullin</b>, currently resident in Austria. Mr. Tukhbatullin is the 
director of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), a non-governmental 
organisation founded in 2004 and based in Vienna, Austria.  
</p>
<p>49. The TIHR publishes information and submits reports regarding the human rights 
situation in Turkmenistan. A similar communication has been sent to the Government of 
Turkmenistan. The reason this appeal has also been sent to your Excellency's Government 
is to draw its attention to this case so that adequate measures may be taken to ensure the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Tukhbatullin 
</p>
<p>50. According to the information received, on 9 and 11 October 2010, Mr. Farid 
Tukhbatullin was informed by reliable sources that agents of the Ministry of National 
Security (MNS) of Turkmenistan were allegedly planning to assassinate him. According to 
the said sources, Ministry officials had discussed assassinating Mr. Tukhbatullin in such a 
way as not to give rise to suspicion of foul play, such as through an orchestrated &#8220;accident&#8221; 
or by inducing heart failure. 
</p>
<p>51. The alleged assassination plot has reportedly been linked to a recent interview given 
by Mr. Tukhbatullin concerning the TIHR&#8217;s assessment of the human rights situation in 
Turkmenistan. The interview was broadcast on the satellite TV channel K+ on 28 and 29 
September 2010.  
</p>
<p>52. In a possibly related incident, the TIHR&#8217;s website was subsequently attacked by an 
unknown group of hackers and was largely inaccessible for several days following the 
broadcast of the interview. 
</p>
<p>53. It is reported that on 18 October 2010, Mr. Tukhbatullin, along with the founding 
chairman of the Republican Party of Turkmenistan in exile, Mr. Nurmuhammet Khanamov, 
were denied registration as participants in the OSCE review conference at Hofburg Palace, 
Vienna. However, On 19 October 2010, the decision was taken to grant Messrs. 
Tukhbatullin and Khanamov admission to the conference, which allegedly prompted the 
official delegation of Turkmenistan to leave the conference room.  
</p>
<p>54. It is reported that the Turkmen authorities have on various occasions attempted to 
hinder the work of the TIHR, such as through attempting to identify its correspondents 
within Turkmenistan, whose identities are not disclosed. It is alleged that in June 2010, 
officials from the MNS visited several schools in Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s former home town, 
and interviewed former classmates, teachers, and friends of Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s sons with a 
view to identifying such correspondents. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>55. It has also been reported that in April 2008, Mr. Tukhbatullin was warned by a 
Turkmenistani diplomat to &#8220;tone down&#8221; criticism of the Turkmenistani authorities on his 
organization&#8217;s website, or cease his activities entirely. 
</p>
<p>56. Mr. Tukhbatullin, who has worked on environmental and human rights issues in 
Turkmenistan since 1993, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkmenistan in December 2002, 
allegedly as a result of his human rights activities. Following his release from prison in 
April 2003, he left Turkmenistan for Austria, where he was granted refugee status, and 
founded the TIHR in November 2004.  
</p>
<p>57. Concern was expressed that the alleged plot to assassinate Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin 
may have been related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights in 
Turkmenistan. In this connection, serious concern is also expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin and his family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>58. In a letter dated 10 December 2010, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
sent on 1 November 2010.  
</p>
<p>59. Austria considers the aforementioned case to be serious, and confirms that there is a 
clear risk situation. The facts as they are set out in the urgent appeal correspond with those 
available to the competent Austrian authorities.  
</p>
<p>60. Immediately after the alleged threats against Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin were brought to 
the Attention of Austria, the competent Austrian Authorities have contacted Mr. 
Tukhbatullin and subsequently taken all necessary measures based on a risk analysis. 
</p>
<p>61. For the sake of Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s personal safety details of the security and 
investigative measures cannot be unveiled. However, Austria would like to reassure that the 
competent authorities are taking the case of Mr. Tukhbatullin very seriously and provide all 
necessary protective measures to ensure Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s personal safety in Austria. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Austria for responding to his 
communication dated 1 November 2010 and takes note of the measures taken by the 
Government to ensure that Mr. Turkbatullin&#8217;s security needs are met.  
</p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 16 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Human Rights 
House Azerbaijan</b>, which has been registered as a partner of the International Human 
Rights House Network since 2007 and works on the promotion and protection of human 
rights in Azerbaijan.   
</p>
<p>64. According to the information received, on 10 March 2010, Human Rights House 
Azerbaijan was allegedly ordered by the Ministry of Justice to cease all activities with 
immediate effect. The Ministry of Justice reportedly stated that Human Rights House 
Azerbaijan must obtain prior permission from the State in order to conduct its activities in 
the future. It is reported that Human Rights House Azerbaijan was not issued with a 
warning. It was reported that the Human Rights House Azerbaijan operates as a meeting 
place, a resource centre and a focal point for human rights organizations in the country. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>65. Concern was expressed that the closure of Human Rights House Azerbaijan will 
impede its legitimate work on the promotion and protection of human rights and will 
hamper the meeting and coordination of other human rights defenders working in the 
country. Further concern was expressed that such a measure may encroach upon the rights 
of many human rights defenders to freedom of expression, assembly and association, and as 
such may have a negative impact on the community as a whole.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>66. In a letter dated 5 May 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent on 16 
March 2011 as follows.  
</p>
<p>67. According to article 4.1 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on &#8220;State 
registration and registry of the legal entities&#8221;, any entity seeking to acquire a legal status in 
the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as representation or branch of the foreign non-
governmental organizations should be registered and included to the state registry. The 
representations or branches of the foreign non-governmental organizations can operate only 
after state registration.  
</p>
<p>68. The Azerbaijani representation of the Norwegian &#8220;Human Rights House&#8221; has been 
registered on 25 May 2007 and started to operate freely.  
</p>
<p>69. According to article 12.3 of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on &#8220;Non-
governmental organizations&#8221;, the representations or branches of the foreign non-
governmental organizations are registered based on the agreements signed with them.  
</p>
<p>70. Because of absence of the relevant agreement in conformity with the legislation, the 
Ministry of Justice demanded the Azerbaijani representation of the Norwegian &#8220;Human 
Rights House&#8221; to cease its activity and stated the necessity of solving the issue within the 
parameters of the national legislation.  
</p>
<p>71. It should be noted that the notification of concluding agreement doesn&#8217;t restrict the 
realization of human rights enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. The said agreement is signed by the reciprocal understanding and provides the 
organization with additional guarantees.  
</p>
<p>72. On 21 April 2011 the meeting was held in the Ministry of Justice with Maria Dahle, 
Executive Director of the Oslo-based Human Rights House Foundation, Ane Bonde, 
Programe Manager on Caucus and Eastern Europe and representatives of Baku Office of 
the organization.  
</p>
<p>73. During the meeting, the representatives of &#8220;Human Rights House&#8221; have been 
informed about the measures taken regarding the development of civil society, non-
governmental sector, democratic reforms and the improvement of the legislation. It was 
highlighted that the branch of &#8220;Human Rights House&#8221; had been registered and there was no 
obstacle and biased attitude to the activity of the organization, the latter should simply 
respect the requirements laid down in legislation and sign an agreement in accordance with 
the regulation on &#8220;Rules for conducting negotiations and signing agreements on state 
registration of foreign non-governmental organizations&#8221; approved by the Cabinet of 
Ministers in March 2011. The representatives of the &#8220;Human Rights House&#8221; underscored 
their respect to the national legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Furthermore, they 
appreciated the cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and expressed their readiness to 
conduct discussions in order to sign an agreement.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>75. On 28 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations regarding the situation of 
the <b>Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS)</b>, an organization established in 2001 to 
promote human rights in Bahrain. According to the information received, on 21 March 
2010, BHRS sent a letter to the Bahraini Ministry of Social Development asking, pursuant 
to a recently established practice, that it addresses the Directorate of Immigration and 
Passports to facilitate the granting of visas of foreign participants attending its capacity 
building workshop on human rights scheduled to take place from 27 to 29 May 2010. The 
workshop, organized in collaboration with the Association for the Prevention of Torture, 
was to address several issues related to the rights of detainees and prisoners such as the 
basic rules for the treatment of prisoners, the use of international human rights mechanisms, 
and the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture and other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>76. On 19 April 2010, BHRS was denied the holding of the workshop by a letter from 
the Ministry of Social Development. The letter allegedly stated that &#8220;after reviewing the 
request and the program of the event, it was found that the workshop contradicts with the 
objectives of BHRS by-laws, Decree Law No. (21) of 1989 Promulgating the Law on 
associations and social and cultural clubs and organizations working in the field of youth 
sports and private institutions, and in  particular Article 18, which states: &#8216;the 
Association may not get involved in political activities&#8217;. And therefore we are unable to 
approve your request mentioned above; this stresses the need to comply with ... the law.&#8221;   
</p>
<p>77. Concern was expressed that the denial of permission of the workshop might be 
directly related to the work of BHRS in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>78. In a letter dated 11 January 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 28 April 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of 
finalization of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position 
to summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>79. On 20 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, sent a 
joint urgent appeal regarding the situation of Dr.<b> Abduljalil Al Singace</b>, Director and 
Spokesperson of the Human Rights Bureau of the Haq Movement for Civil Liberties and 
Democracy, Mr.<b> Abdul Ghani Al Kanja</b>, Spokesperson of the National Committee for 
Martyrs and Victims of Torture, Mr. <b>Jaffar Al-Hessabi</b>, a Bahraini human right activist 
who has been living in the United Kingdom (UK) for 15 years where he has advocated for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>the release of political prisoners, Mr.<b> Mohammed Saeed</b>, a board member of the non-
governmental organization Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, as well as <b>Sheikh 
Mohammed Al-Moqdad</b>, <b>Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori</b>, <b>Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos</b> and <b>Sheikh 
Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder</b>, four religious and political activists.  
</p>
<p>80. According to the information received, on 13 August 2010, Mr. Abduljalil Al 
Singace was reportedly arrested at Bahrain International Airport on his way back from the 
UK with his family, following his participation on 5 August in a seminar on the human 
rights situation in Bahrain held at the House of Lords, during which he denounced the 
alleged deterioration of the human rights and environmental situation in the country. During 
his stay in the UK, Mr. Al Singace took the opportunity to meet with a number of 
international human rights organizations. According to reports, Mr. Al Singace, who is 
disabled and requires the use of a wheelchair, was forcefully apprehended by the 
authorities. On the same day, a peaceful demonstration in solidarity took place in front of 
Mr. Al Singace&#8217;s house, and was violently repressed by security forces using tear-gas, 
sound bombs and rubber bullets. Several demonstrators were injured in the course of the 
operation. 
</p>
<p>81. On 15 August 2010, security forces raided Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja&#8217;s home, 
arrested him and confiscated his computer and mobile phones. 
</p>
<p>82. It was reported that Messrs Al Singace and Al Kanja are accused of &#8220;forming an 
organized network aiming at weakening the security and the stability of the country&#8221; under 
the Anti-Terrorism Law and the Criminal Code. According to Mr Al Singace&#8217;s lawyer who 
spoke to the Public Prosecution Office, case numbers are yet to be assigned and Mr. 
Abduljalil Al Singace will face charges of sedition and making unauthorised contact with 
foreign bodies. Both Messrs Al Singace and Al Kanja are reportedly denied access to their 
lawyer and to their families. Their whereabouts remain unknown as of 20 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>83. On 16 August 2010, Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi was arrested at Bahrain International 
Airport on his way back from Iran, following his participation in peaceful protests in 
London. 
</p>
<p>84. On 17 August 2010, Mr. Mohammed Saeed was arrested at his home. 
</p>
<p>85. Finally, between 15 and 17 August 2010, Messrs Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad, 
Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos and Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder 
were arrested following their recent participation in peaceful protests calling for the release 
of political prisoners. 
</p>
<p>86. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Messrs Abduljalil 
Al Singace, Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Jaffar Al-Hessabi, Mohammed Saeed, Sheikh 
Mohammed Al-Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos and Sheikh 
Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder, and the charges brought against some of them, may be linked to 
their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, while exercising their right to freedom 
of opinion and expression. In view of the incommunicado detention of Messrs Abduljalil Al 
Singace and Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, and possibly of Messrs Jaffar Al-Hessabi, Mohammed 
Saeed, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos 
and Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder, further concerns are expressed for their physical and 
psychological integrity, most notably for Abduljalil Al Singace who is disabled and needs 
assistance to walk. Finally, concern was expressed about the excessive use of force against 
participants of the peaceful protest in front of Mr. Abduljalil Al Singace&#8217;s house. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>87. In a letter dated 12 October 2010, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
sent on 20 August 2010 as follows.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>88. The eight suspects have been arrested because evidence has emerged that they are 
allied in a structured network aimed at compromising national security and abusing the 
country&#8217;s stability. Namely, this network aims to overthrow and change the political system 
of the country, dissolve the constitution and obstruct the enforcement of its provisions, 
inciting and planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and contempt against the regime, 
threatening public order and endangering the safety and security of the Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>89. This network has spread disorder in the country by recruiting youths and juveniles 
and inciting them to compose sabotage groups to commit acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, attacking security personnel, nationals and foreigners 
residing in Bahrain, terrorizing them and damaging their private properties. 
</p>
<p>90. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law No.58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. The suspects were arrested under this law 
and not under Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects must be 
brought before the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest. According to Article 27 of 
Law No. 58 of 2006, Judicial Officers are granted the right, subject to the emergence of 
sufficient evidence, to issue a protective custody order for a period not exceeding five days, 
and if necessary, permission may be obtained from the Public Prosecution to extend the 
custody to a period not exceeding 10 days. Such permission is strictly granted if the Judicial 
Officer provides sufficient evidence that the extension of the custody is essential for the 
continuation of the investigations. Following this period of 10 days, the suspects were duly 
referred to the Public Prosecution. 
</p>
<p>91. As a principal division of the judicial authority, the Public Prosecution have 
commenced and handled criminal proceedings. Working in its capacity as an investigation 
and indictment authority, and, following intensive investigations by prosecutors into the 
clandestine terror network, the eight suspects were laid with 12 charges under the Penal 
Code No. 15 of 1976, Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from 
Terrorist Acts and Law No. 4 of 2001 with respect to Countering Money Laundering and 
Financing of Terrorism. The charges include: founding, organising and managing an 
outlawed organisation with the aim of violating the law and disrupting provisions of the 
constitution and to prevent public authorities from exercising their duties, using terrorism; 
creation and establishment of an organization with the objective of overthrowing the 
regime, changing the statutes and using illegal violent means such as arson and vandalism; 
taking part in acts of sabotage, destruction and arson with terrorist attempt; raising funds for 
an organization that is involved in terrorist acts inside the country, willingly and 
knowingly; disseminating hatred and mockery of the political system through public 
speeches and the internet; agreeing and inciting to destroy public property; spreading 
provocative propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public security and cause 
damages to public interests; publicly instigating sectarian hatred which disturbs civil peace; 
inciting others through public speeches and the Internet to disregard the law; inciting 
participation in public congregations with the purpose of committing arson, vandalism, and 
confronting the security authorities; and unlawfully using force and violence to compel a 
public servant to abstain from his duty. 
</p>
<p>92. It is clear that all charges are on terror crimes, use of force and instigation to it. In 
this regard, it should be mentioned that all guarantees relevant to the suspects&#8217; rights have 
been respected during the investigations. 
</p>
<p>93. In response to the information received by the Working Group with regard to the 
reasons for the suspects&#8217; arrest, the Government would like to emphasize that the arrests 
were based purely on security measures, and were not motivated by nor linked to their 
peaceful activities in defence of human rights, but had been in the light of the existence of 
confirmed information, investigations and evidence that they are part of a structured 
network aimed at compromising national security and abusing the country&#8217;s stability. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>94. Following the arrest of the eight suspects, they have all confessed that they were 
indeed involved in forming sabotage groups and instructed them to carry out rioting, arson, 
vandalism and attacking security men. Abduljalil Al-Singace confessed that he supported 
the groups financially to purchase necessary equipment and materials to undertake such 
sinful acts. He also admitted in details that he, along with the other seven suspects, incited 
openly and secretly to spread chaos in the country and to carry out sabotage acts, along with 
fund raising from citizens and businessmen under the guise of religion, charity and support 
for the families of prisoners and alleged martyrs and victims of torture.  
</p>
<p>95. Further, security authorities have arrested individuals who carried out arsons and 
rioting in varying incidents and in various areas, all of whom have confessed that Abduljalil 
Al-Singace was their main supporter and inciter for those acts. 
</p>
<p>96. In relation to the Working Group&#8217;s concern regarding whether the acts shall be 
criminalised as terrorist, the first two conditions (means used and intent) put forward by the 
group will be demonstrated. Firstly, with respect to the means used. The sabotage groups 
have been committing acts of violence, rioting, vandalizing private and public properties, 
carrying out arsons, blocking highways and crippling all forms of life activities. These 
groups have added violence to their acts by using Molotov bombs, homemade bombs and 
sharpened iron bars. Molotov bombs are considered as improvised incendiary weapons and 
are primarily intended to set targets ablaze and destroy them. In fact, two police were killed 
in two separate horrific attacks by Molotov bombs: a policeman, and an innocent Pakistani 
passer-by, father of five. 
</p>
<p>97. Secondly, concerning the intent behind the aforementioned attacks, it may be seen 
from these acts of violence that the sabotage groups are aiming at the destruction of public 
order. They intend to cause fear among the general population and they chose to undertake 
their terrorist acts at night to spread even greater terror in the hearts of the general public. 
Some of the suspects have confessed that this intent was present while inciting the sabotage 
groups to commit acts of destruction to public order. 
</p>
<p>98. Hence, having seen that the means used by the sabotage groups can be described as 
deadly and of serious violence against members of the general population; and, having 
regard that the intent is to cause fear among the population along with destructing public 
order, one may fairly deduce that the bold presence of these two conditions cumulatively 
fulfill these acts to be criminalised as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>99. Last but not least, elucidation shall duly be made on the allegations on the violent 
repression by security forces of the peaceful protest in front of Abduljalil Al-Singace&#8217;s 
house. Principally, the Government has taken all necessary steps to ensure the right of 
peaceful assembly. Acting in accordance with Article 21 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Government recognizes that no restrictions may be placed on 
this right other than those imposed inconformity with the law and which are necessary in 
the interest of national security of public safety, public order or the protection of the rights 
and freedoms of others. In this connection, participants in the protest in front of Al-
Singace&#8217;s house have resorted to violence for realization of the purpose for which they have 
assembled (release Al-Singace), causing their peaceful demonstration to be deemed as a 
riot. Security forces have exercised their authority granted by Article 180 of the Penal Code 
and ordered the demonstrators to disperse. Should the order come to no avail, security 
forces shall be empowered to take the necessary measures for dispersing those who have 
not complied with the order by arresting them and may use force within reasonable limits 
against any person resisting said order. They may not use firearms except in extreme 
necessity or when someone&#8217;s life is in danger. The demonstrators have continued rioting 
despite receiving orders from security forces to disperse. Having ignored such orders, and, 
having regard to the interest of public order, security forces were compelled to use force to 
confront and terminate the mounting violence and disperse the rioters. In this connection, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>security forces have exerted force in accordance with the provisions of the public security 
forces law. Namely, Article 13 has regulated the use of force in dispersing demonstrators 
and rioters. Force is only exerted following the failure of non-violent means, warning of 
resorting to the use of force and being the only remaining means of separation. Along with 
resorting to force in order to obstruct an assault or resistance from demonstrators or rioters. 
</p>
<p>100. In this connection, mention shall be duly made that these rioters and protesters, who 
were initially incited by the suspects, have been camouflaging their acts of violence by 
labeling them as human rights activism or peaceful demonstrations or protests. It goes 
without saying that committing acts of riot, violence and vandalism under the disguise of 
promoting and protecting human rights reflects nothing but a solid violation of Article 3 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone has the right to 
life, liberty, and security of person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to protect 
individuals and groups against the abuse of these fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>101. The Government of Bahrain reaffirms its adherence to the provisions stipulated in 
the UN body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under any form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of detention are treated in a humane manner 
with respect for their physical and psychological integrity and inherent dignity of the 
human person. Most notably, with regard to the disability of Abduljalil Al-Singace, he has 
been provided with a wheelchair and is always assisted when walking. Any arrest, detention 
or imprisonment is only carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and 
by competent officials or persons authorized for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption 
of this Body of Principles would make an important contribution to the protection of human 
rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law any act contrary to the rights and duties contained 
therein. 
</p>
<p>102. It is also worth stressing that the recent arrests have no relation whatsoever with the 
parliamentary elections scheduled to take place on 23 October next. All suspects do not 
recognize these elections. They never participated in them, and not only did they boycott 
the elections, but they called for a boycott ever since the re-birth of parliamentary elections 
in 2002. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>103. On 27 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning the 
case of Mr. <b>Mohanad Abu Zeitun</b>, editor of the Bahraini newspaper <i>Al Watan</i>. 
</p>
<p>104. According to the information received, on 25 August 2010, Mr. Abu Zeitun was 
reportedly assaulted by two unidentified men in the newspaper&#8217;s parking lot. Mr. Abu 
Zeitun was beaten up and stabbed in the shoulder. He lost a lot of blood before paramedics 
arrived on the scene and stopped the hemorrhage. Before fleeing, the attackers set Mr. Abu 
Zeitun&#8217;s car into fire. 
</p>
<p>105. It was alleged that the attack against Mr. Abu Zeitun is linked to the newspaper&#8217;s 
critical coverage of religious riots allegedly led by hardliners from all religious 
communities in Bahrain. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>106. In a letter dated 4 January 2011, the Government responded to the urgent appeal sent 
on 27 August 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>107. Bahrain, which is keen to cooperate with the Human Rights Council mechanisms 
and takes all human rights very seriously, recognizes the importance of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression. Accordingly, the relevant authorities have taken up this matter, 
provided legal assistance and guarantees to the opposing parties and brought the case before </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the courts, which have yet to issue a ruling on it. In dealing with this matter, Bahrain has 
fully met all its responsibilities. Moreover, it wishes to express its gratitude to the Special 
Rapporteurs for their concern and inquiries about this matter. 
</p>
<p>108. On 25 August 2010, the Office of the Public Prosecutor was informed that Mr. 
Mohanad Abu Zeitun, editor of Al-Watan newspaper, had been assaulted by two 
individuals while he was leaving his place of work. Those individuals had beaten him up 
and set fire to his car. In order to ascertain the facts and build an investigation case, the 
Office of the Public Prosecutor organized a visit to the place where the assault had occurred 
and interviewed Mr. Abu Zeitun, whose testimony was consistent with the information in 
the police report on the incident. Mr. Abu Zeitun was also examined by a medical examiner 
to assess his injuries, what caused them and what instrument had been used to inflict them. 
The police were tasked with making inquiries with a view to apprehending the perpetrators 
of the assault.  
</p>
<p>109. On 29 August 2010, two accused persons, Mr. Jaffar Ahmed Nasser Juma&#8217;a and Mr. 
Hasan Ali Mahdi Ramadan, were brought to the Office of the Public Prosecutor and 
questioned about the assault on Mr. Abu Zeitun. They both made detailed confessions, 
which were consistent with the statement given by Mr. Abu Zeitun to the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor on 25 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>110. On 17 October 2010 the case was referred for trial of the two accused persons on the 
following charges: (a) Physically assaulting another person (Mr. Abu Zeitun), for a terrorist 
purpose, by striking that person with a sharp, hand-held object and causing the injuries that 
were detailed in the medical report; (b) Starting a fire likely to endanger the assets and 
property of another person, for a terrorist purpose; in this case, they deliberately set fire to 
Mr. Abu Zeitun&#8217;s car, which is an offence under the Criminal Code (art. 221, paras. 1 and 
2; art. 339, paras. 1 and 2; and art. 277, para. 1); the Protection of Society from Terrorism 
Act No. 58 of 2006 (art. 1, paras. 1, 2 and 5 (d); art. 2, paras. 1 and 3; and art. 3, paras. 4 
and 5); and Decree Law No. 47 of 2002, concerning the regulation of the press, printing and 
publishing (art. 34).  
</p>
<p>111. The court held a session on 28 November 2010 to hear the testimony of a witness for 
the prosecution. The hearing was then adjourned until 12 December 2010, in order to allow 
Mr. Abu Zeitun and a guard at the Al-Watan newspaper building to be summoned to testify. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>112. On 15 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the situation 
of Mr. <b>Abduljalil Al Singace</b>, Director and Spokesperson of the Human Rights Bureau of 
the Haq Movement for Civil Liberties and Democracy, Mr.<b> Abdul Ghani Al Kanja</b>, 
Spokesperson of the National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture, Mr. <b>Jaffar 
Al-Hessabi</b>, a Bahraini human right activist who has been living in the United Kingdom 
(UK) for 15 years where he has advocated for the release of political prisoners, and Mr.<b> 
Mohammed Saeed</b>, a board member of the non-governmental organization Bahrain Centre 
for Human Rights.  The persons mentioned were all arrested between 13 and 17 August 
2010, and their whereabouts remain unknown.   
</p>
<p>113. The situation of the persons named above was the subject of a communication sent 
on 20 August 2010, by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>114. According to the information received, the persons mentioned above, Mr. Abduljalil 
Al Singace (arrested on 13 August), Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja (arrested on 15 August), 
Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi (arrested on 16 August) and Mr. Mohammed Saeed (arrested on 17 
August) are being held incommunicado in an undisclosed place of detention since the day 
of their arrest.   
</p>
<p>115. In this connection, reports have been received indicating that Mr. Abduljalil 
Alsingace has been subject to physical and psychological abuse as a result of which he 
almost lost his hearing ability and has injuries in his back and other parts of his body. 
According to the information received, on 27 August 2010, Mr. Abduljalil Alsingace 
appeared before the Public Prosecutor.  Mr. Abduljalil Alsingace has reportedly been kept 
in solitary confinement since his detention and his prescription glasses have been 
confiscated.  His wheelchair and crutches have been taken from him and thus he has been 
forced to pull himself in the cell with his arms. Mr. Alsingace depends almost completely 
on the wheelchair for his movement since he was diagnosed with polio when he was two 
years old resulting in complete paralysis in one leg and partial paralysis in the other. As part 
of the torture he reported, Mr. Alsingace was kept standing on his partially paralyzed leg 
for two consecutive days.  Moreover, Mr. Alsingace was allegedly beaten on his fingers 
with a rigid object and slapped on both ears until he could barely hear from them.  His 
nipples and earlobes were allegedly pulled with tongs. Mr. Alsingace was reportedly forced 
to listen to the sound of the electricity machines to scare him and was threatened with rape 
against him and his female family members. Mr. Alsingace was also reportedly beaten with 
a rigid object on his back during the interrogation period in order to force him to sign 
papers of unknown content.  
</p>
<p>116. The information received also includes allegations of torture and ill-treatment of the 
other detainees who have reportedly been handcuffed; blindfolded; held in solitary cells; 
denied food and water for long periods; hung by their hands, their legs tied and their bodies; 
beaten until swollen and bruised; deprived of sleep; and forced to listen to the screams of 
others being tortured.  In this connection, we have received reports indicating the transfer of 
some activists and human rights defenders to hospitals as a result of mistreatment, 
including that of Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja.   
</p>
<p>117. Furthermore, according to the reports received, on 6 September 2010, the Bahraini 
authorities published a ministerial order announcing the dissolution of the Board of 
Directors of the Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS) and appointed an employee of the 
Ministry of Social Affairs to administer the society until the holding of a general assembly. 
The grounds reportedly provided were the organization&#8217;s lack of neutrality towards 
Bahraini society and the publication of articles issued by illegal entities on its website. This 
order reportedly follows a statement by the Ministry of Social Development published on 2 
September 2010, in local newspapers in which it announced that it will take legal and 
administrative action against human rights organizations which, according to the Ministry, 
defend a specific category of citizens and neglect the others.  
</p>
<p>118. According to the information received, on 28 August 2010, the BHRS organized a 
press conference with other NGOs and in the presence of family members of detainees, 
including the human rights defenders mentioned above. During the press conference, BHRS 
denounced the conditions of detention and the lack of access to the detainees by their 
lawyers and families and called for respect for the right of due process and a fair trial.   
</p>
<p>119. Concern was expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Abduljalil Al 
Singace, Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi, and Mr. Mohammed Saeed and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>allegations received that all of them are being held incommunicado in a secret place of 
detention since their arrest and that their fate and whereabouts remained unknown.  In this 
connection, concern was expressed about reports received indicating that Mr. Abduljalil Al 
Singace and the other detainees may have suffered torture and ill-treatment during their 
detention as a result of which some of the human rights defenders mentioned may have 
been transferred to hospitals.   
</p>
<p>120. Moreover, concern was expressed at allegations that the dissolution of the Board of 
Directors of the Bahrain Human Rights Society may be related to the activities of the 
organization in defense of human rights in the country, in particular denouncing the 
conditions of detention of the above-mentioned persons, the lack of access to the detainees 
by their lawyers and families and the right to due process and a fair trial.   
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>121. In a letter sent on 12 October 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 15 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>122. In respect to the mandates provided by the Human Rights Council to seek to clarify 
all cases brought to your attention, and, having regard to the information drawn to the 
attention of the Government of Bahrain, allow us to duly clarify two issues. 
</p>
<p>123. Firstly, the situation regarding Dr. Abduljalil Al-Singace, Mr. Abdulghani Al-
Khanjar, Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi and Mr. Mohammed Saeed (hereinafter the suspects): 
</p>
<p>124. As mentioned in a previous correspondence with your respected Working Group, 
these suspects were arrested in the light of the existence of confirmed information, 
investigations and evidence that they are part of a structured terrorism network aimed at 
compromising national security and abusing the country&#8217;s stability through terrorism and 
violence.  
</p>
<p>125. Investigations thus far have found the network to be responsible for inciting and 
planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and contempt against the government, threatening 
public order and endangering the safety and security of the Kingdom. The aim of the 
network is to overthrow and change the political regime of the country, dissolve the 
constitution and obstruct the enforcement of its provisions. 
</p>
<p>126. The network has spread disorder in the country by recruiting youths and juveniles 
and inciting them compose sabotage groups to commit acts of riot, violence and vandalism, 
disturbance of civil peace, attacking security personnel, nationals and foreigners residing in 
Bahrain, terrorizing them and damaging their private properties.  
</p>
<p>127. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. This law grants Judicial Officers the right, 
subject to the emergence of sufficient evidence, to issue a proactive custody order for a 
period not exceeding five days. If necessary, permission may then be obtained from the 
Public Prosecution to extend the custody to a period not exceeding ten days. Such 
permission is strictly granted, and only if the Judicial Officer provides sufficient evidence 
that the extension of the custody is essential for the continuation of the investigations. 
Given the nature of their suspected crimes, the suspects were arrested under this Law No. 
58 of 2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts, and not under 
Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects must be brought before 
the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest.  
</p>
<p>128. Following the ten days elapse, all of he suspects were duly referred to the Public 
Prosecution. As a principal division of the judicial authority, the Public Prosecution has 
commenced and handled criminal proceedings. Working in its capacity as an investigation 
and indictment authority, and following intensive investigations by prosecutors into the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p>clandestine terror network, the suspects were charged under the Penal Code No. 15 of 1976, 
Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to Protection the Community from Terrorist Acts Law No. 
4 of 2001 with respect to Countering Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism. 
</p>
<p>129. It is worth mentioning that the suspects have labelled their acts of violence as human 
rights activism or peaceful demonstrations or protests. It goes without saying that inciting 
to acts of riot, violence and vandalism under the disguise of promoting and protecting 
human rights reflects nothing but a solid violation of article 3 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of 
person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to protect individuals and groups against the 
abuse of these fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>130. With regard to the concern expressed by the Working Groups with respect to the 
physical and mental integrity of the suspects and that they may have suffered torture and ill-
treatment, it is certainly worth stressing that the Government of Bahrain fully reaffirms its 
adherence to the provisions stipulated in the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of all 
Persons under any form of Detention of Imprisonment. All persons under any form of 
detention are treated in a humane manner and with respect for their physical and mental 
integrity and inherent dignity of the human person. Any arrest, detention or imprisonment, 
is only carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and by competent 
officials or persons authorized for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption of this Body of 
Principles would make an important contribution to the protection of human rights, Bahrain 
has prohibited by law any act contrary to the rights and duties contained therein.   
</p>
<p>131. Bahrain strictly refuses any recourse to torture. Any alleged incident of torture may 
not be overseen. It is unanimously agreed in Bahrain and amongst security authorities that 
torture is an unacceptable approach in handling any case or event, be it criminal or political. 
Bahrain has codified strict measures to penalize civil servants or officers should they 
conduct such unlawful acts. The suspects were all referred to forensic doctors and 
apparently, no complaint has been officially lodged by or on behalf of the alleged victims 
of torture. 
</p>
<p>132. It is apparent that the information sent to the respected Working Groups is 
defamatory by all means. It has been noticed that most of the light was shed on Dr. 
Abduljalil Al-Singace and the alleged torture and ill-treatment he and the others are facing. 
It is recognized that Dr. Al-Singace requires extra care due to his partial paralysis in his 
legs. He is provided with a wheelchair and crutches and is always assisted when walking. 
He holds his prescription glasses and he is currently enjoying reading a book he requested 
titled Mafateeh Al-Jenan. The suspects have the right to obtain within the limits of available 
responses, education, cultural and informational material. They also preserve their right to 
be visited by and to correspond with family members and friends, and visits are indeed 
ongoing. The suspects are allowed to exercise and play sports together.   
</p>
<p>133. In addressing the Working Groups&#8217; appeal to seek clarification of the circumstances 
regarding the cases of the suspects, the Government provided a brief account of where they 
stand.   
</p>
<p>134. Dr. Abduljalil Al-Singace: He was arrested on 13 August 2010 and referred to the 
Public Prosecution on 26 August 2010. A warrant has been issued by the Public 
Prosecution to remand him in custody for 60 days. He has a defence team of five lawyers. 
The list of charges was provided. 
</p>
<p>135. Mr. Abdulghani Al-Khanjar: He was arrested on 15 August 2010 and referred to the 
Public Prosecution on 28 August 2010. A warrant has been issued by the Public 
Prosecution to remand him in custody for 60 days. He has a defence team of 7 lawyers. The 
list of charges was provided. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>136. Mr. Mohammed Saeed: He was arrested on 17 August 2010 and referred to the 
Public Prosecution on 31 August 2010. A warrant had been issued by the Public 
Prosecution to remand him in custody for 60 days. He has a defence team of 2 lawyers. The 
list of charges was provided. 
</p>
<p>137. Mr. Maffar Al-Hessabi: he was arrested on 16 August 2010 and referred to the 
Public Prosecution on 31 August 2010. A warrant has been issued by the Public 
Prosecution to remand him in custody for 60 days. The list of charges was provided. 
</p>
<p>138. The above suspects are all charged with criminal offences. They preserve their right 
to be presumed innocent and are treated as such until proved guilty according to law in a 
public trial at which they have had all the guarantees necessary for their defence. In this 
connection, Bahrain assures its commitment to preserving the suspects` right in full equality 
to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal to determine the criminal 
charges against them. The law guarantees the independence of the judiciary and the probity 
and impartiality of judges. In this context attention shall be drawn to article 104 of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>139. The suspects have exercised their constitutional and legal rights and are all legally 
represented and their court hearing will be held publicly. If the suspect does not have a 
legal counsel, he is entitled to have a legal counsel assigned to him by the court and under 
its expense. Judgments may be challenged before the Courts of Appeal and the compliance 
of the judgments of the foregoing courts with the law is examined by the Courts of 
Cassation.  
</p>
<p>140. Secondly, the dissolution of the Board of Directors of the Bahrain Human Rights 
Society (hereinafter BHRS).  
</p>
<p>141. The BHRS has been working in the field of promoting and protecting human rights 
in Bahrain since 2001. The society has contributed to the development of human rights for 
almost ten years and is regarded as one of the most prominent societies working in this 
field. Having respected the work of the BHRS for man years, the Government of Bahrain 
regrets the accusation that the dissolution of the Board of Directors of the BHRS was 
related to the activities of the organization in defence of human rights in the country. The 
dissolution was based purely on administrative and legal measures. It was not motivated by 
BHRS`s activities in defence of human rights, but was a result of committing habitually 
administrative and legal violations. The BHRS have carried out unlawful activities and 
cooperated with illegal bodies, along with engaging itself in political affairs away from 
human rights perception. 
</p>
<p>142. The BHRS refrained from condemning acts of violence and terrorism which aimed 
at compromising national security and abusing the country&#8217;s stability, and at compromising 
national security and abusing the country&#8217;s stability, and to justify such acts in 
contravention of the very basis of its articles of association, related to defence of human 
rights without discrimination, favouritism or biasness for any party. The society 
coordinated with some outlawed bodies known for their incitement to violence, terrorism 
and hatred of the regime within the framework of the so-called alliance for truth and 
equality. It was also apparent that BHRS combined political work with human rights-
related activities, which resulted in lack of impartiality, professionalism and independence. 
BHRS&#180;s website contained several violations and acts in contravention to Legislative 
Decree No. 21 of 1989 with respect to social and cultural clubs and associations. As a 
social society, it was supposed to refrain from engaging in political activities as stipulated 
in article 18, which provides that the society may neither engage itself in politics nor enter 
into any financial speculations. 
</p>
<p>143. Further, the society has published unlawful materials on its website and having 
carried out activities which are harmful to security, civil peace and stability of the country, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>it has thus violated article 3 of the abovementioned law, which stipulates &#8220;Every society 
established in violation of the public order or public norms or for any unlawful purpose or 
reason or with a view to damaging peace of the state or form of the government or its social 
order shall be null and void&#8221;. The BHRS also submitted false complaints to different human 
rights organizations and have spread provocative propaganda, news and false statements to 
destabilize public security and cause damage to public interests, along with filling false 
complaints to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right of 
opinion and expression and Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, 
claiming that the Government had banned the BHRS from organizing a workshop related to 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>144. With regards to the dissolution of the Board of Directors of the BHRS, the 
ministerial order was a result of a proliferation of violations committed continuously by the 
society. Legislative Decree No. 21 of 1989 with respect to social and cultural clubs and 
associations governs the BHRS. Violations of provisions of this law include: article 16, 
BHRS failed to produce its annual budget and did not send its fiscal statements for auditing; 
article 32, BHRS failed to call for new elections for the Board of Directors; article 33, 
BHRS failed to notify the Ministry of Social Affairs prior to convening a General 
Assembly meeting; article 39, BHRS has no viable Board of Directors; and article 46, 
BHRS failed to provide the Ministry of Social Affairs with decisions taken by the Board of 
Directors. 
</p>
<p>145. With regard to the press conference of 28 August 2010, organised by the BHRS in 
the presence of the family members of the suspects including those of the abovementioned, 
the BHRS has exercised its constitutional and legal rights to strive for the protection of 
human rights. The Government of Bahrain considers such actions as an obligation and a 
duty to respect to protect and to fulfil human rights. The authorities of Bahrain have this 
conference and refrained from interfering with or curtailing the enjoyment of human rights 
for both BHRS and family members of the suspects. Bahrain is also bound to protect 
individuals and groups against human rights abuses, and it is grateful to human rights 
NGOs such as BHRS for being whistleblowers and drawing the Government&#8217;s attention to 
any human rights violations. Bahrain is also committed to fulfil human rights and it 
believes that the enjoyment of these rights are best achieved through the facilitation of 
human rights NGOs, hence it welcomes the organization of such conferences. 
</p>
<p>146. What was unfortunate in this press conference was an incident that was drawn to the 
attention of the Minister of Social Affairs by four journalists and three of the attendees. In 
the course of the press conference, the BHRS humiliated the journalists, sworn at them and 
ordered them to leave the hall. One reason for this was a question asked by one of the 
journalists to the BHRS regarding the refrain of the society from condemning the 
assassination attempt of a fellow journalist on 25 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>147. The journalists have sent separate letters to the Minister of Social Affairs 
condemning the unfortunate incident of the press conference. The journalists have argued 
that such attitude by the BHRS is an unacceptable violation of the fundamental principles 
set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>148. The BHRS, along with all other NGOs in Bahrain, reserve their rights of the 
legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human rights as enshrined in the United 
Nations Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognised Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms. They also preserve the right of freedom of expression and opinion, as enshrined 
in the Constitution of Bahrain. Legal action is only exercised against those who deviate 
from the scope of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human rights and 
freedom of expression and recourse to the execution of acts amounting to the abuse of law. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>149. In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that all suspects are not deprived arbitrarily o their liberty and 
are entitled in full equality to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal. 
Bahrain acknowledges the significant role of the Human Rights Council in the contribution 
to the effective elimination f all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
peoples and individuals and fully supports its efforts in promoting universal respect for 
human rights with its determination to examine thoroughly all the cases brought to its 
attention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>150. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of 
Judges and Lawyers; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, sent a urgent appeal concerning the arrest and 
detention of Mr. <b>Ali Abdulemam</b>. Mr. Abdulemam is the creator and manager of the 
www.bahrainonline.org news website, and a blogger who regularly wrote articles regarding 
media freedom and freedom of expression in Bahrain. 
</p>
<p>151. According to the information received, on 4 September 2010 at approximately 9 
p.m., Mr. Abdulemam was arrested following a summons, via a telephone call, for 
questioning by the National Security Apparatus (NSA). Since his arrest, Mr. Abdulemam 
has been denied access to legal representation, and doubts exist as to whether or not he has 
been presented before the Public Prosecutor within the time limits proscribed by law. He 
was denied access to family members until 29 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>152. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest was reportedly declared by the Ministry of Interior to form 
part of an investigation into an alleged &#8220;terrorist network accused of planning and executing 
a campaign of violence, intimidation and subversion in Bahrain&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>153. According to article 27 of the 2006 &#8220;Law to Protect Society from Acts of 
Terrorism&#8221;, which was invoked by the authorities in the arrests of Mr. Abdulemam and 
various other human rights defenders, a suspect may be detained for a maximum of 15 days 
before either being brought before the Public Prosecutor must question the suspect within 
three days and either order him remanded or released. Government officials have claimed 
that Mr. Abdulemam was presented before the Public Prosecutor soon after his arrest. On 
22 September 2010 it was announced by officials that, beginning on 27 September 2010, all 
detained human rights activists would be allowed to receive visits from their families. Mr. 
Abdulemam&#8217;s brother, Mr. Hossein Abdulemam, visited the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
in order to apply for permission to visit Mr. Abdulemam in detention. He was, however, 
subsequently informed by an official at said Office that Mr. Abdulemam had not been 
brought before the Public Prosecutor and that there is neither any record of, nor personal 
number assigned to him, at the Office. 
</p>
<p>154. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s initial 15-day detention period expired on 19 September 2010; if 
true, the aforementioned lack of knowledge regarding the case at the Office of the Public 
Prosecutor would suggest that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s detention continues in contradiction of 
said legislation. 
</p>
<p>155. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s wife was allowed to visit him in detention for the first time on 29 
September 2010; however, Mr. Abdulemam has yet to be granted access to his lawyer.  
</p>
<p>156. The Ministry of the Interior has allegedly denied that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest was 
in any way related to his political views. However, since 5 September 2010 - the day 
following Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest - the BahrainOnline.org website has been unavailable </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>both within Bahrain and abroad. Furthermore, it is feared that Mr. Abdulemam has been 
compelled to reveal the password for his Internet service.  
</p>
<p>157. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Abdulemam may be 
related to his peaceful and legitimate work in defence of human rights, particularly with 
respect to freedom of expression. Furthermore, mindful of the allegation that Mr. 
Abdulemam has yet to be granted access to his lawyer and brought before the Public 
Prosecutor, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>158. In a letter dated 15 November 2010, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
dated 15 October 2010. It was underlined that the government has not, and does not, target 
nor prosecute any individual based on their peaceful views or opinions. Further, Bahrain is 
committed to the rule of law, and to following the proper legal and constitutional 
procedures designed to protect the rights of all in society. In the case of Mr. Abdulemam, 
the summary set out in your communication is inaccurate.  
</p>
<p>159. Mr. Abdulemam was arrested on 4 September on the basis of evidence of his 
membership of a terrorist network. Investigations have found the network to be responsible 
for inciting and planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and contempt against the 
government, threatening public order and endangering the safety and security of the 
Kingdom. The aim of the network is to overthrow and change the political system of the 
country by force, dissolve the constitution and obstruct the enforcement of its provisions. 
The network recruited nationals and foreigners, youngsters and adults, and incited them to 
commit acts of riot, violence and vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, attacking security 
personnel, nationals and foreigners residing in Bahrain, terrorizing them and damaging their 
private property.  
</p>
<p>160. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law No.58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. This law grants Judicial Officers the right 
subject to the emergence of sufficient evidence, to issue a protective custody order for a 
period not exceeding five days, and if necessary, permission may be obtained from the 
Public Prosecution to extend the custody to a period not exceeding 10 days. Such 
permission is strictly granted if the Judicial Officer provides sufficient evidence that the 
extension of the custody is essential for the continuation of the investigations. Given the 
nature of Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s suspected crimes, he was arrested under this Law No. 58 of 
2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts, and not under 
Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects must be brought before 
the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest.  
</p>
<p>161. Prior to the elapse of the five day protective custody, Mr. Abdulemam was duly 
referred to the Public Prosecution on 9 September 2010, which commenced and handled 
criminal proceedings. Following intensive investigations by prosecutors, Mr. Abdulemam 
was charged under the Penal Code No. 15 of 1976 and Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. He is currently facing the following 
charges: joining an outlawed organization with the aim of violating the law and disrupting 
provisions of the constitution and to prevent public authorities from exercising their duties, 
using terrorism and violence; inciting to acts of sabotage, destruction and arson, publicly 
instigating sectarian hatred which disturbs civil peace; and spreading provocative 
propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public security and cause damages to 
public interests. 
</p>
<p>162. Contrary to the fears expressed in the Communication, on 23 September, the Public 
Prosecution gave permission for the families of defendants in this case to visit those in 
custody, and Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s family subsequently visited him on 29 September.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>163. In relation to the Working Group&#8217;s concern regarding whether the acts shall be 
criminalized as terrorist, the first two conditions (means used and intent) put forward by the 
group will be demonstrated. Firstly, with respect to the means used. The sabotage groups 
have been committing acts of violence, rioting, vandalizing private and public properties, 
carrying out arsons, blocking highways and crippling all forms of life activities. These 
groups have added violence to their acts by using Molotov bombs, homemade bombs and 
sharpened iron bars. Molotov bombs are considered as improvised incendiary weapons and 
are primarily intended to set targets ablaze and destroy them. In fact, two police were killed 
in two separate horrific attacks by Molotov bombs: a policeman, and an innocent Pakistani 
passer-by, father of five. 
</p>
<p>164. Secondly, it is clear that the intent of these acts was to undermine public order, and 
to cause fear among the general population, for example by carrying out their attacks at 
night to spread even greater fear among the general public.  Indeed, some of the suspects 
have admitted that this was their intent. 
</p>
<p>165. Therefore, given that the acts of the groups in question clearly amount to serious 
(sometimes deadly) violence, and given that their intent was to cause fear among the 
population and to disrupt public order, it can clearly be seen that the activities amount to 
acts of criminal terrorism.  
</p>
<p>166. It is worth mentioning that Mr. Abdulemam, along with other members of the 
network, have sought to label their acts of violence as human rights activism or peaceful 
demonstrations or protest. It goes without saying that inciting to acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism under the guise of promoting and protecting human rights is a flagrant violation 
of Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone 
has the right to life, liberty and security of person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to 
protect individuals and groups against the abuse of these fundamental rights.  
</p>
<p>167. Mr. Abdulemam is the creator of the <i>www.bahrainonline.org</i> website, which he has 
managed for many years. He provided that he has created this forum to instigate sectarian 
hatred and to spread provocative propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize 
public security and damage public interest. The leaders and members of the terrorist 
network have used this website, with the knowledge and observance of Mr. Abdulemam, to 
incite acts of sabotage, violence and terrorism. Furthermore, this website is known to praise 
such acts by posting footage and photos of the destruction and damage caused by those 
groups, along with glorifying them as heroes. Mr. Abdulemam has confirmed that he was 
funded by leaders of the terrorism network for doing so. 
</p>
<p>168. With regard to the concern expressed by the Working Group with respect to the 
physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdulemam, it is underlined that the 
Government of Bahrain fully reaffirms its adherence to the provisions stipulated in the UN 
Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under any form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of detention are treated in a humane manner and 
with respect for their physical and mental integrity and inherent dignity of the human 
person. Any arrest, detention or imprisonment is only carried out strictly in accordance with 
the provisions of the law and by competent officials or persons authorized for that purpose. 
Convinced that the adoption of this Body of Principles would make an important 
contribution to the protection of human rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law any act 
contrary to the rights and duties contained therein. 
</p>
<p>169. Mr. Abdulemam is charged with criminal offences. He preserves his right to be 
presumed innocent and is treated as such until proved guilty in a public trial according to 
law, at which he has all the guarantees necessary for his defence. In this connection, 
Bahrain restates its commitment to preserving the suspect&#8217;s right to fair proceedings before 
an independent and impartial tribunal to determine the criminal charges against him. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>law guarantees the independence of the judiciary and the probity and impartiality of judges. 
In this context, attention is drawn to article 104 of the Constitution of Bahrain, which 
stipulates &#8220;No authority shall prevail over the judgment if a judge, and under no 
circumstances may the course of justice be interfered with.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>170. Mr. Abdulemam has exercised his constitutional and legal rights with regards to his 
legal representation. Although he has refused to appoint a counsel for himself and no 
counsel has taken the initiative to represent him, he was legally represented in the first court 
hearing that was held publicly on 28 October 2010. As provided by the relevant legislation, 
if a suspect does not have legal counsel, one will be assigned to him by the court at its 
expense. Further, judgments of the criminal court may be challenged before the courts of 
Appeal, while the Courts of Cassation can examine the compliance of the judgments of the 
foregoing courts with the law.  
</p>
<p>171. Finally, leaders and members of the terrorist network, along with all citizens of 
Bahrain, preserve their right of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human 
rights, as enshrined in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. They also preserve the 
right of freedom of expression and opinion, as enshrined in the Constitution of Bahrain 
which provides that everyone has the right to express his opinion and publish it by word of 
mouth or in writing under the rules and conditions laid down by law, provided that the 
fundamental beliefs of Islamic doctrine are not infringed, the unity of the people is not 
prejudiced, and discord or sectarianism is not aroused. Legal action is only exercised 
against those who deviate from the scope of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence 
of human rights and freedom of expression and recourse to the execution of acts amounting 
to the abuse of law. 
</p>
<p>172. In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Ali Abdulemam is not deprived arbitrarily of his 
liberty and is entitled in full equality to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal. Bahrain acknowledges the significant role of the Human Rights Council 
in the contribution to the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals, and fully supports its efforts in 
promoting universal respect for human rights along with its determination to examine 
thoroughly all the cases brought to its attention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>173. On 17 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal concerning the deaths of several 
people, including <b>Mr. Ali Abdulhadi al-Mushaima</b>, <b>Mr. Fadhel Salman al-Matrook</b>, 
<b>Mr. Issa Abdel Hassan</b>, <b>Mr. Mahmound Makki</b>, <b>Mr. Ali Khudair</b> and <b>Mr. Hussaid 
Zayed</b> and the excessive use of force by security forces in the context of the ongoing 
peaceful protests. Since 14 February 2011, massive demonstrations have peacefully taken 
place across the country calling for democratic reforms, including political rights and 
freedoms, the release of all political prisoners, a new constitution and an elected 
government. 
</p>
<p>174. It was recalled that restrictions to fundamental freedoms and rights in Bahrain had 
been addressed in several urgent appeals, notably in the communication dated 20 August 
2010 sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering

<p>175. According to the new information received, in the context of ongoing protests across 
the country, security officials had reportedly used tear gas, rubber bullets, shotguns and live 
ammunitions against peaceful demonstrators to contain the massive protests. Such 
excessive use of force had been carried out, at a short distance, against people who were not 
participating in the demonstrations, but were running away from the police in proximity to 
protests areas. Due to the excessive use of force, at least six deaths have been reported 
between 14 to 17 February 2011, with a high number of people injured. 
</p>
<p>176. On 14 February 2011, during a demonstration in al-Daih village, in the north of 
Bahrain, Mr. Ali Abdulhadi al-Mushaima, aged 27, and reportedly not a participant in the 
demonstrations, was allegedly shot at short range whilst walking out of his house. He was 
reportedly taken to al-Salmaniaya hospital in Manama and died one hour later. 
</p>
<p>177. On 15 February 2011, a funeral procession was organized to transfer his body from 
the hospital to the cemetery for burial. A high number of people had reportedly gathered at 
the gates of the hospital to join the procession. It has been reported that riot police used tear 
gas and shotguns to disperse the crowd. Consequently, a man named Mr. Fadhel Salman al-
Matrook, aged 32, was severely injured and died later in hospital. 
</p>
<p>178. Furthermore, on the night of 17 February 2011, between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. 
local time, peaceful demonstrators, gathered at Pearl Roundabout, in the centre of the 
capital Manama, have been reportedly attacked by security forces without insufficient 
warning in order to disperse the pro-reform protesters camp. This includes a large number 
of families, women and children. Subsequently, at least four people were allegedly killed, 
Mr. Issa Abdel Hassan, aged 61, Mr. Mahmoud Makki, aged 23, Mr. Ali Khudair, aged 52 
and Mr. Hussaid Zayed. In this regard, the Ministry of Health has confirmed three deaths 
and the number of persons wounded as being 231 during the police operation. Moreover, 
we have received information on the presence of a high number of tanks and armoured 
vehicles on Pearl Roundabout. 
</p>
<p>179. It has also been reported that ambulances have been prevented from accessing the 
protests areas, that doctors and nurses providing medical assistance have been beaten, and 
this has lead to protests by the medical workers themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>180. In a letter dated 5 April 2011, the Government replied to the communication sent on 
17 February 2011. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of finalization 
of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position to 
summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>181. On 18 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning the <b>worsening of the situation 
and excessive use of force against protesters by security forces in the context of the 
ongoing peaceful demonstrations</b>, which have been taking place across the country since 
14 February 2011, calling for democratic reforms and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>182. According to the information received, since 14 February 2011, massive 
demonstrations have been peacefully taking place across the country calling for democratic 
reforms, including political rights and freedoms, the release of all political prisoners, a new 
constitution and an elected Government.  
</p>
<p>183. In the communication dated 17 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment appealed to the Government of Bahrain to 
seek clarification concerning the deaths of several people and the excessive use of force by 
security forces in the context of the ongoing peaceful protests when the alleged use of tear 
gas, rubber bullets, shotguns and live ammunitions against peaceful demonstrators have 
resulted in at least 6 deaths and a high number of people injured between 14 and 17 
February 2011. It was noted that at the time of submission of the communication, no 
response had been received from the Government in relation to the circumstances regarding 
the cases of the persons named therein. 
</p>
<p>184. According to the new information received, on 15, 16 and 17 March 2011 
respectively, following the introduction of a three-month state of emergency by the King of 
Bahrain on 15 March 2011, Bahraini police reportedly attacked a number of villages, 
including Sitra, Ma'amer, Ali, Buri, Salmabad, Nuwaidrat, Bani Jamra and Duraz, and the 
protest camp on Pearl Roundabout, to contain the massive protests using tear gas, rubber 
bullets and shotguns. It is alleged that automatic weapons may also have been used to shoot 
live ammunition at protesters and passers-by. Plainclothes security personnel have also 
reportedly been using clubs, knives, swords and rocks to attack protesters. The electricity 
supply, telecommunications and water in villages and the area around the roundabout was 
cut.  
</p>
<p>185. On 16 March 2011, the Pearl Roundabout, where most anti-government protesters 
were asleep, was attacked by the Bahrain riot police and plain-clothed security. Many 
demonstrators were beaten and wounded with rubber bullets and shotgun pellets. At least 
seven protesters have reportedly been killed during the clashes of 15 and 16 March 2011, 
and many demonstrators sustained gunshot injuries. On 17 March 2011, Mr. Mahmoud 
Makki Ali, Mr. Ali Mansour Ahmad Khudair, and Mr. Isa Abd al-Khusein, were shot dead 
after security forces opened fire on protesters. Mr. Isa Ali Ahmed al-Moamen died in the 
hospital from fatal injuries caused by live ammunition. Reportedly, 255 patients have been 
taken to hospital in the early hours of 17 March 2011 many with severe injuries. It is also 
reported that on 15 March 2011, the police attacked the medical personnel at the scene of 
the attack preventing them from carrying wounded people to hospitals and from having 
access to the protesters&#8217; camp in the roundabout. Several ambulance drivers were attacked 
by riot police with batons as they tried to reach the wounded; 4 paramedics who arrived to 
pick up the wounded were reportedly beaten by the police. Riot police reportedly blocked 
access to the Sitra Health Centre where many of the injured were taken, while leaving other 
injured people lying unassisted in the streets.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>186. Furthermore, the Ministry of Interior Force of Bahrain is alleged to have 
commandeered and occupied Salmaniya hospital, the main hospital in Manama, and to be 
blocking access to it. A group of nurses and doctors who tried to leave the hospital were 
reportedly beaten. The electricity at the hospital has reportedly been cut off, endangering 
the lives of critical care patients. Additional reports have been received that security forces 
have attacked medical workers, and that the wounded are now being treated in mosques or 
in private homes. Further allegations have been received that security forces have occupied 
smaller state and private medical centres.  
</p>
<p>187. In this context, attention was brought to the Government to the statement issued by 
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 17 March 2011, concerning the 
escalation of violence by security forces in Bahrain, in particular the reported takeover of 
hospitals and medical centres in the country, and the most recent communication dated 17 
March 2011, sent by the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>188. The Special Rapporteurs noted that Bahraini activists, human rights defenders, 
leaders of the protest movement and political parties reportedly continue to receive threats 
on social networking websites. On 17 March 2011, five opposition leaders, namely Mr. 
Hassan Mushaima, Secretary-General of the Movement of Liberties and Democracy; Mr. 
Ibrahim Shareef, the Secretary-General of the National Democratic Action Society; Mr. 
AbdulWahab Hussain, the President of the Alwafa Islamic movement; Mr. Kareem Radhi 
Hassan AlHadad; Mr. Abdul Jalil AlSankees, the Board member of the Movement of 
Liberties and Democracy; and Mr. Ali Al Ekri have reportedly been arrested by the security 
forces. It is also reported that on 15 February 2011, Mr. Mohammed al-Buflasa, a former 
military officer was detained by the Bahrain Defense Forces after he spoke at the Pearl 
Roundabout, criticizing the Government and supporting the protesters. His fate and 
whereabouts remained unknown until after 17 days when on 4 March 2011, authorities 
announced that Mr. al-Buflasa was to face trial for &#8220;breaching the Bahrain Defense Force 
law&#8221; without providing further information. Reportedly, on 17 March 2011, the General 
Command of the Bahrain Defense Force issued a statement about the detention of several 
leaders &#8220;of the sedition ring who had called for the downfall of the regime and had 
intelligence contacts with foreign countries [&#8230;], incited [&#8230;] for the killing of citizens and 
the destruction of public and private property, resulting in the undermining of the social 
peace, the loss of innocent lives and the terrorizing of citizens and residents&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>189. Further, the offices of the only opposition newspaper, Al Wasat, were allegedly 
attacked, and many NGO premises in the neighbourhood have been stormed in an attempt 
to arrest those who were trying to cover the event and provide news to local and foreign 
media outlets.  
</p>
<p>190. Given the restrictions on the means of communication, the denial of medical aid and 
medical care to the injured protesters, serious concern was expressed about their physical 
and mental integrity. In addition, concerns were expressed about the physical and mental 
integrity of Bahraini demonstrators, activists, lawyers, politicians who had been arrested 
since the demonstrations began.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>191. On 22 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Abduljalil 
Al Singace, Mr. Hassan Mushaima, Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Mr. Abdulhadi 
Alkawaja,</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Nabeel Rajab. </b>Mr. Al Singace is the head of the human rights office at 
Haq Movement. Mr. Mushaima is President of Haq Movement. Mr. Al Kanja is the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>spokesperson for the Bahraini National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture, Mr. 
Alkhawaja was, until recently, the Front Line protection coordinator for the MENA region, 
and Mr. Rajab is the President of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>192. It was noted that the situation of the aforementioned individuals had previously been 
addressed in a number of communications to the Government sent on 2 February 2007, 19 
February 2009, 5 March 2010, 20 August 2010, and 15 September 2010. Receipt of 
responses to the aforementioned communications transmitted by the Government was 
acknowledged, but the following information was brought to the Government&#8217;s attention.  
</p>
<p>193. According to the new information received, on 17 March 2011, both Mr. Al Singace 
and Mr. Mushaima were arrested by the Bahraini security apparatus. The arrests allegedly 
took place in the aftermath of a security operation carried out by the security forces with the 
alleged objective of removing protesters from Pearl Roundabout, Manama. It is reported 
that their fate and whereabouts are unknown.  
</p>
<p>194. According to the information received, Mr. Al Singace was released from prison on 
23 February 2011, in the wake of civil unrest in Bahrain. However, it is reported that the 
charges against him were not formally dropped. On 13 August 2010, Mr. Al Singace was 
arrested and detained upon his return to Bahrain from London where he reportedly spoke at 
the House of Lords about torture in Bahrain. According to the information received, Mr. Al 
Singace was put on trial for forming part of an alleged terrorist network. During the trial it 
emerged that Mr. Al Singace was allegedly subjected to torture and other forms of ill-
treatment while in detention.  
</p>
<p>195. During his career as a human rights defender, Mr. Al Singace has actively engaged 
with the UN Human Rights Council as well as other UN human rights mechanisms, and has 
openly spoken at the international level about alleged human rights violations in Bahrain.  
</p>
<p>196. According to the new information received, Mr. Mushaima was charged with 
forming part of the same terrorist network as Mr. Al Singace, but was tried in absentia 
while he was in London receiving medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>197. Through his work as an activist, Mr. Mushaima has actively engaged with different 
UN bodies reporting about alleged human rights violations in Bahrain. He has also 
participated in the Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain before the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>198. On 15 August 2010, Mr. Al Kanja was arrested and detained in Bahrain upon his 
return from London where he, along with Mr. Al Singace, addressed the House of Lords on 
torture in Bahrain. Mr. Al Kanja was also put on trial for forming part of an alleged terrorist 
group. It is alleged that he was subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment while in 
detention. On 23 February 2011, Mr. Al Kanja was released from prison however it is 
reported that the charges against him were not formally dropped. 
</p>
<p>199. As a human rights defender, Mr. Al Kanja has engaged with a number of UN human 
rights mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain before the Human 
Rights Council, and the Committee against Torture.  
</p>
<p>200. As well as being charged with forming part of an alleged terrorist group, Mr. Al 
Singace and Mr. Al Kanja were reportedly charged with &#8220;cooperation with international 
organisations&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>201. On 10 March 2011, a number of social networking sites allegedly posted death 
threats against Mr. Al-Khawaja accusing him of treason. The messages reportedly 
contained personal information about Mr. Al-Khawaja including his address, phone 
number, personal identification number and profession. It is reported that such information 
is normally found on Bahraini National Identity Cards. Details about the type of car driven </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>by Mr. Al-Khawaja were also made available on the sites. Text messages were also 
circulated containing similar death threats against Mr. Al-Khawaja. 
</p>
<p>202. Through his work as a human rights defender, Mr. Al-Khawaja has openly discussed 
human rights concerns in Bahrain with a number of international human rights 
organisations including the UN.  
</p>
<p>203. Mr. Rajab has also been involved in reporting to the UN. He also participated in the 
Universal Periodic Review, the UN Human Rights Council, the Committee against Torture 
and the Committee against Racial Discrimination. He was the subject of a communication 
sent to your Government on 5 March 2010. 
</p>
<p>204. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Al 
Singace and Mr. Mushaima who have been arrested on 17 March 2011 by the security 
forces, whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown. Further concern was expressed for 
the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Al Khawaja considering the content of the 
death threats recently made against him posted in a number of social networking sites. 
Concern is also expressed for the situation of Mr. Rajab and Mr. Al Kanja.  
</p>
<p>205. Serious concern was further expressed that the situation of the aforementioned 
persons may be linked to their work in the defence of human rights, in particular their 
cooperation with the UN bodies and its mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>206. In a letter dated 27 October 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 5 March 2010 concerning Mr. <b>Nabeel Rajab</b>, president of the Bahrain Center for 
Human Rights (BCHR), Mr.<b> Mohamed Al-Maskati</b>, president of the Bahrain Youth 
Society for Human Rights (BYSHR), and Mr.<b> Abdul Ghani Al-Khanjar</b>, spokesperson for 
the National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture (NCMVT).  
</p>
<p>207. It is noted that the communication quite correctly makes no allegation of the 
government being involved &#8211; indeed Bahrain&#8217;s media is justifiably regarded as being 
impartial and independent. The government does not, and constitutionally cannot, seek to 
control the media and is therefore not in a position to characterise (whether as &#8220;smear 
campaign&#8221; or otherwise) the output of any media organization, particularly where that 
output involves the expression of opinion by private citizens. Further, the rights of freedom 
of opinion and expression are protected by Bahrain&#8217;s laws and Constitution, and the 
government takes its domestic and international commitments in this regard very seriously. 
Complainants are fully entitled to seek redress for any violations of rights through the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, an independent body affiliated to the Ministry of Justice, and 
assurances are given that Bahrain&#8217;s prosecutorial, judicial and legal system treats all 
litigants equally.  
</p>
<p>208. The government believes that such judicial and other remedies should be exhausted, 
or at least seriously pursued, before alleged violations of rights can properly be raised 
internationally. 
</p>
<p>209. The government continues to welcome and engage domestically and internationally 
in our common endeavour to promote and protect human rights. The individuals referred to 
in the Communication are most certainly able to carry out their peaceful and legitimate 
human rights activities freely and without fear in Bahrain, and their close co-operation with 
Human Rights Watch (to which the Communication refers) bears testament to this. I would 
also note that the Human Rights Watch report in question was in fact launched in Bahrain, 
at a public meeting, equally freely and without any fear or restriction. This once again 
underlines the government&#8217;s commitment to freedom of expression and to protecting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>legitimate human rights defenders, even in cases where we might strongly but respectfully 
disagree with what they say. 
</p>
<p>210. In this context, the government considers the allegations to be erroneous, and any 
attempt to present these claims as fact when, in reality, the allegations are strongly 
contradicted by facts set out above, is regrettable.  
</p>
<p>211. Finally, the opportunity is taken to reiterate the government&#8217;s firm and unwavering 
commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, including the rights to 
freedom of expression and opinion, and to complying with and respecting international 
human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>212. In a letter dated 31 August 2010, the Government responded to a communication 
sent on 28 July 2008 concerning Messrs <b>Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan, Maytham Bader 
Jassim Al Sheikh </b>and <b>Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh</b> of the Unemployment 
Committee; Mr <b>Naji Ali Fateel</b> of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR); 
Mr <b>Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais</b>, head of the Committee to Combat High Prices; Mr 
<b>Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali</b>, former member of the Unemployment Committee; and 
<b>Mr Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab</b>, founding member of the Martyrs and Victims of 
Torture.  
</p>
<p>213. In its letter, the Government informed that the facts as summarized in the letter are 
inaccurate. The accused were neither tried by a criminal court nor convicted because of 
their human rights work, but rather because they had participated in an illegal gathering at 
which they had been carrying iron bars and Molotov cocktails, set fire to a police vehicle 
and stole a firearm from the vehicle. The reasons given in the letter for their criminal 
prosecution and conviction are unsubstantiated and baseless. 
</p>
<p>214. When questioned by the Office of the Public Prosecutor, the five accused neither 
claimed that they had been mistreated nor filed any complaint in that regard. Nevertheless, 
the Office had them examined by a medical examiner in order to determine whether they 
had sustained any injuries. The reports by the medical examiner essentially confirmed that 
the accused had not been subjected to torture.  
</p>
<p>215. The five accused, together with others who are not human rights defenders, were 
brought before the High Criminal Court by the Office of the Public Prosecutor on charges 
of unlawful assembly, setting fire to a police vehicle, using force and violence against 
police officers, stealing a firearm and parts of a firearm from the vehicle and concealing 
and possessing unlicensed weapons. The Office of the Public Prosecutor based its decisions 
on a large amount of evidence, namely confessions by several of the accused, the testimony 
of several police officers, the findings of investigations, technical reports, and photographs 
showing the accused meeting, setting fire to the police vehicle and stealing the firearm from 
the vehicle. During proceedings before the High Criminal Court, lawyers for the accused 
asked for their clients to be referred to an independent medical panel for examination. The 
Court agreed and the accused were examined by the panel. Moreover, the Court allowed the 
accused to submit full evidence in their defence. 
</p>
<p>216. The medical examinations which the five accused underwent focused on old scars 
and bruises found on their bodies. Neither the medical examiner nor the panel determined 
that these were the result of torture. Medical examiners&#8217; independence is ensured by the 
requirement that they not be linked by kinship or blood ties to any party in the proceedings 
or by any other link that could influence the opinions that they are required to reach. 
Moreover, medical examiners who are not Government experts must declare, under oath, 
that they will carry out their duties honestly. Medical examiners may also be questioned 
about how they arrived at their opinions. An accused person who wishes to have an </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>independent medical examination must submit a request either orally or in writing to the 
competent authority, which may be the Office of the Public Prosecutor or the court hearing 
the case. The authority will grant the request promptly, if it determines that it is genuine 
and will not delay court proceedings. In such cases, the medical examiner conducting the 
examination will have the same powers as a medical examiner appointed by the Office of 
the Public Prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>217. The accused appealed against the judgement handed down by the High Criminal 
Court. The appeal filed by Mr. Ahmed Jaffar Mohammed Ali was dismissed by the High 
Criminal Appeals Court on 28 December 2008, as a royal decree had been issued granting 
him and others a pardon. The Court likewise dismissed the appeal lodged by the other four 
accused. Before handing down its verdict, and at the request of the accused, the Court heard 
testimony from numerous witnesses for the defence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>218. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses received to most 
of his communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets that at the time 
of finalization of the report, no reply had been transmitted to his communications of 18 
March 2011 and 22 March 2011, and to four communications sent in 2008 and 2007.  
</p>
<p>219. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation 
in Bahrain following the protests of 14 February 2011. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, issued a joint press 
release on 18 February 2011 expressing alarm and shock by the number of peaceful 
protesters who have been injured or killed during the violent crackdown by the authorities.3  
</p>
<p>220. In another press release issued on 22 March 2011,4 jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, and Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of health, concern was expressed that the Government of 
Bahrain has embarked on a path of multiple human rights violations amidst a dramatic 
deterioration of peace and security in the country. The Special Rapporteurs condemned the 
persistent use, on an even more intensive scale than a month ago, of the brutal tactics to 
quash non-violent protests. The Special Rapporteurs also noted increased incidents of 
serious human rights violations in the capital Manama, and urged the Government to 
immediately stop the violations, and to start an investigation and prosecution of those 
responsible.  
</p>
<p>221. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive information regarding the continued 
detention of journalists, bloggers, human rights defenders, teachers, lawyers, medical 
professionals, artists, activists and members of political bodies in Bahrain. He reiterates his 
call to the Government to fully guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression

</b></p>
<p>222. On 17 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the detention and reported ill-treatment of Mr. <b>Mahmudur 
Rahman</b>, Amar Desh's Editor. The Amar Desh, a Bangladeshi daily newspaper that 
regularly reports on corruption cases, was closed down the day before the detention of Mr. 
Rahman.   
</p>
<p>223. According to the information received, on 2 June 2010, at 4:00 am, agents of the 
Tejgaon police station entered the Amar Desh offices, arrested Mr. Rahman and took him 
to the Dhaka Cantonment Police Station (CPS) for interrogation. The day before, on 1 June 
2010, the Tejgaon Thana Officer-in-Charge had raided the press office of Amar Desh and 
declared its closure.

<p>224. On the same day of his arrest, Mr. Rahman was reportedly charged under Sections 
419, 420 and 500 of the Penal Code for &#8220;cheating by personation&#8221;, &#8220;dishonestly inducing 
delivery of property&#8221; and &#8220;defamation&#8221;. Moreover, the Tejgaon Police Station filed another 
case against Mr. Rahman (Case No. 2(6)2010), as well as against the Amar Desh Deputy 
Editor, Mr. Syed Abdal Ahmed; the Assistant Editor, Mr. Sanjeeb Chowdhury; the City 
Editor, Mr. Jahed Chowdhury; the reporter, Alauddin Arif; and the office assistant Saiful 
Islam for, inter alia, &#8220;obstructing Government officials to perform their duties&#8221; during Mr. 
Rahman's arrest, under Sections 143, 342, 332, 353, 186, 506, 114 of the Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>225. On 6 June, while he was in custody, another case (Case No.5 (6) 2010) was filed 
against Mr. Rahman at the Kowali police station for, inter alia, &#8220;obstructing Government 
officials to perform their duties&#8221;, under Sections 143, 186, 332, 353, 225B/34 of the Penal 
Code.  
</p>
<p>226. On 7 June, on the basis of the two latter cases, Mr. Rahman was placed under a four-
day detention period.  On 8 June 2010, the Magistrates Court No. 7 issued another four-day 
detention period in Uttara Model Police Station against Mr. Rahman for &#8220;printing banned 
leaflets&#8221; under Section 6(1) of the Anti Terrorism Act 2009, as well as an additional four-
day detention period for &#8220;conspiring against the State&#8221; on the basis of a case lodged under 
Sections 121A (&#8220;waging war or attempting to wage war against the State&#8221;), 124A 
(&#8220;sedition&#8221;) and 114 (&#8220;abettor present when offence is committed&#8221;) of the Penal Code.   
</p>
<p>227. According to the information received, on 10 June 2010, Mr. Rahman reported that 
five or six men entered his cell, removed his clothes and then proceeded to hit him very 
hard with their elbows in his chest and back whereupon he lost consciousness.  When he 
awoke, he found himself lying in the room of the Second Officer of the CPS. 
</p>
<p>228. On 12 June 2010, Mr. Rahman was brought before the Magistrates Court on the 
basis of Case No. 2(6)2010. He then reported that he has been subjected to acts of inhuman 
and degrading treatment while in detention.  He was allegedly unable to stand on the dock 
and the Magistrate invited him to sit. The Magistrates Court ordered that Mr. Rahman be 
sent to jail and undergo a full medical check-up on the basis of jail regulations. The 
Magistrate also allowed Mr. Rahman's lawyers to meet him for half an hour. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>229. On the same day, the police of the Detective Branch of Dhaka Metropolitan area 
submitted an application seeking a four-day remand to question Mr. Rahman regarding the 
case filed at the Uttara police station under the 2009 Anti-Terrorism Act.  The remand was 
granted by the Magistrates Court. Mr. Rahman was reportedly taken to the Detective 
Branch offices in Dhaka on 12 June without any medical check-up being performed. 
</p>
<p>230. As a result of the above, Mr. Rahman has been on remand since 2 June 2010.   
</p>
<p>231. Concern was expressed that the arrest and charges against Mr. Rahman, and various 
staff working at the Amar Desh's daily newspaper, might be related to their activities as 
journalists and in defense of human rights.  Further concern is expressed about the physical 
and mental integrity of Mr. Rahman and the allegations that he might have been subject to 
ill-treatment during his detention.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>232. In a letter dated 18 June 2010 and the 5 July 2010, the Government responded to the 
urgent appeal sent on 17 June 2010 as follows.   
</p>
<p>233. The Government reiterates its commitment to freedom of expression and its faith in 
a free media. The declaration of the daily newspaper in Bangladesh named &#8220;<i>Amar Desh</i>&#8221; 
was cancelled by the District Magistrate of Dhaka in accordance with Articles 5 and 7 (part 
3) of the Printing Presses and Publications (Declaration and Registration) Act, 1973, on the 
basis of a complaint lodged by a former employee. 
</p>
<p>234. The former employee resigned as the publisher of the newspaper &#8220;<i>Amar Desh</i>&#8221; on 
11 October 2009. Since his name continued to appear in the printer&#8217;s line of the newspaper, 
he filed a written complaint with the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Dhaka. The 
Deputy Commissioner notified the acting Editor of the daily in order to take necessary 
action in this regard. Since no action was taken, the Deputy Commissioner&#8217;s officer on 15 
March 2010 issued a &#8220;show cause notice&#8221; on the acting Editor asking him to explain why 
appropriate action would not be taken against the daily for using the former employee&#8217;s 
name as the publisher, even after his resignation and complaint.  
</p>
<p>235. The former employee on 1 June 2010 filed a case with the Tejgaon Industrial Area 
Police Station against Mr. Mahmudur Rahman, acting Editor of &#8220;<i>Amar Desh</i>&#8221; for illegally 
using his name as publisher of the daily. 
</p>
<p>236. Following the cancellation of the declaration, a writ petition was filed by the daily 
&#8220;<i>Amar Desh</i>&#8221; with the High Court. On 10 June 2010, the High Court stayed for three 
months the order closing the daily. Following an appeal against the stay order, the 
Appellate Division, on 15 June 2010, issued an order staying High Court&#8217;s order for four 
weeks. Meanwhile, the daily &#8220;<i>Amar Desh</i>&#8221; published regularly from 11 to 15 June 2010. 
The matter is currently pending before the court. 
</p>
<p>237. It may be noted that in the above case, actions were taken in accordance with the law 
of the land and without any political considerations whatsoever. Both the print and 
electronic media in Bangladesh enjoy full freedom and media in Bangladesh continues to 
represent widely diverse and divergent opinions and points of view. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>238. On 14 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
<b>Odhikar</b> and, in particular, of <b>Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan</b>, its Secretary Advocate. 
Odhikar is a human rights organization based in Dhaka, which works documenting human 
rights violations in Bangladesh, including extrajudicial executions, deaths in custody, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>torture, violence against women, freedom of expression and the situation of human rights 
defenders.  
</p>
<p>239. Odhikar was the subject of an urgent appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders on 11 March 2010, and regret was expressed that to 
date, no response had been received regarding the aforementioned communication. 
</p>
<p>240. According to the information received, since October 2010, the activities of Odhikar 
and, in particular, of the Secretary Advocate, Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, have been 
increasingly monitored by the Bangladeshi authorities. The increased surveillance of 
Odhikar allegedly follows the submission by the organization of various project proposals 
to the national NGO Affairs Bureau, an office which regulates NGO activities in 
Bangladesh. It is reported that the content of the aforementioned proposals did not please 
the authorities.  An official from the NGO Affairs Bureau has reportedly warned Odhikar 
staff members to exercise caution while travelling, and to be aware that a legal case may be 
brought against them by the authorities.  
</p>
<p>241. It is also reported that following the submission of the project proposals, the offices 
of Odhikar have frequently been visited by officials from the Bangladeshi Police Special 
Branch and National Security Intelligence agents. The authorities have also reportedly 
made repeated phone calls to the offices of Odhikar inquiring about the work carried out by 
Odhikar, as well demanding information on the location of staff members and human rights 
defenders working there.    
</p>
<p>242. Odhikar often works in close contact with the United Nations and other international 
human rights organizations and bodies. In 2008, Odhikar submitted information to the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the context of the Universal 
Periodic Review (UPR) of Bangladesh by the Human Rights Council, which took place in 
February 2009, and has since featured in many international human rights reports.  
According to the information received, after the engagement with the UPR process, 
Odhikar was threatened and harassed by Government officials of different levels and 
authorities increased the monitoring of its activities.   
</p>
<p>243. Most recently, Odhikar has been campaigning for the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment.   
</p>
<p>244. Concern was expressed that the surveillance carried out by Bangladeshi security 
officials of the activities of Odhikar and of Mr. Adilur Rahman Khan, its Secretary 
Advocate, may be linked to its work by documenting human rights violations in 
Bangladesh. Further, serious concern was expressed that Odhikar may have been targeted 
because of its cooperation with international human rights organizations and the United 
Nations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>245. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bangladesh for the responses 
received to his communication sent on 17 June 2010 but regrets that the allegations that Mr. 
Mahmudur Rahman was subjected to torture and ill-treatment while in detention were not 
addressed. He regrets that, at the time of finalizing this report, no response had been 
received regarding the communication sent on 14 March 2011. He considers response to 
her communications an important part of cooperation by Governments, and urges the 
Government to respond to concerns raised by him with detailed information regarding 
investigations undertaken, prosecutions as well as protective measures taken.   </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>246. On 22 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>arrests and the 
detention of various candidates in the Presidential elections of 19 December 2010, over 
20 journalists, and human rights defenders including those associated with the 
&#8220;Human Rights Defenders for Free Elections&#8221; campaign. </b>The &#8220;Human Rights 
Defenders for Free Elections&#8221; campaign is an initiative of the human rights organisation 
&#8220;Viasna&#8221;, also known as &#8220;Nasha Viasna&#8221; and the Belarusian Helsinki Committee, which 
aims to observe the presidential elections, monitor the election process with regard to 
Belarusian and international standards for free and fair elections, and keep the public, both 
within Belarus and internationally, informed about the election process.  
</p>
<p>247. &#8220;Viasna&#8221; has been the subject of communications sent by the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders previously sent a joint 
communication on 14 May 2009 and 24 August 2009. The responses of the Government to 
these communications dated 2 July 2009 and 1 October 2009 were acknowledged. The 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee and members thereof have been the subject of various 
communications by mandate holders, the most recent of which was sent by the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 22 July 2008. Government 
reply to above-mentioned communication dated 18 August 2008 was acknowledged.  
</p>
<p>248. According to the information received, during the night of 19-20 December 2010, a 
number of political figures, at least 20 foreign and local journalists, as well as human rights 
defenders were arrested and detained during an alleged wave of arrests across Minsk.  
</p>
<p>249. Following the Presidential elections on 19 December 2010, it is reported that 
approximately 10,000 demonstrators gathered at Independence Square, Minsk, to protest 
against the result thereof. Opposition candidate <b>Mr. Vladimir Neklyayev</b>, who was among 
the protesters, was reportedly set upon by a number of unidentified men who began beating 
him while he was en route to Independence Square. He was hospitalised as a result of his 
injuries. However, it is reported that Mr. Neklyayev was later abducted from his hospital 
bed by men in plain clothing who did not produce any identification. Having removed Mr. 
Neklyayev from his bed, the unidentified men reportedly locked Mr. Neklyayev&#8217;s wife, 
who was present, into his ward before leaving. As of noon on 20 December 2010, his fate 
and whereabouts and condition were unknown. It is now reported that Mr. Neklyayev is 
being detained at the detention centre of the Committee for State Security.  
</p>
<p>250. A number of other presidential candidates were present at the protest and were 
arrested and detained by men in plain clothing. It is alleged that those arrested included <b>Mr. 
Andrey Sannikov, Mr. Vitaliy Romashevskiy, Mr. Nikolay Statkevich, </b>and <b>Mr. 
Grigoriy Kostusev. 
</b></p>
<p>251. Later on in the evening of 19 December, at approximately 19:00, the following 
journalists who were covering the arrest of Mr. Neklyayev and his supporters were 
allegedly told by the police to stop working and lie face down in the snow: <b>Mr. Dmitry 
Lukashuk</b>, correspondent for Evroradio, <b>Ms. Yelena Yakzhik</b>, reporter for Solidamost, 
<b>Ms. Yulia Doroshkevich</b>, correspondent for Nasha Niva; <b>Mr. Andrei Lenkevich</b>, 
freelance photographer, and <b>Mr. Anton Taras</b> of the BelaPAN news agency. It has also </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b>  
</p>
<p>been reported that <b>Mr. John Hill</b>, a New York Times reporter, was hit in the face when he 
attempted to show his press pass to the riot police. The police officers allegedly seized the 
journalists&#8217; equipment and deleted photographs and recordings.    
</p>
<p>252. At approximately 22:00 on the same day, <b>Mr Aleh Gulak</b>, Chair of the Belarusian 
Helsinki Committee was reportedly arrested and detained by riot police while observing a 
demonstration organised by an opposition candidate, held directly in front of Government 
Headquarters. Mr Gulak was reportedly taken to Akrestine pre-trial detention facility before 
being placed in police custody at Pervomaysky district police station.  
</p>
<p>253. It was further reported that on 20 December 2010, at approximately 03:15 the 
headquarters of &#8220;Viasna&#8221;, located in central Minsk, was raided by special security officers. 
The headquarters was searched and all electrical equipment was seized. Some time later at 
03:45, members of &#8220;Viasna&#8221;, <b>Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich, Mr. Uladzimir Labkovich, 
Mr. Andrey Paluda, Mr. Zmitser Salaueu, Mr. Uladzimir Mikalaeu, Mr. Aleg 
Zhlutka, Mr. Kanstantsin Staradubets, Mr. Vital Charniauski</b> and <b>Ms. Nasta Loyka</b> 
were allegedly arrested and taken to Pervomaysky district police station where they were 
interrogated. They were reportedly released a short time later. 
</p>
<p>254. At approximately 04:40, the office of the website Charter 97 was also raided by 
police. <b>Ms Natalia Radina</b>, chief editor for Charter 97 was arrested and brought to the 
State Security Agency (KGB). The Charter 97 website reportedly remains inaccessible in 
Belarus, as well as the websites of Belaruspartisan and Gazetaby. It has also been reported 
that social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Odnoklassniki have been 
intermittently inaccessible, and access to Google and Yahoo e-mail services has been 
blocked.  
</p>
<p>255. At 06:00 <b>Mr. Dimitry Bondarenko</b>, coordinator of the civic campaign &#168;European 
Belarus&#168; was arrested and detained in at a KGB prison.    
</p>
<p>256. At approximately 07:00 a group of police officers in plain clothing again tried to 
enter the headquarters of Human Rights Centre Viasna but were refused entry by staff 
members. The police officers then began to dismantle the doors in a bid to gain entry. Mr 
Ales Bialiatski, Chair of Human Rights Centre Viasna arrived at the headquarters and 
requested that the police officers present a search warrant, however they failed to do so. 
They left the premises some time later. 
</p>
<p>257. Other human rights defenders allegedly arrested include <b>Mr. Vladimir Loyko, Mr. 
Siarhei Sys,</b> and <b>Mr. Dmitri Solovyov</b>. They were reportedly detained at Perovomayski 
district police station.  
</p>
<p>258. Although the official number of people detained on 19-20 December has not been 
clarified, &#8220;Viasna&#8221; has reportedly estimated that as many as 400 individuals may have been 
detained throughout Belarus.  
</p>
<p>259. On 21 December 2010, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Navy 
Pillay, expressed deep concern about the violence against and detention of opposition 
candidates and their supporters in the aftermath of the elections in the Republic of Belarus. 
The High Commissioner called on the Government to ensure that human rights defenders, 
journalists and civil society organizations are free from any harassment.  
</p>
<p>260. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the 
aforementioned journalists and human rights defenders. Further concern was expressed that 
the alleged raids, arrests and detentions may be related to their peaceful and legitimate 
activities in the defence of human rights, as well as the journalists&#8217; professional activities to 
4report on matters of public interest. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>261. In a letter dated 10 January 2011, the Government responded to the urgent appeal 
sent on 22 December 2010 by providing information on the prison conditions of persons 
detained during the events in Minsk on 19 December.  
</p>
<p>262. The investigation department responsible for preliminary investigations, working 
under the Central Internal Affairs Department of the Minsk City Executive Committee, on 
19 December 2010 instituted criminal proceedings under article 293, paragraphs 1 and 2, of 
the Criminal Code of Belarus in connection with the events that led to the mass 
disturbances in Minsk on that day. 
</p>
<p>263. As at 3 January 2010, 19 persons were held in the State Security Committee (KGB) 
remand centre on charges of deliberate organization of mass disturbances, accompanied by 
violence against individuals, rioting, destruction of property and armed resistance to the 
authorities, and of direct involvement in mass disturbances, contrary to article 293, 
paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>264. Pursuant to inquiries, the preventive measure, in the form of remand in custody, 
taken against the accused, V. Rymasheuski and A. Dmitriev, was on 31 December 2010 
commuted to travel restraints and a pledge of good behaviour. D. Vus and R. Kastusiou had 
been released earlier subject to travel restraints. 
</p>
<p>265. According to information from the law enforcement agencies, the procedures and 
conditions of confinement of persons held in custody in the KGB remand centre are in 
keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted on 10 December 1948 
by the General Assembly, and meet the requirements of Act No. 215-3, of 16 June 2003, on 
the procedures and conditions of confinement of persons in custody, and departmental 
regulations.  
</p>
<p>266. The accused and other persons were held in custody in common cells that complied 
with health and fire safety regulations. All the persons held in custody were provided with 
their own sleeping area, bedding, dishes and dining utensils. Hot meals were provided free 
of charge three times a day in accordance with existing legal standards. The accused made 
no complaints about the quality of the prepared meals. 
</p>
<p>267. The persons held in custody were allowed to exercise fully their right to counsel. 
Legal counsel was provided in the manner prescribed by the laws of Belarus. 
</p>
<p>268. The accused have access to the books and periodicals in the remand centre library 
and to publications and literature sent to them by family members or acquired through the 
detention centre administration. They are permitted to exercise for up to two hours a day 
and are entitled to eight hours of sleep at night. Virtually every cell is equipped with a 
television, enabling prisoners to watch programmes in accordance with their daily routine. 
</p>
<p>269. All persons detained in custody may receive parcels of clothing without restrictions 
and up to 30 kg of food per month. 
</p>
<p>270. Almost all the accused received at least two parcels during the detention period. In 
total, more than 50 parcels and 5 packages were delivered to them, containing over 400 kg 
of food, various personal effects, clothing and medicine. 
</p>
<p>271. Medical care is provided, and health and hygiene conditions ensured in the detention 
centre in accordance with domestic law: medical examinations are carried out daily, 
including by medical specialists. Where indicated, any necessary medical procedures are 
carried out and preventive treatment given, and free medication is provided to prisoners 
requiring it who do not have their own. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>272. For example, one of the accused suffering from diabetes mellitus was provided with 
the costly medicines metformin and Diabetone as soon as he was taken into custody. 
</p>
<p>273. The administration and the medical staff make every effort to maintain a proper 
level of health and hygiene in the detention centre, with due regard for any risk to life or 
health that a person in custody may face. 
</p>
<p>274. All accused persons are given the opportunity to have the benefit of counsel. 
</p>
<p>275. In accordance with article 43 of the Act on the procedures and conditions of 
confinement of persons in custody and for the purpose of reviewing the claims of the 
detainees&#8217; family members, officials of the Office of the Procurator General of Belarus on 
31 December 2010 verified the procedures and conditions of confinement of the persons in 
custody in the KGB remand centre and found no evidence of a breach of law. None of the 
accused, including the former presidential candidates, filed a claim or report on the actions 
of the remand centre personnel or the prison conditions during the verification exercise. 
</p>
<p>276. It was ascertained that the prison regime for the persons in custody complies with 
the regulations of the KGB remand centre. According to the conclusions received, all the 
persons in custody are in good health. They have been given access to their lawyers and 
relatives and deliveries are duly made. Additional medical personnel have been assigned to 
provide medical care on a 24-hour basis. 
</p>
<p>277. The conditions of confinement in the KGB remand centre of the persons charged 
with organizing mass disturbances on 19 December 2010 are thus in keeping with 
international law and national and departmental laws and regulations. 
</p>
<p>278. In a letter dated 19 January 2011, the Government provided additional information 
regarding the urgent appeal sent on 22 December 2010. However, the reply had not yet 
been translated at the time of finalization of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is 
unfortunately not in a position to summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes 
that he will be able to make his observations on the reply in his future report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>279. On 28 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the <b>request received by the 
Belarusian Helsinki Committee from the Ministry of Justice to submit a copy to it of 
the letter addressed to the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers.</b> The Belarusian Helsinki Committee is an independent, non-political, non-profit 
public association which works to promote and protect human rights providing legal 
assistance and regularly holding human rights seminars and training courses. We have also 
received information concerning alleged interference in the professional discharge of 
functions of lawyers in connection with the 19 to 20 December 2010, demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>280. According to information received, on 12 January 2011, the Belarusian Helsinki 
Committee (BHC) posted on its website information that it had sent a letter to the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.  Immediately after, the head of 
department of non-commercial organizations of the Ministry of Justice reportedly sent a fax 
to the BHC requesting it to provide him with the text of letter within 30 minutes.  
</p>
<p>281. On the same day a statement was issued by the Ministry of Justice accusing the 
BHC of distorting information contained in reports issued by the Ministry regarding the 
demonstrations. The Ministry also alleged that the information sent by the BHC to 
international organizations distorted the present state of affairs in the country and that such 
conduct was tantamount to a violation of legislation governing Non-Governmental 
Organizations.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>282. We have also received reports alleging interference in the lawyers&#8217; discharge of 
professional functions in their capacity as defense counsel of those clients associated with 
the demonstrations which occurred on 19 and 20 December 2010. It is alleged that arrested 
persons are prevented from meeting their lawyers in private and the frequency of visits by 
counsel to meet their clients is restricted.  
</p>
<p>283. We are informed that national legislation governing confidentiality of investigations 
provides for &#8220;secrecy of investigation&#8221;. It is alleged that the provision is being used by 
investigators at the Minsk City Department of Interior as a means of prohibiting lawyers 
from disseminating any information related to the investigation and the whereabouts of 
those arrested in connection with the demonstrations.  
</p>
<p>284. On 29 December 2010, the Ministry of Justice issued a statement alleging that 
comments made by some lawyers providing legal defense to people arrested in connection 
with the demonstrations violated the professional ethics of lawyers. The statement alleged 
that some lawyers were misrepresenting information relating to investigations, 
opportunities for their clients to seek legal assistance, their clients&#8217; health status and prison 
conditions, and the work of law enforcement bodies.   
</p>
<p>285. On 5 January 2011, the Ministry of Justice is alleged to have sent letters to several 
lawyers including Ms. Tamara Sidarenka and Mr. Paval Sapelko.  
</p>
<p>286. The letter sent to Ms. Tamara Sidarenka, alleged that on 24 December 2010, during 
an interview she falsely represented that she was prevented from meeting her client and that 
such conduct undermined lawyers obligations to maintain professional and personal dignity 
and violated professional ethics of the legal profession. Ministry of Justice has reportedly 
ordered Ms. Sidarenka to take measures to prevent such misrepresentation of information. 
She was instructed to inform the Ministry on measures taken to implement the order by 15 
January 2011, otherwise her license would be revoked.  
</p>
<p>287. The letter sent to Mr. Paval Sapelko, who is representing one of the presidential 
candidates arrested during the demonstration, alleged that he had made incorrect statements 
against the college of lawyers, the treatment of his client and the conditions of his 
detention. It also alleged that he had made comments regarding pressure from the State on 
the work of State lawyers, especially in the defense of his client. The Ministry of Justice 
has allegedly requested the Minsk City Bar to take disciplinary action against Mr. Sapelka. 
On 10 January 2011, Mr. Sapelko received a letter from the Ministry of Justice that 
disciplinary action had been initiated to revoke his license.  
</p>
<p>288. There have also been other reports of interference. For example, on 4 January 2011, 
the Collegium of the Ministry of Justice endorsed a decision of the Ministry&#8217;s Bar 
Qualification Commission made on 3 January 2011, to suspend the license of Ms 
Valiantsina Bus&#8217;ko, an advocate of Hrodna Regional Bar. She was suspended for her 
participation in the demonstrations. In addition, on 10 January 2011, the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office initiated a case against Mr. Mikhail Volchak for divulging information 
related to a criminal investigation against the former Senior Investigator of the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office who was investigating corruption cases. 
</p>
<p>289. Concern was expressed at the alleged acts of intimidation against the BHC for 
submitting information to the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers and for the interference in the discharge of the professional functions of lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>290. In a letter dated 1 February 2011, the Government responded to the urgent letter sent 
on 28 January 2011 as follows.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>291. Information from the competent Belarusian authorities about the events in Minsk on 
19 December 2010 and the use of preventive measures against the persons involved in 
them: on 19 December 2010, between 6.50 p.m. and 11.50 p.m., an unauthorized protest 
against the Belarusian presidential election results was organized and staged in Minsk. All 
told, the organizers of the protest mobilized some 3,000 persons. 
</p>
<p>292. The protest began with a march from various parts of the capital to October Square. 
The protesters blocked traffic and began to move towards the building of the President&#8217;s 
Office, but were stopped by a State traffic police cordon. 
</p>
<p>293. Former presidential candidates A. Sannikov, M. Statkevich and V. Rymashevsky 
each spoke in turn at October Square and told the audience that they &#8220;were afraid of 
nothing and would stay to the end&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>294. Rymashevsky demanded that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka come to the square 
and then announced the establishment of a Narodnaya Rada, or People&#8217;s Council, 
composed of the presidential candidates of the current and past elections, as an &#8220;alternative 
government&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>295. Sannikov said: &#8220;We will not allow the usurper to hold on to power. The elections 
were neither free nor fair. The results were rigged.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>296. It is significant that the election results had not yet been announced at that time. The 
claim of electoral fraud, thus, had been rehearsed and was of a deliberately incendiary 
nature. 
</p>
<p>297. At 8.55 p.m., Sannikov, Statkevich and Rymashevsky led a group of demonstrators 
along the roadway to Independence Square. During the march several young persons used 
pyrotechnic devices, climbed up onto snow-removal equipment and attempted acts of 
provocation around State institutions (burning the national flag, shouting offensive slogans 
and inciting the State institution security guards to strike back). 
</p>
<p>298. Individual activists gathered directly on the square. Stankevich and Sannikov called 
on the demonstrators to &#8220;hold a rally for at least two days&#8221; and to &#8220;phone and invite friends 
and acquaintances to the protest&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>299. Subsequently, the protesters were provoked into gross violations of public order. At 
9.50 p.m., on Sannikov&#8217;s call, the crowd, headed by Statkevich, Khalip and Kostusev, 
advanced towards the government building, which also houses the Central Election 
Commission and the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>300. During this time, law enforcement officers, despite the unlawful acts of the 
demonstrators, remained calm and did nothing to impede their activities. 
</p>
<p>301. Within a half hour, between 10 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., the demonstrators drew close to 
the front of the government building, smashed windows, broke down doors and called for 
negotiations. 
</p>
<p>302. There is testimony that the opposition leaders at the time not only did nothing in 
their capacity as organizers to stop the protest as it took a violent and thus unlawful turn, 
but they also openly called on the crowd to defy the authorities and continue efforts to 
&#8220;enter the government building&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>303. At 10.37 p.m., law enforcement officers began to drive the crowd back away from 
the building and at 11.50 p.m. the unlawful acts of the opposition were suppressed. The 
protesters used steel rods, crowbars, tyre irons and other objects to cause injury and fight on 
the street, which attests to the evident aggressive nature of the protesters&#8217; acts. As a result 
of the clash with the protesters, 87 militia officers required medical care for traumas of 
varying severity and 9 persons were hospitalized. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>304. The protesters were arrested in accordance with domestic legislation and the relevant 
provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as the protest on 19 
December was neither peaceful nor authorized under the law. The term &#8220;human rights 
defender&#8221; cannot apply to persons taking part in a protest involving violence and disorderly 
conduct. 
</p>
<p>305. On 20 December 2010, the investigation department responsible for preliminary 
investigations, a unit of the Central Internal Affairs Office attached to the Minsk City 
Executive Committee, instituted criminal proceedings in accordance with article 293, 
paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code (deliberate acts by unidentified persons aimed at 
organizing mass disturbances, or participation therein, accompanied by violence against 
individuals, rioting, destruction of property or armed opposition to the authorities). 
</p>
<p>306. Thirty-one persons, including Neklyaev, Sannikov, Statkevich, Radina and 
Bondarenko, were accused in this criminal case and remanded in custody. Also among the 
accused is Rymashevsky, who was remanded in custody as a preventive measure and has 
now been released on his own recognizance. There are several other persons, including 
Kostusev, with the status of suspect. 
</p>
<p>307. A preliminary criminal investigation into the matter is now being conducted. 
</p>
<p>308. Reasons for the remand in custody of former presidential candidate Neklyaev: on 19 
December 2010, the law enforcement bodies of Belarus took a decision to verify 
intelligence information about a threat to public order (a risk that homemade explosives 
might be used by certain participants in the rally), including through the inspection of the 
vehicles of the protest organizers. Failing to comply with the legitimate demands of the 
State traffic police officers, Neklyaev took steps to block a State traffic patrol car, as is 
borne out by a video recording. 
</p>
<p>309. A scuffle broke out as a result of opposition from Neklyaev supporters, during 
which the presidential candidate, who was among those involved, sustained bodily injury 
and a head trauma and was hospitalized. 
</p>
<p>310. Smoke bombs, steel rods, stakes and other articles used as weapons were found in 
the course of an inspection of a vehicle belonging to a staff member of the public campaign 
entitled &#8220;Tell the Truth&#8221; (headed by Neklyaev). 
</p>
<p>311. On 6 January 2011, the Minsk Central District Court rejected Neklyaev&#8217;s lawyer&#8217;s 
appeal to modify the preventive measure against his client, as Neklyaev is accused of a 
particularly serious offence under article 293, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>312. Reasons for the remand in custody of Khalip and Radina and the searches of the 
offices of a number of media outlets. 
</p>
<p>313. According to information from the competent authorities of Belarus, on 19 
December 2010 the investigation department responsible for preliminary investigations, a 
unit of the Central Internal Affairs Department attached to the Minsk City Executive 
Committee, opened a criminal investigation into the events that day that had led to mass 
disturbances, based on evidence of offences under article 293 (mass disturbances), 
paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>314. On 20 December 2010, the investigation department responsible for pretrial 
investigations in the criminal case detained Irina Vladimirovna Khalip and Natalya 
Valentinovna Radina under article 108 of the Criminal Code (detention on grounds of direct 
suspicion). They were arrested and subsequently held in custody as a preventive measure 
(on 22 December 2010) solely on the basis of reliable information attesting to their direct 
involvement in offences under article 293, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>Accordingly, on 29 December 2010, Khalip and Radina were charged with organizing and 
participating in mass disturbances accompanied by rioting and destruction of property. 
</p>
<p>315. The accused persons&#8217; residence and Radina&#8217;s place of work (the office of the 
Charter &#8217;97 Internet resource) were searched for objects and documents that could be 
pertinent to the criminal investigation, in accordance with the law of criminal procedure of 
Belarus. The searches were thus prompted by the need to obtain the relevant evidence (of 
guilt or innocence) and establish the truth of the matter. 
</p>
<p>316. The searches of the news offices of European Radio for Belarus, the Belsat satellite 
television channel and the newspaper Nasha Niva were also prompted by the need to find 
items and documents, above all video recordings, attesting to certain persons&#8217; organizing 
and participating in offences under article 293, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Criminal Code. 
The computer equipment taken in the course of the search was not confiscated and will be 
returned to its owners after investigative measures are taken. 
</p>
<p>317. The following is worth noting in connection with the allegations made by some 
States that the rights of journalists (Khalip and Radina) were infringed during the events on 
the evening of 19 December in Minsk. 
</p>
<p>318. Khalip, a reporter covering Belarus for the Russian periodical Novaya Gazeta, had 
not applied for accreditation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, which grants 
foreign journalists in Belarus accreditation on a regular basis, and thus had no legal grounds 
for engaging in journalistic work in the country. 
</p>
<p>319. Under domestic law, the Charter &#8217;97 website (www.charter97.org), of which Radina 
is press spokesperson, is not a media outlet. By definition, therefore, Radina had no legal 
grounds to engage in journalism, especially as a press spokesperson is not a journalist per 
se. 
</p>
<p>320. According to law enforcement bodies, Khalip and Radina are currently in good 
health. Proper medical care is available, if necessary, in the KGB pretrial detention facility, 
where they are being held in custody. The accused sought medical attention during their 
detention in the facility and, after proper consultations, no medication was prescribed. 
</p>
<p>321. Procedure for appealing against sentences for administrative offences: Belarusian 
law provides for an appeal against a court judgement involving an administrative offence. 
</p>
<p>322. Under article 12.1, paragraph 1, of the Administrative Code, a judgement involving 
an administrative offence may be appealed by the person against whom it has been 
pronounced, the victims and their representatives and counsel for the defence. 
</p>
<p>323. Under article 12.2, paragraph 4, of the Administrative Code, judgements that have 
not entered into force involving administrative offences may be appealed to a higher court. 
</p>
<p>324. Under article 12.11, paragraph 1, of the Administrative Code, a judgement that has 
entered into force involving administrative offences may be retried where an appeal is 
brought by persons referred to in article 12.1, paragraph 1, of the Code, if this is done 
before the judgement enters into force or if the procurator&#8217;s office raises an objection. 
</p>
<p>325. To date, none of the protesters have lodged a complaint with the Office of the 
Procurator-General of Belarus about the administrative measures taken against them. 
</p>
<p>326. The Office has not received any appeal concerning the alleged use of physical or 
psychological coercion against representatives of the media or members of youth groups. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>327. On 25 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>human rights defenders sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>multiple allegations of 
harassment, arrests and interrogation of numerous human rights defenders in Belarus 
following the presidential elections held in December 2010.</b>  
</p>
<p>328. According to the new information received, on 19 January 2011, human rights 
defender and member of Viasna, <b>Mr. Andrei Paluda</b>, was allegedly summoned to the State 
Security Agency (KGB) Sklou district department where he was interrogated about his 
involvement in unauthorized street rallies held in the aftermath of the presidential elections.  
</p>
<p>329. On 27 January 2011, <b>Mr. Valiantsin Stefanovich</b>, co-chair of Human Rights Centre 
Viasna and participant in the Human Rights Defenders for Free Elections Campaign, was 
reportedly summoned for questioning at the local KGB office in Mazyr.  
</p>
<p>330. On 28 January 2011, <b>Ms. Natalia Radina</b>, editor of the pro-democracy news site 
charter97.org, was reportedly released from detention. She had been arrested on 20 
December 2010 when police raided the offices of the news site. Reportedly her passport has 
now been confiscated and she has been forced to relocate from Minsk to Kobrin, where she 
is not allowed to leave the town and must report to the police daily.  
</p>
<p>331. On 14 February 2011, <b>Mr. Ales Bialiatski</b>, president of Human Rights Centre 
Viasna and vice-president of the International Human Rights Federation (FIDH), was 
summoned by phone to present himself at the office of the Public Prosecutor. It is reported 
that on the same day, Mr. Bialiatski was also given a written warning by the Public 
Prosecutor which stated that the work carried out by Viasna was in breach of Belarusian 
legislation, based on the fact that the organization is not registered with the Ministry of 
Justice.  It is reported that on 12 August 2009, the Belarusian Supreme Court denied Viasna 
registration with the Ministry of Justice. This contravenes a recommendation made in July 
2007 by the United Nations Human Rights Committee which held that the dissolution of 
Viasna violated Article 22.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of 
which Belarus is a party, and recommended that the complainants &#8220;be entitled to an 
appropriate remedy, including the re-registration of Viasna&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>332. Prior to the summons of Mr. Bialiatski, on 17 January 2011, at approximately 15:00, 
three officers of the KGB searched the headquarters of Viasna in Minsk. It is reported that 
the search warrant made reference to the events which took place in the aftermath of the 
presidential elections in December 2010. During the search in January, Mr. Bialiatski was 
reportedly arrested and other staff members were forced to leave the premises and a 
computer was seized.   
</p>
<p>333. Information on new cases was also raised, as follows. On 19 January 2011, the home 
of <b>Ms. Raisa Mikhailouskaya</b> was raided by KGB officers. Ms. Mikhailouskaya is the 
leader of the Centre for Human Rights, Minsk. It is alleged that the offices of Human 
Rights Centre Minsk were also raided by KGB officers and computers were seized. 
</p>
<p>334. Allegedly, on 21 January 2011, the home of <b>Mr. Uladzimir Tseliapun</b>, human 
rights defender, was raided by the KGB officers. It is reported that the officers seized his 
personal computer and a number of DVDs. On 14 February 2011, it is reported that Mr. 
Tseliapun received a summons to present himself at the local KGB office.  
</p>
<p>335. On 26 January 2011, it is reported that local KGB officers in Homiel, searched the 
private residence of human rights defender, <b>Mr. Leanid Sudalenka</b>. During the search a 
notebook, net-book, and computer were seized.  
</p>
<p>336. On 29 January 2011, <b>Mr. Aleh Vouchak</b>, legal assistant at the Centre for Human 
Rights, Minsk, was reportedly interrogated by Frunzienski police officers about a criminal 
case concerning mass riots on 19 December 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>337. On 29 January 2011, it was reported that <b>Ms. Iryna Khalip</b>, a human rights 
journalist was released from pre-trial detention and placed under house arrest. It is alleged 
that there were two KGB officers present at all times who ensured that Ms. Khalip did not 
make contact with the outside world. Ms. Khalip&#8217;s husband, Mr. Andrey Sannikov, remains 
in detention. It is reported that Ms. Khalip was arrested on 19 December 2010, while giving 
an interview to a Russian radio station. During the interview she stated that the riot police 
employed violence to break up a demonstration which following the presidential elections. 
It is alleged that her husband was badly beaten by police during the break-up of the 
demonstration. According to the new information received, both Ms. Khalip and Ms. 
Radina were obliged to sign a document which stated that they would not disclose any 
information about their detention or criminal charges brought against them. 
</p>
<p>338. On 15 February 2011, <b>Ms. Nasta Loika</b>, lawyer with Human Rights Centre Viasna, 
and a participant in the International Youth Human Rights Movement, received various 
phone calls from an investigator of military counter intelligence after which she agreed to 
meet with one of the officers, who reportedly invited her to become an informant.  
</p>
<p>339. On 21 February 2011, the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a press 
release in which she expressed her deep concern about the current situation for human 
rights defenders in Belarus, particularly concerning those facing trial for exercising their 
right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>340. Concern was expressed regarding the situation of the above-mentioned persons as 
well as about the human rights defenders community in Belarus in the aftermath of the 
period of unrest which followed the presidential elections in December 2010. Serious 
concern was expressed regarding allegations that human rights defenders are being arrested, 
detained and harassed by the security forces, including through restrictions on their 
movement, as a result of their legitimate work in the defence of human rights, in particular 
of their activities during the presidential elections in December 2010. Further concern was 
expressed that raids carried out on the offices and private residences of human rights 
defenders as well as the seizure of material and equipment, may hinder them from carrying 
out their legitimate work.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>341. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed responses received 
to his communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets that at the time 
of finalizing this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to his 
communication of 25 February 2011, and to 13 communications sent earlier in 2008, 2006 
and 2004.  
</p>
<p>342. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the human rights situation in 
Belarus since the presidential election of 19 December 2010, and in particular regarding 
reports of increasing harassment of journalists, media outlets and human rights defenders. 
He urges the Government to fully guarantee all individuals&#8217; right to freedom of opinion and 
expression as well as media diversity and pluralism.  
</p>
<p><b>  Burundi 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>343. On 21 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Independent Expert on the 
situation of human rights in Burundi, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders sent an allegation letter concerning Ms. <b>Neela Ghoshal</b>, Human Rights 
Watch&#8217;s researcher in Burundi.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>344. According to the information received, on 18 May 2010, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of Burundi informed Ms. Ghoshal in a letter that the Government had decided to 
cancel Ms. Ghoshal&#8217;s status as the representative of Human Rights Watch in Burundi and 
demanded that she cease her activities and leave the country.  
</p>
<p>345. The decision of the Government was reportedly based on the report that Human 
Rights Watch issued on 14 May 2010 regarding escalating violence in the run-up to the 
elections. The report documented instances of violence carried out by and against members 
of political parties, which reportedly was not properly investigated by the police.  
</p>
<p>346. Concern was expressed that the decision to cancel the work permit of Ms. Neela 
Ghoshal and to order her to leave the country might be directly related to her peaceful 
activities in defence of human rights, in particular her activities as a researcher of Human 
Rights Watch.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>347. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communications of 21 May 2010, and to 
earlier communications sent on 26 November 2009, as well as to five communications sent 
in 2008. He considers response to his communications an important part of cooperation by 
Governments with his mandate. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised 
by him, and provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken as well as 
protective measures taken.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cambodia 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>348. On 14 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the 
situation of Mr. <b>Leang Sokchouen</b>, Mr. <b>Tach Vannak</b>, Mr.<b> Tach Le</b> and Mr. <b>Tach Khong 
Phoung</b>.  Mr. Leang Sokchouen is a staff member of the local human rights NGO 
LICADHO working to protect human rights in Cambodia and to promote respect for civil 
and political rights by the Cambodian Government and institutions.   
</p>
<p>349. According to the information received, on 30 August 2010, Mr. Leang Sokchouen, 
Mr. Tach Vannak and Mr. Tach Le were sentenced to two years in prison and a two million 
riels fine (approximately US$ 500).  Another defendant, Mr. Tach Khong Phoung, was tried 
in absentia and sentenced to three years imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>350. Mr. Leang Sokchouen and others were reportedly accused of distributing anti-
Government fliers in Takeo Province on 4 January 2010.  Mr. Sokchouen was a longtime 
acquaintance of co-defendant Mr. Tach Khong Phoung but, according to reports received, 
he has consistently testified that he had no knowledge of the flier incident.  
</p>
<p>351. It has come to our attention that the trial on 30 August was marked by a number of 
deficiencies that would indicate that the defendants did not enjoy a fair trial.  According to 
the information received, Mr. Sokchouen was arrested without prior notice early on a 
Saturday morning and was held incommunicado for more than 33 hours. During this time, 
he was reportedly detained inside the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s National Police Headquarters 
without access to a lawyer; a violation of Article 98 of the Cambodian Code of Criminal 
Procedure.  
</p>
<p>352. It has been alleged that the official investigation report did not confirm that the 
police arrested the correct man since investigators identified the suspect in the alleged </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>phone calls as &#8220;Mr. L. Sokly,&#8221; a Vietnamese national living in Phnom Penh&#8217;s Russei Keo 
district. Mr. Sokchouen is a Khmer national living in the Sen Sok district. 
</p>
<p>353. Furthermore, one of the defendants, Mr. Tach Vannak, who had initially claimed 
during his detention at the Ministry of Interior&#8217;s National Police that Leang Sokchouen had 
been involved in distributing the fliers, allegedly retracted part of his earlier statement 
during the hearing stating that he only implicated Mr. Sokchouen because of false promises 
made by police interrogators.  He claimed police promised him that he would be allowed to 
go back to his family in exchange for his cooperation. However, the judge reportedly 
ignored the retraction. The defendant also claimed that there was police misconduct, yet the 
judge allegedly ignored what was said in his courtroom and instead relied on police 
paperwork. 
</p>
<p>354. According to the information received, the evidence provided by the police against 
Mr. Sokchouen consisted of a list of phone numbers claiming Mr. Sokchouen and Mr. Tach 
Khong Phoung had called each other. Furthermore, the judge reportedly relied entirely on 
written statements and four alleged witness statements from police officers, all of which 
were produced by the prosecutor. It has been reported that none of these individuals were 
called to court by the investigating judge or cross-examined by the defence. 
</p>
<p>355. During the trial, the judge reportedly stated that in-court testimonies by the three 
accused &#8220;could not be trusted&#8221; and based his decision entirely upon the police report and 
interrogation.  Article 118 of the Cambodian Code of Criminal Procedure states that police 
reports can be used for &#8220;information only,&#8221; but that they may also be considered as 
evidence if they are not &#8220;proven false.&#8221; According to the information received, despite 
strong evidence that the police report was false, the judge did reportedly not evaluate its 
veracity.   
</p>
<p>356. According to reports received, the Court did not examine whether the distribution of 
the leaflets constituted a crime in the first place. During the hearing, there was allegedly 
only marginal examination of whether the leaflets and their dissemination constituted the 
crime of &#8220;disinformation&#8221; under article 62 of the UNTAC penal provisions which defines it 
as the &#8220;publication or dissemination of false information in bad faith with malicious intent, 
which has disturbed or is likely to disturb public peace&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>357. In his justification, the Prosecutor reportedly stated that the leaflets constituted 
criticism to Cambodia&#8217;s leadership and that they could have caused social unrest. In the 
announcement of the verdict, the trial judge did not provide any further elaboration on this 
argument.  According to the information received, Mr. Leang Sokchouen has lodged an 
appeal to the verdict.   
</p>
<p>358. Concern was expressed about the situation of Mr. Leang Sokchouen, Mr. Tach 
Vannak, Mr. Tach Le and Mr. Tach Khong Phoung and the allegations that the conviction 
of Mr. Leang Sokchouen and the three other defendants may constitute a violation of the 
right to freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. In addition, concern was 
expressed that the prosecution of Mr. Leang Sokchouen, a human rights defender, on the 
basis of alleged questionable evidence may have an adverse impact on the working climate 
for human rights defenders in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>359. On 6 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations to the Government 
concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Ath Thorn</b>, President of the Cambodian Labour

<p>360. According to the information received, on 15 September 2010, it was announced 
that law suits for inciting garment workers to strike would be filed against a group of nine 
people, including the above mentioned union leaders and labour activists &#8211; Mr. Ath Thorn, 
Ms. Morm Nhim and Mr. Tola Moeum. The strike was reportedly scheduled to take place 
between 13 and 18 September 2010, but it was postponed due to the alleged invitation to 
the CLC and CNC to attend a negotiation meeting at the MoSalvy on 27 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>361. Previously, on 23 July 2010, Mr. Ath Thorn was reportedly warned that he would 
face criminal proceedings if he continued to oppose the minimum wage decision. 
Furthermore, in mid-August, Mr. Ath Thorn allegedly received a warning not to go out at 
night. According to the information received, on 17 August 2010, an assistant of the union 
leader received a phone call from an unidentified caller concerning Mr. Ath Thorn's 
activities and actions relating to wages for garment workers. Around the same date, Mr. 
Tola Moeun was reported that union leaders and campaign supporters were likely to be 
charged with incitement. In addition, on 28 August 2010, the CLC received the following 
anonymous phone call stating: &#8220;Please tell all your supervisors to not be strong. Be 
careful&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>362. Concern was expressed that the prosecution of Mr. Ath Thorn, Ms. Morm Nhim and 
Mr. Tola Moeun, and the threats against the CLC, may be related to their legitimate 
activities in supporting workers&#8217; rights in Cambodia.  
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>363. On 3 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in Cambodia and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations regarding Mr. <b>Reach Seima</b>, a farmer 
who has been representing a group of 64 co-villagers contesting what they regard as 
encroachment on their lands by a private company; and Mr. <b>Sam Chankea</b>, provincial 
coordinator of the non-governmental organization ADHOC who has been assisting the 
farmers to seek the protection of their rights through existing legal avenues. Both were 
convicted of defamation on 17 and 18 January 2011 respectively in Kompong Chhnang 
province. These convictions took place in the context of a land dispute that began in 1996 
in Ta Ches commune, Kompong Tralach district in Kompong Chhnang province. 
</p>
<p>364. According to information received, on 26 December 2009, Mr. Reach Seima and 
Mr. Sam Chankea were quoted in a Radio Free Asia (RFA) broadcast reporting on the 
ongoing land dispute between the villagers and KDC International. KDC International is a 
company owned by Ms. Chea Kheng, the wife of Mr. Suy Sem, the Minister of Industry, 
Mines and Energy. The company purchased several hundreds hectares of land from local 
farmers, but in the process, appropriated plots of land belonging to 108 families. These 
villagers had no intention to sell their land. They filed complaints to the local, district and 
provincial authorities, as well as to the National Assembly and the National Authority on 
the Resolution of Land Conflicts, but to no avail. They filed several complaints with the 
provincial court, which took no action to resolve the dispute.  
</p>
<p>365. In December 2009, the company reportedly brought machinery to work on the land, 
which prompted renewed protest by the villagers. A reporter from RFA investigated the 
case and interviewed Mr. Seima and Mr. Chankea. In the broadcast, Mr. Seima explained 
that the land was in dispute before the court and that since the latter had not decided who 
the land belonged to, the company should not work on the land. He also explained that 
since the beginning of this unresolved land dispute, the villagers had lost their land, and 
with it their means of livelihood and food shortages. In the broadcast, Mr. Chankea stated 
that &#8220;what the company has done violates the law because the court has yet to rule on the 
merits of the case. Therefore the company should suspend the activity and await the court </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>decision&#8221;. RFA also interviewed the local representative of the company who declined to 
respond.  
</p>
<p>366. Following a meeting on 25 July 2010, between the company, the villagers and Mr. 
Sam Chankea which failed to resolve the dispute, KDC International accused both Mr. 
Seima and Mr. Chankea of disinformation and defamation and filed a complaint to the court 
to that effect. The Kompong Chhnang Provincial Court proceeded with the two complaints 
separately. It charged and convicted Mr. Seima of defamation on 17 January 2011, under 
Article 305 of the new Penal Code. It sentenced him to pay 10 million riels in fine and 
compensation to the company. Mr. Seima faces six months in prison if he does not pay the 
fine.  
</p>
<p>367. The following day, on 18 January 2011, Mr. Chankea appeared before the same 
court and was convicted of defamation under the same article of the penal code, and 
ordered to pay 4 millions riels in fine and compensation. Mr. Chankea faces three months&#8217; 
imprisonment if he does not pay the fine. 
</p>
<p>368. Concerns were expressed that the conviction of Mr. Seima and Mr. Chankea may be 
related to their legitimate human rights activities, in particular in the peaceful exercise of 
their right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>369. On 22 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Cambodia, sent an urgent appeal regarding the case of Mr. <b>Seng Kunnaka</b>, 
a staff member of the United Nations World Food Programme, who was convicted of 
criminal incitement by Phnom Penh Municipal Court on 19 December 2010, and was 
sentenced to six months&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of 1 million riels. 
</p>
<p>370. According to the information received, on 17 December 2010, Mr. Kunnaka was 
reportedly arrested and taken into custody in Russei Keo district police for questioning for 
48 hours. On 19 December 2010, he was tried by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court under 
articles 494 and 495 of the new Penal Code, which recently entered into force. Article 495 
prohibits persons from directly inciting others to commit a criminal act, while article 494 
defines speeches, writing or sketches, or audio-visual communications as acts of 
incitement, provided they are committed in public.  
</p>
<p>371. Mr. Kunnaka was convicted for printing information materials from an internet 
website named Khmer Information media and shared them with two colleagues in his 
workplace. Khmer Information Media is a website linked to the political opposition which 
carries information and opinions critical of the Government's policies and practices. The 
materials appear to include caricatures of political leaders, which were called &#8220;traitors&#8221;. Mr. 
Kunnaka did not encourage the persons with whom he shared the materials to take any 
action against any particular person or the Government. His action of sharing printed 
materials with his colleagues does not seem to have been accompanied by provocation of 
any kind. Based on the facts of the case, there is reportedly no evidence to suggest that Mr. 
Kunnaka had any intention to distribute this information as a call to action against the 
Government or any other person. In addition, he shared the materials he printed at his 
workplace and not in a public place.  
</p>
<p>372. It was further reported that observers were not authorised to attend the trial 
proceedings, which were held in camera. The trial took place on a Sunday, two days after 
Mr. Kunnaka's arrest, when courts are normally closed, except for exceptional cases.  
</p>
<p>373. Concerns were expressed that the conviction of Mr. Kunnaka may be related to the 
exercise of his constitutional right to freedom of opinion and expression and to seek, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>receive and communicate information in a peaceful manner. Concern was also raised that 
article 495 of the new Penal Code may have been interpreted to curtail the constitutional 
exercise of freedom of opinion, expression and information, rather than to protect the public 
from the commission of any crime. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>374. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to any of the communications sent during the 
reporting period dated 14 September 2010, 6 October 2010, 3 February 2011, and 22 March 
</p><p>2011. He also regrets that no response to the communications sent during the previous 
period dated 26 March 2009, 3 April 2009, and earlier communications sent in 2008, 2007, 
2006 and 2005. The Special Rapporteur considers response to his communications to be an 
important part of the cooperation between governments and his mandate and as such 
requests that the Government of Cambodia provide details about the issues raised in the 
aforementioned communication at its earliest convenience. 
</p>
<p>375. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding restrictions to the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in Cambodia, including the use of criminal laws on 
defamation and disinformation to suppress opinions and information that are critical of the 
Government. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned by reported acts of 
intimidation, arrests and judicial harassment of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>376. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to take the necessary measures to 
decriminalize defamation, and to promote a climate of tolerance of diverse views and 
opinions, including those that are critical of the powerful.

</p>
<p>379. M. Alex Gustave Azebaze serait poursuivi pour 'propagation de fausses nouvelles' et

<b>M. Herv&#233; Nko&#8217;o</b>, journaliste &#224; l&#8217;hebdomadaire <i>Bebela</i>. 
</p>
<p>383. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 5 f&#233;vrier 2010, MM. Ngota, Mintsa et Nko&#8217;o

Un jour plus tard, M. Sabouang aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; &#224; son tour. Les quatre journalistes auraient

denunciado el supuesto abuso de autoridad y violaci&#243;n del derecho de reuni&#243;n ante los 
medios de comunicaci&#243;n presentes.  
</p>
<p>395. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, posteriormente, dicho oficial Carabinero habr&#237;a dado la 
autorizaci&#243;n a viva voz de que el grupo de defensores pod&#237;a pasar. No obstante, segundos 
m&#225;s tarde, el mismo oficial habr&#237;a dado orden a los funcionarios de las fuerzas especiales 
Carabineros de que detuvieran inmediatamente a todos los activistas y que les subieran al 
autob&#250;s policial. Seguidamente, se alega que varios Carabineros, incluyendo personal 
vestido de civil, habr&#237;an cogido violentamente al Sr. Cristian Garc&#237;a Quintul, reduci&#233;ndole 
por la espalda e inmoviliz&#225;ndole, supuestamente con golpes de pies y pu&#241;os en piernas, 
brazos y rodillas, los cuales le habr&#237;an causado lesiones de mediana gravedad. Adem&#225;s, se 
alega que le habr&#237;an tirado del pelo y las orejas y le habr&#237;an torcido las mu&#241;ecas. Se alega 
asimismo que el Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul habr&#237;a sido golpeado, insultado y amenazado de nuevo 
despu&#233;s de ser introducido en el veh&#237;culo policial. 
</p>
<p>396. Seguidamente, seg&#250;n las alegaciones recibidas, los Sres. Garc&#237;a Quintul y Vargas, 
junto con la Sra. M&#243;nica Garc&#237;a Quintul, hermana del Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul, habr&#237;an sido 
trasladados a la 2&#186; Comisar&#237;a Policial de Puerto Montt sin serles le&#237;dos sus derechos ni ser 
informados de las razones de su detenci&#243;n. En dicha comisar&#237;a los oficiales les habr&#237;an 
quitado sus pertenencias y, despu&#233;s de llevarles al Hospital Base de Puerto Montt para 
constatar lesiones, les habr&#237;an metido en el calabozo.  
</p>
<p>397. Aproximadamente a las 14:30 de ese mismo d&#237;a, tras la intervenci&#243;n de su abogado, 
el Sr. Vargas y la Sra. Garc&#237;a Quintul habr&#237;an sido puestos en libertad. No obstante, el Sr. 
Garc&#237;a Quintul habr&#237;a permanecido detenido acusado de agresi&#243;n a un carabinero, por lo 
que m&#225;s tarde le habr&#237;an trasladado al Recinto Penitenciario de Alto Bonito. Sin embargo, 
seg&#250;n las alegaciones recibidas, existir&#237;an varios documentos gr&#225;ficos que mostrar&#237;an que 
habr&#237;a sido muy dif&#237;cil para el Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul agredir a un carabinero debido a la 
manera en que fue inmovilizado durante su arresto. Seg&#250;n se informa, durante su detenci&#243;n 
en la Comisar&#237;a y en el transcurso del camino hac&#237;a el Recinto Penitenciario el Sr. Garc&#237;a 
Quintul habr&#237;a recibido repetidas amenazas en las que se le habr&#237;a indicado que &#233;l y su 
familia ser&#237;an perseguidos y detenidos. 
</p>
<p>398. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 19 de septiembre 2010, el Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul 
habr&#237;a sido presentado ante el Fiscal Militar de Puerto Varas ya que se habr&#237;a invocado en </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>su contra la Ley de Justicia Militar. Seguidamente, dicho fiscal habr&#237;a decidido dejar al Sr. 
Garc&#237;a Quintul en libertad y habr&#237;a dictado una orden para investigar los hechos de su 
actuaci&#243;n as&#237; como las circunstancias de su detenci&#243;n y el supuesto uso desmedido de la 
fuerza por parte de los Carabineros.  
</p>
<p>399. Se han recibido alegaciones de que estos actos habr&#237;an tenido lugar en el contexto de 
una supuesta campa&#241;a de seguimiento y vigilancia policial del Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul y sus 
compa&#241;eros activistas Mapuche durante los d&#237;as precedentes, mientras &#233;stos habr&#237;an estado 
desarrollando varias actividades con el fin de lograr la atenci&#243;n p&#250;blica sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los presos Mapuche a la vez que un grupo de los mismos manten&#237;a una huelga de 
hambre, la cual habr&#237;a cesado el d&#237;a 9 de octubre de 2010.  
</p>
<p>400. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n de que los actos descritos arriba pudieran estar 
relacionados con las actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos  por 
parte de los citados activistas Mapuches. Se expresa asimismo preocupaci&#243;n por la 
integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Sr. Cristian Garc&#237;a Quintul y de su familia. 
</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>401. Mediante carta fechada el 8 de marzo de 2011, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la carta de 
alegaciones con fecha de 15 de abril de 2010. 
</p>
<p>402. Al respecto, y como consideraci&#243;n preliminar, el Estado de Chile desea destacar que 
en su territorio continental, insular y ant&#225;rtico, est&#225; plenamente vigente el estado de 
derecho, siendo la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de la Rep&#250;blica la que asegura a todas las personas 
que lo habitan el goce de los mismos derechos y garant&#237;as, sin distinci&#243;n ni discriminaci&#243;n 
de ning&#250;n tipo.  
</p>
<p>403. Junto a lo anterior, es necesario se&#241;alar que, adem&#225;s de las normas jur&#237;dicas 
aplicables a todos los chilenos, rige para el pueblo Mapuche, as&#237; como para las nueve etnias 
ind&#237;genas legalmente reconocidas de nuestro pa&#237;s, un conjunto de normas especiales que, 
entre otras materias, establecen una institucionalidad y procedimientos espec&#237;ficos para 
abordar tanto temas de educaci&#243;n, salud, acceso al trabajo, entre otros y hasta 
requerimientos y reivindicaciones de tierras, lo que demuestra, sin lugar a dudas, una mayor 
y especial preocupaci&#243;n por nuestros pueblos originarios, todos quienes se benefician por 
tanto, de un protecci&#243;n jur&#237;dica reforzada.  
</p>
<p>404. Por su parte, la Constituci&#243;n Pol&#237;tica de la Rep&#250;blica establece como garant&#237;as 
fundamentales de los habitantes del pa&#237;s, la igualdad ante la ley y la igual protecci&#243;n de la 
ley en el ejercicio de los derechos - art&#237;culos 19 n&#250;meros 2 y 3 &#8211; En esta l&#237;nea, dispone 
expresamente que en Chile &#8220;no hay persona ni grupo privilegiado&#8221;. No corresponde al 
Estado, entonces, hacer discriminaciones bajo esta clase de circunstancias &#8211; salvo que as&#237; lo 
dispongan leyes especiales- ni, tampoco, el cumplimiento del deber legal y constitucional 
de sus &#243;rganos puede constituir de ninguna manera, una persecuci&#243;n racial o pol&#237;tica en 
contra de una persona o un grupo de personas. 
</p>
<p>405. En el marco descrito, cabe desvirtuar las alegaciones relativas al Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul 
bas&#225;ndonos en la premisa de que, como es sabido, el Estado de Chile reconoce y ampara el 
derechos de reuni&#243;n, as&#237; como la libertad de expresi&#243;n de todos quienes deseen 
manifestarse siempre cuando se cumpla con institucionalidad vigente y mientras no afecte 
el derecho de terceros, tal y como lo establece nuestro ordenamiento jur&#237;dico interno, as&#237; 
como los tratados internacionales ratificados por nuestro pa&#237;s y que se encuentran vigentes.  
</p>
<p>406. Dicho cumplimiento de la institucionalidad se realiza mediante el procedimiento 
establecido &#8211; Ordenanzas de polic&#237;a y otras normas complementarias-, el que debe ser 
verificado con anterioridad a la realizaci&#243;n de la reuni&#243;n/marcha y no de forma simult&#225;nea </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>o posterior a ella, en especial, cuando se trata e actividades que tendr&#225;n un impacto general 
en lugares o bienes nacionales de uso p&#250;blico como son avenidas, calles y plazas. 
</p>
<p>407. Seg&#250;n ha sido informado a los Sres. Relatores Especiales, el Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul y 
otros activistas Mapuches que lo acompa&#241;aban fueron v&#237;ctimas de un supuesto uso 
excesivo de la fuerza por parte del personal policial que desarrollaba el procedimiento de 
detenci&#243;n, antecedentes consistentes en la opini&#243;n de ciertas personas, o tomados de 
entrevistas o declaraciones hechas por los propios supuestos afectados, todos, lo cual se 
comprender&#225;, representa necesariamente una visi&#243;n de la realidad claramente parcializada y 
que no responde a hechos concretos y comprobados. 
</p>
<p>408. En ese contexto, cabe mencionar que las fuerzas de orden y seguridad de Chile 
act&#250;an dentro del &#225;mbito del ordenamiento jur&#237;dico interno, as&#237; como de las normas 
internacionales &#8211;en especial aqu&#233;llas relativas a derechos humanos- ratificadas y vigentes 
en Chile, por lo que la violencia en los procedimientos surge s&#243;lo como consecuencia de 
situaciones de resistencia violenta a las &#243;rdenes de la autoridad, sean judiciales o 
gubernamentales, siendo proporcional a dicha resistencia. 
</p>
<p>409. Hago presente a Uds. que Carabineros de Chile, como encargado del orden y la 
seguridad p&#250;blica, antes de detener o aprehender a algunas persona o grupo de personas que 
pretenda realizar una manifestaci&#243;n no autorizada &#8211;marcha, reuni&#243;n u otra-, siempre 
procede a una conversaci&#243;n previa con los participantes procurando disuadirlos de su 
accionar e inst&#225;ndolos a formalizar su intenci&#243;n de manifestarse, cumpliendo con los 
procedimientos establecidos, tal como ocurri&#243; en el caso del Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul y otros 
activistas Mapuche.  
</p>
<p>410. El Estado de Chile no patrocina ni incentiva, bajo ning&#250;n aspecto, el uso de la 
violencia armada por parte de las fuerzas de orden y seguridad p&#250;blica de nuestro pa&#237;s. La 
&#250;nica posibilidad de que las anteriormente mencionadas fuerzas puedan actuar, seg&#250;n la 
naturaleza del procedimiento policial que corresponda, es por medio de una resoluci&#243;n 
judicial legalmente emitida por un tribunal de la Rep&#250;blica. 
</p>
<p>411. En la misma l&#237;nea, el Estado de Chile no puede comprometerse a no utilizar la 
fuerza p&#250;blica en los casos y en las circunstancias que as&#237; lo ameriten, ya que de ese modo 
estar&#237;a incumpliendo una de sus funciones principales: mantener el orden y la seguridad de 
todos los habitantes del pa&#237;s. Asimismo, en el cumplimiento de este deber no cabe hacer 
discriminaciones de ning&#250;n tipo para proceder o no, ya sea a favor o en contra, de cierto 
grupo de personas. 
</p>
<p>412. Importa hacer notar, asimismo, que el ordenamiento legal de Chile no contiene 
ninguna norma que tenga como objetivo sancionar la realizaci&#243;n de protestas o actividades 
en que replanteen demandas sociales, ya sea por comunidades originarias o por cualquier 
agrupaci&#243;n civil siempre que se conformen a las reglas que impone la convivencia 
democr&#225;tica, lo que demuestra, una vez m&#225;s, que en Chile, la protesta social no es ni puede 
ser criminalizada.  
</p>
<p>413. En relaci&#243;n a las recomendaciones expresadas en la comunicaci&#243;n de los Sres. 
Relatores, quiero manifestar la decisi&#243;n del Gobierno de realizar todos los esfuerzos 
necesarios para que las instancias correspondientes subsanen cualquier exceso que pudiera 
haberse cometido en el caso del Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul y se tomen las medidas necesarias para 
evitar amenazas o da&#241;os a la integridad f&#237;sica de los miembros del pueblo Mapuche que 
realicen manifestaciones p&#250;blicas. Asimismo, es un compromiso del Ejecutivo, la sanci&#243;n 
judicial y/o administrativa que corresponda a las personas responsables de cualquier uso 
excesivo, injustificado o desproporcionado de la fuerza en el curso de los procedimientos 
policiales de detenci&#243;n antes se&#241;alado. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>414. En el caso consultado, cabe consignar que ha sido lenta la obtenci&#243;n de la 
informaci&#243;n que interesa a los Sres. Relatores y dif&#237;cil contar con informaci&#243;n especifica y 
detallada sobre el caso del Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul, en particular sobre sus ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos, 
investigaciones, cargos en su contra, entre otros, lo que nos impide dar una respuesta m&#225;s 
completa, que nos comprometemos a brindar en el m&#225;s breve plazo. Lo anterior, en todo 
caso, hay que entenderlo en el contexto de todos los esfuerzos desplegados por el Gobierno 
en agosto y septiembre del a&#241;o pasado concentrados en resolver la grave huelga de hambre 
de 34 comuneros mapuches presos en c&#225;rceles del Sur que preocupaba a todo el pa&#237;s. Esta 
situaci&#243;n consumi&#243; muchas energ&#237;as destinadas al tema ind&#237;gena y fue, afortunadamente 
resuelta tras intensas gestiones que permitieron al Ejecutivo atender lo sustancial de los 
reclamos, incluyendo importantes reformas legales a la Ley Antiterrorista y a la de Justicia 
Militar. Asimismo, cabe hacer presente que la situaci&#243;n que habr&#237;a afectado a Cristi&#225;n 
Garc&#237;a Quintul se habr&#237;a verificado el d&#237;a de la conmemoraci&#243;n del Bicentenario de nuestra 
Independencia nacional, donde la atenci&#243;n de las autoridades y de la poblaci&#243;n giraba en 
torno a la solemnidad de esas celebraciones, en cuyo mardo dif&#237;cilmente pod&#237;a prosperar y 
entenderse un acto de manifestaci&#243;n e interrupci&#243;n de dichas actividades que congregaban 
con emoci&#243;n a toda la comunidad nacional. 
</p>
<p>415. As&#237;, con base en la informaci&#243;n hasta ahora recabada, podemos informar a los Sres. 
Relatores que no consta registro alguno de que el Sr. Garc&#237;a Quintul u otros activistas 
mapuches hayan presentado denuncia alguna sobre los supuestos malos tratos recibidos y/o 
vulneraciones en sus derechos y libertades. Frente a ello resulta sorprendente una denuncia 
ante mecanismo de protecci&#243;n internacionales toda vez que a&#250;n no se han agotado las 
instancias judiciales internas chilenas de enmienda y reparaci&#243;n del supuesto agravio 
producido, lo que nos hace dudar la veracidad de las denuncias realizadas por la supuesta 
v&#237;ctima. 
</p>
<p>416.  Al concluir esta repuesta, me permito reiterar a los Sres. Relatores que el Estado de 
Chile est&#225; comprometido a seguir trabajando en la resoluci&#243;n de los problemas que afectan 
al pueblo Mapuche y sus demandas, pues, existe verdadera conciencia de las 
particularidades de su cultura, tradici&#243;n y formas de vida, que representan una innegable 
riqueza para todo nuestro pa&#237;s. 
</p>
<p>417. Como Gobierno, somos conscientes de dichos problemas y entendemos que algunos 
de estos desaf&#237;os para ser resueltos requerir&#225;n todav&#237;a mayores grados de esfuerzo 
dedicaci&#243;n y voluntad por todas las partes para arribar a una soluci&#243;n satisfactoria para 
todas las partes. Sin embargo estamos convencidos, y la inmensa mayor&#237;a del pueblo 
mapuche as&#237; tambi&#233;n lo entiende, de que las v&#237;as de hecho no son camino para ning&#250;n 
resultado satisfactorio. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>418. El Relator Especial agradece la informaci&#243;n detalla proporcionada por el Gobierno 
de Chile en relaci&#243;n con la comunicaci&#243;n enviada.  En conexi&#243;n con dicha informaci&#243;n, el 
Relator Especial se permite se&#241;alar que las denuncias y alegaciones presentadas ante los 
Procedimientos Especiales del Consejo de Derechos Humanos no requieren del 
agotamiento de instancias nacionales y/o regionales.  En este sentido, se hace referencia al 
p&#225;rrafo 42 del <i>Manual de Operaciones de los Procedimientos Especiales del Consejo de 
Derechos Humanos</i> el cual indica que &#8220;a diferencia de lo que ocurre con los procedimientos 
de comunicaciones establecidos por los tratados de derechos humanos, pueden enviarse 
comunicaciones al titular de un mandato incluso si no se han agotado los recursos internos 
del pa&#237;s de que se trate.  Los procedimientos especiales no son mecanismos cuasi judiciales 
sino que se basan en la necesidad de actuar con rapidez, est&#225;n concebidos para proteger a 
las v&#237;ctimas, reales y posibles, y de ninguna manera impiden que se adopten las medidas 
judiciales apropiadas a nivel nacional.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

</p>
<p><b>  China (People&#8217;s Republic of)   
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>419. On 8 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations concerning <b>a series of 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against five websites</b>, Yahoo email 
accounts of journalists which have been hacked and blocked, or were otherwise rendered 
inaccessible, and the directive issued by the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council 
Information Office to restrict information regarding Google&#8217;s decision to stop filtering 
search results and to direct all traffic from its servers in mainland People&#8217;s Republic of 
China to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  
</p>
<p>420. According to information received, between 23 and 24 January 2010, the websites of 
Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD), Independent Chinese Pen, New Century News, 
Canyu and Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch were made inaccessible by a series of DDoS 
attacks. Such attacks consume the website server&#8217;s resources so that the server cannot 
respond to instructions from computers of legitimate users, thus making it impossible to 
access the website. The frequency of the attack of CHRD&#8217;s server was at two Gigabites per 
second at the height of the incident, which is reportedly the most intense attack the server 
has experienced, and requires a large number of computers to coordinate the attack.  
</p>
<p>421. On 25 March 2010, the CHRD website was once again rendered inaccessible by 
another series of DDoS attacks. The website remained inaccessible at the time of 
submission of this communication.  
</p>
<p>422. On the same day, the Yahoo e-mail accounts of approximately ten journalists who 
covered issues related to the People&#8217;s Republic of China were hacked and blocked, or were 
otherwise rendered inaccessible. Google had previously reported in January that its servers 
had also been the target of a hacking attack which originated in the People&#8217;s Republic of 
China, and which Google claimed was aimed at gaining access to Gmail accounts of 
Chinese human rights defenders. The Foreign Correspondents&#8217; Club in Beijing had also 
warned its members that the Google accounts of some of them had been compromised, as 
several journalists discovered that emails from their accounts were being forwarded to 
unfamiliar addresses.   
</p>
<p>423. These attacks on 25 March followed an announcement made by Google of its 
decision to stop censoring Internet search results on their Chinese-language search engine 
and to direct all traffic from its servers from the mainland People&#8217;s Republic of China to the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Following this announcement, a notice had 
allegedly been issued by the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information 
Office, directing website managers to restrict coverage and discussions of Google&#8217;s 
decision.   
</p>
<p>424. Concern was expressed that the DDoS attacks against several websites of human 
rights defenders were directly related to their work in defence of human rights. Similarly, 
concern was expressed that the attacks against Google and Yahoo e-mail accounts of 
journalists were related to their work in monitoring and reporting on sensitive issues in the 
People&#8217;s Republic of China, and raise additional concerns regarding the confidentiality of 
journalistic sources.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>425. In a letter dated 12 April 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 8 April 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of 
finalization of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>to summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>426. On 16 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the state of health of <b>Mr. Hu Jia</b>, a Beijing-
based HIV/AIDS activist, co-founder and former director of the Beijing Aizhixing Institute 
for Health Education.  
</p>
<p>427. Mr Hu Jia has been the subject of communications sent by several mandate holders 
following his detention on 27 December 2007 and his sentencing on 3 April 2008 to three 
years and six months&#8217; imprisonment and one year of deprivation of political rights for 
&#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221; and concerning the appeal process on 23 April 2008. 
The combined response of the Government to these communications was received on 4 
June 2008. 
</p>
<p>428. According to the information received, Mr. Hu Jia was sentenced to 3.5 years in 
prison in April 2008. He previously suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, and was transferred 
on 30 March 2010 from Beijing City Prison to Beijing City Hospital to undergo tests. Mr. 
Hu Jia had remained in Beijing City Hospital since then and allegedly his state of health 
was rapidly deteriorating. It was believed that the poor nourishment and bad conditions in 
prison contributed to his ailing health. Although the results of the medical tests had not yet 
been shared with members of his family, it was feared that Mr. Hu Jia may be suffering 
from liver cancer. Ms. Zeng Jinyan, the wife of Mr. Hu Jia, had formally requested the 
relevant prison authorities to release him on medical grounds.  
</p>
<p>429. Concern was expressed that the living conditions and nourishment in prison might 
have not been adequate given the rapidly deteriorating health situation of Mr. Hu Jia. 
Further concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Hu Jia.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>430. In a letter dated 7 June 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 16 April 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of finalization 
of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position to 
summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>431. On 22 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations regarding the situation of 
<b>Mr. Gu Chuan</b>, writer and human rights activist. Mr. Gu Chuan was the editor of the 
website &#8220;Blog China&#8221; between 2005 and 2008 and has written several articles on the human 
rights situation in China in printed and online newspapers and magazines. Mr. Gu Chan is 
also a signatory of Charter 08, a public appeal calling for reforms to promote democracy 
and human rights in China. 
</p>
<p>432. According to the information received, on 9 April 2010, Mr. Gu Chuan was arrested 
in Beijing by three plainclothes policemen and taken away in an unmarked car. He was 
allegedly interrogated for seven hours. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>62</b>  
</p>
<p>433. The same day, police officers allegedly searched his apartment in the presence of his 
wife Li Xinai, without providing a warrant. They allegedly seized two notebook computers, 
a flash drive and removable hard drive, business cards, magazines, notebooks and the 
passports of Gu Chuan and Li Xinai. It is alleged that the police also took note of the couple 
bank details. 
</p>
<p>434. It is reported that Mr. Gu Chuan was released on the same day after having been 
warned not to talk about his arrest and interrogation. It is alleged that the arrest of Gu Chan 
was an act of intimidation aimed at preventing him from participating in a public forum on 
environmental protection co-organized by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a network of 
Chinese and international activists dedicated to the promotion of human rights and 
strengthening of grassroots activism in China. The forum, who was supposed to be held in 
Beijing on 10 April 2010, was allegedly cancelled under police pressure. 
</p>
<p>435. Concern was expressed that the arrest and house search of Mr. Gu Chan might have 
been directly related to his work in defense of human rights.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>436. On 30 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Cao Du,</b> a Mongolian from China. Mr. Du is the founder and 
Director of the Mongol Yurt Association, an organization promoting the rights of 
Mongolian people in China. He is also the webmaster of a Mongolian language internet 
&quot;Mongol Yurt Forum&quot;, which discusses alleged human rights violations against Mongolian 
people committed by the Chinese authorities, and which has allegedly been closed by the 
Chinese authorities. Mr. Du has organized numerous workshops and seminars among 
Mongolians, mainly within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Liao Ning Province 
and other provinces of China where Mongolian people reside, to educate Mongolians on 
how to defend their rights through peaceful and legal means.  
</p>
<p>437. Mr. Du is a grantee of the UN Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, a 
program run by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
The General Assembly established the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations by resolution 40/131 of 13 December 1985.  The original purpose of the Fund 
was to assist representatives of indigenous communities and organizations to participate in 
the deliberations of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission 
on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights by providing them with financial 
assistance.  
</p>
<p>438. The General Assembly expanded the mandate of the Fund in its resolution 56/140 of 
19 December 2001 to also assist representatives of indigenous communities and 
organizations in attending, as observers, the sessions of the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues.  In its resolution 63/161 of 18 December 2008, the General Assembly 
further adjusted the mandate of the Fund so as to facilitate the participation of 
representatives of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations in the Expert Mechanism on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples established in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/36 of 14 December 2007. 
</p>
<p>439. According to the information received, as a grantee of the UN Voluntary Fund for 
Indigenous Populations, Mr. Du was granted travel funds to attend the 9th session of the 
UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, taking place from 19 to 31 April 2010 at the 
United Nations headquarters in New York City. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>440. On 18 April 2010, Mr. Du was allegedly arrested by the police at the Beijing Capital 
International Airport before boarding his flight to New York City to attend the 9th session 
of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. It is alleged that his whereabouts are 
unknown. 
</p>
<p>441. On 19 April 2010, the local police of Chao Yang City, Liao Ning Province, 
allegedly raided his house and confiscated Mr. Du&#8217;s personal computers, his wife&#8217;s laptop, 
their cell phones and other papers and documents.  
</p>
<p>442. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Mr. Du and the search of his house might 
be directly related to his work in defense of human rights and notably the non-violent 
exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Given the fact that the whereabouts of Mr. 
Du are unknown, further concern was expressed about his physical and psychological 
integrity.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>443. In a letter dated 5 July 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 30 April 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of finalization 
of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position to 
summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>444. On 8 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of <b>Mr. Liu 
Xianbin</b>, a democracy and human rights activist. Mr. Liu Xianbin has published several 
articles online calling for democratic reforms in China. He is a signatory of Charter 08, a 
public appeal calling for reforms to promote democracy and human rights in China. The 
Special Rapporteur had previously addressed the Government in relation to the acts of 
harassment and arrests of several signatories of Charter 08.  
</p>
<p>445. According to the information received, on 28 June 2010, fourteen National Security 
officers from Suining City Public Security Bureau (PSB) reportedly searched the house of 
Mr. Liu Xianbin. They allegedly took him for questioning to the PSB station and 
confiscated two of his computer&#8217;s hard drives, two removable drives, his bank card as well 
as records of payments he had received for publishing articles online. Mr. Liu Xianbin was 
reportedly released the same day. 
</p>
<p>446. On 5 July 2010, Mr. Liu Xianbin was allegedly arrested on suspicion of &#8220;inciting 
subversion of state power&#8221; and transferred to the Suining Detention Centre in Suining City, 
Sichuan Province. It was reported that the police questioned him in relation to his support 
to democracy activists and human rights defenders including Mr. Liu Xiaobo, a writer 
sentenced to 11 years of prison for &#8220;inciting subversion of State power&#8221; for his involvement 
in drafting and organizing the signing of Charter 08. Mr. Liu Xianbin was further 
questioned by the police about the online publication of his articles calling for democratic 
reforms.  
</p>
<p>447. On 6 July 2010, the wife and daughter of Mr. Liu Xianbin were allegedly questioned 
by PSB officers. 
</p>
<p>448. Concern was expressed that the house search, arrests and detention of Mr. Liu 
Xianbin might have been directly related to his work in defense of human rights and 
notably his calls for democratic reforms through articles, the signature of Charter 08 and the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>64</b>  
</p>
<p>support provided to other human rights activists. Further concern was expressed that this 
arrest may constitute a new attempt to intimidate signatories of Charter 08.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>449. In a letter dated 12 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 8 July 2010 as follows.  Liu Xianbin, previously known as Liu Chen, has used the 
pen name Wan Xianming and is a 42-year-old male resident of Suining, Sichuan Province. 
</p>
<p>450. On 28 June 2010, Liu was placed in criminal detention by the Sichuan Province 
public security authorities on suspicion of inciting subversion of State power. The case is 
currently proceeding.  
</p>
<p>451. China is a State governed by the rule of law, and the departments involved have 
handled this case in accordance with the law. Liu, because he engaged in illegal activities, 
has been subject to an investigation as stipulated by law, and the appropriate measures have 
been taken; his every right has been upheld as well in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>452. On 14 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an urgent appeal 
concerning the death of three people that occurred after Chinese security forces opened fire 
on Tibetan protesters in Palyul County Sharchu Gyashoed village, Sichuan Province. 
</p>
<p>453. According to information received, residents of Palyul County Sharchu Gyashoed 
village had expressed concern with local authorities to stop the expansion of gold mining 
activities in the area. About 100 Tibetans from the village camped outside the Government 
headquarters to wait for a response to their concerns.   
</p>
<p>454. On 18 August 2010, Chinese security forces are reported to have used a harmful gas 
to make the protestors unconscious. A number of the protesters engaged in scuffle with the 
security forces who were moving bodies of unconscious people into a truck. In response, 
the security forces opened fire killing three people and injuring several others.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>455. On 22 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Mr. Tian Xi,</b> an activist who has 
reportedly been detained for his advocacy on issues related to HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>456. According to the information received, Mr. Tian Xi, a 23-year-old college graduate 
from Henan Province, reportedly sustained a head injury in an accident as a child, which 
required a blood transfusion as treatment. The blood transfusion allegedly infected him with 
HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Since then, Mr. Tian Xi and his family have reportedly 
petitioned the hospital and local government for compensation, both for himself and for 
others infected with HIV. Allegedly, thousands of people in Henan and other provinces 
were infected with HIV through state-sponsored blood selling programs in the 1990s, and 
through resulting hospital transmissions of HIV from infected blood and blood products. 
</p>
<p>457. Henan provincial courts reportedly refused to accept any lawsuits relating to HIV, 
leaving victims with no legal recourse. It was reported that where no other recourse exists 
in China, citizens may bring complaints against local officials to higher-ranking 
government offices, but that only a small percentage of these complaints receive a 
favourable response. It was reported that Henan authorities had detained individuals trying </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>65 
</b></p>
<p>to draw attention to the issue of compensation for HIV transmission through contaminated 
blood and blood products. 
</p>
<p>458. It also has been reported that Mr. Tian Xi worked for several years at Aizhixing 
Health Education Institute, a non-governmental Chinese AIDS organization. In spring 
2010, Mr. Wan Yanhai, the founder and director of Aizhixing, reportedly relocated his 
family to the United States, alleging government harassment.  
</p>
<p>459. On 23 July 2010 Mr. Tian Xi reportedly received a text message from the Xincai 
County Clerk, inviting him to return to Henan to negotiate a resolution to his HIV/AIDS 
issue. Mr. Tian Xi subsequently returned home to Henan and reportedly the Xincai County 
Clerk made several appointments to meet Mr. Tian Xi.  However, on each occasion, when 
Mr. Tian Xi arrived for the appointment, he was unable to see the Clerk.  
</p>
<p>460. On 5 August 2010, Mr. Tian Xi reportedly visited the Xincai Number One People&#8217;s 
Hospital to see the hospital director about obtaining HIV medication, as he did not bring a 
sufficient quantity with him to Henan. It is alleged that the hospital director told Mr. Tian 
Xi that he did not possess the authority to provide the required medication. It is reported 
that Mr. Tian Xi was upset by this response and allegedly broke some tea cups in the 
hospital director&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>461. On 6 August 2010, the Xincai County Police allegedly took Mr. Tian Xi away, 
leaving the family with a 15-day detention order. It appears that he may have been briefly 
released, as it is reported that Mr. Tian Xi contacted Asia Catalyst on 10 August 2010, 
indicating that he was at risk of arrest. Documents from the Town Board of Lugu Township 
reportedly exist, which, inter alia, request the police to detain Mr. Tian Xi in connection 
with his HIV/AIDS advocacy; conclude that Mr. Tian Xi had been influenced by Mr. Wan 
Yanhai, the Chinese AIDS activist; and recommend that Mr. Tian Xi be &#8220;taken in to public 
security.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>462. On 17 August 2010, it is alleged that the police took Mr. Tian Xi to the Xincai 
County Number Two People&#8217;s Hospital for treatment, where he remained for two days. On 
18 August 2010, the Xincai County Police allegedly issued an order for Mr. Tian Xi&#8217;s 
detention on &#8220;suspicion of intentional destruction of property,&#8221; apparently for the broken 
tea cups during his meeting with the hospital director of Xincai Number One People&#8217;s 
Hospital. On 19 August 2010, the police reportedly took him away, and Mr. Tian Xi was 
transferred from administrative to criminal detention in the Shangcai County Detention 
Centre. On 21 August 2010, Mr. Tian Xi&#8217;s mother and aunt reportedly went to the Shangcai 
County police station to see him, but were refused.  
</p>
<p>463. Concern was expressed that the detention of Mr. Tian Xi may have not been based 
on the &#8220;suspicion of intentional destruction of property,&#8221; but instead be motivated by Mr. 
Tian Xi&#8217;s ongoing petitioning to seek compensation and treatment for hospital 
transmissions of HIV from infected blood and blood products. Concern was also expressed 
that Mr. Tian Xi may have not been receiving appropriate and adequate medical treatment 
while being held in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>464. In a letter dated 16 February 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 22 September 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated at the time of 
finalization of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately not in a position 
to summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be able to make his 
observations on the reply in his future report.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>66</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>465. On 9 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with The Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Mr. Dhondup 
Wangchen</b>, also known as Dunzhu Wangqing and Dangzhi Xiangqian, co-director of the 
film documentary &#8220;Leaving Fear Behind&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>466. According to the information received, from October 2007 to March 2008, Mr. 
Dhondup Wangchen interviewed about a hundred Tibetans living in the Tibetan 
Autonomous region, and made a film based on these interviews, without official 
authorization from the authorities. The documentary was later smuggled abroad where it 
was edited and shared with foreign journalists during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  
</p>
<p>467. On 26 March 2008, Mr. Dhondup Wangchen was arrested in Tongde county, near 
Xining, in connection to riots which broke out in Lhasa and Tibetan-populated regions of 
China. He was first detained at the Ershilibu detention center in Xining, then transferred to 
a Government-run guesthouse nearby, possibly for interrogation, and finally taken to the 
No. 1 Detention Center in Xining. On 12 July 2008, while held in the guesthouse, he briefly 
ran away and told an acquaintance that one of his hands became numb due to severe torture. 
In addition, it was reported that he had been suffering from hepatitis B, and was denied 
access to adequate medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>468. In July 2009, Mr. Li Dunyong, the lawyer chosen by Mr. Dhondup Wangchen was 
reportedly arbitrarily replaced by the judicial authorities in Xining with a Government-
appointed lawyer, without providing any justification. Mr. Li Dunyong was allowed to meet 
his client only once, in July 2009, who informed him that he had been severely tortured 
while in detention to extract a confession, and that he would plead not guilty during his 
trial. 
</p>
<p>469. On 28 December 2009, the provincial court in Xining sentenced Mr. Dhondup 
Wangchen to six years imprisonment. The trial was reportedly held in secret. The Chinese 
authorities reportedly did not inform Mr. Dhondup Wangchen&#8217;s relatives about the trial, nor 
about the verdict. 
</p>
<p>470. According to information received, despite his fragile health condition, Mr. 
Dhondup Wangchen was forced to work 17 to 18 hours per day, sometimes during night 
shifts. He was also denied access to books sent to him in order to educate himself. 
</p>
<p>471. Mr. Jigme Gyatso, monk, co-director of the documentary was arrested during the 
same period, and was released on bail on 15 October 2008. He was reportedly tortured 
while in detention. 
</p>
<p>472. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Dhondup 
Wangchen and Mr. Jigme Gyatso, and the alleged acts of torture suffered in detention, are 
related to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, while exercising their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. Grave concerns were expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Dhondup Wangchen who remains detained. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>473. In a letter dated 21 December 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 9 November 2010. However, the reply had not yet been translated 
at the time of finalization of this report, and thus the Special Rapporteur is unfortunately 
not in a position to summarize in English the content of the reply. He hopes that he will be

arrests and bans on travelling abroad had been reported.  On 8 October and 10 October 
2010, police in Beijing increased the number of guards outside the home of <b>Zhang Zuhua</b>, 
<i>Charter 08</i> drafter and constitutional scholar. Zhang has been closely followed by police 
whenever he leaves his home.

</p>
<p>489. Since 18 October 2010, <b>Yu Jie</b>, a friend of Liu Xiabo, and his wife <b>Ning Xuan</b>, 
have been confined to their home in Beijing by National Security officers. On 27 October, 
Ning Xuan fell ill, and was in the first place prevented from going to the hospital. One 
National Security officer told Yu Jie and Ning Xuan that he had received &#8220;orders from 
above&#8221; not to let them leave their house under any condition. Finally acquaintances called 
an ambulance to their home. The National Security officers ultimately allowed Ning Xuan 
to go to the hospital, accompanied by police. Yu Jie was not allowed to accompany his 
wife. 
</p>
<p>490. On 29 October 2010, <b>Hou Wenbao</b> was arrested by police while visiting friends in 
Hefei City. Hou was forcibly returned to his hometown of Suzhou by National Security 
officers, and put under house arrest. 
</p>
<p>491. <b>Cui Weiping</b>, a university professor, and <b>Xu Youyu</b>, a retired social sciences

</p>
<p>505. <b>Cha Jianguo</b>, <b>Gao Hongming</b>, and <b>Wang Guangze </b>were warned by police officers 
not to participate in activities to celebrate Liu Xiabo&#8217;s award. Jiang Danwen, secretary of 
Independent Chinese PEN, was warned not to discuss the prize.  
</p>
<p>506. Similarly, <b>Yang Anliang</b>, <b>Wang Zhengwei</b>, <b>Li Chun</b> and <b>Zhang Wei</b> were 
summoned for questioning by National Security officers in Nanning City Guangxi Province

</p>
<p>509. Alleged <b>blocking of means of communication</b> had also been reported. The internet 
access of Liu Xiabo&#8217;s wife, <b>Liu Xia</b>, had reportedly been interrupted by the authorities, 
without any reason being given. Her cell phone service had also been blocked. The last 
message sent via Twitter was dated 18 October 2010. Since then, she had been out of reach. 
</p>
<p>510. According to reports, the managers of the four main Chinese domestic internet 
portals, i.e. Ten Cent, Sina, Sohu, and Net Ease, were ordered by the authorities to remove 
pages mentioning the 2010 Nobel Prizes. It is reported that, as of today, online discussions, 
as well as phone text messages, related to Liu Xiabo and the Nobel Peace Prize are still 
blocked.  
</p>
<p>511. Finally, the websites of Independent Chinese PEN, New Century News, Boxun, 
<i>Charter 08</i>, Canyu, and others, which reported on Liu Xiabo&#8217;s award and the subsequent 
alleged crackdown on human rights defenders, were attacked by a virus, in a reportedly 
organized and highly sophisticated manner. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>512. On 19 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
Ms. <b>Ni Yulan</b>, a human rights lawyer, and her husband Mr. <b>Dong Jiqin</b>. Over the past 11 
years, Ms Ni Yulan has been involved in defending human rights, in particular, housing 
rights including by assisting victims of forced evictions in Beijing.  
</p>
<p>513. Ms. Ni Yulan was the subjected of a previous United Nations Urgent Appeal dated 
30 July 2008, signed by the Special Rapporteur, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders.   
</p>
<p>514. According to the information received, on 15 April 2010, Ms. Ni Yulan was released 
from prison. According to the information received, she and her husband were forced to 
live in a park in Beijing as a result of the demolition of their home and the confiscation of 
their belongings in 2008, as well as efforts on the part of the police to prevent Ms. Yulan 
and Mr. Jiqin to rent any space.  Reportedly, the authorities instructed potential landlords or 
hotel owners not to provide space. Ms. Ni Yulan and her husband lived in the park for 
about 60 days, from mid-April until mid-June.  
</p>
<p>515. On 16 June 2010, they were reportedly confined in a room at the Yu Xin Gong 
Hotel.  
</p>
<p>516. On the evening of 16 June 2010, Ms. Yulan was detained in a police station, and 
released when many citizens reportedly convened outside the police station shouting 
slogans and calling for her release. Some time later, she and her husband were reportedly 
taken to a room at the Yu Xin Gong Hotel. Ms. Yulan and her husband are at most times 
allowed to leave the hotel room and to receive guests there. However, Ms. Yulan is largely 
confined to a wheelchair, her legs having broken allegedly under police torture some years 
earlier (as described below).  
</p>
<p>517. On 10 December 2010, Ms. Yulan was visited by a number of friends at her hotel 
room in the Yu Xin Gong Hotel. Shortly after the departure of her friends, it is alleged that 
police ordered the management of the hotel to cut the power to Ms. Yulan&#180;s room. Later 
that evening at approximately 10:30 pm. after the police had left; power was reportedly 
restored to Ms. Yulan&#180;s hotel room. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>71 
</b></p>
<p>518. A number of days later it has been reported that the police returned to the hotel and 
again ordered the hotel management to cut the power to Ms. Yulan&#180;s room. The phone and 
internet connection was also disconnected and the hotel management were reportedly 
instructed by police to stop serving breakfast to both Ms. Yulan and her husband.   
</p>
<p>519. It is alleged, that on 20 December 2010, police officers from the Xicheng District of 
Beijing again contacted the hotel management and demanded that they again cut the power 
to Ms. Yulan&#180;s room.   
</p>
<p>520. Between 20 December 2010 and 4 January 2011, Mr. Jiqin complained about their 
situation to the authorities. Reportedly, one member of the Xicheng district government 
told Mr. Jiqin in one occasion when he was complaining that the authorities were probably 
going to take the couple &#8216;back to the Emergency Shelter [in the Huangchenggen Park in 
Dongcheng district of Beijing].&#8217;  
</p>
<p>521. On 4 or 5 January, the police reportedly ordered the hotel management to cut off the 
water supply and it has remained cut off since then.  
</p>
<p>522. According to the information received, on 5 January, a person identifying himself as 
Xicheng district police officer came to the hotel room and demanded entry in order to 
investigate whether the couple was using a small stove operated with solid tablets of 
alcohol based fuel in the room because, he alleged, this was in violation of &#8216;regulations.&#8217; 
The police officer was reportedly unable to cite any relevant regulation about operating 
stoves in a room and the couple refused him entrance and locked themselves in by bolting 
the door. Ms. Yulan and Mr. Jiqin pointed out to the police officer that if electricity were to 
be restored there would be no need for them to use candles or a stove. The police officer 
reportedly kept banging on the door and only desisted some time after Ms. Yulan had sent 
out a tweet reporting on the matter appealing for help, and after he had spoken to his 
superiors over the phone. According to the information received, the couple has been 
frequently exposed to verbal harassment and is afraid of letting the police come into their 
room because of the specific threats to throw them out, and also due to their previous 
experience of police violence.  
</p>
<p>523. Since 20 December 2010 until today, Ms. Yulan and her husband have been without 
power in their room, and consequentially have been unable to use phone or access the 
internet, and have been forced to recharge the battery of their computer outside the room. 
Ms. Yulan and her husband are being kept under close police surveillance.   
</p>
<p>524. Ms. Ni Yulan is allegedly confined to a wheel chair and relies on crutches to walk as 
a result of the torture she suffered in the hands of the police in 2002 when she was arrested 
for having attempted to film a forced demolition. Ms. Yulan was subsequently prosecuted 
for &#8220;obstructing an officer in the exercise of public duty&#8221;, reportedly denied access to legal 
representation and sentenced to one year in prison. Her licence to practice law was 
permanently revoked. In 2008 Ms. Yulan was again detained and severely beaten, the 
remains of her home were demolished and her belongings were reportedly looted by 
members of the demolition team. In the context of her detention, Ms. Yulan was allegedly 
sexually harassed, and later accused of having attacked a police officer.  She was brought 
before the court and was sentenced to two years in prison.   
</p>
<p>525. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Yulan 
and her husband given the allegations of harassment received indicating that the police have 
ordered that the power and water be cut to Ms. Yulan&#180;s hotel room in an attempt to force 
both her and her husband out of the hotel. </p>

Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning the <b>pattern of arrests, detentions, enforced

University of Politics and Law in Beijing, was not permitted to renew his lawyer&#8217;s license 
allegedly in reaction to his offer to defend Tibetans subject to criminal prosecution 
following the March 2008 protests in Tibet. Since then, he has provided legal assistance to 
a number of people facing the death penalty. Recently, he has reportedly set up the non-
profit organization China against the Death Penalty. We are also informed that Mr. Teng 
Biao regularly reports on alleged human rights violations in China, inter alia on Twitter and 
gives interviews to foreign correspondents in China on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>566. On 19 February 2011, the police reportedly visited him at his home and returned 
later to take him away. It is further alleged that the police took two computers, a copier-fax </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

<p> <b>77 
</b></p>
<p>machine, printed materials, between 10 to 20 books on politics, between 20 to 30 
documentaries and dozens of photos of Chen Guangcheng from Mr. Teng Biao&#8217;s home, 
searched his office and questioned his staff. Reportedly, Mr. Teng Biao was kept in the 
Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and his family has allegedly received no official 
notification of his detention. It is unclear where he is currently being detained. 
</p>
<p>567. Mr. <b>Jiang Tianyong</b>, currently a Beijing resident, was registered as a lawyer in 
Zhengzhou in Henan province. He reportedly used to defend a large number of cases of 
petitioners and in the defence of lawyers&#8217; rights and people living with HIV/Aids.  
</p>
<p>568. In July 2009, it is alleged that Mr. Jiang Tianyong was not allowed to renew his 
license to practice as a lawyer and thereby has been prevented from taking cases. Since 
then, he has reportedly worked as a legal advisor to the Aids NGO Aizhixing. 
</p>
<p>569. On 16 February 2011, Mr. Jiang Tianyong attended the meeting mentioned above to 
discuss the Chen Guangcheng case. Thereafter, at 3:50 p.m., Mr. Jiang Tianyong returned 
home where he reportedly received a phone call from Yang Fangdian police station of 
Haidian district requesting him to meet for questioning. It is alleged that Mr. Jiang 
Tianyong went to meet the police and at about 5:00 p.m., some friends received an SMS 
from him informing them that he had been beaten, the details of which he later reported on 
Twitter. He said that the police had pushed him several times and that the back of his head 
once hit the wall, causing him to feel dizzy. After some lawyers went to the police station to 
have him liberated, he was released from custody. 
</p>
<p>570. On 19 February 2011, between 3:00-4:00 p.m., Mr. Jiang Tianyong was reportedly 
taken away by the police in Changping District in front of his brother&#8217;s home, where he was 
staying with his wife. In their attempt to stop the police, his brother and his mother were 
allegedly beaten. Between midnight and 1:00 a.m., the police reportedly arrived at Mr. 
Jiang Tianyong brother&#8217;s home the same place again and asked to have Mr. Jiang 
Tianyong&#8217;s computer. Despite Mr. Jiang Tianyong&#8217;s wife opposition, the police allegedly 
took away the computer which was on the desk. Reportedly, local police informed his 
family that they had no record on him and that they would file him as a missing person. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>571. On 22 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal concerning the residential 
surveillance of Mr. <b>Wu Wei</b>, also known as Ye Du, a webmaster and Network Coordinator 
of the Independent Chinese PEN Centre (ICPC). 
</p>
<p>572. According to the information received, on 22 February 2011, Mr. Wei was arrested 
by police authorities at his home in Haizhu, Guangdong Province, China. His home was 
searched and police allegedly confiscated computers, books and videos.  
</p>
<p>573. On 1 March 2011, Mr. Wei was placed under residential surveillance in Fanyu, 
Guangdong Province on the charges of &#8220;inciting subversion of state power&#8221;. It is alleged 
that prior to his arrest, Mr. Wei was engaged in dissident writing and activism, and as a 
result was often subjected to alleged harassment. Namely, Mr. Wei, while participating at 
the Pen International Congress, which took place in September 2010 in Tokyo, Japan, 
referred to warnings he had previously received from the police. 
</p>
<p>574. Concerns were expressed at the allegation that Mr. Wei&#8217;s residential surveillance is a 
direct consequence of the exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression as 
guaranteed inter alia by article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). 
</p>
<p>575. Concerns were also expressed at the increasing allegations of resort to &#8220;residential 
surveillance&#8221; as a form of pre-trial detention. According to article 57 of China&#8217;s Code of 
Criminal Procedure, a suspect subjected to residential surveillance must be held either in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>78</b>  
</p>
<p>her/his home or a designated dwelling if she or he has no permanent residence. Mr. Wei&#8217;s 
detention outside his permanent residence in Guangzhou would allegedly be in violation of 
article 57. Moreover, in its Deliberation 01, adopted on 23 March 1992, the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention held that &#8220;house arrest may be compared to deprivation of liberty 
provided that it is carried out in closed premises which the person is not allowed to leave. 
In all other situation, it will devolve on the Working Group to decide, on a case-by-case 
basis, whether the case in question constitutes a form of detention, and if so, whether it has 
an arbitrary character&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>576. On 25 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Jigme Gyatso</b>, currently 
detained at Qushui Prison on the outskirts of Lhasa. 
</p>
<p>577. Mr. Jigme Gyatso was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and five years of 
deprivation of political rights by the Lhasa Municipal Intermediate People&#8217;s Court on 25 
November 1996, on charges of &#8220;planning to found an illegal organization and to seek to 
divide the country and to damage its unity&#8221; for his activities in support of Tibetan 
independence, including setting up a group called the &#8220;Association of Tibetan Freedom 
Movement&#8221; and distributing pro-independence leaflets. Mr. Gyatso was the subject of 
Opinion N&#176; 8/2000 adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 17 May 
2000, and of an urgent appeal sent by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; and the Special Rapporteur on torture on 4 January 2007. The Special 
Rapporteur on torture also visited him on 27 November 2005, at Qushui Prison 
(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, Appendix 2, para. 21). Mr. Gyatso was also the subject of a joint 
communication dated 16 March 2009, sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p>578. On 9 March 2007, the Government replied to the communication dated 4 January 
2007, explaining that Mr. Gyatso enjoyed the same rights and treatment as other criminals. 
The Government claimed that his conditions of detention have not changed, that he was at 
the time in excellent health, and that he received regular visits from family members. By 
letter dated 15 September 2009, the Government responded to the communication dated 16 
March 2009.    
</p>
<p>579. According to new information received, Mr. Gyatso has been held in isolation from 
other prisoners and has been denied his right to family visits on three occasions in the last 
few months. He is reportedly in an extremely poor health condition. 
</p>
<p>580. In view of the allegation that Mr. Gyasto&#8217;s health has been deteriorating in the 
course of last few months, concern was expressed for his physical and mental integrity. 
Concern was also expressed that Mr. Gyatso may not be receiving appropriate and adequate 
medical treatment while being held in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>581. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government for the responses provided 
to 7 of 13 communications sent during the reporting period, but regrets that at the time of 
finalization of this report, no translation was available for most of them.  He also wishes to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>79 
</b></p>
<p>express his regret that at the time of finalizing the report, the Government had not 
responded to four of his communications sent earlier on 7 December 2010, 14 September 
2010, 22 April 2010, 22 January 2010, as well as to four communications sent in 2008, two 
in 2006, and five in 2005.  He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by 
him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent 
prosecutions as well as protective measures taken.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>582. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about recent reports of increasing 
crackdown on human rights defenders and bloggers as a result of peacefully exercising their 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, including enforced disappearance, house arrest, 
surveillance, imprisonment, and allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. Most recently, in October 2010, the Special Rapporteur 
expressed his concern regarding the detention and sentencing of Mr. Liu Xiaobo for his 
peaceful advocacy for greater respect for human rights in China.5   
</p>
<p>583. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that the situation has become even 
more precarious following the awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Mr. Liu Xiaobo, 
as noted in his joint communication of 7 December 2010, and since an anonymous call for a 
&#8220;Jasmine Revolution&#8221; in China was made online in February 2011.  
</p>
<p>584. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his concern that although the 1982 
constitution guarantees freedom of the press, the Government of China continues to charge 
and imprison human rights defenders and bloggers on the basis of inciting subversion of 
state power (article 105, paragraph 2 of the Penal Code), which carries a sentence of up to 
five years of imprisonment. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding the 
vagueness of the broad prohibition of &#8220;subversion of state power&#8221;, and underscores that any 
limitation imposed on the right to freedom of expression sought to be justified on the 
ground of national security is not legitimate unless the Government can demonstrate that: 
(a) the expression is intended to incite imminent violence; (b) it is likely to incite such 
violence; and (c) there is a direct and immediate connection between the expression and the 
likelihood or occurrence of such violence (see for example E/CN.4/1996/39). He would 
also like to reiterate that a restriction sought to be justified on the ground of national 
security is not legitimate if its genuine purpose or demonstrable effect is to protect interests 
unrelated to national security, including, for example, to protect Government from 
embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing, or to conceal information about the functioning 
of its public institutions, or to entrench a particular ideology or to suppress industrial unrest.  
</p>
<p>585. The Special Rapporteur recommends the Government to consider repealing the 
provision of subversion of state power from its Penal Code, and to fully guarantee the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression of all individuals, including opinions that are critical 
of the Government, or information that may be embarrassing to the powerful. The Special 
Rapporteur also emphasizes that peaceful advocacy for human rights should never be 
subjected to restrictions. As expressed in his press statement of 13 December 2010,6 he 
appeals to the Government to release all persons detained for peacefully exercising their 
fundamental rights, and to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b>  Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>586. El 9 de abril de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, y el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron una carta de alegaciones 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el Sr.<b> 
Johnny Hurtado</b>. El Sr. Hurtado era agricultor y Presidente del Comit&#233; de Derechos 
Humanos de la vereda La Catalina, basada en la municipalidad de La Macarena en el 
departamento de Meta. Viv&#237;a en Puerto Catalina en el departamento de Meta. Como un 
activista social, el Sr. Hurtado era nombrado un representante de la comunidad en varias 
ocasiones y hab&#237;a denunciado violaciones de los derechos humanos en la regi&#243;n del R&#237;o 
Guayabero, que supuestamente est&#225;n vinculadas a la presencia militar en la zona. Se alega 
que estas violaciones incluyen las amenazas, intimidaci&#243;n y difamaci&#243;n p&#250;blicas de los 
defensores de los derechos humanos, adem&#225;s de actos de acoso y acusaciones en contra de 
las residentes de la regi&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>587. En particular, a finales de diciembre de 2009 el Sr. Hurtado hab&#237;a p&#250;blicamente 
denunciado violaciones de derechos humanos y la militarizaci&#243;n de la regi&#243;n. Asimismo, 
recientemente &#233;l se hab&#237;a encontrado con una delegaci&#243;n de oficiales que visit&#243; la regi&#243;n, y 
en que se incluy&#243; parlamentarios, sindicalistas, y representantes de la organizaci&#243;n Justicia 
por Colombia, una organizaci&#243;n inglesa que est&#225; enfocada en los derechos humanos en 
Colombia, en particular los derechos laborales. La delegaci&#243;n hizo una visita oficial a la 
regi&#243;n para reunirse con trabajadores rurales, l&#237;deres comunales y defensores de los 
derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p>588. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el lunes el 15 de marzo de 2010, el Sr. Hurtado 
habr&#237;a sido asesinado. Se habr&#237;a encontrado realizando trabajo agr&#237;cola en su granja, 
ubicada a un hora a pie del Puerto Catalina, cuando habr&#237;a sufrido un impacto de bala de un 
arma de fuego. Se inform&#243; que s&#243;lo un tiro habr&#237;a sido disparado. El Sr. Hurtado habr&#237;a 
andado aproximadamente 30 metros antes de caer. Habiendo fallecido poco despu&#233;s. Se 
inform&#243; que agentes militares hab&#237;an estado presentes alrededor de la granja en ese 
momento.  
</p>
<p>589. Se temi&#243; que el asesinato del Sr. Hurtado est&#233; relacionado con las actividades que &#233;l 
realizaba para promover y defender los derechos de la gente de la regi&#243;n del R&#237;o 
Guayabero. Este asesinato, adem&#225;s de los actos de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas, se enmarcan 
en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en 
Colombia.  
</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>590. Mediante dos cartas fechadas el 4 de mayo de 2010 y el 9 de junio de 2010, el 
Gobierno respondi&#243; a la carta de alegaciones con fecha de 9 de abril de 2010. El Estado se 
permite informar a los Honorables Relatores que la exactitud de los hechos denunciados 
ser&#225; determinada mediante sentencia judicial. 
</p>
<p>591. No obstante, es posible se&#241;alar que de conformidad con el informe de Polic&#237;a 
Judicial elaborado en el marco de la investigaci&#243;n penal iniciada para el esclarecimiento de 
los hechos en que result&#243; muerto el se&#241;or Hurtado, estos tuvieron lugar el d&#237;a 15 de marzo 
de 2010, en su finca ubicada en el poblado de &#8220;La Catalina&#8221;, municipio de la Macarena 
(Departamento del Meta). 
</p>
<p>592. El Estado se permite informar a Sus Se&#241;or&#237;as que la investigaci&#243;n penal con ocasi&#243;n 
del presunto delito de homicidio del se&#241;or Hurtado fue iniciada de oficio, siendo asignada a </p>

<p>la Fiscal&#237;a 6&#186; Especializada de la Direcci&#243;n Seccional de Fiscal&#237;as de Villavicencio 
(departamento del Meta). 
</p>
<p>593. Como fue afirmado en el p&#225;rrafo anterior, y de conformidad con la legislaci&#243;n penal 
vigente, la Fiscal&#237;a 6 &#186; Especializada inici&#243; de oficio la investigaci&#243;n penal con el fin de 
esclarecer estos lamentables hechos. 
</p>
<p>594. La mencionada investigaci&#243;n penal, que se encuentra en etapa de Indagaci&#243;n, fue 
asignada a la Fiscal&#237;a de conocimiento el d&#237;a 24 de marzo de 2010, en desarrollo de la cual, 
se han practicado diversas diligencias tales como la inspecci&#243;n t&#233;cnica al cad&#225;ver, 
diligencias de entrevistas a un testigo presencial de los hechos y la pr&#225;ctica de la 
necrodactilia.7  
</p>
<p>595. Sobre el particular, y de conformidad con lo manifestado por la Fiscal&#237;a de 
conocimiento, al momento de practicar la diligencia de inspecci&#243;n t&#233;cnica al cad&#225;ver, la 
compa&#241;era permanente de la victima, inicialmente aport&#243; como documento de 
identificaci&#243;n del se&#241;or Hurtado, una c&#233;dula de ciudadan&#237;a a nombre de otra persona. 
Posteriormente, alleg&#243; un carnet a nombre de Johnny Hurtado Perdomo, que lo identificaba 
como activista y defensor de Derechos Humanos. 
</p>
<p>596. En atenci&#243;n a lo anterior, y con el fin de tener claridad sobre la identidad del occiso, 
la Fiscal&#237;a de conocimiento remiti&#243; el resultado de  la necrodactilia a la Registradur&#237;a 
Nacional del Estado Civil, solicitando se adelanten las gestiones pertinentes para 
determinar la plena identidad del difunto. 
</p>
<p>597. Visto lo anterior, el Estado Colombiano se permite informar que teniendo en cuenta 
que la investigaci&#243;n penal para esclarecer estos lamentables hechos fue iniciada 
recientemente, sus presuntos responsables a&#250;n no han sido identificados y tampoco se han 
proferido sentencias condenatorias. En cuanto a los procesos disciplinarios, el Estado 
informar&#225; posteriormente sobre la existencia de los mismos.  
</p>
<p>598. El Estado lamenta los hechos que resultaron en la muerte del se&#241;or Hurtado, e 
informa que el Gobierno Nacional est&#225; presto a brindar la colaboraci&#243;n necesaria a las 
autoridades judiciales encargadas de esclarecer los hechos y de identificar e individualizar a 
los responsables. 
</p>
<p>599. La Fiscal&#237;a 6&#186; Especializada de Villavicencio inici&#243; de oficio la investigaci&#243;n penal 
con el fin de esclarecer estos lamentables hechos, y que en la actualidad se encuentra en 
etapa de indagaci&#243;n.   
</p>
<p>600. La Fiscal&#237;a de conocimiento ha practicado diversas diligencias tales como la 
inspecci&#243;n t&#233;cnica al cad&#225;ver, diligencias de entrevistas a un testigo presencial de los 
hechos y la practica de la necrodactilia.     
</p>
<p>601. En la actualidad no existe certeza sobre la identidad de la victima, motivo por el cual 
se solicit&#243; a la Registradur&#237;a Nacional del Estado Civil constatar la identidad del difunto. 
</p>
<p>602. El Estado colombiano informar&#225; oportunamente acerca de los avances y resultados

<p><b>  Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>603. El 20 de abril de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre los 
defensores de los derechos humanos, y el Relator Especial sobre las ejecuciones 
extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias enviaron una carta de alegaci&#243;n se&#241;alando a la 
atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. <b>Clodomiro 
Castilla Ospina</b>. El Sr. Castilla Ospina era editor y redactor de una revista informativa 
local, &#8220;El Pulso del Tiempo&#8221;. Asimismo era periodista del &#8220;Bloque Informativo&#8221; de &#8220;la Voz 
de Monter&#237;a&#8221;, una emisora de radio ubicado en el departamento de C&#243;rdoba. Desde el a&#241;o 
2006, el Sr. Castilla Ospina hab&#237;a investigado y denunciado p&#250;blicamente v&#237;nculos 
presuntos entre agentes del Gobierno local, pol&#237;ticos, terratenientes y paramilitares ilegales, 
adem&#225;s de varios casos de corrupci&#243;n en el Gobierno departamental. Asimismo, el Sr. 
Castilla Ospina hab&#237;a investigado la participaci&#243;n presunta de un hombre de negocios en un 
intento de asesinato de un abogado de la ciudad de Monter&#237;a. Recientemente &#233;l hab&#237;a citado 
como testigo en una investigaci&#243;n de la Corte Supremo de Justicia sobre los v&#237;nculos 
ilegales anteriormente mencionados.  
</p>
<p>604. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 19 de marzo de 2010, el Sr. Castilla Ospina 
habr&#237;a sido asesinado. Aproximadamente a las 8.40 horas de la noche, el Sr. Castilla Ospina 
habr&#237;a sido encontrado afuera de su casa, leyendo un libro, cuando un hombre no 
identificado se habr&#237;a acercado y le habr&#237;a disparado por lo menos ocho veces. El hombre 
desconocido habr&#237;a huido en una motocicleta que habr&#237;a sido conducido por un segundo 
hombre no identificado. El Sr. Castilla Ospina se habr&#237;a muerto a la escena un poco 
despu&#233;s. La polic&#237;a habr&#237;a empezado una investigaci&#243;n sobre el asesinato pero hasta la 
fecha el motivo por el asesinato ni algunos sospechosos habr&#237;an sido identificados 
p&#250;blicamente.  
</p>
<p>605. Se informa que el Sr. Castilla Ospina habr&#237;a sido recibiendo amenazas 
continuamente desde el a&#241;o 2006 como resultado de su trabajo y investigaciones. &#201;l habr&#237;a 
recibido medidas de protecci&#243;n policial del Ministerio del Interior y de Justicia durante tres 
a&#241;os desde 2006. Sin embargo, durante el a&#241;o 2009 &#233;l habr&#237;a renunciado sus medidas de 
protecci&#243;n debido a su falta de confianza en la fiabilidad del subcomandante de la polic&#237;a 
departamental, encargada a su protecci&#243;n. Posteriormente, en noviembre de 2009, &#233;l habr&#237;a 
solicitado la reanudaci&#243;n de protecci&#243;n debido al empeoramiento de las amenazas en su 
contra. La solicitaci&#243;n habr&#237;a sido rechazada porque un informe de inteligencia indicaba 
que las amenazas no eran de intensidad suficiente. El 3 de marzo de 2010, el Comandante 
de la Polic&#237;a de C&#243;rdoba habr&#237;a informado al Sr. Castilla Ospina que el Comando de 
Atenci&#243;n Inmediata (CAI) habr&#237;a rechazado su solicitud de medidas de protecci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>606. El 20 de febrero de 2010, el Sr. Castilla Ospina habr&#237;a denunciado formalmente 
amenazas en curso en su contra ante la Fiscal&#237;a Quinta Seccional, en particular citando el 
Sr. William Enrique Salleg Taboada, Director del peri&#243;dico &#8220;El Meridiano de C&#243;rdoba&#8221;. El 
Sr. Castilla Ospina habr&#237;a publicado varios art&#237;culos en que &#233;l habr&#237;a acusado al Sr. Salleg 
Taboada, la Srsa. Martha S&#225;enz, Gobernadora del departamento de C&#243;rdoba, y el Sr. Pedro 
Guisay Chadid, un empresario local, de estar v&#237;nculos a paramilitares ilegales. El Sr. 
Castilla Ospina habr&#237;a expresado preocupaci&#243;n que las amenazas podr&#237;a ser relacionadas a 
llamadas amenazantes que habr&#237;a recibido de personas no identificados en su celular. 
Asimismo, habr&#237;a recibido un mensaje de texto que le habr&#237;a advertido que si no retiraba las 
denuncias, le ser&#237;a asesinado. El Sr. Castilla Ospina habr&#237;a creado que el mensaje de texto 
habr&#237;a sido enviado por el Sr. Guisay Chadid.   
</p>
<p>607. Un nuevo an&#225;lisis de peligro habr&#237;a sido recientemente comisionado por el 
Ministerio del Interior en relaci&#243;n con las amenazas en contra del Sr. Castilla Ospina, pero 
al momento de su asesinato este informe no estaba completado.  El Sr. Castilla Ospina 
hab&#237;a sido programado a presentarse ante la Fiscal&#237;a Primera Especializada de Moneter&#237;a el 
24 de marzo de 2010 en relaci&#243;n con su denuncia formal en contra del Sr. Salleg Taboada.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>608. Se temi&#243; que el asesinato del Sr. Castilla Ospina est&#233; relacionado con las actividades 
que &#233;l realizaba para promover y defender los derechos de la gente de la regi&#243;n de C&#243;rdoba. 
Este asesinado, adem&#225;s de los actos amenazantes, de ser confirmados, se enmarca en un 
contexto de gran vulnerabilidad para los periodistas y defensores de los derechos humanos 
en Colombia.

<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>609. Mediante cartas fechadas el 17 junio de 2010 y el 27 de julio de 2010, el Gobierno 
respondi&#243; a la carta de alegaciones con fecha de 20 de abril de 2010. El Estado se permite 
informar que la exactitud de los hechos denunciados ser&#225; determinada mediante sentencia 
judicial. 
</p>
<p>610. No obstante, a la luz de la informaci&#243;n aportada por la Fiscal&#237;a General de la 
Naci&#243;n, el Estado colombiano se permite se&#241;alar que los hechos narrados por los 
Honorables Relatores Especiales, guardan consonancia con las labores investigativas 
adelantadas hasta la fecha. 
</p>
<p>611. El Estado colombiano se permite se&#241;alar que la Fiscal&#237;a Novena, adscrita a la 
Unidad Nacional de Derechos Humanos de la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n adelanta la 
investigaci&#243;n penal la cual fue iniciada de de oficio. 
</p>
<p>612. Tal como fue afirmado en el p&#225;rrafo anterior, el Estado colombiano estima 
importante recordar que la Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n, en atenci&#243;n a su obligaci&#243;n de 
investigar los delitos de los que tenga conocimiento, dio inicio a la investigaci&#243;n penal la 
cual se encuentra en la actualidad, en etapa de Indagaci&#243;n Preliminar. 
</p>
<p>613. Es as&#237; como, en desarrollo de la misma, la Fiscal&#237;a de conocimiento ha ordenado la 
elaboraci&#243;n del correspondiente programa metodol&#243;gico, as&#237; como tambi&#233;n diversas 
&#243;rdenes a la Polic&#237;a Judicial de la Direcci&#243;n de Investigaciones Judiciales de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional (DIJIN) para recaudar elementos probatorios, los cuales se encuentran en proceso 
de verificaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>614. No obstante lo anterior, a pesar de las gestiones desplegadas por la Fiscal&#237;a de 
conocimiento, el Estado colombiano se permite informar a Sus Se&#241;or&#237;as que hasta la fecha 
no se ha logrado individualizar ni identificar a los presuntos autores intelectuales y 
materiales del hecho punible. 
</p>
<p>615. En este mismo sentido, el Estado colombiano estima importante informar a Sus 
Se&#241;or&#237;as que la Procuradur&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n inform&#243; que la Procuradur&#237;a Delegada 
para el Ministerio P&#250;blico en Asuntos Penales constituy&#243; la Agencia Especial N&#186; 9125 
dentro de la investigaci&#243;n penal mencionada en el p&#225;rrafo cuarto del presente documento. 
</p>
<p>616.  Al respecto, el Estado colombiano se permite informar a Sus Se&#241;or&#237;as que a 
la luz de los hechos relacionados con el homicidio del periodista Castilla Ospona, la 
Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n solicit&#243; a su Oficina de Protecci&#243;n de Victimas y Testigos 
que analice la viabilidad de incorporar a la esposa e hijos de la victima dentro del Programa 
de Protecci&#243;n a su cargo. 
</p>
<p>617. De igual forma, se solicit&#243; a los Comandos de la Polic&#237;a Nacional en las ciudades de 
Monter&#237;a y Mosquera (departamento de C&#243;rdoba), implementar protecci&#243;n especial a favor 
de estas personas.  
</p>
<p>618. En cuanto a las medidas de protecci&#243;n implementadas para garantizar la integridad 
f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los defensores de derechos humanos en la regi&#243;n, el Estado 
colombiano se permite informar que durante el a&#241;o 2010, la Polic&#237;a del departamento de 
C&#243;rdoba ha llevado a cabo Estudios T&#233;cnicos de Nivel de Riesgo a ocho (8) defensores de 
Derechos Humanos del mencionado departamento, tres (3) de los cuales arrojaron como </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>84</b>  
</p>
<p>resultado &#8220;Extraordinario&#8221;, y cinco (5) arrojaron como resultado  &#8220;Ordinario&#8221;. En este 
sentido, el Estado colombiano se permite indicar que se han implementado alianzas 
estrat&#233;gicas de seguridad, como medida preventiva a favor de estos defensores de 
Defensores de Derechos Humanos, de forma tal que se mitiguen y controlen las situaciones 
de riesgo en que se pueden encontrar estas personas.  
</p>
<p>619. El Estado colombiano lamenta y rechaza los hechos que resultaron en la muerte del 
se&#241;or Clodomiro Castilla Opsina. 
</p>
<p>620. La Fiscal&#237;a Novena, adscrita a la Unidad Nacional de Derechos Humanos de la 
Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n, adelante la investigaci&#243;n penal la cual fue iniciada de oficio. 
</p>
<p>621. El Gobierno Nacional brindar&#225; la colaboraci&#243;n necesaria a la Fiscal&#237;a General de la 
Naci&#243;n, con el prop&#243;sito de identificar e individualizar a los responsables y llevarlos ante el 
Juez competente. 
</p>
<p>622. La Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n solicit&#243; a su Oficina de Protecci&#243;n de Victimas u 
Testigos que analice la viabilidad de incorporar a la esposa e hijos de la victima dentro del 
Programa de Protecci&#243;n a su cargo. 
</p>
<p>623. La Polic&#237;a Nacional, a trav&#233;s del Comando de Polic&#237;a del departamento de C&#243;rdoba, 
se encuentra brindado medidas especiales de protecci&#243;n a favor de los familiares del 
periodista Clodomiro Castilla Ospina.    
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>624. El 10 de junio de 2010 el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos enviaron un 
llamamiento urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida 
en relaci&#243;n con la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del sacerdote y defensor de los derechos 
humanos <b>Javier Giraldo</b>.  El padre Javier Giraldo es miembro del Centro de Investigaci&#243;n 
y Educaci&#243;n Popular (CINEP), organizaci&#243;n no gubernamental creada por la Compa&#241;&#237;a de 
Jes&#250;s en 1962, que trabaja por la transformaci&#243;n social, econ&#243;mica y pol&#237;tica de Colombia 
con especial atenci&#243;n a los sectores m&#225;s desfavorecidos.   
</p>
<p>625. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, desde el d&#237;a 22 de abril de 2010, habr&#237;an 
aparecido en la ciudad de Bogot&#225; varias pintadas amenazando de muerte al padre Giraldo.  
Las pintadas habr&#237;an incluidos textos como &#8220;Javier Giraldo = muerte&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>626. Como parte de su labor como defensor de los derechos humanos, el padre Giraldo 
habr&#237;a estado activamente involucrado en el esclarecimiento de la masacre de Trujillo, en el 
Valle de Cauca, en la cual habr&#237;an sido asesinadas m&#225;s de 300 personas en 1990.   
</p>
<p>627. Asimismo, el padre Giraldo habr&#237;a denunciado cr&#237;menes y asesinatos cometidos por 
el ej&#233;rcito colombiano, grupos paramilitares y guerrilla en la Comunidad de Paz de San 
Jos&#233; de Apartado desde julio de 1996.  Su trabajo en relaci&#243;n con esta comunidad habr&#237;a 
incluido la denuncia de la participaci&#243;n de un antiguo Comandante de las Fuerzas Armadas 
colombianas en la masacre de San Jos&#233; de Apartado ocurrida el 21 de febrero de 2005.  En 
conexi&#243;n con su trabajo en este caso, el padre Giraldo habr&#237;a sido objeto de una 
comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el entonces Relator Especial sobre la independencia de 
magistrados y abogados, el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de 
opini&#243;n y de expresi&#243;n, y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los 
derechos humanos el 20 de marzo de 2009.   
</p>
<p>628. Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de creciente 
violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en Colombia.  Se 
expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del padre Javier Giraldo y por el 
hecho de que estas amenazas pudieran estar relacionadas con sus actividades de promoci&#243;n </p>

<p>y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular de los m&#225;s desfavorecidos, as&#237; como 
con sus denuncias de violaciones de derechos fundamentales.  
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente  
</b></p>
<p>629. El 22 de diciembre de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con las 
amenazas contra integrantes de varias organizaciones de derechos humanos en el Valle del 
Cauca, entre ellas el <b>Movimiento de V&#237;ctimas de Cr&#237;menes de Estado</b> (MOVICE), la 
<b>Fundaci&#243;n Comit&#233; de Solidaridad con los Presos Pol&#237;ticos</b> &#8211; Seccional Valle del Cauca 
(FCSPP), la <b>Asociaci&#243;n para la Investigaci&#243;n y Acci&#243;n Social</b> (NOMADESC), la 
<b>Asociaci&#243;n ECATE</b> y el <b>Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores y Empleados 
Universitarios de Colombia</b>, Subdirectiva Cali (SINTRAUNICOL). Varias 
comunicaciones de los procedimientos especiales han sido enviadas en relaci&#243;n con estas 
organizaciones y sus integrantes, la m&#225;s reciente por la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n 
de los defensores de los derechos humanos y el Presidente-Relator del Grupo de Trabajo 
sobre la Detenci&#243;n Arbitraria el 23 de noviembre de 2010. En este respecto, agradecemos la 
respuesta del Gobierno de su Excelencia de fecha 6 de diciembre 2010. 
</p>
<p>630. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 10 y 11 de diciembre del 2010, varias 
organizaciones ubicadas en las zonas del Valle del Cauca habr&#237;an llevado a cabo 
actividades en conmemoraci&#243;n del d&#237;a internacional de los derechos humanos en los 
municipios de Cali y Zarzal. Estas actividades habr&#237;an tenido como objetivo la 
visibilizaci&#243;n de la situaci&#243;n de derechos humanos de algunos sectores de la regi&#243;n, entre 
ellos lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y personas transg&#233;neros (LGBT), sindicatos, residentes en 
asentamientos urbanos, defensores y defensoras de derechos humanos y estudiantes, y 
habr&#237;an culminado con la presentaci&#243;n del &#8220;Plan de Vida de Derechos Humanos para el 
Valle del Cauca&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>631. Sin embargo, se informa que inmediatamente despu&#233;s de la finalizaci&#243;n de los 
dichos actos, varias de las mujeres integrantes que se encontraban presentes habr&#237;an 
recibido amenazas de muerte mediante mensajes de tel&#233;fono, supuestamente provenientes 
del grupo paramilitar conocido como &#8220;&#193;guilas Negras&#8221;. Aproximadamente a las 18:00h, el 
primero de estos habr&#237;a llegado al tel&#233;fono de la Sra. Martha Lucia Giraldo, promotora del 
Cap&#237;tulo Valle del MOVICE, desde un n&#250;mero conocido por la Relatora Especial, y habr&#237;a 
dicho textualmente: &#8220;Ustedes son los que no dejan que este pa&#237;s progrese apoyando a 
familias de gerilleros (sic) y a los que depimen (sic) con esas ideas est&#250;pidas de libertad por

</p>
<p>632. Posteriormente, aproximadamente a las 21:00h, otro mensaje proveniente del mismo 
n&#250;mero habr&#237;a llegado al tel&#233;fono de la Sra. Cristina Castro, integrante del CSPP y de la 
Red de Hermandad y Solidaridad con Colombia, el cual habr&#237;a amenazado de muerte a 
integrantes de MOVICE, ECATE, FSCPP y grupos LGBT, entre otros, acus&#225;ndoles de ser 
guerrilleros. Adem&#225;s, se informa que las Sras. Berenice Celeyta, directora de la Asociaci&#243;n 
NOMADESC y A&#237;da Quilcu&#233;, ex consejera mayor del Concejo Regional Ind&#237;gena del 
Cauca y anterior vocera del proceso Minga de Resistencia Social y Comunitaria, habr&#237;an 
asimismo recibido un mensaje similar al anterior, junto con otro que habr&#237;a amenazado de 
muerte a integrantes de las mismas organizaciones, entre otras, as&#237; como sus familiares, 
acus&#225;ndoles asimismo de ser &#8220;benefactores de la guerrilla&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>633. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de las Sras. 
Martha Lucia Giraldo, Cristina Castro, Berenice Celeyta y Ayda Quilcu&#233;, as&#237; como otros 
integrantes de MOVICE, FCSPP, Asociaci&#243;n ECATE, NOMADESC, SINTRAUNICOL y </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>86</b>  
</p>
<p>de otras organizaciones de derechos humanos que trabajan en el Valle del Cauca. 
Asimismo, se expres&#243; temor por las alegaciones de que las amenazas en contra de estas 
organizaciones pudieran estar relacionadas con sus actividades pac&#237;ficas y leg&#237;timas de 
promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos.  Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se 
enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los 
derechos humanos en el Valle del Cauca, as&#237; como en Colombia generalmente en los 
&#250;ltimos meses. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones  
</b></p>
<p>634. El Relator Especial agradece las respuestas detalladas que el Gobierno de Colombia 
ha proporcionado en relaci&#243;n con las comunicaciones enviadas. Sin embargo, el Relator 
Especial lamenta que, en el momento de la finalizaci&#243;n del presente informe, no hab&#237;a 
recibido respuesta a 25 comunicaciones enviadas anteriormente. El Relator Especial 
considera que el responder a las comunicaciones representa un elemento fundamental para 
la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados con el mandato, es por ello que insta al gobierno colombiano 
a que le proporcione una respuesta tratando los asuntos mencionados.  
</p>
<p>635. El 12 de agosto de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial de la 
Organizaci&#243;n de Estados Americanos, publicaron un comunicado de prensa en el cual ellos 
manifestaron su profundo rechazo ante el atentado ocurrido en la madrugada del 12 de 
agosto frente a Radio Caracol, en Bogot&#225;, y expresaron su solidaridad con las personas 
heridas y con el personal de la emisora. Los relatores enfatizaron que, para impedir la 
repetici&#243;n de estos actos brutales, es determinante la actuaci&#243;n inmediata del Estado para 
identificar la causa del ataque, capturar, procesar y condenar de manera efectiva y 
proporcionada a los autores materiales e intelectuales del mismo.

jour m&#234;me en compagnie de M. Edadi. 
</p>
<p>638. N&#8217;ayant pu rencontrer l&#8217;inspecteur g&#233;n&#233;ral, M. Bahizire aurait envoy&#233; plusieurs 
messages texte &#224; son &#233;pouse, l&#8217;informant qu&#8217;il se rendait &#224; l&#8217;Universit&#233; p&#233;dagogique

<p>641. Dans une lettre dat&#233;e du 7 ao&#251;t 2010, le Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que s&#8217;agissant des 
deux principales pr&#233;occupations exprim&#233;es par les trois Rapporteurs sp&#233;ciaux, les faits dans 
la cause seront mieux relat&#233;s apr&#232;s le proc&#232;s. Le dossier, inscrit dans l'office de l'Auditeur 
General des Forces Arm&#233;es de la R&#233;publique D&#233;mocratique du Congo sous le num&#233;ro RMP

le corps des indications de contrainte extr&#234;me limit&#233;e par chocs, compression et/ou 
enserrement au niveau des bras et des jambes. L'autopsie n'a pas d&#233;montr&#233; avec certitude la 
cause du d&#233;c&#232;s. Toutefois, les observations sont fortement en faveur d'une cause primaire

situation de M. <b>Berry Francklin Lutshaka</b>, journaliste &#224; Radio Okapi, une station 
parrain&#233;e par les Nations Unies.  
</p>
<p>646. Le 3 juin 2010, apr&#232;s avoir effectu&#233; une enqu&#234;te de terrain, M. Lutshaka aurait 
rapport&#233; sur les ondes de Radio Okapi que les travaux de construction des h&#244;tels de la

Lutshaka aurait ajout&#233; que le prince saoudien, qui finance le projet, aurait exig&#233; la 
d&#233;mission de l&#8217;actuel comit&#233; de gestion pour malversations  financi&#232;res et souhaiterait le 
remplacer par un autre comit&#233;. Or, le comit&#233; actuel refuserait de d&#233;missionner.

administratif de la soci&#233;t&#233; Rakeen, qui n&#8217;aurait pas appr&#233;ci&#233; l&#8217;intervention de M. Lutshaka. 
Ce dernier lui aurait offert un droit de r&#233;ponse, mais M. Mwamba l&#8217;aurait menac&#233; dans les 
termes suivants : &#171; tu as tr&#232;s mal fait ton travail. Comment peux- tu aller chercher des

<p>648. Le 8 juin, Me Vincent, avocat de la soci&#233;t&#233; Rakeen, aurait appel&#233; M. Lutshaka pour 
lui proposer une rencontre le 9 juin afin de discuter du droit de r&#233;ponse. M. Lutshaka aurait 
demand&#233; &#224; un officier de la s&#233;curit&#233; de la Mission des Nations Unies en R&#233;publique 
d&#233;mocratique du Congo (MONUC) de l&#8217;accompagner au rendez-vous. Quand Me Vincent 
aurait appris que M. Lutshaka venait accompagn&#233;, il aurait menac&#233; l&#8217;officier de s&#233;curit&#233; qui 
alors conseilla &#224; M. Lutshaka de ne pas se rendre au rendez-vous.  
</p>
<p>649. Dans la matin&#233;e du 9 juin, M. Lutshaka aurait &#233;t&#233; inform&#233; par un magistrat qu&#8217;une 
plainte avait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;pos&#233;e contre lui. 
</p>

appel&#233; M. Lutshaka pour le convoquer au tribunal. Une convocation par &#233;crit aurait &#233;t&#233; 
envoy&#233;e par la suite. 
</p>
<p>651. Le 14 juin, le m&#234;me inspecteur aurait &#233;mis une seconde convocation.

</p>
<p>654. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, depuis le 15 ao&#251;t 2010, M. Tshiyoyo ferait l&#8217;objet de 
menaces de mort apr&#232;s qu&#8217;il ait film&#233; une partie d&#8217;un affrontement entre le Gouverneur du

au cours duquel un garde du corps aurait &#233;t&#233; tu&#233; et quatre personnes au sein de la population 
auraient &#233;t&#233; bless&#233;es. A l&#8217;origine de cet affrontement, le Gouverneur aurait voulu proc&#233;der &#224; 
l&#8217;investiture d&#8217;un nouveau chef du Groupement de Bakua Mushilu &#224; Luandanda, en 
&#233;vin&#231;ant l&#8217;actuel chef qui serait d&#8217;ob&#233;dience politique diff&#233;rente. La population aurait

Gouverneur, se serait rendu au domicile de M. Tshiyoyo, exigeant qu&#8217;il lui livre les images 
qu&#8217;il avait prises le jour m&#234;me. Devant son refus, ces derniers seraient repartis. Plus tard 
dans la soir&#233;e, trois policiers en civil et un autre en tenue polici&#232;re seraient venus au 
domicile de M. Tshiyoyo afin de l&#8217;appr&#233;hender, mais celui-ci n&#8217;&#233;tait pas pr&#233;sent. Plusieurs 
personnes se seraient rendues au domicile des parents du journaliste et seraient rest&#233;es &#224; 
l&#8217;attendre jusqu&#8217;au lendemain matin. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que le Gouverneur se serait d&#233;plac&#233; en 
personne au domicile de M. Tshiyoyo afin d&#8217;obtenir les images en sa possession et qu&#8217;une

<p>660. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 24 ao&#251;t 2010, en d&#233;but d&#8217;apr&#232;s-midi, M. Sylvestre 
Bwira Kyahi aurait &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233; par deux hommes portant l&#8217;uniforme des Forces arm&#233;es de la 
R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC), sur la route de Ndosho sur l&#8217;axe Goma 
Sake. Ces deux hommes auraient fait entrer de force M. Bwira Kyahi &#224; bord de leur 
v&#233;hicule de marque Jeep Prado, de couleur kaki et aux vitres fum&#233;es. Le v&#233;hicule serait 
ensuite parti en direction de Goma. La famille de M. Bwira Kyahi et les membres de la 
soci&#233;t&#233; civile de Masisi seraient depuis sans nouvelle de celui-ci et ils craindraient 
grandement pour sa s&#233;curit&#233;. 
</p>
<p>661. Au cours des quatre derniers mois, M. Bwira Kyahi aurait fait l&#8217;objet de nombreuses 
menaces de mort de la part de personnes pr&#233;sum&#233;es &#234;tre des officiers FARDC post&#233;s dans 
le territoire de Masisi. Le 30 juillet 2010, la soci&#233;t&#233; civile de Masisi, sous l&#8217;impulsion de

Masisi. Cette lettre comportait les noms de plusieurs officiers sup&#233;rieurs actifs dans le 
territoire qui auraient &#233;t&#233; mis en cause dans des cas de violations des droits de l&#8217;homme. 
Suite &#224; la publication de cette lettre, la s&#233;curit&#233; de la victime se serait davantage d&#233;t&#233;rior&#233;e.

</p>
<p>672. Les titulaires de mandat ont demand&#233; au Gouvernement de bien vouloir transmettre 
la pr&#233;sente lettre au Pr&#233;sident de l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e nationale de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du

</p>
<p>673. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 21 octobre 2010, la salle des Congr&#232;s de 
l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e nationale de la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo aurait d&#233;battu d&#8217;une &#171; 
proposition de loi relative aux pratiques sexuelles contre nature &#187;. Selon cette proposition 
de loi, &#171; l&#8217;homosexualit&#233; (&#8230;) [est] une menace &#224; la famille (&#8230;), une d&#233;viation de la race 
humaine vers des relations contre nature (&#8230;) et [constitue] une d&#233;pravation des m&#339;urs 
qualifi&#233;es d&#8217;abomination &#187;.  
</p>
<p>674. La proposition de loi vise &#224; r&#233;viser le code p&#233;nal congolais, tel que modifi&#233; et 
compl&#233;t&#233; par la loi du 20 juillet 2006 sur les violences sexuelles. Les modifications portent 
sp&#233;cifiquement sur le paragraphe 8 de la section III du titre VI de la dite loi du code p&#233;nal : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; selon l&#8217;article 174h1 de la proposition de loi, &#171; [s]era puni de trois &#224; cinq ans de 
servitude p&#233;nale et d&#8217;une amende de 500.000 francs congolais, quiconque aura eu des 
relations homosexuelles &#187; ; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; selon l&#8217;article 174h2 de la proposition de loi, &#171; [s]ont interdites&#8230; toute association 
promouvant ou d&#233;fendant des rapports sexuels contre nature. Sera puni de six mois &#224; 
un an de servitude p&#233;nale et d&#8217;une amende de 1.000.000 francs congolais constants, 
quiconque aura cr&#233;e, financ&#233;, initi&#233; et implanter toute association toute structure 
promouvant les relations sexuelles contre nature &#187; ; et 
</p>
<p>&#8226; selon l&#8217;article 174h3 de la proposition de loi, &#171; [s]ont interdits&#8230; toute publication, 
affiches, pamphlets, film mettant en exergue, ou susceptibles de susciter ou 
encourager des pratiques sexuelles contre nature &#187;.  
</p>
<p>675. La criminalisation de l&#8217;homosexualit&#233; aurait un effet pr&#233;judiciable sur les efforts de 
la R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du Congo dans sa lutte contre le VIH/SIDA. Les politiques de 
la sant&#233; publique concernant l&#8217;&#233;pid&#233;mie du VIH/SIDA d&#233;montrent clairement que la 
d&#233;criminalisation de l&#8217;homosexualit&#233;, combin&#233;e avec des efforts visant &#224; lutter contre la 
discrimination des homosexuels, lesbiennes, bisexuels et transsexuels, repr&#233;sentent une 
mesure substantielle pour restreindre la propagation du virus. De plus, si la proposition de 
loi est adopt&#233;e, celle-ci aurait pour effet d&#8217;entraver l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; information, aux soins et aux 
traitements des personnes homosexuelles, atteintes de VIH/SIDA en R&#233;publique 
d&#233;mocratique du Congo, et par cons&#233;quent pourrait compromettre la r&#233;ponse nationale dans 
la lutte contre le VIH/SIDA.  
</p>
<p>676. Cette proposition de loi aurait &#233;galement un effet n&#233;faste sur la situation des

des homosexuels, lesbiennes, bisexuels et transsexuels en R&#233;publique d&#233;mocratique du

</p>
<p>678. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 17 d&#233;cembre 2010, M. Robert Shemahamba se 
serait pr&#233;sent&#233; &#224; l&#8217;Agence nationale de renseignements (ANR) d&#8217;Uvira sur convocation. Il 
se serait enquis aupr&#232;s d&#8217;un agent du motif de cette convocation et se serait vu r&#233;pondre 
qu&#8217;il devait &#234;tre entendu sur proc&#232;s verbal pour le fait qui lui ait reproch&#233;, &#224; savoir outrage

dans des conditions d&#233;plorables jusqu&#8217;au 24 d&#233;cembre, date de son transfert aux locaux de 
l&#8217;ANR &#224; Bukavu M. Shemahamba souffre d&#8217;hypertension et sa femme, qui lui aurait rendu

son &#233;tat de sant&#233;. 
</p>
<p>679. Il serait reproch&#233; &#224; M. Shemahamba d'avoir anim&#233; le 12 d&#233;cembre 2010 une 
&#233;mission intitul&#233;e &#8216;Franc Parler&#8217; sur les antennes de radio Mitumba, au cours de laquelle M.

du chef de l&#8217;Etat tenu le 8 d&#233;cembre 2010 au Parlement national.  
</p>
<p>680.   Suite &#224; l&#8217;&#233;mission, M. Kalonzo serait entr&#233; en clandestinit&#233;, craignant pour sa 
vie. Quelques jours plus tard, il aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; par des agents de l&#8217;ANR &#224; Uvira qui 
l&#8217;auraient menott&#233; et train&#233; sur le sol, avant de le rouer de coups sur diverses parties de son 
corps. M. Kalonzo aurait &#233;t&#233; admis &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital inconscient, le visage tum&#233;fi&#233;, puis aurait &#233;t&#233; 
enlev&#233; par deux individus. 
</p>
<p>681. De s&#233;rieuses craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant au fait que l&#8217;arrestation et la d&#233;tention 
de M. Shemahamba, ainsi que l&#8217;arrestation, l&#8217;agression et l&#8217;enl&#232;vement de M. Kalonzo,

M. Shemahamba qui souffre d&#8217;hypertension.

Cet appel reste sans r&#233;ponse &#224; ce jour. 
</p>
<p>685.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 1er f&#233;vrier 2011, Me Jean Claude Katende aurait 
re&#231;u un SMS le mena&#231;ant dans les termes suivants : &#171; Merci pour le communiqu&#233; de presse 
n&#176; 02/ASADHO/2011. Mais n&#8217;oubliez pas non plus le droit fondamental de tuer votre

pillages ont &#233;t&#233; commis.  
</p>

biens provenant des pillages, d'autres munis d'objets contendants et barres de fer &#224; l'aide 
desquels des principales d&#233;gradations ont &#233;t&#233; commises.  
</p>
<p>701. Il ressort des premiers &#233;l&#233;ments de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te que le nomm&#233; Farah Abadid Hildid a 
particip&#233; &#224; cette manifestation et cinq personnes parmi la douzaine gard&#233;es &#224; vue, n'&#233;tant 
par ailleurs ni &#233;tudiants du p&#244;le universitaire ni m&#234;me un riverain de l'endroit o&#249; cette 
manifestation se d&#233;roulait, ont reconnu s'&#234;tre retrouv&#233;s parmi les &#233;tudiants avec et sur 
initiative de Farah Abadid Hildid.  
</p>
<p>702. Celui-ci les avaient r&#233;unis la veille et l'avant-veille, c'est-&#224;-dire dans l'apr&#232;s-midi du 
3 f&#233;vrier 2011, dans un local sis au quartier 7 faisant office d'annexe d'un mouvement que 
celui-ci anime pour le compte de son ami et cousin, Daher Ahmed Farah et dans la soir&#233;e 
du lendemain vendredi 4 f&#233;vrier au si&#232;ge du m&#234;me mouvement au lieu-dit Cheik Moussa.  
</p>
<p>703. Farah Abadid Hildid appelait les participants aux r&#233;unions clandestines au 
soul&#232;vement qui devait, selon lui, d&#233;buter &#224; l'occasion de la manifestation des &#233;tudiants.  
</p>
<p>704. Non content d'y avoir incit&#233; les &#233;l&#233;ments &#171; casseurs pilleurs &#187;, Farah Abadid 
participait lui-m&#234;me aux violences ayant emmaill&#233; dans la matin&#233;e du 5 f&#233;vrier les abords 
de l'Universit&#233; de Djibouti et le centre-ville proche.  
</p>
<p>705. Farah Abadid Hildid est interpell&#233; le 5 f&#233;vrier dans la soir&#233;e.  
</p>
<p>706. Les auditions qui s'ensuivirent ont permis d'&#233;tablir que Jean-Paul Abdi No&#235;l avait lui 
aussi particip&#233; aux deux r&#233;unions pr&#233;cit&#233;es.  
</p>
<p>707. Des documents et des retranscriptions saisies dans le cadre de l'enqu&#234;te attestent de 
la r&#233;alit&#233;, non seulement des contacts nombreux entre Jean-Paul Abdi No&#235;l et les 
principaux animateurs de mouvements dissous, lesquels mouvements sont identifi&#233;s comme 
&#233;tant des instigateurs des troubles perp&#233;tr&#233;s, mais &#233;galement de la participation de ce 
dernier aux r&#233;unions pr&#233;paratoires des 3 et 4 f&#233;vrier ainsi que l'assistance fournie &#224; la 
r&#233;alisation des infractions en permettant notamment de dupliquer les tracts appelant la 
violence.  
</p>
<p>708. Le 9 f&#233;vrier 2011 est interpell&#233; a son tour Jean-Paul Abdi No&#235;l.  
</p>
<p>709. Une information judiciaire est ouverte le m&#234;me jour ; Farah Abadid, et six autres 
personnes sont pr&#233;venues d'avoir particip&#233; &#224; un mouvement insurrectionnel en provoquant 
des rassemblements et manifestations ayant entrain&#233; des violences collectives, d&#233;gradations 
de biens appartenant &#224; autrui et d&#233;gradation d'&#233;difices publics.  
</p>
<p>710. Il est ordonn&#233; par le magistrat instructeur, d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive &#224; l'encontre des sept 
pr&#233;venus. 
</p>
<p>711. Le 21 f&#233;vrier 2011, Jean-Paul Abdi No&#235;l est remis en libert&#233; pour des raisons de 
sant&#233; ; le contr&#244;le judiciaire auquel ii &#233;tait astreint est lev&#233; par le m&#234;me magistrat le 22 mars

demande de libert&#233; de Farah Abadid Hildid et de ses cod&#233;tenus.  
</p>
<p>713. En compl&#233;ment, nous souhaiterions apporter les informations et observations 
suivantes : 
</p>
<p> 1)  Djibouti r&#233;affirme son soutien aux proc&#233;dures sp&#233;ciales et son souhait de 
coop&#233;rer avec les d&#233;tenteurs de mandats dans l'accomplissement des fonctions qui leurs </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>96</b>  
</p>
<p>sont confi&#233;es par le Conseil des droits de l'Homme en vertu de la proc&#233;dure 60/251 de 
l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e G&#233;n&#233;rale.  
</p>
<p> 2)  Djibouti reconnait que les proc&#233;dures sp&#233;ciales jouent un r&#244;le crucial dans la 
promotion et la protection des droits de l'homme, tout en soulignant l'importance majeure 
que celles-ci s'&#233;vertuent constamment &#224; s'acquitter de leurs missions en faisant &#224; tout instant 
preuve d'ind&#233;pendance, de probit&#233;, d'impartialit&#233;, d'honn&#234;tet&#233; et de bonne foi.  
</p>
<p> 3)  Tout en soulignant l'utilit&#233; d&#8217;une interaction r&#233;guli&#232;re des proc&#233;dures 
sp&#233;ciales avec les d&#233;fenseurs de droits de l'homme, elle soul&#232;ve des interrogations s&#233;rieuses 
quant au caract&#232;re urgent de la situation lorsque l'examen de la r&#233;ponse donn&#233;e par le 
Gouvernement fait clairement ressortir que toutes les mesures ont &#233;t&#233; prises afin que les 
droit fondamentaux des personnes concern&#233;es tels qu'il sont d&#233;finis et prot&#233;g&#233;s par le droit 
national et international ont &#233;t&#233; respect&#233;s.  
</p>
<p> 4)  A cet &#233;gard, nous souhaiterions attirer votre attention sur le paragraphe 3 de 
l&#8217;article 19 du Pacte Internationale aux Droits civils et politiques qui stipule : &#171; l'exercice 
des libert&#233;s pr&#233;vues au Par.2 du pr&#233;sent article comporte des devoirs sp&#233;ciaux et des 
responsabilit&#233;s sp&#233;ciales. Il peut en cons&#233;quence &#234;tre soumis certaines restrictions qui 
doivent toutefois &#234;tre express&#233;ment fix&#233;es par la loi et qui sont n&#233;cessaires &#187;. Et &#224; l'alin&#233;a b 
du m&#234;me article qui sp&#233;cifie ces limites &#171; la sauvegarde de la s&#233;curit&#233; nationale, de l&#8217;ordre 
public, de la sant&#233; et de la moralit&#233; publique, ainsi que l&#8217;article 20, par.2 &#171; tout appel &#224; la 
haine nationale, raciale ou religieuse qui constitue une incitation &#224; la discrimination, &#224; 
l'hostilit&#233; ou &#224; la violence est interdite par la loi &#187;. Dans le cas sous examen, les deux 
personnes suscit&#233;es se sont rendues coupables d'infractions p&#233;nales mises en &#233;vidence par 
enqu&#234;te rapide et impartiale men&#233;es par l'Etat et la proc&#233;dure d'instruction qui a &#233;t&#233; 
engag&#233;e. Le gouvernement est convaincu que les individus, groupes, institutions et 
organisations non-gouvernementales ont un r&#244;le important &#224; jouer et une responsabilit&#233; &#224; 
assumer en ce qui concerne la sauvegarde de la d&#233;mocratie, la promotion des droits de 
l'homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales ainsi que la promotion et le progr&#232;s de soci&#233;t&#233;s, 
institutions et soci&#233;t&#233;s d&#233;mocratiques mais comme le stipule l&#8217;article 17 de la d&#233;claration 
des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme &#171; dans l'exercice des droits et libert&#233;s de chacun, 
agissant individuellement ou en association avec d'autres, n'est soumis qu'aux limitations 
fix&#233;es conform&#233;ment aux obligations internationales existantes et &#233;tablies par la loi 
exclusivement en vue d'assurer la reconnaissance et le respect des droits et libert&#233;s d'autrui 
et afin de satisfaire aux justes exigences de la morale, de l&#8217;ordre public et du bien-&#234;tre 
g&#233;n&#233;ral dans une soci&#233;t&#233; d&#233;mocratique &#187;. 
</p>
<p> 5)  Nous souhaitons enfin souligner le fait que l&#8217;exercice du droit a la libert&#233; 
d'opinion et d'expression est pleinement garanti par la l&#233;gislation nationale, un droit dont la 
jouissance est essentielle pour la vitalit&#233; du processus d&#233;mocratique.  
</p>
<p> 6)  Dans les communications all&#233;guant les informations qui ont probablement 
servi de base &#224; l'appel urgent, il est souvent fait r&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; un effort syst&#233;matique du 
gouvernement de &#171; musellement des voix dissidentes en raison d'un contexte pr&#233;-&#233;lectoral 
tendu &#187;. Le Gouvernement r&#233;cuse les accusations de harc&#232;lement et de musellement. Des 
&#233;lections d&#233;mocratiques, libres et transparentes, se sont tenues &#224; Djibouti en pr&#233;sence 
d'observateurs internationaux invit&#233;s par le Gouvernement afin d'appuyer le processus 
d&#233;mocratique. Le candidat sortant et le candidat ind&#233;pendant soutenu par une partie de 
l'opposition ont chacun &#233;tay&#233;, au cours une campagne &#233;lectorale vigoureuse, les politiques 
sociales, &#233;conomiques qu'ils comptent mettre en &#339;uvre afin de r&#233;pondre aux d&#233;fis de 
d&#233;veloppement du pays. Et c'est sur la base de l'examen souverain de ces propositions que 
l&#8217;&#233;lectorat s'est prononce. Nous joignons &#224; la r&#233;ponse du gouvernement la d&#233;claration 
conjointe des observateurs internationaux publi&#233;e &#224; l'issue d'un scrutin dont ils ont salu&#233; la 
r&#233;gularit&#233;, la transparence, l&#8217;&#233;quit&#233; et le bon d&#233;roulement conform&#233;ment aux dispositions 
pertinentes.  </p>

<p>715. El 22 de julio de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron una carta de alegaciones 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el 
asesinato del Sr. <b>Germ&#225;n Antonio Ram&#237;rez Herrera</b>, m&#233;dico forense de la prisi&#243;n de 
Quevedo, en la provincia de Los R&#237;os, y experto independiente parte de la red nacional 
creada por la Fundaci&#243;n para la Rehabilitaci&#243;n Integral de V&#237;ctimas de Violencia (PRIVA) 
para la ejecuci&#243;n del proyecto &#8220;Prevenci&#243;n de la tortura a trav&#233;s de la documentaci&#243;n e 
implementaci&#243;n del Protocolo de Estambul&#8221;.  PRIVA es una organizaci&#243;n no-
gubernamental que trabaja para la prevenci&#243;n y erradicaci&#243;n de la tortura en Ecuador.   
</p>
<p>716. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 6 de julio de 2010, sobre las 12:30 horas, el 
Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera recibi&#243; dos disparos con arma de fuego despu&#233;s de haber dejado su 
oficina.  Varios testigos habr&#237;an asegurado ver en el lugar de los hechos a tres individuos en 
un coche color gris y a un cuarto en una motocicleta.    
</p>
<p>717. Como parte de su trabajo en tanto que experto independiente de la red nacional 
creada por PRIVA, el Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera habr&#237;a documentando casos de tortura y 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales en la prisi&#243;n de Quevedo.  Como consecuencia de este trabajo, 
el Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera habr&#237;a recibido amenazas en el pasado.   
</p>
<p>718. El d&#237;a del asesinato del Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera, PRIVA habr&#237;a presentado los casos de 
la prisi&#243;n de Quevedo al Relator Especial de las Naciones Unidas sobre ejecuciones extra-
judiciales, sumarias y arbitrarias, Philip Alston, el cual se encontraba realizando una visita 
de investigaci&#243;n al pa&#237;s.  
</p>
<p>719. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, tras el asesinato del Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera habr&#237;a 
motivos para temer por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de sus familiares as&#237; como de los 
trabajadores de PRIVA y de otros miembros de la red nacional de expertos independientes.  
</p>
<p>720. Se temi&#243; que el asesinato del Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera est&#233; relacionado con sus 
actividades en defensa de los derechos humanos, en concreto con su labor de 
documentaci&#243;n de casos de tortura y ejecuciones extra-judiciales.  Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n 
por la posibilidad de que el asesinato del Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera tenga relaci&#243;n con su trabajo 
como integrante de la red nacional de expertos independientes creada por PRIVA.  
Finalmente, se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los familiares

</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>721. Mediante carta fechada 2 de Noviembre de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la carta de 
alegaciones con fecha de 22 de julio de 2010.  El Gobierno del Ecuador, que considera una 
prioridad el garantizar y velar por el pleno ejercicio y goce de los derechos humanos de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>98</b>  
</p>
<p>todos los habitantes del pa&#237;s, ha brindado una especial atenci&#243;n al caso sobre la muerte del 
doctor Ram&#237;rez. En primer lugar, se inform&#243; de las denuncias y requerimientos 
internacionales sobre el caso a todas las altas autoridades que representan a las instituciones 
involucradas en brindar la debida respuesta estatal a este asunto, como son el Ministerio 
Coordinador de Seguridad; el Ministerio de Justicia, Derechos Humanos y Cultos; el 
Ministerio del Interior; la Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado y la Corte Nacional de Justicia. 
</p>
<p>722. Debido a la importancia del caso, a principios de agosto 2010 se articul&#243; una 
coordinaci&#243;n interinstitucional, convocada por el Ministerio de Justicia y con la 
participaci&#243;n del Ministerio de Coordinaci&#243;n de Seguridad; del Departamento de Derechos 
Humanos de la Direcci&#243;n de Educaci&#243;n de la Polic&#237;a Nacional; de la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo; 
del Ministerio de Defensa y del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores. 
</p>
<p>723. El 16 de agosto 2010, la Corte Nacional de Justicia inform&#243; que, en julio del 
presente a&#241;o, solicit&#243; al Fiscal General del Estado investigar el caso, a fin de establecer a 
los responsables del hecho, y al Comandante General de Polic&#237;a solicit&#243; tomar las medidas 
necesarias para garantizar la seguridad y la integridad de la familia del Dr. Germ&#225;n Antonio 
Ram&#237;rez Herrera, as&#237; como de todo el personal y de la red de expertos independientes de 
PRIVA.  La Presidencia de la Corte se comprometi&#243; a vigilar el proceso investigativo a fin 
de garantizar su rapidez e imparcialidad, respetando la independencia judicial. 
</p>
<p>724. Por su parte, el 2 de agosto del a&#241;o en curso, la Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado report&#243; 
que a trav&#233;s del Fiscal de lo Penal de Quevedo la indagaci&#243;n previa se encuentra en etapa 
de investigaci&#243;n, en la cual se han receptado las declaraciones tanto de los funcionarios y 
los internos del Centro de Rehabilitaci&#243;n Social de Quevedo, como de los agentes de 
polic&#237;a y otras personas involucradas en la investigaci&#243;n.  El Fiscal de Quevedo se&#241;ala que 
ha solicitado al Programa de V&#237;ctimas y Testigos brindar protecci&#243;n a las hijas y la esposa 
del doctor Germ&#225;n Ram&#237;rez.  
</p>
<p>725. Adicionalmente, la Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado al ser de su competencia responde a 
las preguntas espec&#237;ficas planteadas por los titulares de los Procedimientos Especiales:  
</p>
<p>726. El Fiscal de Quevedo ratific&#243; que las denuncias sobre los hechos del asesinato de 
Germ&#225;n Ram&#237;rez corresponden a la realidad.  
</p>
<p>727. El Fiscal de Quevedo indic&#243; que en el expediente consta una denuncia presentada 
por la hija de la v&#237;ctima, se&#241;orita Tannia Carola Ram&#237;rez Pe&#241;afiel.- 
</p>
<p>728. El Fiscal de Quevedo se&#241;al&#243; que la investigaci&#243;n se encuentra en etapa de 
Indagaci&#243;n Previa, que al momento consta de diez cuerpos, y se han receptado las 
declaraciones de los funcionarios y los internos del Centro de Rehabilitaci&#243;n Social de 
Quevedo, como de los agentes de polic&#237;a y otras personas involucradas en dicha 
investigaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>729. El Fiscal inform&#243; que ha solicitado al Juzgado S&#233;ptimo de Garant&#237;as Penales de 
Quevedo la detenci&#243;n de algunos sospechosos de ser los autores materiales del delito con 
fines investigativos, a efectos de establecer las responsabilidades de los detenidos.-  
</p>
<p>730. Sobre la inclusi&#243;n de las dos hijas y la esposa del doctor Germ&#225;n Ram&#237;rez en el 
Programa de V&#237;ctimas y Testigos, las autoridades ecuatorianas certifican que la familia de 
la v&#237;ctima ha sido llevada a otra ciudad y se le est&#225; brindando alojamiento y alimentaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>731. Cabe aclarar que, en virtud de que el presente caso se encuentra apenas en la fase de 
investigaci&#243;n, no se han impuesto sanciones penales ni administrativas con relaci&#243;n al 
mismo. 
</p>
<p>732. Sobre las medidas adoptadas por el Estado para garantizar la protecci&#243;n del personal 
de PRIVA, la Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado informa que el Sistema Nacional de Protecci&#243;n y 
Asistencia a V&#237;ctimas y Testigos constituye un conjunto sistem&#225;tico de acciones </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

<p>interinstitucionales, encaminadas a dar asistencia y protecci&#243;n integral a las v&#237;ctimas, 
testigos y otros participantes en el proceso penal que han sufrido de manera directa o 
indirecta las afectaciones de acciones criminales.  Uno de los principios que rige el Sistema, 
el cual garantiza su imparcialidad, es la voluntariedad, principio que ha sido definido de 
acuerdo con el Art. 295 numeral 1 C&#243;digo Org&#225;nico de la Funci&#243;n Judicial, como: &#8220;La 
aceptaci&#243;n del ingreso y la decisi&#243;n y retiro del Sistema ser&#225; voluntaria&#8221;. En consecuencia, 
el Sistema inicia su actividad de protecci&#243;n previa denuncia y solicitud de las personas que 
necesitan dicha protecci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>733. La Jefatura Nacional de Protecci&#243;n y Asistencia tom&#243; contacto con el personal de la 
Fundaci&#243;n para la Rehabilitaci&#243;n de las V&#237;ctimas de la Violencia (PRIVA), a quienes se les 
inform&#243; del procedimiento a seguir para su ingreso y las medidas que el Sistema ejecuta en 
caso de ser acogidos.  Hasta la presente fecha los miembros de PRIVA no han presentado 
denuncia alguna ni han formalizado un requerimiento de ingreso al Sistema de Protecci&#243;n a 
V&#237;ctimas y Testigos. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>734. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno por la respuesta recibida.  Sin embargo, 
lamenta que, en el momento de finalizar este informe, no se hab&#237;a recibido respuesta a 27 
comunicaciones enviadas con anterioridad. El Relator Especial considera que el responder a 
las comunicaciones representa un elemento fundamental para la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados 
con el mandato es por ello que insta al Gobierno a que le proporcione una respuesta acerca 
de los casos mencionados.   
</p>
<p>735. El Relator Especial lamenta especialmente el asesinato Dr. Ram&#237;rez Herrera y toma 
nota de la informaci&#243;n proporcionada sobre el Programa de V&#237;ctimas y Testigos as&#237; como 
de las medidas adoptadas para proteger a su familia.   
</p>
<p>736. El 7 de octubre de 2010, el Relator Especial public&#243; un comunicado de prensa en el 
cual exhort&#243; al Gobierno ecuatoriano a garantizar el ejercicio del derecho a la libertad de 
expresi&#243;n y libertad de prensa. El martes 30 de septiembre, una secci&#243;n de las fuerzas 
policiales atac&#243; de manera violenta al Presidente Rafael Correa, a quien se le impidi&#243; salir 
del hospital, violando sus derechos fundamentales. Reiter&#243; la importancia de la libertad de 
prensa de conformidad con los principios de diversidad y pluralismo a fin de informar a la 
sociedad de manera objetiva, tomando en cuenta que, en este caso, una gran parte de las 
fuerzas policiales fueron movilizadas por sectores interesados, basados en supuesta 
desinformaci&#243;n relacionada con las nuevas propuestas de leyes relativas a condiciones 
laborales.

<p><b>  Egypt  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>737. On 14 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning Mr. <b>Ibrahim Mohamed MOUJAHID</b>, an Egyptian citizen, 18 years old, 
studying art in second year at the institute of art of Kwaisna, and living with his parents, in 
the village of Hanoun-Centre, Zafta, Muhafadhat Al Gharbiya. 
</p>
<p>738. According to information received, on 8 March 2010, Mr. Ibrahim Mohamed 
MOUJAHID was arrested by security agents of the institute of art of Kwaisna, while he 
was posting a student statement on the walls expressing support to the Al Aqsa Mosque in 
the city of Jerusalem. These security agents had reportedly no legal authority to arrest Mr. 
MOUJAHID, but they took him to their offices, where he was attached and violently 
beaten. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>100</b>  
</p>
<p>739. Later that day, Mr. MOUJAHID was handed over to police agents at the El Kwaisna 
Police station where agents reportedly insulted him, threatened him and violently beaten 
him before presenting him to the Court of El Kwaisna. The Prosecutor found no violation 
of criminal law and ordered his immediate release on the same day.  
</p>
<p>740. According to reports received, instead of being freed, on 11 March 2010 Mr. 
MOUJAHID was transferred to the premises of the intelligence services (Al Mabahit) of 
Beshbeen El Koum where an administrative detention order was issued against him with 
the charges of &#8220;belonging to a prohibited religious organization.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>741. On 12 March 2010, Mr. MOUJAHID was reportedly taken back again to the El 
Kwaisna police station, and then transferred the day after to the prison of Damenhour, 
where he remains detained as of today. 
</p>
<p>742. According to the information received, since the Prosecutor ordered his immediate 
release on 8 March 2010, Mr. MOUJAHID has not been presented before a magistrate to 
have his detention extended according to the law, and he has not been subject to any 
additional legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>743. Serious concern was therefore expressed with regard to the detention of Mr. Ibrahim 
Mohamed MOUJAHID. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>744. On 16 July 2010, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent on 14 June 2010 
as follows.  
</p>
<p>745.  The background to the altercation that took place on 10 March 2010 between 
Ibrahim Muhammad Mujahid, a second year student at the Arts Institute in Quwaisna, 
Manufiyah province, and Abdul Hamid Abdul Aziz Abdul Hamid, a policeman posted as a 
security guard at the gate of the Institute, at Manufiyah University, is that Mr. Abdul Hamid 
refused to allow Mr. Mujahid to enter the Institute. He did so in accordance with 
instructions from the administrative offices of the Institute that Mr. Mujahid should be 
denied entry unless accompanied by his guardian, in view of his repeated transgressions. 
</p>
<p>746. Following the altercation, Mr. Mujahid attacked and beat Mr. Abdul Hamid, causing 
injuries and bruises to his shoulders and chest and tearing his uniform. Quwaisna police 
station issued police report No. 3993/2010 in connection with the incident and transmitted 
it to the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which decided to release Mr. Mujahid on condition that he 
register his place of residence with the police. The allegations made in the petition, 
however, indicate that the student was arrested for posting flyers expressing solidarity with 
Al-Aqsa Mosque (posting flyers or sticking bills in any Egyptian educational institution is 
subject to administrative rules). 
</p>
<p>747. Mr. Mujahid was arrested on 12 March 2010 under another set of circumstances, in 
view of his previous repeated violations on the university campus and of the suspicions of 
the security forces about his activities at the Institute. The arrest was made under a warrant 
issued by the Minister of the Interior in accordance with article 3 of Act No. 162 of 1958 
and Presidential Decrees No. 2 and No. 4 of 1982. 
</p>
<p>748. Mr. Mujahid was released on 9 June 2010, when the detention period established 
under Egyptian law expired. His release coincided with the release by the Ministry of 
Interior of all detainees not suspected of involvement in terrorist offences or narcotics 
trafficking, pursuant to the amendments contained in the Act promulgated by the Egyptian 
People&#8217;s Assembly on 11 May 2010 renewing the state of emergency and limiting its 
applicability to the said offences. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>749. On 23 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the situation of Mr. <b>Ayman Salem</b>, Lieutenant Colonel at the 
Egyptian Military Forces, born in 1969, married with three children, who lives with his 
family in Hay Al Alf Maskan, Cairo.  
</p>
<p>750. According to the information received, since 3 December 2010, Mr. Ayman Ahmed 
Salem Mohamed had reportedly been publishing several online political opinions criticising 
the current regime in Egypt. It is also reported that he had been posting messages and 
comments in various forums, criticising the current regime and calling for non-violent civil 
disobedience.  
</p>
<p>751. It is further reported that fearing persecution from the Egyptian Security Services, 
Mr. Salem went into hiding for a few days. Soon afterwards, on 9 December 2010, Mr. 
Salem, his wife and daughters were allegedly arrested by agents of the Egyptian Security 
Services. It is reported that the security agents did not present an arrest warrant, nor did 
they inform Mr. Salem and his family of the reasons for their arrest.  
</p>
<p>752. Mr. Salem&#8217;s wife and children were immediately separated from him, following 
their arrest and were later released on 11 December 2010. Reportedly, Mr. Salem&#8217;s fate and 
whereabouts remain unknown since then. Mr. Salem&#8217;s family was unable to obtain 
information from either the Egyptian Military Intelligence or the Egyptian Military Forces 
who have reportedly denied Mr. Salem&#8217;s detention and refused to provide any information 
about his whereabouts or fate. On 15 December 2010, Mr. Salem&#8217;s family filed a complaint 
with the National Council for Human Rights (reportedly known as Egyptian National 
Human Rights Institution) and on 16 December, with the General Prosecutor in Cairo. It is 
reported that Mr. Salem&#8217;s family did not receive any response to either of these complaints.  
</p>
<p>753. Mindful of the fact that the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Salem allegedly remain 
unknown, concern was expressed about Mr. Salem&#8217;s physical and psychological integrity 
and that of his family. Further concern was expressed that both the arrest of Mr. Salem and 
his purported secret detention may be related to his recent activities of publishing political 
opinions on the Internet criticising the current regime in Egypt.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>754. On 1 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the <b>arrests, excessive use of force, killings, attacks against 
journalists, and disruptions in media coverage and access to the Internet in relation to 
the demonstrations which have been taking place across Egypt since 25 January 2011</b>.  
</p>
<p>755. According to the information received, since 25 January 2011, massive 
demonstrations have been taking place throughout the country calling for democratic 
reforms, challenging the limitations on their freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and 
association, and the right to participate in decision-making processes. In addition, the 
demonstrations would seem to have been fueled by social and economic grievances related 
to a lack of access to job opportunities and to an adequate standard of living exacerbated by 
the increasing cost of food and other basic commodities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>102</b>  
</p>
<p>756. In this context, excessive use of force by security officers against peaceful 
demonstrators has been reported, causing the death of many protestors, which according to 
some media reports may already have reached triple figures. There are also reports that 
some members of the security forces have been killed. 
</p>
<p>757. While there are many other similar cases, the following demonstrators have 
reportedly been killed between 25 and 29 January 2011: 
</p>
<p> 1. Mutapha Ragab, aged 21 
</p>
<p> 2. Sulaiman Saber, aged 35

</p>
<p> 19. Ali Ahmed Ali 
</p>
<p> 20. Abdelmajeed Abdelalim Abdelmajeed, aged 41  
</p>
<p>758. It has been reported that the above-mentioned persons were registered in Suez 
hospital as victims of gunshot wounds. They were allegedly shot during demonstrations by 
security officials who were using live ammunitions to halt peaceful demonstrations. It has 
been further reported that many of the demonstrators killed arriving at Suez hospital on 26 
January 2011, were not registered due to the intervention by security officials. As a 
consequence of the use of live ammunition, hundreds of others have reportedly been injured 
and many remain in a critical state.  
</p>
<p>759. Hundreds of peaceful demonstrators have also allegedly been arrested in an attempt 
to clamp down anti-government protests. It has been reported that some of those arrested 
have been taken to undisclosed locations, including those arrested at Suez hospital on 26 
January. These allegations are deeply worrying particularly in relation to the fate and 
whereabouts of those who have been arrested. Grave concerns have been expressed about 
the physical and psychological integrity of these individuals.  
</p>
<p>760. Information has also been received about major disruptions in communication 
networks and the transmission of news, which have prevented journalists and the public at </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>103 
</b></p>
<p>large to seek, receive and impart information concerning the events. Specifically, on 26 
January 2011, access to social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube 
were reportedly blocked. On 28 January 2011, at around 12:34 a.m., the country&#8217;s four 
primary Internet service providers (ISP) all stopped moving data in and out of the country. 
According to Internet traffic-monitoring software, Internet connection has been disabled 
with the exception of information transmitted via Noor Group, which allegedly hosts the 
Egyptian Stock Exchange. Similarly, mobile phone connections have been disrupted, as all 
mobile phone operators have reportedly been instructed to suspend services in selected 
areas. While it has been reported that mobile phone communications were partially restored 
on 29 January 2011, access to the Internet reportedly remains blocked, as at 1 February 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>761. On 30 January 2011, Mr. Anas el-Fekki, Minister of Information, ordered the 
relevant Government agencies to take immediate legal measures necessary to suspend the 
operations of Al-Jazeera, a Qatar-based satellite television channel, in Egypt. He also 
reportedly ordered the licenses of five live satellite transmission equipment and other 
means of communication provided to Al-Jazeera to be revoked, as well as the accreditation 
of its staff. As a result, Nilesat, a satellite transmission company owned by the Egyptian 
Radio and Television Union and other Government agencies, has stopped transmitting the 
signal of Al-Jazeera&#8217;s live news channel, which has been broadcasting live footage of the 
demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>762. In addition, journalists have allegedly been targeted by security forces while 
covering the demonstrations, including the following incidents. On 28 January 2011, Mr. 
<b>Asadallah al-Sawi</b>, correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation, was hit in the 
back of the head and has been taken to a hospital where he is currently recovering. Mr. 
<b>Ahmad Mansour</b>, a veteran Al-Jazeera journalist, was reportedly detained for over an hour 
in front of the Journalists&#8217; Syndicate in Cairo. Several journalists working with Al-Jazeera 
have reportedly been prevented from entering Egypt through Cairo International Airport. 
Four French journalists, working for Le Figaro, Journal du Dimanche, Sipa Photo Agency, 
and Paris Match, have allegedly been detained while covering demonstrations in Cairo. On 
28 January 2011, Mr. <b>Ben Wedemen</b>, senior international correspondent for the Cable 
News Network (CNN), and Ms. <b>Mary Rogers</b>, photojournalist working with Mr. 
Wedemen, were surrounded and attacked by plainclothes police who took their cameras. 
</p>
<p>763. In this context, concern was expressed that human rights organizations are not able 
to gather information on human rights violations that have been reported in relation to these 
demonstrations. Concern was also expressed at the potential escalation of violence as well 
as at the subsequent increase in the number of victims and arrests. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>764. On 4 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the <b>worsening of the situation of 
human rights defenders and journalists in Egypt</b>, in relation to the demonstrations 
which have been taking place across the country since 25 January 2011. 
</p>
<p>765. According to the information received, on 1 February 2011, Mr. <b>Malak Adly</b>, a 
lawyer from the Hisham Mubarak Law Center (HMLC) which has been providing legal 
assistance to protestors arrested in demonstrations, was arrested by security forces and his 
whereabouts remain unknown as of today.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>104</b>  
</p>
<p>766. On 3 February, the offices of the HMLC and the Egyptian Center for Economic and 
Social Rights, which has been supporting an impromptu medical center in a mosque near 
Tahrir Square to treat those injured in the protests, were raided by military police, 
accompanied by unidentified men in civilian clothes. They searched both offices, and 
confiscated the equipment and the mobile phones of several staff. More than 30 persons 
working for both centers, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, were reportedly 
arrested, beaten, and taken to an undisclosed location. 
</p>
<p>767. Those arrested include: 
</p>
<p> 1. Mr. <b>Ahmed Seif El Islam</b>, former Director of HMLC; 
</p>
<p> 2. Mr. <b>Mohsen Beshir</b>, HMLC lawyer; 
</p>
<p> 3. Mr. <b>Mostafa Al Hassan</b>, HMLC lawyer; 
</p>
<p> 4. Ms. <b>Mouna Al Masry</b>, HMLC researcher; 
</p>
<p> 5. Mr. <b>Al Sayed Feky</b>, HMLC lawyer; 
</p>
<p> 6. Mr. <b>Mohamed El Taher</b>, HMLC staff member; 
</p>
<p> 7. Ms. <b>Fatma Abed</b>, Front to Defend Egypt Protestors (FDEP) volunteer;

<p> 8. Ms. <b>Shahdan Abou Shad</b>, FDEP volunteer; 
</p>
<p> 9. Ms. <b>Nadine Abu Shadi</b>, FDEP volunteer; 
</p>
<p> 10. Ms. <b>Nadia Hashem</b>, FDEP volunteer; 
</p>
<p> 11. Mr. <b>Ahmed Hamdy Mahmoud</b>, student from Assiut University; 
</p>
<p> 12. Mr. <b>Said Haddadi</b>, Amnesty International; 
</p>
<p> 13. Another Amnesty International staff member whose identity is known to the 
 mandate-holders; 
</p>
<p> 14. Mr. <b>Daniel Williams</b>, Human Rights Watch; 
</p>
<p> 15. Ms. <b>Sofia Amara</b>, French citizen working for Magneto Press; and 
</p>
<p> 16. Mr. <b>Pedro da Foneska</b>, Portuguese Citizen working for Magneto Press. 
</p>
<p>768. In connection to these arrests, it is further reported that the offices of the HMLC 
were surrounded by supporters of the current Government, threatening with weapon the 
people inside the Center&#8217;s premises. After the aforementioned persons were arrested, thugs 
reportedly destroyed the premises of HMLC, including document and case files which will 
impact on the lives of victims defended by the Center. 
</p>
<p>769. On the same day, in the evening, Mr. <b>Amr Salah</b>, researcher at the Cairo Institute 
for Human Rights Studies, was arrested along with activists Ms. <b>Shadi Al Ghazali Harb</b>, 
Mr. <b>Nasser Abdel Hamid</b>, Mr. <b>Mohamed Arafat</b>, Mr. <b>Ahmed Douma</b>, Mr. <b>Amr Ezz</b>, 
and Mr. <b>Ahmed</b> (surname unknown) in El Haram area, Giza, Cairo. They are reportedly 
being detained in El-Haram police station. 
</p>
<p>770. In addition, some unidentified men in civilian clothes entered the Nadim Center for 
Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, which provides legal assistance to victims of torture, 
and threatened the personnel of the organisation. 
</p>
<p>771. Furthermore, security forces and unidentified men in civilian clothes have continued 
to harass national and international journalists covering the protests, searching their hotel 
rooms, and confiscating their equipment. Mr. <b>Rajesh Bhardwaj</b>, a journalist for CNN-
IBN, was reportedly arrested by security forces, before been released some hours later. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>105 
</b></p>
<p>772. Serious concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of the aforementioned 
persons, and other acts of harassment faced by human rights defenders and journalists, may 
be related to their legitimate human rights activities in the context of the ongoing 
demonstrations across the country. Further concern was expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of the human rights defenders detained, and more generally, for 
defenders and journalists currently working in Egypt.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations   
</b></p>
<p>773. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 1 April 2011 and to 
earlier communications sent on 14 February 2011, 1 February 2011, 23 December 2010, 20 
February 2009, 21 August 2008, and 3 April 2008. He urges the Government to respond to 
the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations 
undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>774. As expressed in his press statement on World Press Freedom Day of 2011, the 
Special Rapporteur commends and stands in solidarity with courageous individuals, 
including journalists, bloggers, and activists, who have risen above fear to express their 
legitimate grievances and to demand reforms, democracy and transparency, using at great 
risk their freedom of expression and new information communication technologies.9  
</p>
<p>775. In the context of political reforms in Egypt, the Special Rapporteur encourages the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right to peaceful assembly of all 
individuals to be fully guaranteed, and to ensure that there are effective investigations and 
prosecution of persons responsible for the killings of protesters as referred to in his 
communications.   
</p>
<p><b>  Fiji 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>776. On 15 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations concerning  the 
continued and increasing restrictions to the right to freedom of expression and freedom of 
the press in the Republic of Fiji Islands, in particular the <b>recent adoption of the Media 
Industry Development Decree 2001 </b>(Decree No.29 of 2010, hereinafter &#8220;the decree&#8221;). 
The Special Rapporteur had addressed concerns regarding violations of the right to freedom 
of expression in the Republic of the Fiji Islands to the Government through 11 
communications since 2007, and expressed regret that no reply has been received from the 
Government to any of these communications.  
</p>
<p>777. According to the new information received, on 28 June 2010, Attorney General Mr. 
Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyun reportedly announced that the decree, drafted in April 2010, is now 
in effect. The Special Rapporteur raised several concerns with regard to the compatibility of 
this decree with the obligations of the Government under international human rights law, in 
particular article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).  
</p>
<p>778. First, the decree stipulates that the media cannot publish material which threatens 
public interest or order, is against the national interest, or creates communal discord (article 
22). Any media organization that breaches this provision is punished by a fine of up to 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>May 2011, 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10975&amp;LangID=E.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>106</b>  
</p>
<p>100,000 Fijian dollars (approximately 53,000 USD) and/or imprisonment of up to two years 
(article 24). The Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the decree does not define what 
kinds of material fall under these categories, in violation of the principle that any law that 
restricts the right to freedom of expression must be clear, drawn narrowly and with 
precision so as to enable individuals to foresee whether a particular action is unlawful. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteur noted the principle enunciated, inter alia, by the Human 
Rights Council in its Resolution 12/16, which called upon all States to refrain from the use 
of imprisonment or the imposition of fines for offences relating to the media, which are 
disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and which violate international human rights 
law. 
</p>
<p>779. Second, the decree establishes a new regulatory body, the Fiji Media Industry 
Development Authority (hereinafter &#8220;the Authority&#8221;), which will have wide powers of 
investigation over journalists and media outlets, including powers of search and seizure 
(article 27(2)), and to refer any complaint received to the Media Tribunal. The Media 
Tribunal is mandated to enforce the decree. As the members of the Authority are to be 
appointed by the Minister of Information, National Archives and National Library Services, 
and the Chairperson of the Media Tribunal is to be appointed by the President, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concern that the decree may be used as an instrument to censor 
publications that are critical of the Government.  
</p>
<p>780. Third, article 38(1) of the decree restricts foreign ownership by stipulating that 90 
percent of shareholders of any media organization must be citizens of the Republic of Fiji 
Islands permanently residing in the country, and companies are only given three months to 
comply. Such a requirement is likely to result in the closure of the Fiji Times, which has 
come under increasing pressure in the past few years, due to critical reporting of the 
military and the Government. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur drew the attention of 
the Government to the letter sent on 18 May 2008.  
</p>
<p>781. Fourth, according to article 26 of the decree, journalists will be forced to reveal their 
sources to the Authority, in contravention of the principle that journalists should not be 
forced to reveal confidential sources, as enunciated inter alia in the Johannesburg Principles 
on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (as endorsed in 
E/CN.4/1996/39 of 1996).  
</p>
<p>782. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern that the adoption of the decree, in a 
context where the right to freedom of expression has already been undermined by the 
Public Emergency Regulations of April 2009, will further exacerbate the situation of the 
right to freedom of expression in the Republic of Fiji Islands. The Special Rapporteur 
reminded the Government of its the obligations under article 19 of the UDHR, which 
provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice&#8221;. In addition, he reiterated the principle enunciated in Human Rights 
Council Resolution 12/16, which calls on States, while noting that the exercise of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities, to 
refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with paragraph 3 of that article, 
including on (i) discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human 
rights, government activities and corruption in government; engaging in election 
campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or 
democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief, including by persons 
belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>783. On 3 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the <b>pattern of arrests, arbitrary detentions, torture and ill-
treatment of politicians, trade unionists, and other Fijians</b> in an attempt to prevent plans 
for a peaceful demonstration scheduled to take place in Fiji&#8217;s capital, Suva, on 4 March 
2011.  
</p>
<p>784. According to the information received, on 27 January 2011, at about 7:00 p.m., Mr. 
<b>Benjamin Padarath</b>, a businessman and a former politician in Fiji, was arrested by four 
members of the Fiji military in civilian clothes who arrived in a Toyota Hilux four-wheel 
drive at Mr. Padarath&#8217;s home and informed his wife that the Prime Minister wanted to see 
him. Mr Paradath drove to the government buildings and then was taken in a car, escorted 
by four military officers, to the Queen Elizabeth Barracks (QEB) in Delainabua. It is 
reported that as soon as the vehicle moved the two men who were sitting in the backseat 
with Mr. Padarath started punching him in the face and slapping and hitting his upper 
thighs. Mr. Padarath was reportedly beaten with steel helmets and rifle butts. Upon arrival 
at the QEB, he was locked in a cell having all his clothes except his underwear taken off. 
Later that night, Mr. Padarath was reportedly removed from the cell, severely beaten and 
assaulted by military officers and dragged back to his cell. Major Ben Naliva was reported 
to have been identified as one of the officers involved in the assault. It is reported that Mr. 
Padarath sustained serious injuries: his mouth, nose and ears had been bleeding, his face 
was swollen, his body was bruised all over and he was unable to walk. Only when the 
doctor at the military hospital told the soldiers escorting Mr. Padarath that he might die in 
custody did they carry him to the bus stop near the QEB military hospital, where he was put 
on a bench and later collected by his wife. We have been told that Mr. Padarath had been 
suffering from severe pain, was scared and refused to go out from his home.  
</p>
<p>785. It is further reported that on 10 February 2011, at about 8:30 p.m., Mr. Padarath was 
again taken to the QEB barracks by military officers, where he was stripped of his clothes, 
blindfolded and beaten. It is reported that Mr. Padarath was sexually assaulted, had hot 
water poured over him and was burned with cigarette butts. Allegedly, a draft decree 
authorizing the ousting of the Prime Minister was said to have been found in his house. 
Reportedly, Mr. Padarath was given a statement to sign without being able to read it. He 
was then threatened to be killed and his family murdered had he reported this incident. Mr. 
Padarath was reported to have been taken to the Colonial War Memorial hospital when the 
interrogator at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) headquarters in Toorak 
realized that he was bleeding from the burn scalds and sustained injuries. It is further 
reported that from 11 to 23 February 2011, everyday, including on weekends, Mr. Padarath 
was picked up by the military officers at 8:00 a.m. at the hospital, taken into police custody 
at the CID headquarters and interrogated the entire day before being returned to the hospital 
at 11:00 p.m. It is also reported that Mr. Padarath was released from the hospital upon his 
own request since the CID officers had reportedly told him that they would not spend too 
long questioning him, and if he did not cooperate with them, he would face longer 
imprisonment. On 23 February 2011, Mr. Padarath appeared before the Suva Magistrates 
Court and released on bail after the magistrate saw the extent of his injuries. He had 
reportedly been placed in a wheelchair and was covered in bandages. The court hearing has 
reportedly been rescheduled for 4 April 2011. We have been told that Mr. Padarath suffers 
from nightmares and has difficulties sleeping. He has not recovered from sustained injuries, 
is in a state of severe depression and fears repeated detention and torture.  
</p>
<p>786. According to the new information received, Mr. Padarath has allegedly been charged 
with concealing a document with the intent of obtaining a financial gain from another </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>108</b>  
</p>
<p>person, causing loss to the Government of Fiji. It is also reported that the questioning upon 
his detention implied allegations of a political nature, including allegations of overthrowing 
the Prime Minister and the Attorney General.  
</p>
<p>787. It is also further reported that on 28 January 2011, Suva lawyer Ms. <b>Renee Lal</b> was 
detained by the military for a few hours during which she was reportedly physically 
assaulted by a military officer. Ms. Renee Lal was reported to have had suffered head 
injuries as a result of the assault during her detention.  
</p>
<p>788. Additionally, on 18 February 2011, Mr. <b>Felix Anthony</b>; Mr. <b>Maika Namudu</b>; Mr. 
<b>Anil Kumar</b>, the Vice President of Ba branch of General Workers Union; Mr. <b>Mohammad 
Khalil</b>, the President of Fiji Sugar; and Mr. <b>Anand Singh</b> were allegedly arbitrarily 
detained by Fijian military officers, taken to a private residence and subjected to severe 
beatings and other forms of torture and ill-treatment during interrogations before being 
released later the same day. It is reported that the detention of the above mentioned 
individuals was linked to publishing an article in the national newspaper Fiji Times on 
matters pertaining to the Fiji Sugar Corporation, Air Pacific and Fiji Sun, in which the State 
is reportedly a major stakeholder. It is further reported that workers at the Lautoka Sugar 
Mill have been told by the Commissioner Western Division Commander Joeli Cawaki that 
if they got involved with the trade unions, they will have to deal with the military.  
</p>
<p>789. Reportedly, on 10 February 2011, Mr. <b>Poseci Bune </b>and Mr. <b>Anand Kumar Singh</b>, 
Fiji Labour Party officials, were also detained at the military barracks in Suva. It is reported 
that Mr. Anand Kumar Singh was repeatedly moved between different buildings, physically 
assaulted and subjected to long interrogations. He was reportedly denied access to a lawyer 
or his family members.  
</p>
<p>790. It is further reported that on 25 February 2011, Mr. <b>Samisoni Speight Tikoinasau</b>, a 
Fijian politician, was detained from the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) party 
office in Lautoka for his alleged involvement in organizing the protest planned for 4 March 
2011, as well as for distributing DVDs about human rights violations in Fiji. While 
detained in an unknown location, he claimed to have been subjected to torture and ill-
treatment. His fate and whereabouts were unknown until after three days when he was 
released and fled to Australia to receive urgent medical treatment from the injuries 
sustained while in detention.  
</p>
<p>791. Furthermore, on 26 February 2011, seven young men aged between 18 and 21, from 
the outskirts of Suva, who are said to have been discussing plans for a peaceful 
demonstration on 4 March 2011, to call on the head of the Government to step down, were 
reportedly detained, physically and sexually assaulted and ridiculed by around 20 soldiers 
at the QEB. It is also reported that human rights activists and the family members of these 
young men were beaten and threatened by soldiers in the army camp when they went to 
enquire about them. These young men did not want to be named for fear of reprisals from 
the authorities. They were threatened to be killed if they spoke to anyone about their 
treatment at the camp.  
</p>
<p>792. Serious concern was been expressed about an imminent risk of more people being 
arrested and subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment by the military in relation 
to the planned demonstration of 4 March 2011. Further concern is expressed about the fears 
for the safety of the above mentioned individuals. Finally, a serious concern was expressed 
that no military officers have been officially investigated or charged in relation to these 
allegations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>793. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communications sent during the reporting </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>109 
</b></p>
<p>period. Further, he regrets that the Government has responded to only two out of 13 
communications sent since 2007, including one reply which merely informed the Special 
Rapporteur that the communication has been transmitted to relevant authorities. He urges 
the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>794. In addition, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding the continued 
and increasing restrictions to the right to freedom of expression in Fiji, particularly given 
the adoption of the Media Industry Decree (Decree No.29 of 2010), as outlined in his 
communication of 15 July 2010. He urges the Government to promote a climate of 
tolerance of diverse views, including those that are critical of public officials and the 
powerful, and to take measures to promote press freedom.

encontraban reunidas en la comunidad de San Antonio de las Trojes I, insult&#225;ndolos y 
lanzando piedras contra las casas, antes de que se cortara el servicio de electricidad.  
Aprovechando el corte de luz, los trabajadores de la mencionada empresa cementera 
habr&#237;an llevado a cabo varios destrozos y se habr&#237;an producido disparos. 
</p>
<p>797. En este contexto, los trabajadores de la empresa Cementos Progreso S.A. habr&#237;an 
proferido amenazas de muerte contra los Sres. Alberto Diaz Zet, Cornelio Subuyuj Camey, 
Juan Marcelo Coztojay Tubac, L&#225;zaro Raxon Cotzojay y Gregorio Cotzajay Tubac. El Sr. 
Cornelio Subuyuj Camey habr&#237;a sido apuntado con un arma de fuego mientras se le 
amenazaba con eliminarlo f&#237;sicamente.   
</p>
<p>798. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, varios trabajadores de la empresa Cementos Progreso 
S.A. se habr&#237;an asimismo presentado en la casa del Sr. Gregorio Cotzajay Tubac y, al no 
encontrarlo, habr&#237;an amenazado a su familia y les habr&#237;an advertido que quemar&#237;an su casa.   
</p>
<p>799. En el contexto de estos sucesos, varias personas de la comunidad de San Antonio 
Las Trojes habr&#237;an resultaron heridas, algunas de gravedad.   
</p>
<p>800. Esta no ser&#237;a la primera vez que se producen actos de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas 
contra l&#237;deres de esta comunidad.  Recientemente, el d&#237;a 2 de junio de 2010, un autob&#250;s que 
viajaba hacia la comunidad con miembros de la misma involucrados en la reparaci&#243;n de 
una carretera de la zona habr&#237;a sido detenido por trabajadores de la empresa Cementos 
Progreso S.A. Los trabajadores de la empresa habr&#237;an hecho descender del autob&#250;s a sus 
ocupantes, les habr&#237;an amenazado y agredido f&#237;sicamente.   </p>

<p>801. Asimismo, se recuerda que el 11 de febrero de 2010, el cuerpo del Sr. Germ&#225;n 
Antonio Curup, fue encontrado en el municipio de B&#225;rcenas.  El cad&#225;ver habr&#237;a sido 
degollado y se habr&#237;a encontrado con indicios de tortura.  El Sr. Curup habr&#237;a sido 
secuestrado con un colega de trabajo no identificado.  Germ&#225;n Antonio Curup era hijo del 
Sr. Abelino Curup, un l&#237;der comunitario de la regi&#243;n de San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez. Un 
llamamiento urgente ha sido enviado el 5 de marzo de 2010 sobre esa situaci&#243;n, por el 
Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y 
de expresi&#243;n y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos.  Hasta la fecha, no hemos recibido ninguna respuesta de parte del Gobierno de su 
Excelencia. 
</p>
<p>802. En este contexto, se temi&#243; que las amenazas de muerte contra los Sres. Alberto Diaz 
Zet, Cornelio Subuyuj Camey, Juan Marcelo Coztojay Tubac, L&#225;zaro Raxon Cotzojay y 
Gregorio Cotzajay Tubac est&#233;n relacionadas con las actividades que realizan en defensa de 
los derechos de su comunidad, en particular en contra del proyecto de instalaci&#243;n de una 
planta de cementos por la empresa Cementos Progreso S.A. Estas amenazas y agresiones, 
algunas de ellas muy graves, se enmarcar&#237;an en un clima de gran vulnerabilidad para los 
defensores de los derechos humanos en Guatemala.  
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>803. El 13 de diciembre de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre 
la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la integridad 
f&#237;sica y mental del Sr. <b>Mateo Bernab&#233; L&#243;pez P&#233;rez</b>, Secretario General del Sindicato de 
Trabajadores de Salud de Malacat&#225;n, miembro del Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la 
Salud de Guatemala (SNTSG) y tambi&#233;n del Frente Nacional de Lucha (FNL). El Sr. L&#243;pez 
P&#233;rez trabaja en la defensa del derecho de la poblaci&#243;n al acceso a servicios p&#250;blicos de 
calidad y a costos accesibles en el municipio de Catarina, Departamento de San Marcos.  
</p>
<p>804. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, en la madrugada del d&#237;a 28 de octubre de 2010, 
dos hombres en un ciclomotor habr&#237;an realizado varios disparos contra el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez 
cuando &#233;ste se dirig&#237;a a tomar el transporte p&#250;blico en el municipio de Catarina, San 
Marcos, hacia la Ciudad Guatemala. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez iba 
a participar en la asamblea general ordinaria del SNTSG durante la cual se iban a tratar 
asuntos propios del sindicato, entre ellos, la situaci&#243;n del jefe del &#225;rea de salud de San 
Marcos. El SNTSG habr&#237;a solicitado la destituci&#243;n del jefe del &#225;rea de salud por su presunta 
conexi&#243;n con casos de corrupci&#243;n y despidos injustificados.  
</p>
<p>805. Como resultado del ataque, el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez, habr&#237;a sido recibido cinco impactos 
de bala que no habr&#237;an afectado ning&#250;n &#243;rgano vital. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, tras los 
primeros disparos, los atacantes habr&#237;an dado la vuelta con la intenci&#243;n de rematar al Sr. 
L&#243;pez P&#233;rez, pero habr&#237;an decidido darse a la fuga disuadidos por el hecho que los vecinos 
comenzaron a encender las luces de sus casas y a hacer ruido.  
</p>
<p>806. Seg&#250;n las mismas informaciones, el ataque habr&#237;a sido denunciado ante la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional Civil (PNC), la cual habr&#237;a iniciado las primeras investigaciones y remitido el 
informe policial a la Fiscal&#237;a del Ministerio P&#250;blico para que esta instituci&#243;n inicie la 
investigaci&#243;n penal. La PNC habr&#237;a puesto a disposici&#243;n del Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez y de su familia 
dos oficiales con el fin de garantizar su protecci&#243;n. Asimismo, la Unidad de Derechos 
Humanos de la Divisi&#243;n Especial de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal (DEIC) tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a 
realizado una investigaci&#243;n detallada. 
</p>
<p>807. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, a principios del a&#241;o 2010, el Sr. L&#243;pez P&#233;rez habr&#237;a 
denunciado varios casos de corrupci&#243;n en los que habr&#237;a estado presuntamente implicado el 
Director del hospital de Malacat&#225;n. Asimismo, su trabajo en defensa del acceso de la </p>

Frente de Resistencia de los Abusos de DEOCSA de Malacat&#225;n (FRENA). El FRENA 
estar&#237;a llevando a cabo actividades de oposici&#243;n y resistencia a las operaciones de la 
&#8220;Distribuidora de Electricidad de Occidente SA&#8221; en la zona, la cual pertenece a la empresa 
transnacional espa&#241;ola Uni&#243;n Fenosa. En este contexto, el 20 de octubre de 2010, el Sr. 
L&#243;pez P&#233;rez habr&#237;a participado en la conmemoraci&#243;n del asesinato del Sr. V&#237;ctor G&#225;lvez, 
miembro del FRENA. 
</p>
<p>808. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Sr. L&#243;pez 
P&#233;rez y por las alegaciones de que el ataque contra su vida pudiera estar relacionado con 
sus actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular en 
defensa del derecho de la poblaci&#243;n al acceso a servicios p&#250;blicos de calidad y a costos 
accesibles. Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de creciente 
violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>809. Mediante carta fechada el 23 de diciembre de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; al 
llamamiento urgente con fecha de 13 de diciembre de 2010. 
</p>
<p>810. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n proporcionada por la Oficina Regional de la 
Comisi&#243;n Presidencial Coordinadora de la Pol&#237;tica del Ejecutivo en Materia de Derechos 
Humanos, con sede en el departamento de San Marcos, la situaci&#243;n del se&#241;or Mateo L&#243;pez 
es la siguiente: 
</p>
<p> 1. El 5 de noviembre de 2010, la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil recibi&#243; una llamada 
donde les indicaban que en la calzada la Democracia hab&#237;a sido herida una persona con 
arma de fuego, realizando un patrullaje sin localizar a ninguna persona; minutos despu&#233;s se 
present&#243; el se&#241;or Santiago Apollnarlo, padre del se&#241;or Mateo Bernab&#233; L&#243;pez, quien narr&#243; 
lo sucedido a su hijo, 
</p>
<p> 2. Se coordin&#243; con la Polic&#237;a Nacional Civil seguridad personal en el Sanatorio 
donde se encuentra internado el se&#241;or Mateo L&#243;pez, con el objeto de resguardar su vida e 
integridad f&#237;sica. 
</p>
<p>811. Este Comisi&#243;n Presidencial inform&#243; que nadie hab&#237;a presentado una queja ni por 
parte de la supuesta v&#237;ctima o en su nombre. Sin embargo, como los agentes de la polic&#237;a 
Nacional Civil tuvieron conocimiento la noticia de un hecho punible perseguible por ley 
informar&#225;n al Ministerio P&#250;blico para que inicie con las investigaciones del caso de 
conformidad con el C&#243;digo Procesal Penal decreto 51-92, articulo 504. 
</p>
<p>812. El Estado de Guatemala informa que el caso se encuentra en fase de investigaci&#243;n 
por parte del Ministerio P&#250;blico para esclarecer los hechos denunciados. 
</p>
<p>813. El Estado de Guatemala informa que el juzgado de Paz de la localidad traslad&#243; el 
expediente a la Fiscal&#237;a Distrital del Ministerio P&#250;blico con sede en Malacat&#225;n, 
departamento de San Marcos con el objeto de que se inicien las investigaciones respectivas 
para dar con los presuntos responsables del atentado en contra del se&#241;or L&#243;pez.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>814. El Relator Especial agradece las respuestas transmitidas por parte del Gobierno de 
Guatemala. No obstante, el Relator Especial lamenta que, en el momento de finalizaci&#243;n 
del presente informe, no hab&#237;a recibido respuestas a 26 comunicaciones. El Relator 
Especial considera que el responder a las comunicaciones representa un elemento 
fundamental para la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados con el mandato, es por ello que insta al 
gobierno de Guatemala a que le proporcione una respuesta tratando los asuntos 
mencionados. </p>

<p><b>  Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>815. El 20 de abril de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron una carta de alegaciones en 
relaci&#243;n con el <b>Sr. Jos&#233; Bayardo Mairena Ram&#237;rez, el Sr. Manuel Ju&#225;rez, el Sr. Nahun 
Palacios Arteaga, el Sr. David Meza y el Sr. Joseph Hernandez</b>. El Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez 
y el Sr. Ju&#225;rez eran periodistas en el programa &#8220;As&#237; es Olancho&#8221;, que transmite en Canal 4, 
una televisora de Televisi&#243;n R.Z., y asimismo trabajaban con Radio Exc&#233;lsior, una emisora 
hondure&#241;a. El Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez tambi&#233;n era director del Radio Exc&#233;lsior, integrante de 
la Asociaci&#243;n de la Prensa Hondure&#241;a, y estudiante del periodismo al Centro Universitario 
Regional Nor-Oriental en Juticalpa. El Sr. Palacios Arteaga era director de noticias de la 
televisora Canal 5 del Agu&#225;n.  
</p>
<p>816.  Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 26 de marzo de 2010, el <b>Sr. Mairena 
Ram&#237;rez y el Sr. Ju&#225;rez</b> habr&#237;an sido asesinados. Los dos periodistas habr&#237;an estado 
viajando en un coche por una carretera proveniente de la ciudad de Catacamas. Cerca de la 
ciudad de Juticalpa en el departamento de Olancho, aproximadamente a las 9.30 horas de la 
ma&#241;ana, otro veh&#237;culo les habr&#237;a acercado mientras su coche estaba en movimiento y 
hombres no identificados habr&#237;an disparado el Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez y el Sr. Ju&#225;rez con 
varias r&#225;fagas de tiros de ametralladora. Despu&#233;s, los agresores se habr&#237;an detenido y se 
habr&#237;an bajado de su veh&#237;culo para disparar m&#225;s tiros y asegurar que los dos periodistas 
estaban muertos. Se inform&#243; que el coche del Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez ten&#237;a 21 agujeros de 
bala despu&#233;s del ataque. El Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez habr&#237;a resultado muerto en la escena. El 
Sr. Ju&#225;rez habr&#237;a sido traslado al Hospital San Francisco en Juticalpa pero habr&#237;a muerto un 
poco despu&#233;s. Se inform&#243; que el Sr. Mairena Ram&#237;rez recientemente habr&#237;a estado 
investigando los conflictos territoriales y el crimen organizado en Honduras. 
</p>
<p>817.  Durante la noche del 14 de marzo, el <b>Sr. Palacios Arteaga</b> habr&#237;a sido asesinado 
mientras viajaba en coche hasta su casa, ubicada en el barrio de Los Pinos, en la ciudad de 
Tocoa, departamento de Col&#243;n. Personas no identificados le habr&#237;an disparado con fusiles 
autom&#225;ticos AK-47, y el Sr. Palacio Arteaga habr&#237;a sufrido por los menos de 30 impactos 
de bala. Se inform&#243; que el coche en que viajaba habr&#237;a recibido 42 impactos de bala, y que 
dos personas que estaban con &#233;l en el coche resultaban heridas.  
</p>
<p>818.  El Sr. Palacios Arteaga habr&#237;a sufrido varios actos de acoso durante meses recientes 
debido a su cr&#237;tica p&#250;blica al golpe de Estado de 2009, y su cobertura de las 
manifestaciones organizadas por la resistencia al mismo. El 30 de junio de 2009, equipos de 
trabajo del Canal 5 habr&#237;an sido confiscados durante un allanamiento militar en que agentes 
militares habr&#237;an allanado su casa, decomisado su coche, y amenazado a sus hijos con 
armas de fuego. El 24 de julio, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos orden&#243; 
la implementaci&#243;n de medidas cautelares de protecci&#243;n para el Sr. Palacios Arteaga a fin de 
asegurar su vida e integridad f&#237;sica. Sin embargo, estas medidas nunca habr&#237;a sido 
implementadas por las autoridades hondure&#241;as.  
</p>
<p>819.  Durante las &#250;ltimas semanas, el Sr. Palacios Arteaga habr&#237;a investigado el conflicto 
agrario que est&#225; tomando lugar en la regi&#243;n de Agu&#225;n entre el Movimiento Campesino 
Unificado (MUCA) y empresarios. Asimismo, recientemente habr&#237;a informado sobre un 
operativo militar en el que 18 personas habr&#237;an sido detenidas y varias armas de fuego 
habr&#237;an sido decomisadas. Con posterioridad a ello, el mismo habr&#237;a recibido nuevas 
amenazas de muerte.  
</p>
<p>820.  Estos asesinatos habr&#237;an ocurrido en el marco de una situaci&#243;n de gran 
vulnerabilidad de los periodistas en Honduras. Se informa que por lo menos cinco </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>113 
</b></p>
<p>periodistas ya habr&#237;an sido asesinados en Honduras en los primeros tres meses de 2010. Por 
ejemplo, el 1 de marzo, el Sr. Joseph Hern&#225;ndez Ocho habr&#237;a sido asesinado en la ciudad de 
Tegucigalpa, la se&#241;ora Karol Cabrera habr&#237;a resultado herida a consecuencia de un atentado 
contra su persona. El 11 de marzo de 2010, el <b>Sr. David Meza Montesinos</b>, periodista de 
&#8220;Radio El Patio&#8221; habr&#237;a sido asesinado en horas de la tarde en La Ceiba, a unos 300 metros 
de su domicilio.  
</p>
<p>821.  Hasta la fecha ninguna informaci&#243;n habr&#237;a sido hecha disponible en relaci&#243;n con las 
investigaciones de estas asesinatos ni sobre las medidas cautelares solicitadas a fin de 
proteger a otros periodistas y defensores de Derechos Humanos en riesgo.   
</p>
<p>822.  Se expres&#243; temor porque los asesinatos del Sr. Jos&#233; Bayardo Mairena Ram&#237;rez, el 
Sr. Manuel Ju&#225;rez y el Sr. Nahun Palacios Arteaga pudieran estar relacionados con las 
actividades que ellos realizaban en defensa de los Derechos Humanos en Honduras, en 
particular desde el golpe de Estado de 2009. En vista de las informaciones aqu&#237; resumidas, 
se expres&#243; profunda preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los periodistas y 
los defensores de los Derechos Humanos en Honduras. Aunque la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana 
de Derechos Humanos ha ordenado varias medidas cautelares para asegurar la seguridad de 
periodistas en peligro, amenazas y ataques en contra de sus vidas e integridad siguen 
produci&#233;ndose. 
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>823.  El 21 de mayo de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y la Relatora Especial sobre la 
independencia de magistrados y abogados, enviaron un llamamiento urgente haciendo 
referencia a su comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 16 de noviembre de 2009 en la que expresaron su 
preocupaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con los <b>actos de hostigamiento e intimidaci&#243;n en contra de 
magistrados, defensores p&#250;blicos y dem&#225;s auxiliares de justicia</b>. En particular, se 
expresaba preocupaci&#243;n sobre el hecho que la Corte Suprema de Justicia de Honduras 
habr&#237;a ordenado procesos disciplinarios, traslados forzosos, y otras acciones que se 
considera de intimidaci&#243;n y hostigamiento contra varios jueces y funcionarios que se 
habr&#237;an manifestado, de distintas formas legales, contra la destituci&#243;n del ex presidente 
Manuel Zelaya.  
</p>
<p>824.  En la misma comunicaci&#243;n se solicitaban algunas clarificaciones con respecto a los 
mecanismos para garantizar los principios de estabilidad e inamovilidad de los jueces y la 
manera en la cual se asegura en Honduras que en el curso de los procesos disciplinarios en 
contra de los jueces se respeten las garant&#237;as m&#237;nimas del derecho a un proceso justo.  
</p>
<p>825.  A la fecha, no hab&#237;a recibido respuesta a la mencionada comunicaci&#243;n. Por ello, los 
Relatores Especiales quisieron reiterar su preocupaci&#243;n respecto a nueva informaci&#243;n 
recibida. Seg&#250;n la misma, el pasado 5 de mayo, el pleno de la Corte Suprema de Justicia 
habr&#237;a conocido de los expedientes de remoci&#243;n de cinco funcionarios que fueron -entre 
otros- objeto de nuestro llamamiento urgente de fecha 16 de noviembre de 2009, es decir: 
<b>Luis Alfonso Chavez de la Roca</b>, Juez contra la violencia dom&#233;stica en San Pedro Sula; 
<b>Ram&#243;n Enrique Barrios</b>, Juez de Sentencia en San Pedro Sula; <b>Guillermo L&#243;pez Lone</b>, 
Juez de Sentencia de San Pedro Sula; <b>Osman Fajardo Morel</b>, Defensor P&#250;blico de San 
Pedro Sula; y <b>Tirza Flores Lanza,</b> Magistrada de la Corte de Apelaciones Penal de San 
Pedro Sula. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n recibida, la Corte Suprema habr&#237;a acordado 
durante dicha sesi&#243;n la remoci&#243;n de estos funcionarios. Esta decisi&#243;n habr&#237;a sido ratificada 
en el Pleno de la Corte Suprema el 13 de mayo.   
</p>
<p>826.  Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, a los jueces Guillermo L&#243;pez y Luis Alfonso 
Ch&#233;vez, as&#237; como al Defensor P&#250;blico Osman Fajardo, se les habr&#237;a atribuido haber 
participado en manifestaciones contra el golpe de Estado; al juez Ram&#243;n Enrique Barrios lo </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>114</b>  
</p>
<p>habr&#237;an cuestionado por haber publicado un art&#237;culo en un peri&#243;dico en el que objetaba, con 
argumentos jur&#237;dicos, la posici&#243;n de la Corte Suprema de denominar como sucesi&#243;n 
constitucional a la destituci&#243;n del ex-Presidente Manuel Zelaya. Finalmente, a la 
magistrada Flores se le habr&#237;a sancionado por haber presentado un recurso de amparo 
constitucional a favor del ex-Presidente Zelaya y otros funcionarios. 
</p>
<p>827.  Se inform&#243; tambi&#233;n que todos los funcionarios objeto de remoci&#243;n ser&#237;an miembros 
de la Asociaci&#243;n de Jueces para la Democracia, organizaci&#243;n que habr&#237;a expresado 
p&#250;blicamente su posici&#243;n con respecto a la crisis pol&#237;tica del a&#241;o pasado y cuyos miembros 
habr&#237;an participado activamente en la interposici&#243;n de diversos recursos judiciales al 
respecto.  
</p>
<p>828.  Se expres&#243; temor porque la sanci&#243;n que se impuso a los jueces no s&#243;lo les afecta 
personalmente sino que puede tener un efecto intimidatorio respecto a los otros miembros 
del gremio en el sentido de que se abstengan de manifestar opiniones diferentes de aquellas 
expresadas por las autoridades actuales. Esto representar&#237;a un ataque inadmisible contra la 
independencia de la judicatura. Al respecto, quisi&#233;ramos subrayar que la creaci&#243;n de un 
clima de temor en el Poder Judicial y en los abogados puede debilitar el Estado de Derecho 
y obstruir la justicia. 
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>829.  El 19 de noviembre de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial 
sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos y la Relatora Especial sobre la 
independencia de magistrados y abogados, enviaron un llamamiento urgente en relaci&#243;n 
con la situaci&#243;n de <b>varios abogados y trabajadores de la organizaci&#243;n Asociaci&#243;n para 
una Sociedad mas Justa (ASJ)</b>, los cuales trabajan defendiendo los derechos y libertades 
fundamentales de sectores desfavorecidos de la poblaci&#243;n hondure&#241;a, incluyendo casos de 
derechos laborales.  
</p>
<p>830.  Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 21 de septiembre de 2010, una abogada de 
ASJ habr&#237;a sido amenazada por empleados de la Secretar&#237;a del Trabajo mientras se 
encontraba realizando labores de investigaci&#243;n en la misma Secretar&#237;a. Dichos empleados 
habr&#237;an advertido a la abogada de que el Sub-Secretario de la Secretaria de Trabajo y 
Seguridad Social, antiguo gerente de la compa&#241;&#237;a &#8220;Seguridad T&#233;cnica de Honduras&#8221; 
(SETECH), estar&#237;a muy interesado en su investigaci&#243;n y que deber&#237;a tener cuidado con lo 
que estaba haciendo.  
</p>
<p>831.  Posteriormente, el d&#237;a 19 de octubre de 2010, la misma abogada amenazada en 
septiembre, habr&#237;a sido v&#237;ctima de un secuestro en la ciudad de Tegucigalpa por parte de 
dos hombres armados los cuales la habr&#237;an obligado a introducirse en un taxi. Una vez en el 
veh&#237;culo, los individuos habr&#237;an intercambiado armas de fuego y habr&#237;an comentado entre 
ellos: &#8220;Sabes que nos pagaron para ejecutarla, tenemos que hacerlo&#8221;. Despu&#233;s, se habr&#237;an 
dirigido a la abogada y le habr&#237;an preguntado: &#8220;&#191;Trabajas para ASJ? &#191;Qui&#233;n te paga? 
&#191;Cu&#225;nto te paga? &#191;Est&#225;s investigando a SETECH?&#8221; Sin embargo, 40 minutos despu&#233;s de 
haberla retenido, los dos hombres la habr&#237;an dejado bajar del veh&#237;culo cerca de unos 
grandes almacenes.  
</p>
<p>832.  SETECH es una empresa de seguridad, la cual fue demandada en 2006 por sus 
trabajadores por incumplimiento de la normativa laboral. ASJ y el abogado Dionisio D&#237;az 
Garc&#237;a estaban trabajando en uno de los casos cuando el Sr. D&#237;az Garc&#237;a fue asesinado el 4 
de diciembre de 2006 despu&#233;s de recibir amenazas de muerte. El resultado de las 
investigaciones y del juicio por el asesinato del abogado D&#237;az Garc&#237;a result&#243; en una 
condena a un antiguo guardia de seguridad de SETECH as&#237; como a un agente de la Oficina 
Nacional de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal. Tras la muerte del Sr. D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, el 20 de diciembre 
de 2006, la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos otorg&#243; medidas cautelares a </p>

<p>cuatro trabajadores de ASJ. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, despu&#233;s del asesinato del Sr. 
D&#237;az Garc&#237;a, ASJ habr&#237;a suspendido el acompa&#241;amiento legal de los trabajadores de 
SETECH. 
</p>
<p>833.  Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, el d&#237;a 3 de noviembre, otra abogada de ASJ habr&#237;a 
recibido amenazas por parte de dos hombres desconocidos en motocicleta mientras 
circulaba en su veh&#237;culo particular en un transitado boulevard de la ciudad de Tegucigalpa. 
Estos dos hombres se habr&#237;an acercado a la ventanilla del conductor del veh&#237;culo de la 
abogada y le habr&#237;an dicho: &#8220;Ten cuidado con Transformemos Honduras y ASJ&#8221; al tiempo 
que mostraban un arma de fuego. Transformemos Honduras es una asociaci&#243;n de la cual 
forma parte ASJ y que trabaja investigando y denunciando irregularidades y corrupci&#243;n en 
los sistemas educativo y sanitario de Honduras.  
</p>
<p>834.  Los sucesos relatados habr&#237;an sido puestos en conocimiento de la Fiscal&#237;a Especial 
de Derechos Humanos, as&#237; como de la Secretaria de Estado de Seguridad, con el fin de 
solicitar las medidas necesarias para garantizar la seguridad de los abogados de ASJ. Seg&#250;n 
la informaci&#243;n recibida, hasta el momento no habr&#237;an sido adoptadas medidas de protecci&#243;n 
para los trabajadores de ASJ amenazados recientemente. En este sentido, tampoco se habr&#237;a 
visto reforzada la protecci&#243;n otorgada a varias personas de la citada asociaci&#243;n en virtud de 
la medida cautelar de la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de Derechos Humanos de 20 de 
diciembre de 2006. 
</p>
<p>835. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de los abogados

alegaciones de que los sucesos arriba mencionados pudieran estar relacionadas con sus 
actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular con sus 
labores de investigaci&#243;n en casos relacionados con las actividades de la empresa de 
seguridad SETECH. Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de 
creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en 
Honduras.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>839. On 18 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief, sent a letter of allegations to the Government regarding 
<b>two acts relating to the regulation of the media, namely the Press and Media Act (Act 
CIV of 2010) and the Media Services and Mass Media Act (Act CLXXXV of 2010)</b>, 
which have been adopted by the parliament of Hungary on 20 December 2010, and came 
into effect on 1 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>840. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern that the introduction of a new 
regime of media regulation through the adoption of these Acts constitutes a regressive step 
for press freedom and all individuals&#8217; right to freedom of opinion and expression in the 
Republic of Hungary. The Special Rapporteurs&#8217; main concerns include the fact that the 
types of media content deemed illegal in the two Acts are overly broad and vague, and the 
Acts are enforced by a non-independent entity. These factors will increase the likelihood of 
creating a chilling effect on the exercise of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression 
as well as freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
</p>
<p>841. At the outset, the Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that while the right 
to freedom of expression can be limited under certain circumstances, three clear-cut 
conditions must be respected for any limitation on the right to freedom of expression: (a) 
restrictions must be established in law, which is accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly 
and with precision so as to enable individuals to foresee whether a particular action is 
unlawful; (b) they should pursue one of the aims listed in article 19 (3) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and (c) they must be proportionate to the 
accomplishment of that aim, in a sense that the benefit to the protected interest must 
outweigh the harm to freedom of expression, including in respect to the sanctions imposed, 
and constitute the least intrusive means to achieve the aim without jeopardizing the respect 
for the right to freedom of expression (see for example the latest report to the Human 
Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, A/HRC/14/23). In addition, any laws restricting the 
right to freedom of expression must be applied by a body which is independent of any 
political, commercial, or other unwarranted influences in a manner that is neither arbitrary 
nor discriminatory, and with adequate safeguards against abuse. 
</p>
<p>842. The Special Rapporteurs expressed concern that the provisions in the Press and 
Media Act and the Media Services and Mass Media Act do not meet the criteria outlined 
above. In particular, the Special Rapporteurs expressed their concerns regarding the 
following provisions, which they deem to be particularly problematic. 
</p>
<p>843. Section VI of the Press and Media Act outlines several obligations of the press, 
including provisions which stipulate that &#8220;all media content providers shall provide 
authentic, rapid and accurate information on local, national and European Union affairs and 
on any event that bears relevance to the citizens of the Republic of Hungary and members 
of the Hungarian nation&#8221; (article 13 (1), Press and Media Act), and that &#8220;linear and 
ondemand media content providers engaged in news coverage operations shall provide 
comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, objective and balanced coverage on local, national and 
European issues that may be of interest for the general public and on any event bearing 
relevance to the citizens of the Republic of Hungary and members of the Hungarian nation&#8221; 
(article 13 (2), Press and Media Act). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>117 
</b></p>
<p>844. While the Special Rapporteurs acknowledged the importance of the media to uphold 
the highest standards of ethics and professionalism, such standards should be adhered to 
voluntarily, rather than as obligations with legal sanctions (see for example the latest report 
to the General Assembly by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, A/65/284, para. 22). It is unclear how the legal 
requirements for the media to provide &#8220;authentic, rapid and accurate information&#8221; or 
&#8220;comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, objective, and balanced coverage&#8221; is necessary for 
achieving one of the aims set out in article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and the Special Rapporteurs are concerned that the plurality and diversity 
of views and information transmitted by the media may be undermined. 
</p>
<p>845. Article 14 (1) of the Press and Media Act provides that &#8220;the media content provider 
shall &#8211; in the media content that it publishes and while preparing such media content &#8211; 
respect human dignity&#8221;, and article 14 (2) stipulates that &#8220;no self-gratifying and detrimental 
coverage of persons in humiliating or defenceless situations is allowed in the media 
content.&#8221; In relation to these provisions, the Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government 
that limitations to the right to freedom of expression can only be imposed to protect the 
purposes enunciated in articles 19 (3) or 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In this regard, they noted with concern that &#8220;respect for human dignity&#8221;, 
and the prohibition of content that is &#8220;self-gratifying and detrimental coverage of persons in 
humiliating or defenceless situations&#8221;, constitute overly broad grounds for limiting the right 
to freedom of expression. The Special Rapporteurs also underscored that public officials 
and authorities should not take part in the initiation of defamation cases and tolerate more 
criticism because of the nature of their mandate, since public office entails public scrutiny 
as part of checks and balances in any democratic society (see for example E/CN.4/2006/55, 
para. 55). 
</p>
<p>846. Although article 6 (1) of the Press and Media Act guarantees the right of media 
content providers to keep the identity of its informant confidential, article 6 (3) stipulates 
that &#8220;in exceptionally justified cases, courts or authorities may &#8211; in the interest of protecting 
national security and public order or uncovering or preventing criminal acts &#8211; require the 
media service provider and any person employed by or engaged, in any other legal 
relationship intended for the performance of work, with the media content provider to 
reveal the identity of the informant.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs emphasized that protection 
of national security may not be used as a reason to compel journalists to reveal confidential 
sources, as enunciated in Principle 18 of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, 
Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (as endorsed in the 1996 report by the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, E/CN.4/1996/39). Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern 
over the provision which authorizes forced disclosure of identity for the too broadly defined 
purposes of &#8220;uncovering or preventing criminal acts&#8221;, which may thus be subject to abuse. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs noted that &#8220;authorities&#8221;, which is not defined further, 
in addition to courts, may request for the disclosure of identity of the source, and are 
concerned that there are insufficient guarantees to ensure that such disclosure is not done in 
a manner that is arbitrary or free of political influence. 
</p>
<p>847. The Special Rapporteurs are also concerned about several provisions in the Press 
and Media Act which refer to religious groups and communities, including article 11, which 
states that &#8220;the public service media operates in order to preserve and strengthen integrity 
both on a national and European level, foster national, family, ethnic and religious 
communities&#8221;; article 17 (1), which states that &#8220;media content may not incite hatred against 
persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any 
majority as well as any church or religious groups&#8221;; article 17 (2) which stipulates that &#8220;the 
media content may not offend or discriminate against &#8211; whether expressly or by implication 
&#8211; persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>118</b>  
</p>
<p>majority as well as any church or religious groups&#8221;; and article 20 (5), which stipulates that 
&#8220;[n]o media content with a commercial announcement that may offend religious or 
ideological convictions may be published&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>848. With regard to article 17 of the Press and Media Act, the Special Rapporteurs 
recognized the importance of prohibiting any advocacy of national, racial or religious 
hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence and of protecting 
individuals from all forms of discrimination. However, the Special Rapporteurs are 
concerned that the wording of article 17 of the Press and Media Act is overly broad, since it 
prohibits content that would merely &#8220;offend&#8221;, and even &#8220;by implication&#8221; &#8211; without 
necessarily inciting discrimination or hatred &#8211; &#8220;persons, nations, communities, national, 
ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any majority&#8221; as well as &#8220;any church or religious 
groups&#8221;. Similarly, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned at the formulation in article 11 of 
the Press and Media Act (&#8220;the public service media operates in order to [&#8230;] foster national, 
family, ethnic and religious communities [&#8230;]&#8221;) and its article 20 (5) concerning the 
nonpublication of &#8220;media content with a commercial announcement that may offend 
religious or ideological convictions&#8221;. As the Special Rapporteurs have stated on many 
occasions, abstract or subjective notions or concepts, such as the State, national symbols, 
national identity, cultures, schools of thought, religions, ideologies or political doctrines 
should not be protected as such. Otherwise, the rigorous protection of religions as such may 
create an atmosphere of intolerance and can give rise to fear and may even provoke the 
chances of a backlash (see A/HRC/2/3, para. 42). The Special Rapporteurs also reiterated 
that international human rights law protects individuals and groups of people, but not 
abstract notions or institutions that are subject to scrutiny, comment, criticism or ridicule 
(see A/HRC/14/23, para. 84 and A/HRC/2/3, paras. 27, 36 and 38). 
</p>
<p>849. Compliance with these provisions is overseen by a National Media and 
Infocommunications Authority (hereinafter the &#8220;Authority&#8221;), consisting of three entities as 
set out in article 109 of the Media Services and Mass Media Act: the President of the 
Authority, who is appointed by the Prime Minister of Hungary for a period of nine years; a 
Media Council of the Authority (hereinafter the &#8220;Media Council&#8221;), whose members are 
appointed by two thirds of the members of the Parliament for a period of nine years; and a 
Bureau of the Authority (hereinafter the &#8220;Bureau&#8221;), headed by a Director-General who is 
appointed by the President of the Authority. The Media Council in particular is mandated to 
prohibit unlawful conduct (article 186, Media Services and Mass Media Act), and &#8220;apply 
legal consequences&#8221; for breaches of the Press and Media Act (article 3 (4), Press and Media 
Act). Such &#8220;legal consequences&#8221; include suspension of a media service provider for up to 
one week in cases of repeated and grave infringements (article 187(3), Media Services and 
Mass Media Act), as well as imposition of fines of up to HUF 50,000,000 for a media 
service provider, HUF 25,000,000 for a newspaper with nationwide distribution, HUF 
10,000,000 for a weekly periodical with nationwide distribution, HUF 5,000,000 for other 
newspapers or periodicals, HUF 25,000,000 for an online media product, HUF 5,000,000 
for a broadcaster, and HUF 3,000,000 for an intermediary service provider (article 187 (3), 
Media Services and Mass Media Act). 
</p>
<p>850. As mentioned previously, any limitations to the right to freedom of expression 
should be applied by a body that is independent of any political, commercial, or other 
unwarranted influences. The Special Rapporteurs are concerned that the appointment 
process for the members of the Authority, which includes the President, Media Council and 
the Bureau, does not guarantee the independence of the Authority, given that the President 
is appointed by the Prime Minister, who is also empowered to appoint the Director-General 
of the Bureau, and the members of the Media Council are appointed by two thirds of the 
members of Parliament, or the dominant political party. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteurs noted that 263 out of 386 Members of Parliament (or 68 percent) are from the 
ruling FIDESZ-KDNP list. Additionally, the Special Rapporteurs are concerned that the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>119 
</b></p>
<p>financial sanctions to be imposed for a violation of legislation related to the media are 
determined by the Authority, rather than an independent judiciary. 
</p>
<p>851. The Special Rapporteurs indicated that they stand ready to provide the Government 
with support and assistance regarding the concerns outlined in this communication, in 
accordance with the mandates given to them by the Human Rights Council that the Special 
Rapporteurs provide advisory services or technical assistance when requested by the State 
concerned. The Special Rapporteurs also requested information from the Government 
clarifying how it intends to address the concerns raised in this communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>852. In a letter dated 2 February 2011, the Government of Hungary replied to the letter of 
allegations of 18 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>853. The Government emphasized that it was firmly committed to freedom of the press 
and freedom of expression. Hungary had expressed this commitment not only by taking 
part in the framework of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but also 
by acceding to other important international legal instruments, such as the European 
Convention on Human Rights. Based on the Government&#8217;s international commitments, 
freedom of expression had also been recognised as one of the most important fundamental 
values of the country&#8217;s legal system by a series of landmark decisions in the Hungarian 
Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>854. According to the Government, the purpose of the recent legislation relating to media 
services (Act CIV of 2010 on the Freedom of the Press and the Fundamental Rules 
Governing Media Content [the Press and Media Act] and Act CLXXXV of 2010 on Media 
Services and Mass Communication [Media Services and Mass Media Act]) was to 
safeguard freedom of the press and freedom of expression, while at the same time achieving 
a corresponding balance with other fundamental rights &#8211; such as the right to human dignity, 
the rights of minors, and consumers&#8217; rights. The Government believed that by recently 
adopting a set of new acts related to the media it had secured this balance in accord with its 
international commitments, most notably with Article 19 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>855. With the above in mind, the Government reacted to the comments in the Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; letter related to particular aspects of the recent Hungarian media legislation:  </p>
<p><i>  Obligations related to information and news services 
</i></p>
<p>856. The Special Rapporteurs had quoted in their letter Article 13 (1) of the Press and 
Media Act. The Government noted that the quoted English translation of the text was 
incorrect at this point. The provision, in effect, was a declarative one. It established that the 
totality of the whole Hungarian media system shall provide adequate information to 
citizens. Contrary to the interpretation in the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter, it did not provide 
for any legally enforceable obligation for each and every media content provider. 
</p>
<p>857. As regards other provisions related to balanced presentation of news, the 
Government emphasized that this was not a legal requirement for the print media or internet 
news providers under the present Hungarian legislation. According to Article 13 (2) of the 
Press and Media Act, it was applicable only to radio, television and television-like media 
content (i.e. non-linear audiovisual media cervices, within the meaning of the 
corresponding European Union directive). In the event of a violation of this obligation, the 
only &#8220;sanction&#8221; applicable by the authorities was the obligation to make viewers/listeners 
aware that they had received biased or inaccurate information, or the obligation to remedy 
biases and/or inaccuracies in the presentation. It was apparent from Article 181 (5) of the 
Media Services and Mass Media Act that there was no possibility of applying any other </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>120</b>  
</p>
<p>sanction in this regard. The obligation to provide balanced coverage could be found in 
many legal systems throughout the world. In this context, Recital 102 of Directive 
2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council explicitly referred to the 
common practice of imposing the obligation on television broadcasters to present facts and 
events fairly. 
</p>
<p>858. The Government also pointed out that the requirement of balanced presentation had 
been in existence in the Hungarian legislation since 1996. The requirement was supported 
by the decisions of the Hungarian Constitutional Court; its precise content had been 
developed over the 15-year lifespan of the former media authority, and in the Hungarian 
courts. The Government stressed that courts performing judicial review concerning the 
related activities of the media authority were bound by this substantial body of 
constitutional jurisprudence &#8211; just as the authority itself. Given the fact that the precise 
content of the said requirement was well defined in case law, the Government stated that 
media content providers were not facing a new, &#8220;overly broad&#8221; or &#8220;vague&#8221; concept in this 
respect, the application of which may produce a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on them. 
</p>
<p><i>  The notion of human dignity 
</i></p>
<p>859. The application of the provisions of Article 14 (1) and 14 (2) of the Press and Media 
Act raised, in the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; judgment, unjustified limitations on the right of 
freedom of expression, given the &#8220;overly broad grounds of limitation&#8221;, such as respect for 
human dignity. However, the Government indicated that the notion of human dignity was 
another well-defined notion in the Hungarian legal system, with numerous interpretative 
decisions by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, the former media authority and the 
Hungarian courts. Moreover, human dignity was explicitly referred to in the European 
audiovisual media legislation, particularly in the Directive on Audiovisual Media Services 
and in related recommendations by the European Parliament and the Council. The concept 
was also present in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. As a 
consequence, the legal concept of &#8220;human dignity&#8221; had become instrumental in combating 
racism, xenophobia and hate speech in Europe. Therefore the Government was convinced 
that its use in the Hungarian legislation was an important safeguard of democratic values, 
and in no way constituted an unjustified restriction on freedom of the press or freedom of 
expression. 
</p>
<p>860. As regards the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; comment concerning defamation cases related 
to public officials and authorities, the Government noted that well-established case law 
from the Hungarian courts &#8211; based on a decision by the Hungarian Constitutional Court &#8211; 
clearly defined the limits and the scope of criticism that holders of public office must 
tolerate. The approach taken by the Constitutional Court and by the courts of Hungary was 
consistent with the Council of Europe declaration adopted by the Committee of Ministers 
on 12 February 2004 at the 872nd meeting of the Ministers&#8217; Deputies on &#8220;freedom of 
political debate in the media&#8221;. In line with this declaration, the Hungarian legislation 
continued to fulfil the requirement that &#8220;political figures and public officials should only 
have access to those legal remedies against the media which private individuals have in 
case of violations of their rights by the media&#8221;. Against this background, the Government 
also noted that the exclusion of those holding public office from any form of legal remedy 
in the event of the violation of their dignity &#8211; as expressed in the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter 
&#8211; seemed to be a requirement going beyond what was necessary to ensure the possibility of 
public scrutiny. 
</p>
<p><i>  The protection of journalistic sources 
</i></p>
<p>861. As regards the protection of journalists&#8217; sources, the Government drew the Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; attention to Article 6 (1) of the Press and Media Act, which explicitly stated </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>121 
</b></p>
<p>that media outlets and journalists &#8220;are entitled to keep the identity of their sources 
confidentia1.&#8221; This general right of confidentiality also extended to court and authority 
proceedings: in other words, it granted those in the media exemption from the obligation to 
testify. According to these rules, journalists could only be required to disclose their sources 
of information in court or authority proceedings when there was exceptional justification. 
The definition of these exceptions corresponded to Article 10 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>862. Furthermore, the Government Please noted that although Article 6 (3) of the Press 
and Media Act stated that courts and authorities may, in exceptional cases, request the 
disclosure of the identity of the source, this did not in itself mean that <i>any </i>court or <i>any 
</i>authority was vested to implement this power, regardless of the procedure or investigation 
it pursued. In fact, this provision may only be applied in the context of criminal 
investigation, as identification of sources may only be requested &#8220;in the interest of 
protecting national security and public order or uncovering or preventing criminal acts&#8221; &#8211; 
this limited the scope of the provision to authorities with criminal investigative powers 
defined in other statutory provisions, such as the Code on Penal Procedure. It should also be 
noted that such decisions were always subject to judicial review by the courts. The 
Government was convinced that this set of guarantees excluded the possibility of any 
arbitrary rulings. 
</p>
<p>863. The Government also emphasized that prior to the adoption of the Press and Media 
Act the scope for protection of journalistic sources was much narrower under Hungarian 
law. Under the legal regime of Act 11 of 1986 on the Press (the relevant act in force prior to 
the adoption of the Press and Media Act and Media Services and the Mass Media Act), 
journalistic sources did not enjoy any special protection in the context of criminal 
proceedings. In the light of this, the Government was convinced that the provisions of the 
Press and Media Act regarding the right of journalists to protect their sources of 
information could not be described as a &#8220;regressive step&#8221; in any way. 
</p>
<p><i>  Actions against incitement to hatred and discrimination 
</i></p>
<p>864. In the context of actions against incitement to hatred and discrimination, the 
Government noted that the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; letter referred to various provisions, 
differing in both nature and context. The first of these provisions was Article 11 of the 
Press and Media Act, defining the basic role of public service media. Among other 
international documents, the Council of Europe Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)3 of the 
Committee of Ministers on the remit of public service media in the information society 
stated that &#8220;member states have the competence to define and assign a public service remit 
to one or more specific media organisations&#8221;. This competence was also recognised by 
European Union law and by several other documents of international law. 
</p>
<p>865. Another quoted provision was Article 20 (5) of the Press and Media Act, protecting 
religious and ideological convictions with regard to advertising. In this context the 
Government referred to the practice of the European Court of Human Rights, which granted 
a greater margin of interpretation to states when determining advertising regulation, given 
that such forms of communication &#8211; although also protected by the European Convention 
on Human Right &#8211; were less linked to democratic and social values than to economic ones. 
</p>
<p>866. According to the Government, the purpose of Article 17 of the Press and Media Act 
was to provide the opportunity for effective legal remedies when addressing problems 
related to racism, xenophobia or anti-Semitism &#8211; thereby helping to prevent the 
development of a climate of intolerance. Based on this aim, the article sought to combat al1 
ideologies, policies and practices characterized by incitement to racial hatred, violence and 
discrimination, as well as any action or language likely to strengthen fears and tensions 
between groups from different racial, ethnic, national, religious or social backgrounds. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>122</b>  
</p>
<p>867. The Government was aware that the balance between securing freedom of 
expression and promoting a culture of tolerance was an extremely delicate one, and finding 
it posed a substantial challenge to al1 legal systems. However, the Government was 
confident that its legislation drew appropriate boundaries to freedom of expression also in 
this respect. At this instance the Government referred again to the importance of the judicial 
review over the activities of the media authority as granted by the Press and Media Act that 
ensured this balance at the level of the practice. 
</p>
<p><i>  The independence and sanctioning powers of the regulatory authority 
</i></p>
<p>868. Finally, as regards the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; concerns over the independence of the 
National Media and Infocommunications Authority &#8211; and the Media Council therein &#8211; the 
Government noted that the Media Council was comprised of specialists elected by a two 
thirds majority in the Hungarian National Assembly. The Government believed that the fact 
that they are elected by Parliament was itself proof enough that they could not be regarded 
as political appointees. The Hungarian legislation provided substantial guarantees to ensure 
their independent conduct in their office: in performing their duties, members of the Media 
Council could not take orders from anyone; they could not be recalled; and they had to 
comply with strict rules on conflict of interest. The elected members of the Media Council 
were expected to have no ties &#8211; either formal or informal &#8211; to any political party, or to the 
Government. Media authorities with a much smaller degree of independence from their 
respective governments were not uncommon across Europe: in several countries it was the 
Government, the Head of State or a minister that appointed the members of such 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>869. With regard to the imposition of fines and other sanctions by the Authority, the 
Government referred to Article 185 (2) of the Media Services and Mass Media Act, which 
stated that &#8220;in applying the legal consequence, the Media Council and the Office &#8211; under 
the principle of equal treatment &#8211; shall act in line with the principles of progressivity and 
proportionality; shall apply the legal consequence proportionately in line with the gravity 
and rate of re-occurrence of the infringement, taking into account al1 circumstances of the 
case and the purpose of the legal consequence&#8221;. This provision was complemented by 187 
(2) of the same act, stating: &#8220;The Media Council and the Office shall impose the legal 
consequence &#8211; depending on the nature of the infringement &#8211; taking into account the 
gravity of the infringement, whether it was committed on one or more occasions or on an 
ad-hoc or continuous basis, its duration, the pecuniary benefits earned as a result of the 
infringement, the damage to interests caused by the infringement, the number of persons 
aggrieved or jeopardized by the damage to interests, the damage caused by the infringement 
and the impact of the infringement on the market and other considerations that may be 
taken into account in the particular case.&#8221; According to the Government, these provisions 
effectively excluded the possibility of disproportionate sanctioning by the Authority. 
</p>
<p>870. The Government also noted that the Media Services and Mass Media Act granted 
the possibility of judicial review for al1 of the Authority&#8217;s decisions. The media service 
provider concerned could challenge the decision of the Media Council by launching an 
appeal at the competent court. The court may dismiss the decision of the Authority or 
amend it. Therefore the entire conduct of the National Media and Telecommunications 
Authority was under the supervision of the courts. 
</p>
<p>871. The Government was confident that the above explanations relating to the 
Hungarian legislation on media services provided the Special Rapporteurs with the further 
insight necessary to assess the conformity of the legislation with fundamental rights, and in 
particular with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Should the Special 
Rapporteurs consider it necessary, the Government was willing to provide further 
clarifications necessary for the finalization of the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; report. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>123 
</b></p>
<p>Government also informed that it was currently in negotiations with the European 
Commission relating to possible amendments to the Hungarian legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Communication sent on 31 March 2011 
</b></p>
<p>872. On 31 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, sent a non-exhaustive commentary on some of the issues in 
the amended media legislation most relevant from the perspective of his mandate and, 
wherever relevant and appropriate, the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, as follows.  
</p>
<p><i> I.  Introduction 
</i></p>
<p>873. On 20 December 2010, the Parliament of Hungary adopted the Law on the Freedom 
of the Press and the Fundamental Rules on Media Content (Act CIV of 2010) (the &#8220;Press 
and Media Act&#8221;) and the Media Services and Mass Media Act (Act CLXXXV of 2010) (the 
&#8220;Media Law&#8221;), which entered into force on 1 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>874. The aforementioned acts are part of a broader &#8220;media package&#8221;, which implicated, 
inter alia, the amendment of Article 61 of the Hungarian Constitution, passed on 6 July 
2010, and which removed the obligation of the Parliament to pass a law aimed to &#8220;preclude 
information monopolies&#8221;, i.e. the obligation of the State to uphold pluralism. Instead, the 
amendment introduced a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s right to be provided with &#8216;proper&#8217; or &#8216;adequate&#8217; 
information about public life&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>875. The two acts were reportedly passed on an expedited basis without effective 
consultations with journalists&#8217; associations, civil society and other stakeholders. The new 
media legislation uses the term &#8216;media product&#8217; in an unusually broad way. It includes not 
only the printed press and broadcast media, but also Internet-based content. The scope of 
the legislation covers all media services and products that can be &#8220;consumed&#8221; in Hungary, 
regardless of the location of the media provider.    
</p>
<p>876. In our joint communication of 18 January 2011, we expressed concern at the fact 
that the new regime of media regulation in Hungary classifies certain types of media 
content as unlawful on overly broad and vague grounds and provides high administrative 
fines. Likewise, we expressed concern that the legislative acts in question are enforced by a 
non-independent and non-impartial regulatory body. We would like to thank the 
Government of Hungary for its responses provided on 2 February and 8 March 2011, the 
informal discussion held on 10 February in Vienna, and the invitation extended to us for a 
technical cooperation visit to the Republic of Hungary.  
</p>
<p>877. On 7 March 2011, the Parliament of Hungary adopted a number of amendments to 
the new media legislation. While we welcome efforts to improve the two Acts, we remain 
concerned about the conformity of the amended media legislation with international human 
rights norms and standards.  
</p>
<p>878. In the spirit of our ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the Government of 
Hungary, we seek to provide, through this memorandum, a non-exhaustive commentary on 
the principal issues that merit close scrutiny. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>124</b>  
</p>
<p><i> II.  General Analysis of the Media Legislation  
</i></p>
<p> A.  The right to freedom of expression and information and its limitations 
</p>
<p>879. The right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by Article 19(2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the &#8220;ICCPR&#8221;),10 which provides that 
&#8220;[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom 
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
This provision thus protects every communicable type of subjective idea and opinion, of 
value-neutral news and information, of commercial advertising, art works, critical political 
commentary, pornography, etc. In addition, every medium of communication is protected, 
including the press, assemblies and demonstrations, radio and television, electronic media 
such as the Internet, film, music, graphic arts, and so forth. Moreover, Article 19(2) of the 
ICCPR does not only guarantee the rights of individuals to be passive recipients of 
information, but it also ensures their right to seek information.  
</p>
<p>880. While the right to freedom of expression can be limited under certain circumstances, 
such limitations are subject to the following conditions:  
</p>
<p> (a)  restrictions must be established in law, which is accessible, unambiguous, 
drawn narrowly and with precision so as to enable individuals to foresee whether a 
particular action is unlawful;  
</p>
<p> (b)  they should pursue one of the aims listed in article 19(3) of the [ICCPR], and  
</p>
<p> (c)  they must be proportionate to the accomplishment of that aim, in a sense that 
the benefit to the protected interest must outweigh the harm to freedom of expression, 
including in respect to the sanctions imposed, and constitute the least intrusive means to 
achieve the aim without jeopardizing the respect for the right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>881. Any legislation restricting the right to freedom of expression must be applied by a 
body which is independent of any political, commercial, or other unwarranted influences in 
a manner that is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, and with adequate safeguards against 
abuse. 
</p>
<p>882. In the view of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the rights 
to freedom of opinion and expression, the following principles can be used to determine the 
conditions that must be satisfied in order for a limitation or restriction on freedom of 
expression to be permissible: 
</p>
<p> (a)  The restriction or limitation must not undermine or jeopardize the essence of 
the right of freedom of expression; 
</p>
<p> (b)  The relationship between the right and the limitation/restriction or between 
the rule and the exception must not be reversed; 
</p>
<p> (c)  All restrictions must be provided for by pre-existing statutory laws issued by 
the legislative body of the State; 
</p>
<p> (d)  Laws imposing restrictions or limitations must be accessible, concrete, clear 
and unambiguous, such that they can be understood by everyone and applied to everyone. 
They must also be compatible with international human rights law, with the burden of 
proving this congruence lying with the State; 
</p>
<p>  
 10 The Government of Hungary ratified the ICCPR on 17 January 1974. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>125 
</b></p>
<p> (e)  Laws imposing a restriction or limitation must set out the remedy against or 
mechanisms for challenging the illegal or abusive application of that limitation or 
restriction, which must include a prompt, comprehensive and efficient judicial review of the 
validity of the restriction by an independent court or tribunal; 
</p>
<p> (f)  Laws imposing restrictions or limitations must not be arbitrary or 
unreasonable and must not be used as a means of political censorship or of silencing 
criticism of public officials or public policies; 
</p>
<p> (g)  Any restrictions imposed on the exercise of a right must be &#8220;necessary&#8221;, 
which means that the limitation or restriction must: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Be based on one of the grounds for limitations recognized by the Covenant; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Address a pressing public or social need which must be met in order to prevent the 
violation of a legal right that is protected to an even greater extent; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Pursue a legitimate aim; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Be proportionate to that aim and be no more restrictive than is required for the 
achievement of the desired purpose. The burden of demonstrating the legitimacy and 
the necessity of the limitation or restriction shall lie with the State; 
</p>
<p> (h) Certain very specific limitations are legitimate if they are necessary in order 
for the State to fulfil an obligation to prohibit certain expressions on the grounds that they 
violate the rights of others. These include the following:  
</p>
<p>(i)  Article 20 of the Covenant, which establishes that &#8220;any propaganda for war&#8221; 
and &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(ii)  Article 3, paragraph 1 (c), of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, which provides that States must ensure that their criminal law 
covers &#8220;producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, 
offering, selling or possessing [...] child pornography&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(iii)  Article 4 (a) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination, which establishes the requirement to &#8220;declare an 
offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial 
superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of 
violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of 
another colour or ethnic origin&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Article III (c) of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide, which states that &#8220;direct and public incitement to commit 
genocide&#8221; shall be punishable; 
</p>
<p> (i)  Restrictions already established must be reviewed and their continued 
relevance analysed periodically; 
</p>
<p> (j)  In states of emergency which threaten the life of the nation and which have 
been officially proclaimed, States are permitted to temporarily suspend certain rights, 
including the right to freedom of expression. However, such suspensions shall be legitimate 
only if the state of emergency is declared in accordance with article 4 of the ICCPR. 
General Comment No. 29 of the Human Rights Committee (the &#8220;HRCtee&#8221;) provides clear 
guidance on such suspensions. A state of emergency may not under any circumstances be 
used for the sole aim of restricting freedom of expression and preventing criticism of those 
who hold power; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>126</b>  
</p>
<p> (k)  Any restriction or limitation must be consistent with other rights recognized 
in the Covenant and in other international human rights instruments, as well as with the 
fundamental principles of universality, interdependence, equality and non-discrimination as 
to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social origin, 
property, birth or any other status; 
</p>
<p> (l)  All restrictions and limitations shall be interpreted in the light and context of 
the particular right concerned. Wherever doubt exists as to the interpretation or scope of a 
law imposing limitations or restrictions, the protection of fundamental human rights shall 
be the prevailing consideration.11 
</p>
<p>883. As provided in paragraph 5 (p) of Human Rights Council (the &#8220;HRC&#8221;) resolution 
12/16, restrictions on the following aspects of the right to freedom of expression are not 
permissible: 
</p>
<p>(i)  Discussion of government policies and political debate; reporting on human 
rights, government activities and corruption in government; engaging in 
election campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including 
for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or 
belief, including by persons belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p>(ii)  The free flow of information and ideas, including practices such as the 
banning or closing of publications or other media and the abuse of 
administrative measures and censorship; 
</p>
<p>(iii)  Access to or use of information and communication technologies, including 
radio, television and the Internet.12 
</p>
<p> B.  The Press and Media Act 
</p>
<p>884. The Press and Media Act stipulates that media providers operating in, or targeted at, 
the Republic of Hungary are obliged to provide proper, authentic and accurate information 
to the public. We consider that the requirement for broadcast news reports to be 
&#8220;comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, objective and balanced&#8221; is problematic to fully 
guarantee the right to freedom of expression, particularly as grants a considerable degree of 
discretion to the National Media and Info-Communications Authority (the &#8220;Media 
Authority&#8221;) to interpret such concepts. The Media Authority is a regulatory body 
established pursuant to the Press and Media Act. It is comprised of a President, the Media 
Council, the Media Commissioner and the Bureau. This body is entitled inter alia to deny 
registration of media; to interpret the law and decide what constitutes &#8220;public interest&#8221;, 
&#8220;public morals&#8221;, &#8220;balanced coverage&#8221;; to perform supervisory and control tasks over the 
compliance with the law; and to impose penalties on the media service providers which 
violate the legislation. While the Press and Media Act guarantees journalists&#8217; right to 
protect their sources from disclosure, not only courts but also other authorities can request 
journalists to do so in exceptionally justified cases, namely &#8220;in the interest of protecting 
national security and public order or uncovering or preventing criminal acts&#8221;.   
</p>
<p> C.  The Media Law 
</p>
<p>885. The Media Law has been a subject of strong criticism by a number of international 
organizations (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (the &#8220;OSCE&#8221;), 
European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;)), Governments (Germany, France, Luxembourg and the Czech 
</p>
<p>  
 11 UN Doc. A/HRC/14/23, para. 79.  
 12 UN Doc. A/HRC/14/23, para. 81. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>127 
</b></p>
<p>Republic) and civil society (Amnesty International, Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, 
Article 19, etc.). One of our main concerns is that the legal consequences ensuing from 
violations of the legislation are subject to discretion of the Media Authority, which fails to 
comply with standards of independence and impartiality, both in terms of its composition 
and appointment process. We are also concerned that regulations specified in the Act apply 
to all types of media, including press, Internet, blogs and foreign media available in 
Hungary. Media content providers may face fines of up to HUF 200 million (&#8364;720,000) for 
television and radio, and up to HUF 25 million HUF (&#8364;90,000) for print and online 
publications. These fines can be imposed repeatedly, and the Media Authority is authorized 
to suspend or ban the distribution of a media product in the event of repeated violations of 
the enacted legislation.  
</p>
<p><i> III.  Article by Article Commentary on the Press and Media Act 
</i></p>
<p>886. This section provides a commentary on those articles of the Press and Media Act, 
which we find most problematic in terms of their compliance with international human 
rights norms and standards. For ease of reference, each comment is preceded by relevant 
extracts from the law. The amended provisions, as adopted on 7 March 2011 by the 
Parliament of Hungary, are already taken into account (deletions appear in brackets and 
strikethrough mode, while additions are underscored). 
</p>
<p>Article 1 [as amended] &#8211; [Ibid. Art. 203 of the Media Law] 
</p>
<p>1.  Media service shall mean any economic service as defined in Articles 56 and 
57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, pursued independently, 
businesswise &#8211; on a regular basis for profit, taking economic risk &#8211; for which the 
media service provider bears editorial responsibility, the primary aim of which is the 
delivery of programmes to the general public for informational, entertainment or 
educational purposes through an electronic communications network. 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>6.  [Printed] press [materials] product [&#8230;] shall mean individual issues of daily 
newspapers or other periodical papers, internet newspapers or news portals, which 
are offered as an economic service, for the content of which a natural or legal 
person, or a business entity with no legal personality has editorial responsibility, and 
the primary purpose of which is to deliver textual or image content to the general 
public for information, entertainment or educational purposes, in a printed format or 
through any electronic communications network. Editorial responsibility shall mean 
the responsibility for the actual control over the selection and composition of the 
media content and shall not necessarily result in legal responsibility in connection 
with the press product. Economic service shall mean any service pursued 
independently, businesswise &#8211; on a regular basis for profit, taking economic risk. 
</p>
<p>887. The printed press and the Internet-based media have so far been virtually free from 
any regulation. We believe that the scope of the law as it stands creates an unprecedented 
restriction to these forms of media content. It remains unclear, for example, whether in the 
light of the present legislation, an Internet blog could qualify as an economic service.    
</p>
<p>Article 3 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>(2)  This Act shall apply to media services and printed press materials targeted at 
or distributed or published in the territory of the Republic of Hungary that are not 
deemed as established in any Member State of the European Economic Area, and 
the media services or printed press materials that fall under the scope of the Act 
under Article 2 and paragraphs (1)-(2). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>128</b>  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>888. The reference to &#8220;targeted at&#8221; contained in Article 3(2) remains unclear. If the 
majority of the media service provider is established outside the EU, would the Act apply to 
its media outlet operating or targeted at the Republic of Hungary? This could involve 
seeking to block access to any such content originating from abroad. </p>
<p>889. The territorial scope of the measures, as prescribed in Article 3, would not be in 
conformity with inter alia Principle 3 of the Council of Europe Declaration on freedom of 
communication on the Internet, which provides that &#8220;[p]ublic authorities should not, 
through general blocking or filtering measures, deny access by the public to information 
and other communication on the Internet, regardless of frontiers. This does not prevent the 
installation of filters for the protection of minors, in particular in places accessible to them, 
such as schools or libraries&#8221;. </p>
<p>890. Similarly, it is difficult to see how Article 3 of the present Act can be reconciled 
with Recommendation CM/Rec (2008)6 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of 
Europe, which in its paragraph 5 provides that Member States shall &#8220;refrain from filtering 
Internet content in electronic communications networks operated by public actors for 
reasons other than those laid down in Article 10, paragraph 2, of the European Convention 
on Human Rights [(the &#8220;ECHR&#8221;)], as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights 
[(the &#8220;ECtHR&#8221;)]; to take such action only if the filtering concerns specific and clearly 
identifiable content, a competent national authority has taken a decision on its illegality and 
the decision can be reviewed by an independent and impartial tribunal or regulatory body, 
in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human 
Rights&#8221;.  </p>
<p>891. We find that the reference to &#8220;distributed or published in the territory of the 
Republic of Hungary&#8221; is also problematic. It could apply to any person, even a foreigner, 
who uses a computer or similar equipment in the territory of Hungary to upload any content 
onto the Internet. In other words, it could easily amount to a system which aims to prevent 
&#8220;unwanted&#8221; content without following any guidelines with the view to avoiding 
arbitrariness.  </p>
<p>Article 4 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>(3) The exercise of the freedom of the press may not constitute or abet an act of 
crime, violate public morals or prejudice the inherent rights of others. 
</p>
<p>892. In terms of the purposes for interference with the right to freedom of expression, 
Article 19(3) of the ICCPR &#8220;permits fewer restrictions than Art. 10(2) of the ECHR&#8221;.13 Art. 
10(2) of the ECHR contains the following references for interference with freedom of 
expression, which were expressly not adopted in Art. 19(3) of the ICCPR on the grounds of 
being too specific: (a) in the interest of territorial integrity or public safety; (b) for the 
prevention of disorder or crime; (c) for preventing the disclosure of information received in 
confidence; (d) for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. Although 
these purposes for interferences may be taken into account on a case-by-case basis, a 
relatively limited number of reasons for permissible interference in the ICCPR indicated 
that &#8220;these are to be interpreted narrowly in cases of doubt&#8221;.14

<p> <b>129 
</b></p>
<p>893. Article 4(3) of the Press and Media Law contains a reference to &#8220;public morals&#8221; 
which, in our view, requires further precision, since it may be subject to overly broad and 
vague interpretation.  
</p>
<p>894. In <i>Hertzberg et al. v. Finland</i>, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (the 
&#8220;HRCtee&#8221;) noted that &#8220;public morals differ widely. There is no universally applicable 
common standard. Consequently, in this respect, a certain margin of discretion must be 
accorded to the responsible national authorities&#8221;.15 It must be noted, however, that in their 
individual opinions, three Committee members stressed that the concept of public morals is 
relative and that any ensuing restrictions on freedom of expression should not be applied in 
a manner &#8220;as to perpetuate prejudice or promote intolerance. It is of special importance to 
protect freedom of expression as regards minority views, including those that offend, shock 
or disturb the majority&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>895. In addition, we would like to recall that, in its General Comment no. 22 on freedom 
of thought, conscience and religion, the HRCtee stated the following: &#8220;[l]imitations may be 
applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and must be directly related 
and proportionate to the specific need on which they are predicated. Restrictions may not be 
imposed for discriminatory purposes or applied in a discriminatory manner. The Committee 
observes that the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious 
traditions; consequently, limitations on the freedom to manifest a religion or belief for the 
purpose of protecting morals must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a 
single tradition&#8221;.17  
</p>
<p>896. As far as the protection of &#8220;the inherent rights of others&#8221; is concerned, the principle 
of proportionality must be strictly observed in this area. Article 4(3) does not provide for 
such a balancing exercise, imposing an absolute prevalence of the right to privacy by 
stating that the exercise of the freedom of the press may not &#8220;prejudice the inherent rights 
of others&#8221;. It is true that States parties to the ICCPR, pursuant to Art. 17(1) in conjunction 
with Art. 19(3) are bound to provide statutory protection against <i>unlawful</i> or <i>intentional 
</i>infringement on honour and reputation by <i>untrue </i>assertions.18 However, &#8220;particularly in the 
political arena, not every attack on the good reputation of others must be sanctioned, since 
freedom of expression and information (especially freedom of the media) would otherwise 
be stripped of their fundamental importance for the process of formation of political 
opinion&#8221;.19  
</p>

<p>Media Authority may also be set as a condition for the commencement of the media 
service. 
</p>
<p>897. It is our understanding that, by providing for an official registration as a 
precondition for the commencement of media services, the publication of printed press 
materials and successful participation in a tendering procedure in cases of limited state-
owned resource, the Press and Media Act seems to unnecessarily restrict the diversity and 
equal opportunity of the media providers, without setting adequate and impartial procedures 
for their selection. This obligation seems to apply not only to television and radio stations, 
but also to online and printed press. 
</p>
<p>898. With regard to online press, we believe that any requirement to register websites 
with Governmental authorities is not acceptable. Unlike licensing scarce resources such as 
broadcasting frequencies, an abundant infrastructure like the Internet does not justify 
official assignment of licenses. We share the view that &#8220;mandatory registration of online 
publications might stifle the free exchange of ideas, opinions, and information on the 
Internet&#8221;.20 
</p>
<p>899. This requirement is unprecedented inside the EU and is prohibited by the Council of 
Europe guidelines. It may also amount to a violation of Article 11 of the Charter of 
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The registration system creates a legal, 
administrative and potentially a political barrier to the entry of new media service providers 
and it could be used to silence the existing ones (please refer to the commentary of Article 
46 of the Media Law).  
</p>
<p>900. Moreover, we are concerned that registration can be denied by the Media Authority, 
whose independence and impartiality are not guaranteed (please refer to the commentaries 
of Articles 42, 102, 109-111 of the Media Law), thereby posing a threat to the existence of 
independent and diverse media. 
</p>
<p>Article 6 
</p>
<p>(1)  The media content provider and any person employed by or engaged, in any 
other legal relationship intended for the performance of work, with the media 
content provider shall have the right to keep the identity of its informant confidential 
(hereinafter referred to as: source of information). The right to keep such data 
confidential shall not apply to the protection of sources disclosing qualified data 
unlawfully.  
</p>
<p>(2)  The media content provider and any person employed by or engaged, in any 
other legal relationship intended for the performance of work, with the media 
content provider shall have the right to keep the identity of their sources of 
information confidential even in judicial or other official proceedings, provided that 
the information thereby supplied were disclosed in the interest of the public.  
</p>
<p>(3)  In exceptionally justified cases, courts or authorities may &#8211; in the interest of 
protecting national security and public order or uncovering or preventing criminal 
acts &#8211; require the media service provider and any person employed by or engaged, in 
any other legal relationship intended for the performance of work, with the media 
content provider to reveal the identity of the informant.  
</p>
<p>901. Although Article 6(1) guarantees the right of media content providers to keep the 
identity of its informant confidential, article 6(3) stipulates that &#8220;in exceptionally justified

<p>cases, courts or authorities may &#8211; in the interest of protecting national security and public 
order or uncovering or preventing criminal acts &#8211; require the media service provider and 
any person employed by or engaged, in any other legal relationship intended for the 
performance of work, with the media content provider to reveal the identity of the 
informant&#8221;. Vaguely formulated exceptions such as &#8216;interest of protecting national security 
and public order&#8217; may not be used as a reason to compel journalists to reveal confidential 
sources, as enunciated in Principle 18 of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, 
Freedom of Expression and Access to Information.21 Similarly, purposes such as 
uncovering or preventing criminal acts entail risk of abuse. Even more troublesome, in our 
view, is the reference to authorities as an alternative to courts. The law fails to specify the 
competent authorities that together with courts would be entitled to request disclosure of 
identity of the source. The provision leaves broad discretion to authorities to determine 
what qualifies as &#8220;exceptionally justified cases&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>902. In your Government&#8217;s response to our letter dated 18 February 2010, it was noted 
that although Article 6(3) of the Press and Media Act stated that courts and authorities may, 
in exceptional cases, request the disclosure of the identity of the source, this did not in itself 
mean that any court or any authority was vested to implement this power, regardless of the 
procedure or investigation it pursued. In fact, this provision may only be applied in the 
context of criminal investigation, as identification of sources may only be requested &#8220;in the 
interest of protecting national security and public order or uncovering or preventing 
criminal acts&#8221; &#8211; this limited the scope of the provision to authorities with criminal 
investigative powers defined in other statutory provisions, such as the Code on Penal 
Procedure. According to the information provided by your Government, such decisions 
were always subject to judicial review by the courts. Your Government also asserted that 
this set of guarantees excluded the possibility of any arbitrary rulings.  
</p>
<p>903. Your Government also emphasized that prior to the adoption of the Press and Media 
Act, the scope for protection of journalistic sources was much narrower under the 
Hungarian law (Act II. of 1986 on the press). Under the legal regime of Act 11 of 1986 on 
the Press, the relevant act before the recently enacted legislation, journalistic sources did 
not enjoy any special protection in the context of criminal proceedings. In the light of this, 
Your Government alleges that the provisions of the new legislation regarding the right of 
journalists to protect their sources of information could not be described as a &#8220;regressive 
step&#8221; in any way. 
</p>
<p>904. With respect to the comments provided by your Government, we would like to 
highlight the principal requirements for regulations, including legislation, interfering with 
the rights and freedoms. Any restriction to the freedom of expression must be established in 
law, which is accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly and with precision so as to enable 
individuals to foresee whether a particular action is unlawful. At a very minimum, the 
present provision is not drawn narrowly and with precision given that it grants the 
possibility for any authority to request the disclosure of journalists&#8217; sources. 
</p>
<p>905. In line with the rationale first outlined by the ECtHR in <i>Sunday Times v. the United 
Kingdom</i>, persons must be able &#8211; if need be with appropriate advice &#8211; to foresee, to a 
degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences that will follow from a 
given action.22 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>132</b>  
</p>
<p>906. Both the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers23 and the Parliamentary 
Assembly24 have issued Recommendations regarding the protection of journalists&#8217; sources. 
In reference to Hungary, the Parliamentary Assembly stated that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Referring to the new Press and Media Law of Hungary (Law CIV of 2010 on the freedom 
of the press and the fundamental rules on media content), the Assembly expresses its 
concern that limits to the exercise of media freedom fixed by Article 4(3) and the 
exceptions to the right of journalists not to disclose their sources stipulated in Article 6 of 
this Law seem to be overly broad and thus may cause a severe chilling effect on media 
freedom. This Law sets forth neither the procedural conditions concerning disclosures nor 
guarantees for journalists requested to disclose their sources&#8221;.25   
</p>
<p>907. In <i>Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands</i>, apart from the standard of the &#8220;quality 
of law&#8221; (i.e. precision and foreseeability), the ECtHR stressed that Article 10 ECHR 
requires procedural safeguards in domestic law, including an assessment by an impartial 
and independent body against a decision not to protect a journalist&#8217;s source.26  
</p>
<p>908. The Johannesburg principles on national security, freedom of expression and access 
to information also specifically provide in Principle 18 that &#8220;protection of national security 
may not be used as a reason to compel a journalist to reveal a confidential source&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>909. In our view, any decision compelling the disclosure is subject to an accurate 
assessment by an independent and impartial body and on the basis of precise and 
foreseeable guidelines. The present provision does not meet this benchmark. 
</p>
<p>Article 8 
</p>
<p>(1)  The media content provider and the persons employed by or engaged, in any 
other legal relationship intended for the performance of work, with the media 
content provider may not be held liable for any breach of law committed in 
connection with obtaining information of public interest provided the particular 
piece of information could not have been obtained otherwise or when the difficulties 
endured while obtaining such information would be out of proportion, unless such 
breach of law constitutes a disproportionate or serious violation and such 
information was obtained in disregard of the Act on the protection of qualified data.  
</p>
<p>(2)  The entitlement laid down in paragraph (1) does not constitute an exemption 
from the enforceability of claims under civil law for compensation for damage in 
property caused by such unlawful conduct.  
</p>
<p>910. Although in principle article 8 guarantees non-prosecution of journalists for 
violating the law in the process of obtaining information of &#8220;public interest&#8221; so long as the 
information could not have been obtained through legal means, we are concerned that this 
provision contains a considerably broad exception for those cases in which journalists 
reveal &#8220;qualified data&#8221; and it is unclear what kind of information constitutes such data.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>133 
</b></p>
<p>Article 10 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>Everyone shall have the right to receive proper information on public affairs at local, 
national and EU level, as well as on any event bearing relevance to the citizens of 
the Republic of Hungary and the members of the Hungarian nation. It is a task for 
the entirety of the media system to provide authentic, rapid and accurate information 
on such affairs and events. 
</p>
<p>911. In our view, introducing terms such as &#8220;proper&#8221; into the provision on the right to 
information is tantamount to undermining guarantees of pluralism in Hungary&#8217;s 
constitutional order. It is difficult to see how terms such as &#8220;proper&#8221; and &#8220;authentic&#8221; 
correspond to the State&#8217;s obligation to ensure &#8220;range of opinion&#8221; and &#8220;diversity&#8221; as often 
referred in the judgments of the ECtHR. In <i>Manole et al. v. Moldova</i>, for example, the 
ECtHR stressed that States must be the ultimate guarantors of pluralism and that the 
principles on media pluralism derived from Article 10 ECHR &#8220;place a duty on the State to 
ensure, first, that the public has access through television and radio to (&#8230;) a range of 
opinion and comment, reflecting inter alia the diversity of political outlook within the 
country&#8221;.27  
</p>
<p>912. We would like to stress that, pursuant to Article 19 of the ICCPR, the public has the 
right to receive information as a corollary to the specific function of any journalist to impart 
information.28 
</p>
<p>Article 11 
</p>
<p>In the Republic of Hungary, the public service media operates in order to preserve 
and strengthen integrity both on a national and European level, foster national, 
family, ethnic and religious communities, as well as promote and enrich national and 
minority languages and culture and meet the needs of citizens for information and 
culture.  
</p>
<p>913. In our view, this article, in conjunction with other provisions in the law, namely 
article 20(5) and article 17, may lead to propagating the idea that abstract or subjective 
notions or concepts, such as the State, national symbols, national identity, cultures, 
religions, ideologies or political doctrines be protected as such. The rigorous protection of 
religions as such may create an atmosphere of intolerance and can give rise to fear or even 
provoke the chances of a backlash.29 International human rights law protects individuals 
and groups of people, but not abstract notions or institutions that are subject to scrutiny, 
comment, criticism or ridicule.30 
</p>
<p>914. In justification of the present language in Article 11, your Government refers to 
Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)3 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe 
on the remit of public service media in the information society and the resolution of the 4th 
Council of Europe ministerial conference on mass media (&#8220;Prague Resolution&#8221;), which 
stressed the necessity of promoting intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. In our view, 
this does not mean that media legislation in any given country must specifically restrict the 
role of the media as currently prescribed in Article 11. We believe that in any democratic 
society, media must be free to decide on its content and role to be pursued.

</p>
<p>Article 13 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>(1)  The media content providers as a whole shall have the task to provide 
authentic, rapid and accurate information on local, national and EU public affairs 
and on the events that bear relevance to the citizens of the Republic of Hungary and 
the members of the Hungarian nation. 
</p>
<p>(2)  Linear and on-demand media services engaged in the provision of 
information shall provide comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, objective and balanced 
coverage on local, national and European issues that may be of interest for the 
general public and on any event bearing relevance to the citizens of the Republic of 
Hungary and the members of the Hungarian nation. The detailed rules of this 
obligation shall be set by act in accordance with the requirements of proportionality 
and a democratic public opinion.  
</p>
<p>915. This provision imposes an overly strict obligation. Authorities may determine what 
qualifies as an objective and balanced coverage. In Your Government&#8217;s response to our 
letter dated 18 February 2011, it was stated that this provision is a declarative one, 
indicating that the totality of the Hungarian media system shall provide adequate 
information to citizens. In the response, it was noted that that this provision did not provide 
for any legally enforceable obligation for each and every media content provider. 
</p>
<p>916. With regard to the issue of balanced and objective presentation of the news, Your 
Government emphasized that this was not a legal requirement for the print media or 
Internet news providers under the present Hungarian legislation. According to the 
information received from your Government, Article 13(2) of the Press and Media Act is 
applicable only to radio, television and television-like media content, i.e. non-linear 
audiovisual media services, within the meaning of the corresponding EU directive. In the 
event of a violation of this obligation, the only &#8220;sanction&#8221; applicable by the authorities was 
the obligation to make viewers/listeners aware that they had received biased or inaccurate 
information, or the obligation to remedy biases and/or inaccuracies in the presentation. 
Your Government also made reference to recital 102 of the Directive 2010/13/EU of the 
European Parliament and of the Council explicitly referring to the common practice of 
imposing the obligation on television broadcasters to present facts and events fairly. While 
this is the case, such guidelines are part of the policy objectives which are not suitable as 
stringent legal requirements. For purposes of Article 19(3) of the ICCPR, a norm, to be 
characterised as a &#8220;law&#8221;, must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable an 
individual to regulate his or her conduct accordingly.31 We consider that the reference to 
balanced coverage in accordance with the requirements of proportionality and democratic 
public opinion only adds to the vagueness of the law and ensuing sanctions contained 
therein.  
</p>
<p>917. Your Government has also indicated that the requirement of balanced presentation 
had been in existence in the Hungarian legislation since 1996. The requirement was 
supported by the decisions of the Hungarian Constitutional Court; its precise content had 
been developed over the 15-year lifespan of the former media authority, and in the 
Hungarian courts. Your Government stressed that courts performing judicial review 
concerning the related activities of the media authority were bound by this substantial body 
of constitutional jurisprudence &#8211; just as the authority itself. Given the fact that the precise 
content of the said requirement was well defined in case law, Your Government stated that 
media content providers are not facing a new, &#8220;overly broad&#8221; or &#8220;vague&#8221; concept, the

</b></p>
<p>application of which may produce a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on them. &#8220;A law may not confer 
unfettered discretion for the restriction of freedom of expression on those charged with its 
execution&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p>918. With respect to your Government&#8217;s comments, in our view, it remains unclear how 
the legal requirements for the media to provide &#8220;comprehensive, factual, up-to-date, 
objective, and balanced coverage&#8221; are necessary for achieving one of the aims set out in 
article 19(3) of the ICCPR. The severity of these obligations may have a negative impact on 
the effective freedom and diversity of views expressed by media. 
</p>
<p>919. Similar uncertainties remain with regard to conformity of requirements set out in 
this provision vis-&#224;-vis Article 10(1) of the ECHR, which not only extends its protection to 
information, ideas and opinions which are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or 
as a matter of indifference, &#8220;but also to those that offend, shock or disturb the State or any 
sector of the population. Such are the demands of pluralism, tolerance and 
broadmindedness, without which there is no &#8216;democratic society&#8217;&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>920. Pursuant to your Government&#8217;s agreement with the European Commission, on-
demand audiovisual media is now exempted from the tasks prescribed under article 13(2), 
while it is still subject to those prescribed in article 13(1). Although it would seem that the 
requirement of &#8220;balanced&#8221; reporting is no longer applicable to blogs, it is still applicable to 
audiovisual media as well as Internet linear content providers.  
</p>
<p>921. If the requirement of proportionality is to be kept, we would like to remind your 
Government that it involves the assessment of the restriction in terms of severity and 
intensity vis-&#224;-vis the purpose being sought and it should under no circumstances become 
the rule. The HRCtee, when applying the proportionality test of Article 19(3) of the ICCPR 
in individual cases, regularly refers to the freedoms of expression and information as 
cornerstones in any free and democratic society.34 In its General Comment No. 27, the 
HRCtee observed that &#8220;restrictive measures must conform to the principle of 
proportionality; they must be appropriate to achieve their protective function; they must be 
the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve their protective function; 
they must be proportionate to the interest to be protected (&#8230;) The principle of 
proportionality has to be respected not only in the law that frames the restrictions but also 
by the administrative and judicial authorities in applying the law&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p>922. The principle of proportionality must also take account of the form of expression at 
issue. For instance, the value placed by the Covenant upon uninhibited expression is 
particularly high in the circumstances of public debate in democratic society concerning 
figures in the public and political domain.36

<p>923. In light of a number of issues raised with regard to this provision, we recommend 
that Article 13 be deleted altogether. 
</p>
<p>Article 14 
</p>
<p>(1)  The media content provider shall &#8211; in the media content that it publishes and 
while preparing such media content &#8211; respect human dignity.  
</p>
<p>(2)  No self-gratifying and detrimental coverage of persons in humiliating or 
defenseless situations is allowed in the media content.   
</p>
<p>924. This article emphasizes the need of the media content to respect human dignity. In 
this respect it prohibits self-gratifying and detrimental coverage of persons in humiliating or 
defenceless situations. We are concerned that such terms are unclear and vague, and would 
need further elaboration with regard to how such requirement constitutes one of the 
legitimate aims set out in article 19(3).   
</p>
<p>925. In response to the argument that human dignity may serve as an unjustified 
limitation on the right of freedom of expression, Your Government has stressed that such a 
notion was well-defined in the Hungarian legal system, with a number of interpretative 
decisions by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, the former media authority and the 
Hungarian courts. Moreover, human dignity was explicitly referred to in the European 
audiovisual media legislation, particularly in the Directive on Audiovisual Media Services 
and in related recommendations by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe. 
The concept is also present in the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, for example in the case C-
377/98 <i>the Netherlands v. the European Parliament and the Council</i> (ECR 2001, p. I-
7079). As a consequence, the legal concept of &#8220;human dignity&#8221; had become instrumental in 
combating racism, xenophobia and hate speech in Europe. Therefore, Your Government 
has maintained that its use in the Hungarian legislation is an important safeguard of 
democratic values and in no way an unjustified restriction on freedom of the press or 
freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>926. Regarding the reference in Article 14(2) to &#8220;self-gratifying and detrimental coverage 
of persons in humiliating or defenceless situation&#8221;, your Government has noted that a well-
established case law from the Hungarian courts &#8211; based on a decision by the Hungarian 
Constitutional Court &#8211; has clearly defined the limits and the scope of criticism that holders 
of public office must tolerate. The approach taken by the Constitutional Court and by the 
courts of Hungary was consistent with the Council of Europe declaration adopted by the 
Committee of Ministers on 12 February 2004 at the 872nd meeting of the Ministers&#8217; 
Deputies on &#8220;freedom of political debate in the media&#8221;. In line with this declaration, the 
Hungarian legislation continued to fulfil the requirement that &#8220;political figures and public 
officials should only have access to those legal remedies against the media which private 
individuals have in case of violations of their rights by the media&#8221;. Your Government has 
noted that the exclusion of those holding public office from any form of legal remedy in the 
event of the violation of their dignity seemed to be a requirement going beyond what was 
necessary to ensure the possibility of public scrutiny.   
</p>
<p>927. Despite the above clarifications provided by your Government, we are concerned 
that this provision could be subject to differing interpretations and abuse. In particular, we 
would like to reiterate that public officials and authorities should tolerate more criticism, 
including those that may be offensive or humiliating, because of the nature of their 
mandate, since public office entails public scrutiny as part of checks and balances in any 
democratic society.37

<p> <b>137 
</b></p>
<p>Article 17 
</p>
<p>(1)  The media content may not incite hatred against persons, nations, 
communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and other minorities or any majority as well 
as any church or religious groups. 
</p>
<p>(2)  The media content may not [offend or] discriminate [neither directly nor in 
an implied manner,] persons, nations, communities, national, ethnic, linguistic and 
other minorities or any majority as well as any church or religious groups.  
</p>
<p>928. According to the response received from your Government, the purpose of Article 
17 is to provide the opportunity for effective legal remedies when addressing problems 
related to racism, xenophobia or anti-Semitism, thereby helping to prevent the development 
of a climate of intolerance. Hence, the article sought to combat all ideologies, policies and 
practices characterized by incitement to racial hatred, violence and discrimination, as well 
as any action or language likely to strengthen fears and tensions between groups from 
different racial, ethnic, national, religious or social backgrounds.  
</p>
<p>929. Despite the clarification provided by your Government and the changes made in 
Article 17 of the Press and Media Act, we are still concerned that its wording continues to 
be overly broad and seems to protect &#8220;any church or religious group&#8221; <i>per se</i>. We have 
stated on many occasions that abstract or subjective notions or concepts, such as the State, 
national symbols, national identity, cultures, schools of thought, religions, ideologies or 
political doctrines should not be protected as such. Otherwise, the rigorous protection of 
religions as such may create an atmosphere of intolerance and can give rise to fear and may 
even provoke the chances of a backlash.38 We would like to reiterate that international 
human rights law protects individuals and groups of people, but not abstract notions or 
institutions that are subject to scrutiny, comment, criticism or ridicule.39 The principle that 
individuals rather than religions <i>per se</i> are the rights-holders was also recently reiterated 
during the 16th session of the Human Rights Council through its resolutions on &#8220;freedom of 
religion or belief&#8221;40 and on &#8220;combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and 
stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence, and violence against persons 
based on religion or belief&#8221;.41 
</p>
<p>930. The Camden Principles on Freedom of Expression and Equality42 provide useful 
guidance for the interpretation of international law and standards, inter alia with regard to 
incitement to hatred. We have highlighted Principle 12 which clarifies that the terms <i>hatred</i> 
and <i>hostility</i> refer to &#8220;intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation 
towards the target group&#8221;, that the term <i>advocacy</i> is to be understood as &#8220;requiring an 
intention to promote hatred publicly towards the target group&#8221; and that the term <i>incitement</i> 
refers to &#8220;statements about national, racial or religious groups which create an imminent 
risk of discrimination, hostility or violence against persons belonging to those groups&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>931. We express concerns that the powers of the Media Council may arbitrarily extend 
the interpretation of offences of inciting hatred or discrimination as provided in the 
Criminal Code. Similarly, there is little justification for referring in the same provision to 
majorities or churches which already benefit from an extensive protection in the country.  
</p>
<p>932. We recommend that Article 17 be brought in line with international human rights 
standards, including with article 20 of the ICCPR (which prohibits any advocacy of

<p><i> IV.  Article by Article Commentary on The Media Law 
</i></p>
<p>934. The present section of the memorandum provides a commentary on those articles of 
the Media Law, which we find most problematic in terms of their compliance with 
international human rights norms and standards. For ease of reference, each comment is 
preceded by relevant extracts from the law. The amended provisions, as adopted on 7 
March 2011 by the Parliament of Hungary, are already taken into account (deletions appear 
in brackets and strikethrough, while additions are underscored). 
</p>
<p>Article 12 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>(2)  Subject to the nature of the programme the balanced nature of the 
communication shall be ensured within the given programme or in a series of 
programmes in the case of programmes appearing regularly.  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>935. Under Article 12(2), reference is made to the requirement of the &#8220;balanced nature of 
the communication&#8221;. While it is true that such a requirement was already part of the former 
Media Law in Hungary, under that law there was no authority entitled to investigate 
violations and no sanctions were foreseen. Under the current legislation, media responsible 
for an allegedly &#8220;unbalanced&#8221; reporting are subject to burdensome proceedings as 
prescribed by the Media Authority.  
</p>
<p>Article 14 
</p>
<p>The viewers or listeners shall be given a forewarning prior to broadcasting any 
image or sound effects that may potentially infringe a person&#8217;s religion, faith related 
or other philosophical convictions or which are violent or otherwise disturbing.   
</p>
<p>936. We find this provision to be troublesome and overly broad, with terms such as 
&#8220;philosophical convictions&#8221; or &#8220;otherwise disturbing&#8221;. It is extremely difficult to see how it 
can be implemented without bringing in subjective views. 
</p>
<p>Article 15 
</p>
<p>During a state of distress, state of emergency or state of extreme danger (&#8230;) the 
Parliament, the Defence Council, the President of the Republic and the Government, 
as well as the persons and organizations defined in other acts may order the media 
service provider to the extent necessary to publish, free of charge, any public service 
announcements in connection with the existing state of affairs or situation in the 
prescribed form and time, or may prohibit the publication of certain announcements 
or programmes. (&#8230;)  
</p>
<p>937. We find that the terms &#8220;state of distress&#8221;, &#8220;state of emergency&#8221; and &#8220;state of extreme 
danger&#8221; are overly broad and may serve as a justification for disproportionate interferences 
with the right to freedom of expression.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>139 
</b></p>
<p>Article 16 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>(2) The Media Council shall designate for the purposes of the audiovisual media 
service providers defined in paragraph (1), the events of considerable importance to 
society in an administrative resolution subsequent to a public hearing. In this 
resolution the Media Council shall also establish whether the events of considerable 
importance to society should be broadcast live or subsequently. In the course of 
adopting the resolution it should also be given consideration that a wide range of 
viewers should show interest in the event classified as one of considerable 
importance, and that the event should be a world- or Europe-wide event, or one with 
Hungarian significance, which, save for events exclusively of Hungarian 
significance, is aired in a significant number of European countries.  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>938. In our view, this article is excessively prescriptive and effectively undermines the 
independence of media in selecting content of its services. There is no justification for the 
media to avoid transmitting live certain events, which are concurrently transmitted on other 
European channels.   
</p>
<p>Article 22 
</p>
<p>(1) The rules stipulated in Articles 20 and 21 shall not apply to (&#8230;) 
</p>
<p> (c)  the media service which broadcasts its service exclusively in a 
language different from that of the Member States of the European Union; where 
programmes are broadcasted in this language or languages most of the time,  the 
rules shall not be applicable to the given part of programme time;  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>939. We believe that the above provision amounts to an unjustified discrimination against 
media services provided in one of the official languages of the European Union.  
</p>
<p>Article 24 
</p>
<p>(1)  The commercial communication broadcasted in the media service  
</p>
<p> (a)  may not infringe upon human dignity;  
</p>
<p> (b)  may not contain and may not support discrimination on grounds of 
gender, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, religion or philosophical conviction, 
physical or mental disability, age or sexual orientation;  
</p>
<p> (c)  may not directly invite minors to purchase or rent a certain product or 
to use a service;  
</p>
<p> (d)  may not directly call on minors to persuade their parents or others to 
purchase the advertised goods or to use the advertised services;  
</p>
<p> (e)  may not exploit on the special trust minors towards their parents, 
teachers or other persons or the inexperience of and credulity of minors;  
</p>
<p> (f)  may not unreasonably show minors in dangerous situations;  
</p>
<p> (g)  may not express religious, conscientious or philosophical convictions 
except for commercial communications broadcasted in thematic media services 
concerning a religious topic;  
</p>
<p> (h)  may not infringe upon the dignity of a national symbol or a religious 
conviction.  </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>140</b>  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>940. We recommend that broad formulations, such as commercial communication that 
&#8220;may not infringe upon human dignity&#8221;, be deleted.  
</p>
<p>941. The provision in Article 24(1)(g) in the Media Law provides that commercial 
communication broadcasted in the media service &#8220;(g) may not express religious, 
conscientious or philosophical convictions except for commercial communications 
broadcasted in thematic media services concerning a religious topic&#8221;; this overly broad 
formulation may constitute an undue limitation both on freedom of religion or belief and on 
the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>Article 41 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>(2)  On-demand and ancillary media services [subject to this Act provided by a 
media service provider with a registered office (domicile) on the territory of the 
Republic of Hungary shall be registered with the Authority. The said shall also be 
applicable to a media product published by a publisher with a registered office 
(domicile) on the territory of the Republic of Hungary] provided by media service 
providers established in the Republic of Hungary under the scope of this Act shall be 
notified to the Authority for registration within 60 days following the 
commencement of the service or activity. The registration is not a condition for 
taking up a service or activity. 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>942. Registration must be completed not prior but in the first 60 days of operation of the 
outlets. This transforms the permissive type of registration into a notifying one. 
Nevertheless, we believe that the requirement of registration is problematic (please refer to 
the commentary on Article 46 of the Media Law). The current wording of the provision still 
provides the Media Authority with the power to stop the media service or activity upon the 
expiry of the 60-day period. 
</p>
<p>943. We are concerned that the mandatory registration requirement still remains an 
absolute condition for providing media services. The amendment introduced by the 
Parliament only postpones the date of registration by up to 60 days, but the mandatory 
obligation remains unchanged (please refer to commentary of Article 46 of the Media 
Law).  
</p>
<p>Article 42 
</p>
<p>(7)  The Authority shall cancel the linear media service provision from the 
register in the event that  
</p>
<p> (&#8230;) 
</p>
<p> f)  the Media Council has, in consequence of the media service 
provider&#8217;s repeated severe violation of the law, decreed said legal sanction with due 
consideration of those set forth in Articles 185-187.  
</p>
<p>944. We recommend that para. 7(f) be deleted from the list of conditions under which the 
Media Authority can cancel the linear media service provision from the register. While 
administrative sanctions may remain within the mandate of the Media Council, we are 
convinced that any sanction for repeated severe violations of the law, which could possibly 
entail suspension of the linear media provider, should be adjudicated by an independent 
judicial body. 
</p>
<p>945. In <i>Findlay v. United Kingdom</i>, the ECtHR stated that &#8220;in order to establish whether 
a tribunal can be considered as &#8216;independent&#8217;, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner 
of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>141 
</b></p>
<p>outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of 
independence (&#8230;)&#8221;.43The Court continued as follows: &#8220;[a]s to the question of &#8216;impartiality&#8217;, 
there are two aspects to this requirement. First, the tribunal must be subjectively free of 
personal prejudice or bias. Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, 
that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect 
(&#8230;) The concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked (&#8230;)&#8221;.44 
</p>
<p>946. Similarly, in defining the impartiality and independence of courts, the United 
Nations Human Rights Committee takes into account &#8220;the manner in which judges are 
appointed, the qualifications for appointment, and the duration of their terms of office&#8221;.45 
</p>
<p>947. We believe that the above analysis is instructive in assessing the independence and 
impartiality of the Media Authority in the Republic of Hungary.  
</p>
<p>Article 45 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>(1)  The registration of on-demand media services may be initiated by the [future] 
media service provider thereof. The notification to the Authority of the on-demand 
media service shall include:  
</p>
<p>(3)  The Authority shall [issue a regulatory decision on the registration] register 
[of] the on-demand media service within thirty days. [In the event that the Authority

<p>(8a)  In the event the publisher or founder of a press product fails to comply with 
its obligations related to registration, the Authority may impose a fine up to one 
million forints, taking into consideration the principles set forth in Article 185(2).  
</p>
<p>949. Art. 10(1) of the ECHR allows States to establish licensing procedures for audio-
visual broadcasters, television and cinema enterprises. However, there is no reference in the 
Convention to mandatory registration of the printed press, which in the ECtHR&#8217;s case-law 
has been intentionally accorded a broader scope of protection.  
</p>
<p>950. In <i>Gaweda v. Poland</i>, the ECtHR noted that &#8220;although Article 10 of the Convention 
does not in terms prohibit the imposition of prior restraints on publications (&#8230;) the relevant 
law must provide a clear indication of the circumstances when such restraints are 
permissible and, a fortiori, when the consequences of the restraint are to block publication 
of a periodical completely (&#8230;) This is so because of the potential threat that such prior 
restraints, by their very nature, pose to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 
10&#8221;.46 In that case, the Court dealt with the case where Polish authorities refused to register 
two periodicals on the grounds that the publications were &#8220;inconsistent with the real state of 
affairs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>951. In its para. 8.15, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly&#8217;s Resolution 1636 
(2008) on indicators for media in a democracy provides that print media and Internet-based 
media should not be required to possess a State licence, other than a mere business or tax 
registration document. We share the view of the Council of Europe Commissioner for 
Human Rights that print media and Internet-based media should not subject to any 
registration requirements. 
</p>
<p>952. In its draft General Comment No. 34, the United Nations Human Rights Committee 
stressed that States parties to the ICCPR must avoid imposing onerous licensing conditions 
and fees on the broadcast media, including on community and commercial stations.47 The 
criteria for the application of such conditions and license fees should be reasonable and 
objective,48 clear,49 transparent,50 non-discriminatory and otherwise in compliance with the 
ICCPR.51 For example, reference in Article 46(5)(a) to &#8220;a conflict of interest&#8221; does not meet 
the aforementioned requirements.  
</p>
<p>953. In <i>Mavlonov and Sa&#8217;di v. Uzbekistan</i>, the United Nations HRCtee found that &#8220;the 
application of the procedure of registration and re-registration (&#8230;) did not allow Mr. 
Mavlonov, as the editor, and Mr. Sa&#8217;di, as a reader, to practice their freedom of expression, 
as defined in article 19, paragraph 2 [of the ICCPR]&#8221;.52 The Committee noted that &#8220;the 
public has a right to receive information as a corollary of the specific function of a 
journalist and/or editor to impart information.&#8221;53 
</p>
<p>954. Article 45(8) and Article 46(8)(a) further confirm our concerns with regard to the 
unsatisfactory amendment introduced with regard to the registration requirement. The 
present provisions provide for an additional form of pecuniary sanction (up to one million

<p> c)  in regard to which no final public administration ruling has established 
a gross breach of obligations stemming from a broadcasting or an official contract 
undertaken on the basis of a previous tender procedure closed no later than five 
years, and the broadcasting or official contract of which has not been terminated 
may take part in the tender procedure. 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>955. The provision contained in Article 55(1)(c) gives the authorities the discretion to 
exercise undue influence on the media service provider, which while accountable to an 
administrative regulatory mechanism, may be prevented from freely publishing or 
broadcasting content critical of the Government. For example, we are concerned that the 
Media Council can exclude any company from participating in tenders for licenses if, in the 
last five years, a media outlet owned by the company has been reprimanded by the same 
Media Council for a &#8220;gross&#8221; or &#8220;grave&#8221; violation. Article 55(2) adds that the same rationale 
is applicable to any company that has a controlling stake or may be part of such a stake. A 
similar rationale is applicable to the Television programmes (see Article 187(3)(e)). 
</p>
<p>Article 70 
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>(2)  In order to clarify the relevant facts and circumstances, the Media Council 
may require media service providers to disclose data in its administrative 
verification proceedings by way of a final decision. No independent legal remedy 
may beclaimed against the final decision; the final decision may be contested in the 
legalremedy following the administrative verification brought against the material 
decision made in the procedure aimed at the prevention of media market 
concentration and at determining media service providers with substantial influence. 
The final decision may be challenged in a legal remedy procedure brought against 
the decision of substance made in a procedure that follows the authority supervision 
and is aimed at the prevention of media market concentration and at determining 
media service providers with substantial influence.  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>956. We are concerned that sanctioned media service providers with substantial influence 
do not have an effective right to appeal and review by a judicial body. In addition, they do 
not seem to be allowed to appeal on the merits. Their appeal can only be considered if the 
Media Council is claimed to have violated the Media Law, for example, for non-
compliance with deadlines, violating rules of procedure, etc. For instance, sanctioned media 
service providers seem to be unable to contest the amount of the fine imposed, as the Media 
Council has unrestricted power to define whether an alleged violation by media service 
provider was a &#8216;light&#8217; or a &#8216;grave&#8217; one in accordance with Article 187.  
</p>
<p>Article 102 
</p>
<p>(1)  Public service broadcasters are headed by a general director, they do not hava 
Board of Directors. The general director shall &#8211; within the scope of this Act &#8211; 
exercise all those powers, which the Act on Business Associations confers upon the 
Board of Directors of a company limited by shares. A work contract must be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>145 
</b></p>
<p>executed with the general director, and his or her remuneration must be defined as a 
fixed monthly sum payable by the public service broadcaster under his or her 
management.  
</p>
<p>(2)  The Board of Trustees is vested with employer&#8217;s rights in relation to the 
general directors of public service broadcasters, which includes the appointment of 
general directors and the termination of their employment. General directors are 
nominated and appointed in the following step-by-step order:  
</p>
<p> a)  the chairperson of the Media Council proposes two general directors 
to the Media Council in relation to each public service broadcaster,  
</p>
<p> b)  if the Media Council approves of these candidates, then it shall submit 
the nominations to the Board of Trustees, asking it to select one of the candidates,  
</p>
<p> c)  if the Media Council does not approve of either of the candidates 
proposed by the chairperson of the Media Council, then the chairperson of the 
Media Council shall propose a new candidate. The Media Council may nominate a 
candidate to the Board of Trustees only if it had already approved two candidates,  
</p>
<p> d)  the Media Council may also propose certain substantive elements to 
be included in the general director&#8217;s work contract,  
</p>
<p> e)  during the first round of voting, members of the Board of Trustees &#8211; 
including its chairperson &#8211; shall come to a decision concerning the appointment of 
the general director with a two-thirds majority of votes,  
</p>
<p> f)  if the Board of Trustees fails to make a selection with a two-thirds 
majority of votes from the two candidates nominated by the Media Council within 
thirty days from the date when they were nominated, then a new nomination 
procedure must be carried out,  
</p>
<p> g)  in the course of the new nomination, two new candidates must be 
proposed per public service broadcaster,  
</p>
<p> h)  during the vote taking place after a new nomination, all members of 
the Board of Trustees &#8211; including its chairperson &#8211; shall come to a decision 
concerning the appointment of the general director with a simple majority of votes.  
</p>
<p>(&#8230;) 
</p>
<p>957. According to Recommendation No. R(96) 10 of the Committee of Ministers of the 
Council of Europe, &#8220;[t]he rules governing the status of the boards of management of public 
service broadcasting organisations, especially their membership, should be defined in a 
manner which avoids placing the boards at risk of any political or other interference&#8221;. 
Similarly, the guidelines provide that &#8220;[t]he legal framework governing public service 
broadcasting organisations should stipulate that their boards of management are solely 
responsible for the day-to-day operation of their organisation&#8221;. Hence, it clarifies that 
interference in the day-to-day management of the activities of public service broadcasting 
organizations is prohibited not only for all authorities outside the organizations but also for 
their own supervisory bodies. 
</p>
<p>958. Article 102(2) provides that the Prime-Minister-appointed President of the 
Authority, who is also the President of the Media Council, is the only person who has a 
right to propose candidates for senior management posts of public service broadcasters. The 
other members of the Media Council can approve or reject the proposals. The Board of 
Trustees can select among two candidates.  
</p>
<p>959. We are concerned that the head of the Media Council is the only person in the 
system entitled to appoint the CEOs of the four existing media outlets (MTV; Hungarian </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>146</b>  
</p>
<p>Radio; Danube TV; Hungarian News Agency), who is not required to follow any criteria or 
public procedure. In other words, all public service broadcasting newsmakers are composed 
of the employees of a Fund established under the Media Council (please refer to Chapter V 
of the Media Law). We support the view of the Commissioner for Human Rights of the 
Council of Europe that such an arrangement in the law &#8220;is not reconcilable with Council of 
Europe standards aimed at preserving the independence, especially editorial, of the public 
service broadcasting from interference, notably political, from any external authority.  
</p>
<p>Article 109 &#8211; Article 111 
</p>
<p>960. Compliance with the provisions set out in the new media legislation is overseen by 
the Media Authority, consisting of three entities which are indicated in article 109: (a) the 
President of the Authority, who is appointed by the Prime Minister of Hungary for a period 
of nine years; (b) a Media Council of the Authority, whose members are appointed by two 
thirds of the members of the Parliament for a period of nine years; and a Bureau of the 
Authority, headed by a Director-General who is appointed by the President of the 
Authority. 
</p>
<p>961. In its response to our concerns, Your Government noted that the Media Council is 
comprised of professionals elected by a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian National 
Assembly and hence can in no way be regarded as political appointees.  
</p>
<p>962. In any event, the period of nine years should be reduced in our view. It is the longest 
known term of office for members of equivalents of broadcasting regulatory authorities in 
Europe. For instance, according to a Council of Europe 2003 study &#8220;An overview of the 
rules governing broadcasting regulatory authorities in Europe&#8221;, terms of office range 
between 4 and 6 years (7 years in the case of Italy), with the possibility of re-election 
limited in most cases.54  
</p>
<p>Article 123 &#8211; Article 125 
</p>
<p>963. In accordance with Recommendation Rec(2000)23 on the Independence and 
Functions of Regulatory Authorities for the Broadcasting Sector, the Council of Europe 
Committee of Ministers set out detailed prerequisites for the rules regarding the 
membership and functioning of media regulatory authorities: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;II. Appointment, composition and functioning      
</p>
<p> 3.  The rules governing regulatory authorities for the broadcasting sector, 
especially their membership, are a key element of their independence. Therefore, 
they should be defined so as to protect them against any interference, in particular by 
political forces or economic interests.  
</p>
<p>   4.  For this purpose, specific rules should be defined as regards 
incompatibilities in order to avoid that:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; regulatory authorities are under the influence of political power;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; members of regulatory authorities exercise functions or hold interests in 
enterprises or other organisations in the media or related sectors, which might 
lead to a conflict of interest in connection with membership of the regulatory 
authority.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Europe&#8221;, DH-MM(2003)007. See also OSCE, &#8220;Analysis and Assessment of a Package of Hungarian 
Legislation and Draft Legislation on Media and Telecommunications&#8221;, prepared by Dr. Karol 
Jakubowicz, Warsaw, Poland, September 2010, pp. 41-42. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>147 
</b></p>
<p> 5.  Furthermore, rules should guarantee that the members of these 
authorities:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; are appointed in a democratic and transparent manner;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; may not receive any mandate or take any instructions from any person or 
body;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; do not make any statement or undertake any action which may prejudice the 
independence of their functions and do not take any advantage of them.  
</p>
<p> 6.  Finally, precise rules should be defined as regards the possibility to 
dismiss members of regulatory authorities so as to avoid that dismissal be used as a 
means of political pressure&#8221;.55  
</p>
<p>964. In their current form, the provisions regarding the appointment, composition and 
tenure of the media regulatory bodies would, in our view, require amendments to comply 
with the requirements of independence and impartiality (please refer to our comments 
above concerning Article 42).  
</p>
<p> Article 139 &#8211; Article 143 
</p>
<p>965. Through the services of a &#8220;Media Commissioner&#8221;, the Authority and Media Council 
have the right to request any information at any time from any media outlet in the country, 
without any violation of law having been committed by the media outlet on the grounds, 
that it &#8220;is or may be suitable for causing a harm to the equitable interests of users, 
subscribers, viewers, listeners, consumers resorting to media services and media products 
and electronic communications services&#8221; (Art. 140(1)). The Media Commissioner may also 
act <i>ex officio</i> (Art. 140(2)).  
</p>
<p>966. In accordance with Article 142(1), no business/trade secrets or otherwise protected 
data constitute an exception to investigating powers of the Media Commissioner, as defined 
in Article 140. In our view, the Media Commissioner is granted with extensive powers 
which are susceptible to abuse.  
</p>
<p> Article 163 &#8211; Article 166 
</p>
<p>967. The provisions on the available legal remedies are particularly problematic from the 
perspective of international and European legal norms.  
</p>
<p>968. Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that &#8220;[e]veryone 
is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial 
tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations (&#8230;)&#8221;. Article 6 of the ECHR 
requires in particular that there must always exist the possibility of judicial review by an 
independent and impartial tribunal in instances where administrative decisions have 
affected a person&#8217;s civil rights and obligations.  
</p>
<p>969. In <i>Leander v. Sweden</i>, the ECtHR noted that &#8220;Article 13 guarantees the availability 
of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and 
freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order (&#8230;) 
The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the 
competent &#8216;national authority&#8217; both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention 
complaint and to grant appropriate relied (see, inter alia, the <i>Silver</i> judgment of 25 March 
1983, Series A No 61, p 42, &#167; 113(a))&#8221;.56 No effective remedy can be envisaged without 
possibility of review of the merits or a limited possibility to conduct such reviews, which

</b></p>

</p>
<p>would impair a proper examination regarding the existence of a violation of the 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>970. In <i>Glas Nadezhda EOOD and Elenkov v. Bulgaria</i>, the applicants complained, under 
Article 13 in conjunction with Article 10, about the refusal by the Supreme Administrative 
Court to review the merits of a decision by the national Radio and Television Committee 
(NRTC) to deny a radio broadcasting license.57 The ECtHR found a violation of Article 13 
ECHR, noting that the Supreme Administrative Court&#8217;s scope of review fell short of the 
substantive and procedural scrutiny required. 
</p>
<p>971. Article 163(1) suggests that any official decision of the Media Council passed in its 
capacity as Authority of the first instance, for example in fining a media service provider, 
may only be appealed to an administrative court whose scope of review is limited to 
examining the conformity with the media legislation itself. At the same time Article 164(3) 
provides that &#8220;the court shall have the powers to alter the decision passed by the Media 
Council&#8221;, without specifying the nature of the decision. On the face of the law, it is not 
clear to us whether the administrative court has the competence to review the merits of the 
decisions taken by the Media Council and examine their conformity with international and 
European standards.  
</p>
<p>Article 176 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>(1)  When the linear audiovisual media service of a media service provider 
established in another Member State is aimed at the territory of the Republic of 
Hungary, the Media Council shall have the right to apply, solely as regards the 
retransmission of the said service within the territory of the Republic of Hungary, 
the legal consequences as defined in Article 187(3)(b)(c)&#8211;(d) against the media 
service provider under its decision for the period of the infringement but up to 180 
days at the most when the following conditions are in existence:  
</p>
<p> (a)  the media service clearly and materially violates Article 17(1), 19(1) 
or 19(4) of the Press and Media Act or Article 9 or 10(1)&#8211;(3) of this Act,  
</p>
<p>Article 177 [as amended] 
</p>
<p>(1)  When the on-demand audiovisual media service of a media service provider 
established in another Member State is aimed at, is broadcast or published in the 
territory of the Republic of Hungary, the Media Council shall have the right to 
apply, solely as regards the transmission of the said service within the territory of the 
Republic of Hungary, the legal consequences as defined in Article 187(3)[(b)](c)&#8211;(d) 
against the media service provider under its decision for the period of the 
infringement but up to 180 days at the most when the following conditions are in 
existence (&#8230;)

<p>972. Notwithstanding the amendments adopted by the Parliament of Hungary, we remain 
concerned that in accordance with Article 178, the Media Authority retains the power to 
launch procedures against linear radio services, online and printed medial products. 
According to the EU Audiovisual Directive, &#8220;notwithstanding the application of the country 
of origin principle, Member States may still take measures that restrict freedom of

</b></p>
<p> <b>149 
</b></p>
<p>movement of television broadcasting, but only under the conditions and following the 
procedure laid down in this Directive&#8221;. We also raise our concerns regarding the 
conformity of Article 178(1)(a) with the requirements set forth in the aforementioned 
Directive, in particular given the unclear and broad language of that provision (&#8220;the 
protection of public order, the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal acts, 
necessary on account of infringement of the prohibition of inciting hatred against 
communities, for the protection of minors, public health, public security, national security 
and consumers and investors&#8221;).  
</p>
<p> Article 181- Article 184 
</p>
<p>973. The Media Authority is entitled to sanction media service providers for coverage 
issues, in particular for failing to comply with the obligation of &#8220;balanced communication&#8221;. 
We believe that the procedure in case of infringement of such obligation as set forth in 
Article 181 is burdensome and may impose unnecessary restrictions on the freedom of 
media service providers.     
</p>
<p> Article 185 &#8211; Article 189 
</p>
<p>974. These provisions identify legal consequences that the Media Council is entitled to 
apply to media service providers for breaches of the act. They include suspension of a 
media service provider for up to one week in cases of repeated and grave infringements 
(article 187(3)), as well as imposition of overly high fines up to HUF 50,000,000 for a 
media service provider, HUF 25,000,000 for a newspaper with nationwide distribution, 
HUF 10,000,000 for a weekly periodical with nationwide distribution, HUF 5,000,000 for 
other newspapers or periodicals, HUF 25,000,000 for an online media product, HUF 
5,000,000 for a broadcaster, and HUF 3,000,000 for an intermediary service provider. 
</p>
<p>975. In assessing the proportionality of such sanctions vis-&#224;-vis the purposes sought, two 
elements must be taken into account (the nature and severity of the penalty imposed).58 
Similarly, no sanction can have the effect of discouraging the press from expressing 
criticism.59 For instance, in <i>&#220;rper et al. v. Turkey</i>, the ECtHR held that the decision of the 
Turkish authorities to suspend the publication of several newspapers for periods of up to 
one month was based on an assumption that the applicants &#8220;would re-commit the same kind 
of offences in the future&#8221;. The Court held that the preventive effect of such suspension 
orders entailed implicit sanctions on the applicants, which had the effect of dissuading them 
from publishing similar articles or news reports in the future, thereby hindering their 
professional activities.60 The Court also considered that alternative measures to suspension, 
such as the confiscation of particular issues of the newspapers or restriction on their 
publication of specific articles could meet the purpose of interference. Hence, it would 
seem that <i>a priori</i> Article 187(3)(d) runs counter the above interpretation by the ECtHR.  
</p>
<p>976. The amendments proposed by your Government following discussions with the 
European Commission do not include any reduction of overly high administrative fees. 
Your Government justified the provisions establishing the administrative penalties by 
stating that &#8220;a broadcaster with annual revenue of several tens of billions or even hundreds 
of millions of forints will not be affected by a fine to the tune of a few hundred thousand 
forints, which will not prevent it from repeating its infringing conduct and will not set a 
dissuasive example for other broadcasters&#8221;.61 However, in line with the jurisprudence of the

<p>  
 58 ECtHR, <i>S&#252;rek v. Turkey</i>, Judgment of 8 July 1999, App. No. 26682/95; <i>Chauvy et al. v. France</i>,

<p>Judgment of 29 June 2004, App. No. 64915/01. 
 59 See e.g. ECtHR, <i>Dammann v. Switzerland</i>, Judgment of 25 April 2006, App. No. 77551/01.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>150</b>  
</p>
<p>ECtHR, even relatively small fines could amount to censorship. In <i>Lingens v. Austria</i>, the 
Court held that &#8220;although the penalty imposed on the author did not strictly speaking 
prevent him from expressing himself, it nonetheless amounted to a kind of censure, which 
would be likely to discourage him from making criticisms of that kind again in the 
future&#8221;.62 The Court found that sentencing a journalist with a relatively small fine of 20,000 
Austrian Schillings (1,430 EUR) &#8220;would be likely to deter journalists from contributing to 
public discussion of issues affecting the life of the community&#8221;. By the same token, a 
sanction such as this is liable to hamper the press in performing its task as purveyor of 
information and public watchdog&#8221;.63  
</p>
<p>977. In our view, the amendments proposed do not respond to the core issue of 
independence and impartiality of the body applying similar sanctions. The deficiencies in 
terms of independence and impartiality relate both to the composition of the authority 
overseeing the violations of the media service providers and the appointment process. The 
President of the Authority is appointed by the Prime Minister, who is also empowered to 
appoint the Director-General of the Bureau. The members of the Media Council are 
appointed by two thirds of the members of Parliament, or the dominant political party. 
Further concern is expressed at the fact that the financial sanctions imposed for a violation 
of legislation related to the media are determined by the Authority rather than an 
independent judiciary. 
</p>
<p>978. As recommended in one of the studies commissioned by the OSCE, in order to 
achieve greater independence of the members of the Media Authority, we would like to 
invite your Government to identify alternative methods of considering candidates for 
membership so that their identification is &#8220;taken out of hands of the politicians&#8221; and the 
parliament &#8220;could only consider candidates recommendation by institutions of higher 
learning and appropriate professional, trade and civil society organizations&#8221;.64    
</p>
<p>979. Moreover, in accordance with Article 187(3)(e), any Television programme may be 
excluded from distribution in the country. In practice, the licenses of the only two 
nationwide commercial analogue television channels (RTL Klub and TV2), will expire in 
</p><p>2012. The interest in renewing these licences will most likely lead to self-censorship of 
these television channels. 
</p>
<p>980. In general, we support the recommendation of the Commissioner for Human Rights 
of the Council of Europe to delete Article 187 in its entirety and make reference to the 
existing instruments in the Hungarian legal order concerning acts such as incitement to 
violence.65   
</p>
<p>981. By virtue of Article 189, the Media Council can compel Internet service providers to 
block any Internet-based news outlet as a final sanction for alleged non-compliance with 
the Media legislation.

<p> Article 203 
</p>
<p>982. This provision provides a definition of &#8220;Media Product&#8221;. It refers not only to the 
printed press, but also to Internet-based content. The wording suggests that the scope of the 
law encompasses not only news sites but also private websites that are financed by 
advertisements. Please refer to our comments on Article 1 of the Press and Media Act.  
</p>
<p> Article 220 
</p>
<p>983. In its paragraph 15, Article 220 postponed Hungary&#8217;s digital switchover from 31 
December 2011, the Europe-wide deadline, to 31 December 2014. In practice, this amounts 
to barring Hungary from the diversity of channels and may have a chilling effect on the 
promotion and protection of media pluralism in the country. While the law had as its initial 
justification the openness of the country to new media markets and technology, it risks 
precluding the entry of new TV channels. 
</p>
<p><i> V.  Conclusions and Recommendations 
</i></p>
<p>984. We believe that the media legislation, as adopted by the Parliament of Hungary, 
contains a number of serious deficiencies with respect to compliance with international 
human rights law and obligations. In this commentary, we have undertaken a general and 
non-exhaustive assessment on the principal issues that we believe merit close scrutiny from 
the perspective of our mandates.  
</p>
<p>985. In light of our analysis, we invite the Government of Hungary to consider either 
repealing or amending the current media legislation, taking into account the following 
recommendations:  
</p>
<p> 1) Renew the process of elaboration of the legislation in a public consultative 
process that shall include members of the media associations, civil society and other 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> 2) Delete any reference to the requirement of &#8220;objective and balanced coverage&#8221; 
of events; 
</p>
<p> 3) Remove any registration requirement which remains a precondition for 
maintaining media services after the expiry of 60 days following the commencement of the 
service or activity; 
</p>
<p> 4) Ensure the independence and impartiality of the Media Authority, and allow

</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>987. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed response received on 
2 February 2011 to his communication dated 18 January 2011 regarding the Hungarian 
media legislation. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the 
invitation and facilitation of a technical mission, which was carried out from 3 to 5 April 
2011, to address his concerns regarding the media laws.  
</p>
<p>988. However, as he has stated at the end of the mission in his press statement,66 the 
Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the media laws still fall short of the required 
international benchmarks to which Hungary has committed itself. The Special Rapporteur 
looks forward to the implementation of his recommendations, including the holding of 
meaningful and public consultations with all stakeholders, including representatives of the 
media and civil society. Additionally, he hopes that the Government will also consider his 
recommendation to adopt a concrete plan of action to bring the media legislation into 
conformity with international human rights standards following open and transparent 
consultations with relevant stakeholders prior to the examination of the human rights 
situation in Hungary through the Universal Periodic Review on 11 May 2011.  
</p>
<p>989. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to continued engagement and dialogue with 
the Government to ensure that the media laws come into full conformity with international 
human rights norms and standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>990. On 13 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter concerning 
approximately <b>1,000 metric tonnes of newsprint material that are bound for Nepal, but 
are allegedly being held at Kolkata port in India by the Department of Revenue 
Intelligence</b>. 
</p>
<p>991. According to information received, the following shipments containing newsprint 
material arrived at Kolkota port: (1) on 27 May 2010, 11 containers from Canada (275 
metric tonnes); (2) on 29 May, 19 containers from the Republic of Korea (475 metric 
tonnes); (3) 12 June, 9 containers from Canada (228 metric tonnes). These shipments were 
imported by Kantipur Publications based in Nepal, but have reportedly been seized by the 
Department of Revenue Intelligence of India since their arrival. While it has been alleged 
that the shipments are being held on the basis that the materials need to be investigated, no 
investigation has allegedly been undertaken.  
</p>
<p>992. According to the Nepal-India transit treaty, no consignment in transit can be held 
without explanation, but accoutring to information received, no explanation has been 
provided to date.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>153 
</b></p>
<p>993. Concern was expressed that the lengthy seizure of the newsprint material may 
jeopardize the work of Kantipur Publications, which publish two of the largest newspapers 
circulated in Nepal, the Kathmandu Post and Kantipur. Further concern was expressed that 
the continued seizure of the shipment, without explanation, may constitute an attempt to 
hamper the work of Kantipur Publications in Nepal, which has reportedly published opinion 
pieces that have been critical of India&#8217;s policy on Nepal.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>994. In a letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government informed that the above-mentioned 
allegation has been investigated by the Government of India. The consignment was 
subjected to routine examination by the concerned authorities and a part of it was released 
on 25 June 2010. The remaining part of the consignment was released on 30 June 2010, 
after due inspection and verification. The Government informed that there was no unusual 
delay in the above procedure.  
</p>
<p>995. The bilateral trade and transit arrangements between the Governments of Nepal and 
India, which include the Transit Treaty and the Agreement of Co-operation to Control 
Unauthorized Trade, allow either party to take all necessary measures, including inter alia 
examination of consignments transiting through their territories, to ensure that their 
legitimate economic interests are not adversely affected.  
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>996. On 29 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an allegation letter concerning the killing of <b>Mr. Amit 
Jethwa</b> who was a Public Interest Law Practitioner and Right to Information Activist. 
</p>
<p>997. According to the information received, on 20 July 2010, Mr. Jethwa was shot dead 
by two individuals on a motorcycle as he was leaving the Gujarat High Court building after 
a meeting with his lawyer. The killers allegedly left on foot leaving the motorcycle, a bag 
and the weapon on the scene. Mr. Jethwa died at the scene before the arrival of the 
ambulance. 
</p>
<p>998. Mr. Jethwa had reportedly been denouncing corruption in the exploitation of the Gir 
forests and had alleged that a local Member of Parliament was running illegal mines near 
the same forests. Mr. Jethwa had filed a Public Interest Litigation against the State forest 
department concerning illegal mining in the Gir forests of Junagadh district on the 
Kathiawar peninsula in Western Gujarat. 
</p>
<p>999. Concern was expressed that the killing of Mr. Jethwa might have been related to his 
work in exposing corruption and denouncing illegal mining.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1000. In a letter dated 20 January 2011, the Government informed that the alleged incident 
is under investigation and five of the six accused have been arrested. At the same time, all 
efforts are being made to arrest the sixth accused who is absconding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1001. On 18 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Ms. <b>Bharathi 
Pillai</b>, Ms. <b>Niharga Priya</b>, Ms. <b>Sudha</b>, Mr. <b>Gnana Diraviam</b>, and Mr. <b>Anandan</b>, 
participants of a human rights training course organized by the non-governmental </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>154</b>  
</p>
<p>organizations the Dalit Foundation (DF) and People's Watch (PW), from 11 to 20 August 
2010, in Nagamalai Puthukottai, near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. The DF works to eliminate 
caste discrimination and caste-based violence, with a particular emphasis on Dalit women 
and manual scavengers, and the PW provides legal support and human rights education. 
</p>
<p>1002. According to the information received, on 15 August 2010, around 6.30 p.m., as part 
of their fieldwork exercise, Ms. Bharathi Pillai, Ms. Niharga Priya, Ms. Sudha, Mr. Gnana 
Diraviam, and Mr. Anandan went to the Veeravanallur Police Station, in Tirunelveli 
District of Tamil Nadu, to gather information in relation to allegations of torture of a Dalit 
youth by police officers at the station. The five human rights defenders identified 
themselves, and requested permission to Ms. P. Roswin Savimo, Sub-Inspector of police, 
and Mr. T. Murugesan, Inspector of police, to be provided with documents relating to the 
case. As a result, they were questioned and kept in the police station. It is alleged that Mr. 
Murugan is one of the alleged perpetrators in this case. 
</p>
<p>1003. Later in the evening, Ms. Bharathi Pillai, Ms. Niharga Priya, and Ms. Sudha 
requested to leave the police station and come back the next day, but Mr Ramu, Deputy 
Superintendent of Police of Ambasamudram, refused, arguing that they had to be further 
questioned. Mr. Gnana Diraviam then tried to call a program assistant from the training 
program, but his mobile phone, as well the phones belonging to the other defenders, got 
confiscated. The five defenders were taken to separate rooms to get their identification 
marks, and were kept in the police station until 11 p.m.  
</p>
<p>1004. At 11.45 p.m., the group of defenders arrived under police escort at the house of the 
Judicial Magistrate in the nearby town of Cheranmahadevi in order to be remanded into 
judicial custody. They were charged with using the Indian Penal Code under Section 170 
(impersonating a public servant), Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public 
servant from discharge of his duty), Section 416 (cheating by impersonation) and Section 
506 (punishment for criminal intimidation). They learnt that the complainant in the case 
against them was Ms. P. Roswin Savimo. The group was then taken to the hospital for 
medical examination. The three women defenders were then transferred to Kokarakulam 
Women's Sub Jail in the city of Tirunelveli, and the two male defenders were taken to 
Ambasamudram Sub Jail. 
</p>
<p>1005. During the evening, staff members of PW tried to call the Veeravanallur Police 
Station to enquire about the situation of the five defenders, in vain. One staff went to the 
police station to meet the group, but was asked to sign some papers without being told what 
they were and then to leave the station immediately.  
</p>
<p>1006. Finally, it is reported that in the case remand report, Mr. Henri Tiphagne, Executive 
Director of PW-India, Member of the Executive Committee of the Asian Forum for Human 
Rights and Development (FORUM-ASIA), and a member of the Asian NGOs Network on 
National Human Rights Institutions, was referred to as an &#8220;absconding accused&#8221;, although 
no charges had been filed against him, nor was he present at the police station at the time of 
the arrest of the five defenders. 
</p>
<p>1007. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Gnana 
Diraviam, Mr. Anandan, Ms. Bharathi Pillai, Ms. Niharga Priya, and Ms. Sudha, and the 
charges brought against them, might have been related to their legitimate human rights 
activities. Further concerns were expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
the five human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1008. On 22 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an allegation letter concerning <b>the killing of civilians</b> <b>by </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>155 
</b></p>
<p><b>military and police forces in Jammu and Kashmir</b>. The Special Rapporteurs also 
brought the attention of the Government to allegations received that journalists and human 
rights defenders are being targeted by the authorities in relation to their work in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>1009. According to information received, between 1 January and 8 August 2010, 84 
civilians, 120 persons identified as militants, and 66 Indian forces personnel have been 
allegedly killed. It is reported that those killed by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), 
police and army personnel were predominantly young Muslim men. 
</p>
<p>1010. &#8220;Encounter killings&#8221; are also allegedly used by security forces to create the 
impression of a national threat and the extension of cross-border terrorism. On 30 April 
2010, for example, Indian Armed Forces claimed that three &#8220;foreign/infiltrating militants&#8221; 
(from Pakistan) were killed in an &#8220;encounter&#8221; in Machil sector, Kupwara district, along the 
Line of Control (LoC). On 28 May 2010, the three victims namely Shahzad Ahmad, Riyaz 
Ahmad, and Mohammad Shafi were reportedly authenticated as &#8220;fake encounter&#8221; killings. 
Over 20 persons were killed in &#8220;encounters&#8221; in April-May 2010, and each &#8220;encounter&#8221; was 
reported as necessary to combating &#8220;infiltrating militants&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1011. There have also been widespread protests against &#8220;militarized governance&#8221; in the 
Jammu and Kashmir. The military and police forces are said to be targeting unarmed and 
peaceful protesters and often have used live ammunition on protesters. Civilians have 
reportedly reacted to this through stone pelting, damaging State property and arson. In 
several instances this has resulted in injury to some members of the security forces.  
</p>
<p>1012. In addition, State authorities have reportedly been targeting journalists and human 
rights defenders as a means of preventing them from discharging their functions. For 
example Advocate Mian Qayoom, President of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar 
Association in Srinagar and also a human rights defender, was arrested allegedly because of 
his legal advocacy for the detained and disappeared in Jammu and Kashmir, his offer of 
legal counsel to dissenters against the Indian state, his arguments against the indiscriminate 
use of the Jammu and Kashmir Public and Safety Act (PSA), his investigations into 
allegations of abuse by the Indian military and police, his articulation of Jammu and 
Kashmir as a disputed territory, and his support of self-determination. On 18 July 2010, 
Advocate Ghulam Nabi Shaheen, General Secretary, Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar 
Association, Srinagar, and a human rights defender, was arrested under the same Act (PSA). 
</p>
<p>1013. The mandate-holders have appended the following annex to this communication 
summarizing alleged killings that occurred between 11 June and 8 August 2010. They 
would like to seek from the Government information on the inquiries into the protests and 
their outcomes, on the measures taken to hold those responsible for killings accountable, 
and on the measures taken to prevent the recurrence of such acts. They would also like to 
enquire about allegations received that journalists and human rights defenders are being 
targeted by the authorities in order to prevent them from carrying out their work in defense 
of human rights.  
</p>

<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1058. In a letter dated 3 December 2010, addressed to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, the Government apologized for the delay in 
acknowledging the letter of 22 October 2010, and assured that the letter had been forwarded 
to authorities in India for their due consideration. The Government stressed the complexity 
of the situation that has a strong dimension of cross-border terrorism and extremism, aimed 
at challenging the very idea of a secular, liberal and democratic India, as also her modest 
level of economic development. The Government further referred to its sensitivities on this 
issue and its current position on the matter. 
</p>
<p>1059. On the issue of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, the Government assured that 
it is seized of the concerns that have been expressed by various quarters, including the civil 
society, and would give due attention to the views of the High Commissioner.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>1060. On 16 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
regarding the case of Mr. <b>Julfikar Ali</b>, a District Human Rights Monitor (DHRM) of the 
human rights non-governmental organization MASUM in the Murshidabad District of West 
Bengal. On behalf of MASUM, Mr. Julfikar Ali investigates alleged torture cases 
perpetrated by State agents, and accompanies victims of torture in seeking legal redress. 
Mr. Julfikar Ali was the subject of an allegation letter sent by the then Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on 11 
March 2008. Your Excellency&#8217;s Government responded to this letter on 6 April 2009. 
</p>
<p>1061. According to the new information received, on 2 January 2011, an unidentified 
police officer, in plain clothes, from the Raninagar Police Station, came to the house of Mr. 
Julfikar Ali, who was away at the time. The police officer informed Mr. Julfikar Ali&#8217;s 
family that the arrest warrant related to criminal case Raninagar Police Station no.8/2008, 
which was the subject of the aforementioned letter, was still pending and that he should 
immediately surrender himself before the court of law. As previously stated, the complaint 
relates to an incident which reportedly took place on the night of 11 January 2008, at the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>161 
</b></p>
<p>Kaharpara Border Security Force (BSF) outpost, whereas Mr. Julfikar Ali was reportedly 
not in the vicinity of the outpost that night. In addition, the three other persons mentioned in 
the complaint are not reportedly known to Mr. Julfikar Ali. 
</p>
<p>1062. On 13 January 2011, Mr. Julfikar Ali made a statement on his case to the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, in Kolkata, West Bengal, during her 
country mission to India. 
</p>
<p>1063. A few days after Mr. Julfikar Ali delivered his testimony, police visits to his home 
reportedly became more frequent, during which his family has been asked for his 
whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>1064. On 11 February 2011, Mr. Julfikar Ali, accompanied by Mr. Kirity Roy, Secretary 
of MASUM, went to the District Court to surrender. His decision was motivated by the 
need to settle the issue, and to be able to continue his human rights activities. Mr. Julfikar 
Ali filed a petition before the District Court for anticipatory bail, which was granted with a 
bond of 3,000 Indian Rupees. 
</p>
<p>1065. On 14 February 2011, the District Court granted another anticipatory bail to Mr. 
Julfikar Ali in relation to another complaint filed by the BSF (case Raninagar PS no. 33 
dated 16 February 2008), with a bond of 5,000 Indian Rupees. In this case, Mr. Julfikar 
Ali&#8217;s name reportedly did not appear in the complaint filed by the BSF. 
</p>
<p>1066. Serious concern was expressed that the aforementioned acts of judicial harassment 
against Mr. Julfikar Ali may be related to his human rights activities, i.e. his reporting of 
alleged violations committed by BSF officials, and might have increased due to interaction 
with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders during her recent 
visit to India. Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Julfikar Ali and his family.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1067. In a letter dated 29 March 2011, the Government of India acknowledged receipt of 
the urgent appeal sent on 16 February 2011. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving a substantive reply addressing the concerns raised in the urgent appeal.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>1068. On 28 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Ms. 
Teesta Setalvad</b>, Secretary of the organization Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), a 
Mumbai-based non-governmental organization. Ms. Setalvad, a prominent human rights 
defender and a lawyer by profession, has been advocating for the rights of victims and 
survivors of the violence that took place during the Gujarat Riot of February 2002. Ms. 
Setalvad and CJP have filed cases relating to the riots, and have been pressing for 
prosecution of the perpetrators of the riots since 2002.  
</p>
<p>1069. According to the information received, in the conduct of her professional activity as 
a lawyer providing legal support to victims of the Gulbarg Society massacre which took 
place during the Gujarat riots of February 2002, Ms. Teesta Setalvad had sent, on 5 and 7 
October 2010, respectively, to Mr. R.K. Raghavan, the Chair of Special Investigation Team 
(SIT), letters voicing her concern regarding the lack of protection by the SIT for witnesses 
and victims. 
</p>
<p>1070. On 20 January 2011, Justices D.K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and Aftab Alam, Supreme 
Court judges handling the case surrounding the Gulbarg Society massacre which took place 
during the Gujarat riots of February 2002, reportedly reprimanded Ms. Setalvad for sending 
copies of letters she had sent on 5 and 7 October 2010, respectively, to Mr. R.K. Raghavan, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>162</b>  
</p>
<p>to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Allegedly, Ms. 
Setalvad was told by the judges that the court did not &quot;appreciate&quot; letters about the 
proceedings being sent to OHCHR and that they &quot;take it as interference in [their] 
proceedings&quot;.  
</p>
<p>1071. On 17 February 2011, Ms. Setalvad was again allegedly issued with a verbal 
warning against writing to OHCHR by Justices D. K. Jain, P. Sathasivam and Aftab Alam. 
</p>
<p>1072. When explaining that OHCHR receives information on any human rights matter 
from all over the world, Ms. Jaiswal, Ms. Setalvad&#8217;s lawyer, was allegedly told that her 
client must promise not to send any further communication to OHCHR on information 
regarding the proceedings.  
</p>
<p>1073. The source also mentions that Ms. Setalvad&#8217;s integrity has been put into question 
due to the state government of Gujarat&#8217;s alleged efforts to undermine her professional 
credibility, including accusations of tutoring witnesses and tampering with evidence. We 
understand Ms. Setalvad believes her physical safety is further endangered by the reported 
hostility of the Gujarat state and its police, on the basis of threats of arrests made against 
her. She has also reportedly been followed by unmarked vehicles immediately following 
court hearings on more than one occasion.  
</p>
<p>1074. Concern was expressed that the restriction placed by the Supreme Court of India on 
Ms. Setalvad&#8217;s freedom of expression, and the harassment and threats against her, may be 
related to their legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular upholding the 
justice of victims of the Gulbarg Society Massacre. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1075. In a letter dated 29 March 2011, the Government of India acknowledged receipt of 
the urgent appeal sent on 28 March 2011. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to 
receiving a substantive reply addressing the concerns raised in the urgent appeal.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government to a communication sent before the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>1076. In a letter dated 25 June 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 30 November 2004 by the former mandate holder and the former Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment concerning Mr. 
<b>Rafiq Maqbool</b>, journalist with Associated Press, and Mr. <b>Amin War </b>of <i>The Tribune</i>. The 
Government informed that it has examined the complaint and found it to be inaccurate, as 
the subjects were not beaten by the police.  
</p>
<p>1077. In a letter dated 25 May 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 5 November 2009 by the Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders concerning the situation of Mr.<b> Chotan Das, </b>Mr. 
<b>Bhanu Sarkar and </b>Mr. <b>Ramesh Das</b>, informing that it had examined the complaint and 
found it to be inaccurate. Contrary to the allegation, one of the subjects, Mr. Chotan Das, 
was neither arrested, nor detained by any police personnel. The two other subjects 
mentioned in the communication, Mr. Bhanu Srakar and Mr Ramesh Das, belong to Bandi 
Mukti Committee that is an outfit affiliated with a banned extremist organization CPJ-
Maoist, and were detained on 6 October 2009 while demanding release of some prisoners 
connected with another front organization controlled by this banned extremist outfit. They 
were subsequently released after questioning. 
</p>
<p>1078. In a letter dated 6 December 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 24 September 2009 sent by the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, and the Special </p>

<b>Chung-shel Koireng</b>, Mr. <b>Taorem Ramananda</b> and Mr. <b>Samjetshabam Nando</b>. The 
Government informed that it had examined the communication and found its chief to be 
inaccurate. The investigation into the matter, including those of relevant medical records, 
showed that the subject was not tortured by the police. Contrary to what was alleged in the 
communication, the medical certificate concerning the subject does not state the subject had 
been treated for any electric shocks. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1079. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its responses, but notes that at 
the time of the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to 
his communication of 18 August 2010, as well as to 14 communications sent earlier. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken.

</b></p>
<p>1080. On 26 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
the situation of participants to an Asian regional meeting of the <b>International Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association </b>(ILGA). 
</p>
<p>1081. According to the information received, on 26 March 2010, more than 150 human 
rights defenders representing 100 organizations from 16 Asian countries gathered in 
Surabaya to participate in a three-day Asian regional meeting of the ILGA. 
</p>
<p>1082. In response to protests by conservative Muslim groups and the Indonesian Ulema 
Council, the police reportedly ordered the cancellation of the conference, and national and 
international participants were ordered to leave the conference hotel. 
</p>
<p>1083. At the time of drafting the present appeal, a group of militant fundamentalists was 
inside the hotel, attempting to identify conference participants, by conducting a room-by-
room search.  
</p>
<p>1084. According to various reports, the police were not taking any measure to ensure the 
safety of the participants. 
</p>
<p>1085. Grave concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the 
participants of the ILGA meeting. We remind the Government of Indonesia of its 
responsibility under international human rights law to ensure the safety of the participants. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal

<p>1086. On 19 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the 
detention of <b>Fredy Akihary, Leonard Hendriks, Semuel Hendriks, Piter Johanes,

Piter Elia Saiya, Elia Sinay</b> and <b>Alexander Tanate</b>. 
</p>
<p>1087. According to the information received, on 29 June 2007, 23 political activists, 
mostly farmers, performed a traditional Maluku war dance in front of the President of 
Indonesia and other officials, during a ceremony to mark the 14th anniversary of National 
Family Day in Independence Field, Ambon, Maluku Province. At the end of the dance, they 
unfurled the Benang Raja flag, the pro-independence symbol of South Maluku. The 
political activists had not been registered as part of the ceremony, and were immediately 
arrested by approximately 20 police and presidential guards.  
</p>
<p>1088. During the arrest and in the police vehicle, some of the activists were punched and 
beaten with rifle butts. They were transferred between police stations, including the 
regional police station (Polda, Polisi Daerah), the district police station (Polres, Polisi 
Resort) and the police mobile brigade (Brimob, Brigade Mobil Tantui base). Most of the 
detainees were subjected to torture and ill-treatment in police custody. They were forced to 
crawl on their stomachs over hot asphalt, billiard balls were forced into their mouths, they 
were whipped with electric cables, beaten on the head with rifle butts until their ears bled, 
and shots were fired close to their ears. Afterwards, while they were still bleeding, they 
were thrown into the sea and dragged out. It has been reported that Special Detachment 88 
officers were responsible for the most severe assaults.  
</p>
<p>1089. On the same day, nine other people were arrested for having helped organize the 
event or for having watched it. Eight of them are serving sentences of between six and 12 
years imprisonment. Flip Malawau, Barce Manuputty, Petrus Rahayaan, Arens Arnol Saiya, 
Elia Sinay, Alexander Tanate and Johan Teterissa were all subjected to beatings with hard 
objects, including rifle butts, during their pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p>1090. All of the detainees were denied contact with the outside world for 11 days. Once 
the trials began, the detainees were transferred to the Waiheru detention centre, where some 
were coerced into signing statements waiving their right to a lawyer. Those who had 
lawyers assigned by the State were advised to plead guilty and waive their right to appeal. 
Additionally, some of the detainees did not appear before a judge and were nonetheless 
convicted in absentia. They were all sentenced to between seven and 20 years of 
imprisonment. No investigation has yet been launched into the allegations of torture and ill-
treatment.  
</p>
<p>1091. On 10 March 2009, 11 of the detainees were transferred to correctional facilities in 
Java, more than 1,000 kilometres away from their families. It is believed that neither the 
detainees nor their families were informed of their transfer. Lawyers from the Malang 
branch of the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum, LBH) Surabaya have been 
seeking permission to visit three of them, Leonard Hendricks, Johan Teterissa and Abraham 
Saiya, while in detention in Lowokaru Prison in Malang, East Java. On 12 February 2010, 
LBH received a copy of a letter from the East Java regional office of the Ministry of Justice 
and Human Rights to the Director General of Prisons in Jakarta, informing them of LBH&#8217;s 
application and asking the Director General to coordinate with the Foreign Affairs Ministry. 
They have not heard either from the East Java office of the Ministry of Justice and Human 
Rights or the Director General of Prisons since then.  
</p>
<p>1092. Particular concern was expressed over Mr. Teterissa, who has not received medical 
treatment since the arrest and ill-treatment. He has a high fever, is in constant pain and 
cannot see properly. The prison authorities have denied his request for external medical 
treatment, and a doctor who went to see him on 15 July was also turned away. It is also 
believed that Mr. Teterissa may be denied access to sufficient food and clean water in 
prison. </p>

regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective 
measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1094. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern regarding the allegations in his 
communications, particularly the communication of 26 March 2010 taking into account the 
number of human rights defenders present at the LGBT gathering. Moreover, he is also 
concerned about reports that the police did not take measures to ensure that those present 
were offered adequate protection. As such, he urges the Government to provide information 
about the allegations at its earliest convenience.

<p>1095. On 22 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding Mr. <b>Heshmatollah Tabarzadi </b>(&#8220;Heshmat&#8221;), a journalist and leader 
of the Democratic Front of Iran, a banned political party. 
</p>
<p>1096. According to the information received, Mr. Heshmatollah Tabarzadi was arrested on 
27 December 2009 in Tehran, by intelligence officers from the Revolutionary Guard. Upon 
arrest, his computer, phone book, photo albums, video tapes, fax and mobiles phone were 
confiscated. It is believed that Mr. Tabarzadi&#8217;s arrest may be as a result of an article which 
was published on 17 December in a United States-based newspaper, and which stated that 
&#8220;if the government continues to opt for violence, there very well may be another revolution 
in Iran&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1097. Mr. Tabarzadi has been accused of &#8220;insulting the Supreme Leader&#8221;, &#8220;insulting the 
Islamic Republic&#8221; and &#8220;acting against national security&#8221;. He has not had access to a lawyer, 
but has been able to receive visits from his family and to talk to them on the phone, albeit 
while being monitored by the police administration. During his interrogation by intelligence 
officers, Mr. Tabarzadi was blindfolded, beaten and threatened with the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>1098. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Tabarzadi may form part 
of an attempt to stifle his rights to freedom of opinion expression, peaceful assembly, and 
participation in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen 
representatives, in the country. In light of the above allegations of threats and ill-treatment, 
further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Tabarzadi. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1099. In a letter dated 9 February 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal of 22 
March 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1100.  In connection with Mr. Heshmatollah Tabarzadi&#8217;s case, the High Council of Human 
Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has approached all pertinent judicial 
authorities and courts. According to reports, Mr. Tabarzadi has been charged with 
propaganda against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, endangerment of national </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>166</b>  
</p>
<p>security through unlawful association, conspiracy with the intention of disturbing public 
security, insults against the leadership of the country and disruption of public order. Mr. 
Tabarzadi was arrested on 28 December 2009. On virtue of articles 500, 514, 610 and 618 
of the Islamic Penal Code (IPC), Branch 26 of Tehran Province&#8217;s Court of Revolution 
found the accused guilty of all charges and sentenced Mr. Tabarzadi to one year Taziri (in 
Islamic jurisprudence/Figh&#8217;h this term refers to sentences which carry variable levels of 
punishment, as determined by the law and the judge respectively) imprisonment, for 
engaging in propaganda against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, two years of 
additional Tazari imprisonment for insulting the country&#8217;s Leadership, also five years of 
Taziri imprisonment for association and conspiracy with the intention of endangering 
national security, as well as one year&#8217;s Taziri imprisonment and 74 Taziri lashes for 
disrupting public order through participation in illegal gatherings.  
</p>
<p>1101. The verdict was reached, in compliance with relevant legal procedures, after Mr. 
Tabarzadi&#8217;s defense team &#8211; namely Mr. Mohammad Oliayi-Fard, Mr. Abdolfattah Soltani, 
Mr. Jahangir Mahmoudi-nejad, Ms. Nasrin Sotoudeh, Ms. Giti Pourfazel and Ms. Sara 
Najibi &#8211; mounted their defense. The verdict was contested and appealed by Mr. Jahangir 
Mahmoudi-nejad. As a result Branch 54 of Tehran province&#8217;s Appeal Court re-examined the 
verdict. Nevertheless, on the basis of Para A of article 275 of the IPC the Court rejected the 
appeal through judgment No.968 dated 1 January 2011. However, the court cleared Mr. 
Tabarzadi of the particular charge of &#8220;disrupting public order through participation in illegal 
gatherings&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1102. It is worth noting that before his most recent arrest, and from 1996 onwards, on 
several occasions Mr. Tabarzadi had been convicted of several charges, including 
propaganda against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Two of his Taziri 
imprisonments sentences, were replaced by fines and in another instance he was handed a 
suspended prison sentence. Also back in 2004, he was sentenced to fourteen years of Taziri 
imprisonment, by Tehran Province&#8217;s Court of Revolution (verdict No. 150/36/83 of 20 
December 2004) on the basis of articles 498, 500, 514 and 698 of the IPC also by virtue of 
article 19 of the IPC he was sentenced and banned from engaging in social activities for 10 
years. This verdict was contested by Mr. Tabarzadi&#8217;s attorney &#8211; Mr. Ali Akbar Behmanesh. 
As a result the case was re-examined by Branch 36 of Tehran Province&#8217;s Court of Appeal 
and later by Branch 7 of the Supreme Court. Ultimately Mr. Tabarzadi was sentenced to 
nine years of Taziri imprisonment and banned from engaging in social activities for 10 
years.  
</p>
<p>1103. According to information provided to the High Council of Human Rights, despite 
his definitive conviction and ban from engaging in social activities, on Islamic 
compassionate grounds, Mr. Tabarzadi was given home leave. However, Mr. Tabarzadi 
abused his leave and violated his pledge to refrain from endangering national security by 
engaging in activities against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Mr. Tabarzadi&#8217;s 
disregard of the above has led to his conviction.  
</p>
<p>1104. Presently, Mr. Tabarzadi is serving his sentence and like other prisoners, is accorded 
his legal rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1105. On 1 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the situation of 
Mr. <b>Isa Saharkhiz</b>, a citizen of Iran and resident of Teheran. He is a pro reform movement 
journalist and a political analyst in Iran. He is a member of the Association of Iranian 
Journalist Syndicate and a member of the Central Council of the Committee for Protect of 
Press Freedom. Mr. Isa Saharkhiz is a founding member of the Society for the Defense of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>167 
</b></p>
<p>Freedom of the Press (SDFP) in Iran. The SDFP has been outspoken in its opposition to 
censorship and press suppression, and the constant harassment and imprisonment of 
journalists. Mr. Isa Saharkhiz was instrumental in establishing the Golden Pen award. The 
SDFP awards the Golden Pen every year to a person who has taken important steps to 
defend the freedom of the press in Iran. He is also a civil society and human rights activist.  
</p>
<p>1106. According to the information received, Mr. Isa Saharkhiz was detained at home by 
eight plainclothes officers, on July 4, 2009, after having been in hiding since his family 
home was raided on 20 June. No arrest warrant was presented to him, nor was he informed 
of the reasons and legal basis for his arrest. He was taken to an unknown location, where he 
was reportedly tortured during the interrogation, and suffered from broken ribs as a result. 
</p>
<p>1107. Although his family and his lawyer tried to obtain information about his place of 
detention, the Iranian authorities failed to provide this information for a considerable time. 
He is now believed to be held at Evin Prison, under the surveillance of the Revolutionary 
Guard. According to the source, for the first sixty two (62) days of his detention, he was 
held incommunicado and in solitary confinement.  
</p>
<p>1108. Before his arrest, on 20 June 2009, his family home in Tehran had been raided 
whilst he was travelling in Northern Iran and his computer and campaign materials 
supporting the opposition presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi were confiscated. On 2 
July, Mr. Isa Saharkhiz had posted an article on news website Rooz in which he criticized 
the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Sayed &#8216;Ali Khamenei. 
</p>
<p>1109. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Isa Saharkhiz might be 
directly related to his work in defence of human rights, in particular the non-violent 
exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed that his 
detention may form part of a broader pattern to intimidate other journalists. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1110. In a letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
dated 1 April 2010. According to information we have received, Mr. Saharhiz was in 
charge of foreign news service of one of the presidential candidates and played an effective 
role after the election in propagating fictitious news, attributing fabricated allegations to 
high-ranking officials of the country, disturbing public mind and provoking unrest. He was 
arrested on the basis of a warrant, and after completion of investigations and collection of 
evidence; the investigating judge on 3 July 2009 remanded the accused in light of previous 
records of commission of numerous offences. 
</p>
<p>1111. On 14 December 2009 an indictment was issued charging him for his actions in 
waging propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran, insulting the high-ranking officials 
of the country and disturbing public minds, his case was sent to the court &#8211; Branch 15 &#8211; and 
the first hearing was held on 18 July 2010. He has four defence lawyers. Despite the 
factious claim concerning his lawyers not being able to have access to his dossier, 
according to our inquiries his defence lawyer came to the court and read his case on 2 
Esfand 1388 and 14 Farvardin 1389. Moreover, the lawyers met their client number of 
times. Mr Sharkhiz is serving his sentence in the general cell of Evin Prison and is in good 
health. In relation to having telephone contacts, his family visits him weekly. Claims 
concerning the mistreatment of Mr. Sharkbiz in prison are rejected.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1112. On 23 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the arrest and detention of Ms. <b>Narges Mohammadi</b> and Mr. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>168</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Abdolreza Tajik</b>. Ms. Narges Mohammadi is the deputy head of the Defenders Human 
Rights Centre (DHRC). Mr. Abdolreza Tajik is a journalist and member of the DHRC. The 
closure of the Defenders Human Centre and the arrest and detention of, as well as judicial 
proceedings against its director and members were the subject of several communications 
sent to your Excellency&#8217;s Government, including on 16 July 2009, 18 June 2009, 19 
January 2009, 31 December 2008 and 22 December 2008. Mr. Tajik was also the subject of 
joint urgent appeals sent on 10 July 2009 and 7 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>1113. According to the information received, on 10 June 2010, Ms. Narges Mohammadi 
was arrested at her home in Tehran by security forces. According to information received, 
those carrying out Ms. Mohammadi&#8217;s arrest were not in possession of a valid arrest warrant 
issued by a judicial official, but instead showed a letter stating that they had the authority to 
search Ms. Mohammadi&#8217;s house and to arrest her. Ms. Mohammadi has been permitted 
only one phone call to relatives and has been held incommunicado since then in Evin 
Prison.  
</p>
<p>1114. On 12 June 2010, Mr. Abdolreza Tajik was arrested as he was leaving his office, 
after being summoned by the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran. Mr. Tajik has been held 
incommunicado in Evin Prison since then. Mr. Abdolreza Tajik was prevented from leaving 
the country in February 2009, on his way to attend a seminar in Spain. He was arrested on 
14 June 2009 and released on bail after 45 days in detention. He was rearrested again in 
December 2009.  
</p>
<p>1115. Ms. Narges Mohammadi was allegedly prevented from leaving the Islamic Republic 
of Iran in May 2010, when she was about to attend a conference in Guatemala. She has 
been reportedly regularly summoned for interrogation and advised to stop her work with the 
DHRC.  
</p>
<p>1116. The Defenders of Human Rights Centre has been closed since December 2008.  
</p>
<p>1117. Concern was expressed that the arrest and incommunicado detention of Ms. Narges 
Mohammadi and Mr. Adbolreza Tajik may be in connection with their peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights, in particular their work in the Defenders of Human Rights Centre.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1118. On 1 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government concerning <b>Majid Tavakkoli</b>, aged 24, member of the 
Islamic Students&#8217; Association at Amir Kabir University. 
</p>
<p>1119. According to the information received, Majid Tavakkoli was first arrested on 7 
December 2009 after he gave a speech at a student demonstration at Amir Kabir University 
in Tehran. He ended a seven-day hunger strike in protest for being placed in solitary 
confinement when he was transferred to the general section of Evin Prison on 29 May 
</p><p>2010. However, on 22 June, he was transferred to Section 350, where the conditions are 
believed to be poor, with overcrowded cells, inadequate food and sanitary facilities. Mr. 
Tavakkoli suffers from a respiratory condition which has worsened during his detention, 
and for which he has not received medical attention. 
</p>
<p>1120. Mr. Tavakkoli was beaten upon arrest. Additionally, on 8 December 2009, Fars 
News Agency published pictures of Mr. Tavakkoli wearing women&#8217;s clothing, indicating 
he had been wearing them to avoid arrest. However, it is alleged that he was forced to wear 
the clothes to humiliate him.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>169 
</b></p>
<p>1121. His trial took place in January 2010, but his lawyer was not allowed to attend. Mr. 
Tavakkoli was sentenced to five years imprisonment for &#8220;participating in an illegal 
gathering&#8221;, one year for &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;, two years for insulting the 
Supreme Leader&#8221; and six months for &#8220;insulting the President&#8221;. He was also banned from 
participating in political activities or leaving the country for five years. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1122. On 12 August 2010, the Special Ropporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Mr. <b>Abdolreza Tajik</b>, a journalist and member of the Association of Human Rights 
Defenders. Mr. Tajik was the subject of previous communications sent on 23 June 2010, 7 
January 2010 and 10 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>1123. According to the new information received, Mr. Abdolreza Tajik was arrested on 11 
June 2010 by security officers. It is the third time he has been arrested following the 2009 
presidential elections in Iran. Since the arrest, Mr. Tajik has been held in solitary 
confinement and subjected to torture and ill-treatment, in order to extract a confession. It is 
also believed that Mr. Tajik was &#8220;defiled&#8221; in the presence of Tehran&#8217;s deputy prosecutor. 
Although Mr. Tajik&#8217;s family filed a complaint with the Tehran Prosecutor-General, no 
action has been taken to investigate the allegations of torture and ill-treatment. 
Additionally, Mr. Tajik has not been allowed to meet with his lawyer and was only granted 
one meeting with his family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1124. On 27 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government concerning the situation of Ms. <b>Shiva Nazar-Ahari</b>, a member of the 
Committee of Human Rights Reporters (CHRR), an Iranian human rights non-
governmental organization. Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari has been the subject of joint urgent 
appeals sent by several Special Procedures mandate-holders on 22 February 2010 and 10 
September 2009. We regret that both urgent appeals are left unanswered as of today. 
</p>
<p>1125. According to the information received, since 20 December 2009, Ms. Shiva Nazar-
Ahari has reportedly been detained and charged with moharebeh (enmity with God), under 
article 186 of the Iranian Penal Code, which potentially carries the death penalty, as well as 
with &#8220;assembly and collusion to commit a crime&#8221; (article 610) and &#8220;propaganda against the 
Regime&#8221; (article 500). Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari and her organization are reportedly accused 
of contacting the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, a group which is allegedly 
banned in the country. 
</p>
<p>1126. Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari has further been charged with &#8220;causing unease in the public 
mind through writing on the CHRR's website and other sites&#8221; and &#8220;acting against national 
security by participating in [anti-government] demonstrations on 4 November 2009 and 7 
December 2009&#8221;. Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari denies participating in these demonstrations as 
she had allegedly been working on those days.  
</p>
<p>1127. Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari is currently being tried in Branch 26 of the Revolutionary 
Court in Tehran. The next hearing will take place on 4 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>1128. It is reported that Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari has been held in solitary confinement, in a 
cage-like cell which prevents her from moving her arms and legs. In addition, she has 
limited access to her family. </p>

<p><b>  Response of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1129. In a letter dated 9 February 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 27 August 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1130. With regard to Ms. Shiva Nazar-Ahari&#8217;s case, the High Council of Human Rights of 
the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has approached all pertinent judicial 
authorities and courts. According to reports, Ms. Nazar-Ahari, has been charged with 
endangering national security, supporting the MKO terror group and disrupting public 
order. Ms. Nazar-Ahari was arrested in May 2009 and released on bail in September 2009.  
</p>
<p>1131. She was put on trial on 3 September 2010 at branch 26 of Tehran Province&#8217;s Court 
of Revolution. Mr. Mohammad Sharif and Ms. Afrouz Moghzi defended Ms. Nazar-Ahari 
at her trial. The court &#8211; in correspondence with Articles 46, 47, 186, 190, 191, 193, 194, 
610, 618 and paragraph 5 of Article 22 of the Islamic Penal Code &#8211; later issued verdict 
No.288 dated 4 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>1132. Ms. Nazar-Ahari&#8217;s sentence entails:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Two years of Ta&#8217;ziri (in Islamic judisprudence/Figh&#8217;h this term refers to sentences 
which carry variable levels of punishment, as determined by law and judge 
respectively) imprisonment for conspiring against national security.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Six months of Ta&#8217;ziri imprisonment and a 400,000 Toman pecuniary fine (substitute 
for 74 Ta&#8217;ziri lashes) for disrupting public order.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Three and a half years of imprisonment for &#8220;Maharebeh&#8221; (enmity to God), in the city 
of Eizeh in Khouzestan Province. 
</p>
<p>1133. The verdict was appealed and subsequently the charge of &#8220;association and 
conspiracy against the system&#8221; was quashed by the appellate court. The court also reduced 
her imprisonment sentence to four years and changed her place of imprisonment from Eizeh 
prison to Karaj prison.  
</p>
<p>1134. Records show that back in 2003 Ms. Nazar-Ahari had been given a two year 
suspended prison sentence for engaging in propaganda against the state. This background is 
indicative of Ms. Nazar-Ahari&#8217;s intention to continue her illegal activities against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>1135. Similar to other prisoners, the Prisons Organization provides care &#8211; including 
medical attention &#8211; to Ms. Nazar-Ahari. She also has access to her defense counsel and has 
received visits from her family.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1136. On 24 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Mr. 
<b>Saeed Ha&#8217;eri </b>and Ms. <b>Shiva Nazar Ahari</b>, members of the Committee of Human Rights 
Reporters, an organization which campaigns against human rights violations, including 
abuses against women, children, prisoners, workers and others. Ms. Nazar Ahari and Mr. 
Ha'eri were the subject of urgent appeals sent on 22 February 2010 and 27 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1137. According to the information received, Ms. Shiva Nazar Ahari and Mr. Saeed Ha&#8217;eri 
were arrested on 20 December 2009, together with another member of the Committee of 
Human Rights Reporters. They were both released on bail pending their trial. 
</p>
<p>1138. On 18 September 2010, Ms. Ahari&#8217;s sentence of 74 lashes for &#8220;disturbing public 
order&#8221; was commuted to a fine. However, she was also sentenced to three years&#8217; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>171 
</b></p>
<p>imprisonment for &#8220;moharebeh&#8221; (enmity against God), two years for &#8220;gathering and 
colluding to commit a crime&#8221; and six months for propaganda against the system&#8221;, which 
she must serve at Izeh Prison. It is not clear if Izeh Prison has existing facilities for women. 
Mr. Ha&#8217;eri was sentenced by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court to two and a half years&#8217; 
imprisonment and 74 lashes for &#8220;disturbing public order&#8221; and &#8220;gathering and colluding with 
intent to harm state security&#8221;. The convictions and sentences of both Mr. Ha&#8217;eri and Ms. 
Ahari will be appealed.  
</p>
<p>1139. Concern was expressed that the arrests and convictions of Mr. Saeed Ha&#8217;eri and Ms. 
Shiva Nazar Ahari might be directly related to their work in defence of human rights. 
Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Ahara 
and Mr. Ha&#8217;eri if his sentence is implemented. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1140. In a letter dated 17 February 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 24 September 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1141. In connection with Mr. Saeed Ha&#8217;eri&#8217;s case, the High Council of Human Rights of 
the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has approached all pertinent judicial

</p>
<p>1144. On the basis of articles 610 and 618 of the Islamic Penal Code, Mr. Saeed Ha&#8217;edi 
was sentenced to serve a 2 year prison sentence &#8211; to include his earlier detention &#8211; for 
assembly and conspiracy against the security of the state and six months of Taziri (in 
Islamic jurisprudence/Figh&#8217;h this term refers to sentences which carry variable levels of 
punishment, as determined by law and judge respectively) imprisonment as well as an 
additional 74 lashes for disrupting public order.  
</p>
<p>1145. The above verdict is subject to appeal.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1146. On 29 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the 
government regarding the situation of Mr. <b>Emadeddin (Emad) Baghi</b>, founder of the 
Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights, laureate of the 2009 Martin Ennals Award for 
Human Rights Defenders, and also laureate of the 2005 Human Rights Prize of the French

treatment or punishment; and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes 
and consequences on 7 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>1147. According to the information received, on 21 September 2010, after being 
summoned by Branch 1057 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court regarding the closure in 
2009 of the Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights, Mr. Emadeddin (Emad) Baghi was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>172</b>  
</p>
<p>reportedly informed that on 17 August 2010 he had been sentenced by the Branch 26 of the 
Revolutionary Court to six years of imprisonment on charges of &#8220;propaganda against the 
system&#8221; and &#8220;colluding against the security of the regime&#8221;, allegedly because of an 
interview with the late Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri.  
</p>
<p>1148. In relation to the above mentioned interview, Mr. Emadeddin (Emad) Baghi has 
reportedly been arrested for six months on 28 December 2009, spending five of them in 
solitary confinement, while suffering from heart and breathing problems and severe back 
pain. He was reportedly released on 23 June 2010 on health grounds, after paying a bail of 
about 200,000 dollars. 
</p>
<p>1149. It is reported that Mr. Baghi is to serve a total of seven years in prison, since on 27 
July, he was sentenced by the Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court to one year of prison 
and five years of deprivation of civil activities, regarding a different case for heading the 
Centre for the Defence of Prisoners' Rights. Reportedly, to date, he remains under 
provisional release. 
</p>
<p>1150. Concern was expressed that the convictions against Mr. Emadeddin (Emad) Baghi is 
a result of his legitimate human rights activities, in a context of repeated harassment against 
human rights lawyers and activists in Iran. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1151. As was explained earlier in our response to some of the communications of 
rapporteurs on Mr. Emmadin Baghi, in the Islamic Republic of Iran charges against 
individuals are investigated and tried on the basis of law, regardless of the individual&#8217;s 
social and political status.  
</p>
<p>1152. Regrettably, Mr. Baghi used improper and unacceptable activities. He was arrested 
and tried on the charges of waging propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by 
propagating lies for the purpose of disturbing public mind. He was indicted by the Islamic 
Revolution Court of Tehran and after exhausting all legal remedies and formalities he was 
sentenced to one year in prison. His trial was on the basis of indictment 6/83/327 dated 
12/7/1383 and in accordance with article 500 of the Penal Code. This article in the Penal 
Code stipulates that any person who acts against the Islamic Republic of Iran or wages 
propaganda in the interest of groups or organization that oppose Islamic Republic of Iran 
shall be sentenced from three months to one year in prison. The sentence was appealed by 
his defence lawyer, Mr. Saleh Nikbakht. The appellate court upheld the sentence by the 
lower court. 
</p>
<p>1153. This sentence by the court was enforced on 22/7/1396, and from 27/10/1386 to 
27/1/1387 (three full months) and again from 13/3/1387 (for two weeks) and from 
25/6/1387 to 5/7/1387 (two weeks), he was sent outside the prison for sick leave. 
</p>
<p>1154. Altogether, he has used four months of sick leave that is counted as part of his 
prison term. He repeated the same offence and was summoned by Branch 1 of Tehran 
Dadsara in the month of Azar 1386 and his case is presently being reviewed by Branch 15 
of Tehran Criminal Court. No verdict has been issued yet. 
</p>
<p>1155. He has two defence lawyers on this case, Mr. Keshavarz and Mr. Tabatabie.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1156. On 7 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the 
sentencing of Mr. <b>Isa Saharkhiz</b>, a pro-reform movement journalist and member of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>173 
</b></p>
<p>Association of Iranian Journalists and of the Central Council of the Committee to Protect 
Press Freedom, and Mr. <b>Hossein Derakhshan</b>, a blogger with dual Iranian-Canadian 
citizenship who posted instructions on his blog in Persian on how to set up a blogging site 
and begin writing online comments.  
</p>
<p>1157. Concerns regarding the case of Mr. Isa Saharkhiz have been communicated to the 
Government on numerous occasions, including through urgent appeals dated 11 February 
2010 and 1 April 2010. Mr. Isa Saharkhiz&#8217;s case has also been considered by the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention and has been deemed arbitrary in its opinion adopted on 6 
May 2010 (Opinion No.8/2010). 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1158. In a letter dated 7 October 2010, the Government provided information regarding the 
case of Mr. <b>Isa Saharkhiz</b> as follows. 
</p>
<p>1159. Mr. Isa Saharkhiz was in charge of foreign news service of one of the presidential 
candidates (Mr. Karoobi) and played an effective role after the election in propagating 
fictitious news, attributing fabricated allegations to high-ranking officials of the country, 
disturbing public mind and provoking unrest. He was arrested on the basis of a warrant, and 
after completion of investigations and collection of evidence, the investigating judge on 3 
July 2009 remanded the accused in light of previous records of commission of numerous 
offences.  
</p>
<p>1160. On 14 December 2009 an indictment was issued charging him for his actions in 
waging propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran, insulting the high-ranking officials 
of the country and disturbing public mind, his case was sent to the court &#8211; Branch 15 &#8211; and 
the first hearing was held on 18 July 2010. He has four defense lawyers &#8211; Ms. Nasim 
Ghnavi, Sepanta Jafari, Nasrin Sotoodeh and Mr. Mohammed Reza Afghahi. Despite the 
factious claim concerning his lawyers not being able to have access to his dossier, 
according to our inquiries his defense lawyer &#8211; Mr. Faghihi &#8211; came to the court and read his 
case on 2 Esfand 1388 and 14 Farvardin 1389. Moreover, the lawyers met their client a 
number of times. Mr. Sharkhiz is serving his sentence in the general cell of Evin Prison and 
is in good health. In addition to having telephone contacts, his family visits him weekly. All 
claims concerning mistreatment of Mr. Sharkhiz in prison is rejected.  
</p>
<p>1161. In a letter dated 16 February 2011, the Government replied to the urgent appeal sent 
on 7 October 2010 concerning the case of Mr. <b>Hossein Derakhshan</b> as follows.  
</p>
<p>1162. In connection with the conviction of Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, the High Council of 
Human Rights of the Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran has contacted all pertinent 
judicial authorities and courts. According to reports, Mr. Hossein Derakhshan, son of 
Hassan, has been charged with:  
</p>
<p> 1. Insulting Islamic sanctities (Hazrat Sedigh Tahereh, PBHU). 
</p>
<p> 2. Insulting the Leaders of the country.  
</p>
<p> 3. Distribution of pictures and materials intended to mock sanctities.  
</p>
<p> 4. Statements to the same effect.  
</p>
<p> 5. Distribution of obscene and pornographic material in cyberspace.  
</p>
<p> 6. Insults against the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p> 7. Propaganda against the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p> 8. Cooperation with hostile states (namely the Zionist regime) by participating 
 in anti-revolutionary conferences.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>174</b>  
</p>
<p> 9. Establishment of anti-revolutionary media.  
</p>
<p>1163. Mr. Derakhshan was arrested on 3 November 2008. Sometime later his case was 
brought before Branch 15 of Tehran&#8217;s Court of Revolution. During his trial, Mr. 
Derakhshan was defended by Dr. Mahdavi &#8211; his attorney. After the completion of the trial, 
the Court of Revolution found Mr. Derakhshan guilty and &#8211; based on articles 7, 47, 500, 
508, 513, 514 and 609 of the Islamic Penal Code and article 10 of the illegal audio and 
visual activities act &#8211; condemned (verdict No.D/T/16192/88) the accused to 5 years of 
imprisonment in connection with offenses 1 and 3, also 5 years of imprisonment in 
connection with offenses 1 and 3, also 5 years of imprisonment for offense 2, as well as 1 
year of imprisonment for offense 4, also 6 months of imprisonment for offence 5, and 1 
year of imprisonment for offence 6, and an additional 10 years of imprisonment for offense 
</p><p>7.  
</p>
<p>1164. Mr. Derakhshan was also prohibited from involvement in the media (print and 
cyberspace) and the activities of political parties. He was also ordered by the court to 
deposit all monies received into a government account.  
</p>
<p>1165. Mr. Derakhshan and his attorney have the right to appeal the sentence.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1166. On 22 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, sent an 
urgent appeal regarding the detention of Ms. <b>Fatemeh Masjedi</b> and Ms. <b>Maryam Bidgoli</b>, 
members of the &#8220;One Million Signatures Campaign&#8221; which purpose is to collect signatures 
in support of amendments of laws that discriminate against women. 
</p>
<p>1167. It was noted that members of the &#8220;One Million Signatures Campaign&#8221; have been the 
subject of previous communications sent to the Government, the most recent of which was 
sent on 28 December 2009, on behalf of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences; and Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>1168. According to information received, Ms. Masjedi and Ms. Bidgoli were arrested on 7 
May 2009, for peacefully gathering signatures in the framework of the &#8220;One Million 
Signatures Campaign&#8221;. Reportedly, they were released on bail after two weeks in detention. 
However, following a court hearing on 4 August 2010, Ms. Masjedi and Ms. Bidgoli were 
found guilty of &#8220;spreading propaganda against the system in favour of a feminist group [the 
Campaign] and for publication of materials in support of a feminist group opposed to the 
system&#8221;, and sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment. On 7 December 2010, this sentence 
was reduced to six months following a ruling by a court of appeal in Qom province.  
</p>
<p>1169. On 29 December 2010, both Ms. Masjedi and Ms. Bidgoli were summoned to report 
within 3 days to prison officials in Qom to begin serving the six-month prison sentence, but 
reportedly they remained free after further appealing their convictions and sentences. On 28 
January 2011, Ms. Masjedi was once again arrested for peacefully collecting signatures in 
support of the &#8220;One Million Signatures Campaign&#8221;, and is currently in an unknown place of 
detention. Ms. Bidgoli is currently free but is fearful that she might be detained at any time.  
</p>
<p>1170. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Madjedi and Ms. Bigdoli 
may be directly related to their work in defense of human rights. More generally, further 
concern was also expressed about the consideration of the &#8220;One Million Signatures 
Campaign&#8221; as a &#8220;group opposed to the system&#8221;, which places all members of the campaign 
in danger.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>175 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>1171. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 22 March 2011, and to 
eight communications sent earlier in 2010, and six in 2009. He urges the Government to 
respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information regarding 
investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1172. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the situation in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, in particular with regard to allegations of widespread use of torture and 
ill-treatment in places of detention against human rights defenders, bloggers, journalists and 
individuals who have expressed critical views. Additionally, he is disturbed by reported 
practice of detention of such individuals in unknown locations and incommunicado 
detention, as well as alleged restrictions to access a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>1173. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the use of vaguely 
worded provisions in the Islamic Penal Code which restrict the right to freedom of 
expression in contravention of international human rights standards, such as &#8220;enmity 
against God&#8221;, &#8220;propaganda against the system&#8221;, &#8220;colluding against the security of the 
regime&#8221;, &#8220;insulting Islamic sanctities&#8221;, &#8220;insulting the Leaders of the country&#8221;, &#8220;insults 
against the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8221;, &#8220;distribution of pictures and 
materials intended to mock sanctities&#8221;, &#8220;cooperation with hostile states by participating in 
anti-revolutionary conferences&#8221;, and &#8220;establishment of anti-revolutionary media&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur underscores that none of these constitute legitimate grounds for 
restricting the right to freedom of expression under international human rights law, 
particularly given that breaches of such provisions carry disproportionate sentences, 
including lashing and imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>1174. The existence and application of such laws creates a significant chilling effect on the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to repeal such provisions and to promote a 
climate of tolerance where individuals can express diverse views without risk to their 
physical and psychological integrity or acts of harassment, intimidation or fear of 
persecution.  
</p>
<p><b>  Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>1175. On 22 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an allegation letter concerning the 
<b>rising trend of fatal attacks on journalists and media personnel </b>in Iraq, including the 
most recent killings of Mr. <b>Riad Al-Saray</b>, television presenter of Al-Mosuliyah television 
channel, Mr. <b>Safaa Al-Dine Abdul Hameed</b>, television presenter of Al-Iraqiya television 
channel, and Mr. <b>Tahrir Kadhim Jawad</b>, freelance cameraman and former editor of the 
Al-Karma weekly newspaper. 
</p>
<p>1176. According to information received, on 7 September 2010, at around 6.00 a.m., Mr. 
Riad Al-Saray was killed when a group of unidentified gunmen opened fire on his car in 
western Baghdad. The police have reportedly confirmed that the gunmen used silencers in 
the attack. Mr. Al-Saray had hosted programmes that sought to reconcile Shiites and Sunnis 
in Iraq after joining Al-Iraqiya television channel in 2005, which is part of the State-run 
Iraqi Media Network. At least 14 other staff of the Iraqi Media Network have reportedly 
been killed since 2003. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>176</b>  
</p>
<p>1177. The following day, on 8 September 2010, at around 8.00 a.m., Mr. Safaa Al-Dine 
Abdul Hameed was shot dead in front of his house in Mosul, in the northern province of 
Ninawa, by gunmen firing from a speeding car. Mr. Abdul Hameed had worked less than a 
year at Al-Mosuliya, a private channel that was launched in 2006 and broadcasts in 
northern Iraq. He had hosted a programme called &#8220;Our Mosques&#8221;, which detailed the 
history of religious sites in Mosul.  
</p>
<p>1178. On 4 October 2010, Mr. Tahrir Kadhim Jawad died immediately after a bomb 
attached to his car exploded in the city of Garma in Anbar province. He was reportedly 
intending to drive to Baghdad to deliver footage when the bomb exploded. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1179. On 11 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the 
situation of Mr. <b>Ayad Muayyad Salih</b>, a human rights defender working with the Iraqi 
Institution for Development, a local non-governmental organization active in documenting 
and reporting human rights violations by the Iraqi army in Nineveh and Mosul. He is also 
an alumni of the Canadian non-governmental organization Equitas&#8217; CIDA-funded project, 
&#8220;Human Rights Education: A Pathway to Building a Human Rights Culture in Iraq, the 
Middle East and North Africa&#8221;.    
</p>
<p>1180. We would also like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8217;s Government to 
information we have received concerning the situation of Messrs. <b>Muayyad Salih Ahmed</b> 
and <b>Ra'ed Muayyad Salih</b>, the father and brother of Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>1181. According to the information received, on 26 October 2010, at 3:30 a.m., the house 
of Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih in Al-Faysaleya quarter of Mosul city was raided by members 
of the Iraqi military, who came to arrest him. However, Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih was away 
at that time, attending a conference organized by the Human Rights Centre of Nottingham 
University in Erbil City. 
</p>
<p>1182. Shortly afterwards, Messrs. Muayyad Salih Ahmed and Ra'ed Muayyad Salih were 
arrested and taken to an undisclosed location, reportedly to force Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih 
to surrender. Their whereabouts remain unknown as of today.  
</p>
<p>1183. It is reported that Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih went into hiding, fearing he would be 
arrested. 
</p>
<p>1184. Serious concerns were expressed that the attempt to arrest Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih, 
and the subsequent arrest and detention of Messrs. Muayyad Salih Ahmed and Ra'ed 
Muayyad Salih, may be related to Mr. Ayad Muayyad Salih&#8217;s legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights. In view of the incommunicado detention of Messrs. Muayyad 
Salih Ahmed and Ra'ed Muayyad Salih, further concerns were expressed for their physical 
and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1185. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communications dated 22 October 2010 and 
11 November 2010. The Special Rapporteur considers responses to his communications an 
important part of cooperation by Governments with his mandate, and urges the Government 
of Iraq to respond to the concerns raised in the aforementioned communication. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>177 
</b></p>
<p>1186. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the situation of 
journalists in Iraq. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 149 journalists have 
been killed in the country since 1992, with complete impunity in 93 cases.67 The Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure the safety and security of journalists, and to 
undertake immediate, impartial and effective investigations into the deaths of journalists 
and bring the perpetrators to account.     
</p>
<p><b>  Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>1187. On 20 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an allegation letter regarding 
concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Omar Alaaeddin</b> and Mr. <b>Mahmoud Zwahre</b>. Mr. 
Alaaeddin is a Palestinian human rights activist who has been organizing and participating 
in demonstrations in the village of Al Ma'asara (West Bank) in protest of human rights 
violations allegedly committed by the Israeli authorities and the Israeli armed forces. Mr. 
Mahmoud Zwahre is the mayor of Al Ma'asara, and a co-organizer of demonstrations in Al 
Ma'asara. 
</p>
<p>1188. According to the information received, on 14 March 2010, Mr. Alaaeddin was 
reportedly beaten and arrested by Israeli soldiers at the Container checkpoint in the West 
Bank. He was detained incommunicado in the Israeli Russian Compound jail in Jerusalem 
and interrogated in relation to his participation in demonstrations and for having allegedly 
assaulted one Israeli soldier who arrested him. Mr. Alaaeddin reported that he was beaten 
and subjected to electro-shocks with a taser while in detention. He further alleged that 
despite his repeated requests, he did not receive any medical treatment during his detention. 
Furthermore, Mr. Alaaeddin denied having assaulted Israeli soldiers at the Container 
checkpoint. 
</p>
<p>1189. On 21 March 2010, Mr. Alaaeddin was brought before a judge who reportedly 
ordered his release for lack of evidence in relation to the assault of Israeli soldiers. 
</p>
<p>1190. This arrest follows the one of Mr. Zwahre, who was allegedly arrested at the 
Container checkpoint, beaten and detained by Israeli forces on 2 March 2010. 
</p>
<p>1191. Concern was expressed that the arrests and detentions of Mr. Alaaeddin and Mr. 
Zwahre might be directly related to their legitimate work in defense of human rights, in the 
exercise of their right to freedom of expression. More generally, further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of the organizers of demonstrations 
in Al Ma'asara.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1192. In a letter dated 30 March 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 2- April 2010. 
</p>
<p>1193. <b>Mr. Omar Alaaeddin</b> was interrogated in the &#8220;Maale Edomim&#8221; police station on 15 
March 2010 for alleged assault of a policeman in duty. The information gathered in the 
investigation was transferred to the military prosecution for further analysis. On 7 
September 2010 the case was closed and no indictment given.

</p>
<p>1194. During his interrogation Mr. Alaaeddin reported that he was beaten by a Border-
Control Policeman. According to set rules and procedures, the complaint was transferred to 
the police investigations department. The department sent a letter to the complainant 
requesting that he arrives to file a complaint as required. Since the complainant did not 
contact the police investigations department, the file was closed on 26 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>1195. Mr. Alaaeddin did not complain of being subjected to electro-shocks during 
detention.  
</p>
<p>1196. We further request to note that all acts of torture, as defined in Article 1 of the 
International Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment are criminal acts under Israel&#8217;s legislation. In addition, all forms 
of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by 
Israel&#8217;s <i>Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty</i>.  
</p>
<p>1197. Moreover, in C.A. 5121/98, <i>Prv. Yisascharov v. The Head Military Prosecutor et. 
al</i>. (4.5.06), the Supreme Court held that &#8220;&#8230;the nature and extent of the unacceptable 
methods of interrogation included today in the scope of &#8216;harming the human character of 
the interogatee&#8217; may wider than in the past. This, in light of the interpretative impact of the 
<i>Basic law</i> and considering the international contractual law that Israel is a party to.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1198. In 2009, Israel&#8217;s High Court of Justice rejected a petition claiming that the 
Government and the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) disregarded the High Court of Justice 
ruling in <i>H.C.J. 5100/94 The Public Committee against Torture in Israel v. The State of 
Israel</i>. The Court found no legal or factual basis for this claim.  
</p>
<p>1199. We request to note that in 2006 Mr. Alaaedin was convicted, upon his confession 
and as part of a plea bargain, of membership and activity in a terrorist organization, 
attempting to purchase weapons and conspiring to intentional killing. He was sentenced to 
44 months imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>1200. We were unable to identify the complainant Mr. <b>Mahmoud Zwahre</b> according to 
the information in the report. We would appreciate further details of the complainant and 
the incident reported, including an identity number of Mr. Zwahre, in order to inquire into 
the allegations in the report.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1201. On 21 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the government concerning the situation of 
Mr. <b>Ameer Makhoul</b>. Mr. Makhoul, Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel, is the General 
Director of Ittijah (the Union of Arab Community-Based Associations), a network of Arab 
NGOs in Israel with special consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council. 
He is also the Chairman of the Public Committee for the Defense of Political Freedom 
where he monitors the restrictions on the political freedoms of the Arab citizens in Israel. 
</p>
<p>1202. According to the information received, on 8 January 2010, 10 days after Mr. 
Makhoul gave a speech in Haifa protesting the ongoing attack on Gaza, Israeli police 
allegedly summoned him for an interrogation. Mr. Makhoul refused, and was allegedly 
forcibly escorted by two ISA officers to a police station where he was interrogated for three 
hours.  
</p>
<p>1203. On 21 April 2010, an administrative order signed by Israeli Interior Minister Eli 
Yishai allegedly prohibited Mr. Makhoul from traveling outside Israel for a period of two 
months based on Article 6 of the Emergency Regulations of 1948. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>179 
</b></p>
<p>1204. On 6 May 2010, 16 Israeli police officers accompanied by agents from the Israeli 
General Security Services (GSS) allegedly raided Mr. Makhoul&#8217;s home in Haifa and 
arrested him pursuant to an arrest order dated 23 April 2010 citing security reasons as the 
grounds for his arrest. It is alleged that the police searched his house and confiscated 
documents, maps, the family&#8217;s four mobile phones, the laptops of Mr. Makhoul and his 
wife, the hard drives from his daughters&#8217; desktop computers, a camera and a small tape 
recorder. During the house search, the police allegedly violently restrained Mr. Makhoul&#8217;s 
wife.  
</p>
<p>1205. It is alleged that a few hours after the arrest, Mr. Makhoul&#8217;s wife received a phone 
call from someone who identified himself as representative from the &#8220;international 
terrorism&#8221; section of Petah Tikva interrogation center. She was then informed that her 
husband was being detained at the Petah Tikva interrogation center for questioning. The 
same day, a detention hearing on Mr. Makhoul&#8217;s case was reportedly held at the 
Magistrates&#8217; Court in Petah Tikva and his detention was extended for six days.  During this 
time, Mr. Makhoul was reportedly held incommunicado and had no access to a lawyer.   
</p>
<p>1206. On 17 May 2010, Mr. Makhoul&#8217;s detention was allegedly further extended until 20 
May by the Petah Tikvah Magistrate Court. It is alleged that, for the first time since his 
arrest, Mr. Makhoul was allowed to attend the hearing and granted access to his lawyers. 
</p>
<p>1207. It is further alleged that, Mr. Makhoul, who has been subjected to extensive 
interrogations, is suffering for exhaustion and pains in the head.  
</p>
<p>1208. Concern was expressed that the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mr. 
Makhoul might be directly related to his legitimate work in defense of human rights, in the 
exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Further concern was expressed about his 
physical and psychological integrity.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1209. In a letter dated 28 July 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 21 May 2010.  Mr. Amir Makhoul was arrested on May 6, 2010, and on May 27, 2010 
an indictment was filed against him for the following offences.   
</p>
<p>1210. Details on the indictment were provided by the Government. According to the 
indictment, the defendant knowingly had contact with foreign agents of the Hezbollah 
terrorist organisation, without reasonable explanation, and while he is aware that the 
abovementioned agents dealt with or were sent to collect confidential information or other 
actions that may harm state security on behalf of a terrorist organisation or linked to it or 
acting on its behalf. In doing so, the defendant conspired to assist the enemy, the Hezbollah 
terrorist organisation, in its was against Israel with the intent to doing so, by transmitting 
information with the intention that they will result in enemy hands or knowing that they 
might reach enemy hands. In addition the defendant transmitted information and 
confidential information while not being authorised to do so and with the intent of harming 
State security. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1211. On 8 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, sent a communication to the 
government concerning the sentencing of Mr. <b>Abdallah Abu Rahma</b>. Mr. Abu Rahma is a 
secondary-school teacher and head of the Bil&#8217;in Popular Committee against the Wall, an 
organization that carries out public demonstrations against the Israel security barrier and 
wall in the West Bank. This organization was awarded the International League for Human 
Rights&#8217; Carl Von Ossietzky Medal in 2008 for its work in defense of human rights.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>180</b>  
</p>
<p>1212. According to the information received, on 11 October 2010, Mr. Abdallah Abu 
Rahma was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 5,000 New Israeli Shekels by 
an Israeli Military Court, after having been found guilty of incitement and organizing 
illegal demonstrations. The charges allegedly relate to Mr. Abu Rahma&#8217;s activities 
organizing peaceful protests against the Israeli-built separation wall in the village of Bil&#8217;in. 
In addition, Mr. Abu Rahma was reportedly given a six-month suspended sentence in case 
he might carry out similar actions again in the future. Initial charges against Mr. Abu 
Rahma for alleged stone-throwing and arms possession were apparently withdrawn..  The 
latter was reportedly linked to Mr. Abu Rahma&#8217;s having collected used tear-gas canisters 
and bullet cases relating to shots at demonstrators by Israeli security agents, in order to 
document the level of force directed at demonstrators.  
</p>
<p>1213. The demonstrations against the wall, which Mr. Abu Rahma was involved in 
organizing, are reportedly non-violent and consist of Israeli, Palestinian, and foreign 
participants. It is further reported that Military Order 101, which applies only to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, was evoked in order to convict Mr. Abu Rahma.  This 
Order criminalizes attempts to influence public opinion, orally or otherwise, &#8220;in a manner 
that is liable to harm public order or public safety&#8221;, as well as other acts such as displaying 
or waving flags. The prosecution allegedly requested that the judge make an example of 
Mr. Abu Rahma by handing down a harsh sentence, with the objective of deterring others 
from participating in such public demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>1214. Concern was expressed that the sentencing of Mr. Abu Rahma may be related to his 
legitimate human rights activities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1215. In a letter dated 26 November 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 8 November 2010. In 2005, three criminal indictments were filed 
against Mr. Abdullah Abu Rahma for disruption of public order, interference with an IDF 
soldier in performing his duty and incitement and breach of curfew. Mr Abu Rahma was 
released from detention upon certain conditions for the duration of his trial. On 20 July 
2010, Abu Rahma was convicted of the above offences and sentenced to two months 
imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>1216. While breaching the conditions set by the court upon his abovementioned release, on 
December 10, 2009, Mr. Abu Rahma was arrested again, this time for committing 
additional offences. An indictment was filed against him for incitement; organisation and 
participation in an unauthorised demonstration aimed, <i>inter alia</i>, to disrupt public order, 
stone throwing; and the possession of unlicensed ammunition. Mr. Abu Rahma was 
arrested until the completion of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p>1217. On August 24, 2010, the Court convicted Mr. Abu Rahma for incitement and for 
organising and participating in an unauthorised demonstration. Mr. Abu-Rahma was 
acquitted of stone-throwing and possession of unlicensed ammunition. The conviction was 
based on Articles 1, 3, 7(a), 10 of Military Order No. 101 (1967). 
</p>
<p>1218. On October 11, 2010, the Court sentenced Abu Rahma to a total of 12 months 
imprisonment conditional imprisonment and a NIS 5000 fine. 
</p>
<p>1219. Mr. Abu Rahma was convicted for his role in the &#8220;Bil&#180;in in Popular Committee&#8221; or 
the &#8220;Fence Committee&#8221; which organises the weekly demonstrations in Bil&#180;in against the 
construction of the security barrier since 2005. 
</p>
<p>1220. It should be mentioned that these demonstrations often turn violent and involve 
stone-throwing and violent acts against Israeli forces in the area. Abu Rahma was convicted 
for organisation of these events and for incitement before and during these events. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>181 
</b></p>
<p>judges thoroughly reviewed all evidence before them in an extensive judgement and all 
procedures were held in accordance with relevant legislation and orders. 
</p>
<p>1221. The violent actions of demonstrators in Bil&#180;in are a constant threat to public order 
and security. Incitement to violence leads to actions that undermine peace and security and 
pave the way for violence and hatred. 
</p>
<p>1222. The military courts in the Judea and Samaria area act under the power of security 
legislation, which also guarantees the independence of the judges. All judges are jurists. All 
defendants have a right to retain private counsel, who are independent of the Israeli military 
system. In addition, it should be noted that all processes under the courts may be appealed 
to a Court of Appeals as well as ultimately reviewed in an appeals process by the High 
Court of Justice in Israel. 
</p>
<p>1223. The Court in its decision regard Abu Rahma addressed allegations raised by the 
Defendant relating to unfair trial and investigation practices. When these chargers were 
found to have merit by the Court, they were taken into account, and accordingly, two 
charges were dropped, <i>inter alia</i>, for reasons of lack of sufficient investigation and lack of 
evidence. A great deal of testimony, however, was found to be unreliable, as several of the 
witnesses contradicted one another, while other witnesses were declared to be &#8220;hostile&#8221; due 
to meaningful inconsistencies in their testimonies during investigation and during trial. 
</p>
<p>1224. The maximum penalty for the offences that Abu Rahma was convicted of is 10 years 
imprisonment. In his sentencing, handed down on October 11, 2010, due consideration was 
given to aggravating as well as mitigating factors. Abu Rahma`s leading role in the 
demonstrations and in society, his influence over the village people that was used for 
incitement to violence and his previous convictions and parole conditions which were 
violated called for a longer sentence. However, the court also took into account the fact that 
Abu Rahma`s actions were sparked by a sense of injustice; the defendant&#8217;s overall moral 
character; the fact that he has worked to promote peace, dialogue and co-existence; and the 
fact that the defendant is a teacher and a father. Taking into consideration all of the factors 
noted above, Abu Rahma was sentenced to a total of 12 months imprisonment, 6 months of 
conditional imprisonment (should he repeat these offenses in the following 5 years) and a 
NIS 5000 fine.  
</p>
<p>1225. Mr. Abu Rahma was represented by a lawyer in all the legal proceedings and court 
hearings. In addition an interpreter was present at the hearing.     
</p>
<p>1226. In a letter dated 15 February 2011, the Government provided additional information 
concerning the case of Mr. Abu Rahma.  
</p>
<p>1227. On 11 May 2011 an appeal decision was given in the case of Abdallah Abu-Rahme. 
The Defense appealed the convictions and the sentence, while the Prosecution appealed an 
acquittal from the criminal offense of stone-throwing and requested that the sentence be 
prolonged to a minimum of 18 months.  
</p>
<p>1228. The Court of Appeals thoroughly reviewed the claims of the defense and dismissed 
them except for a correction requested in the facts of the incident. The claims of the 
prosecution were also reviewed and the court ruled not to overturn the acquittal of Abu-
Rahme for stone-throwing.  
</p>
<p>1229. The Prosecution&#8217;s appeal on the sentence was granted. The Court of Appeals ruled 
that the actions and sayings of Abu-Rahme had a concrete designation, targeted at a 
concrete and clear audience that was ready to receive the message and to implement it 
immediately. Since the violent protests continue sentencing should be severe to deter future 
violations. However, since the exact scope of Abu-Rahme&#8217;s actions is unclear (and there is 
no evidence of activity later than 2008) and since Abu-Rahme did not act in physical 
violence against the soldiers his sentence should be alleviated.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>182</b>  
</p>
<p>1230. The Court decided to prolong Abu-Rahme&#8217;s sentence to a 16 month imprisonment 
(instead of 12 as he was sentenced in the Court of First Instance).  
</p>
<p>1231. As of January 2011, Abu-Rahme satisfied 13 months of his imprisonment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations   
</b></p>
<p>1232. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed responses received 
to the communications sent on 20 April 2010, 21 May 2010, and 8 November 2010, and 
looks forward to receiving a response to his communication sent on 5 March 2010.  
</p>
<p>1233. The Special Rapporteur expresses his concern at reports received regarding 
increasing restrictions to the right to freedom of opinion and expression of human rights 
defenders working in Israel. He reiterates his appreciation for the invitation extended to him 
in 2009 by the Government of Israel to undertake a mission, and hopes that a mutually 
agreeable set of dates can be agreed upon in the near future.  
</p>
<p><b>  Italy 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1234. On 6 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations to the 
Government regarding the <b>draft law entitled &#8220;Progetto di Legge 1415: Norme in 
material di intercettazioni telefoniche, telematiche e ambientali&#8221; </b>(hereinafter &#8220;the draft 
law&#8221;), concerning regulations on electronic surveillance and eavesdropping for criminal 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>1235. According to information received, on 10 June 2010, the draft law, proposed by the 
Minister of Justice Mr. Angelino Alfano, was passed by the Senate with 164 votes in 
favour. Of a total of 323 senators, only 189 were in the room when the draft law was voted 
on, as the representatives of the opposition coalition had allegedly left the room in protest. 
The draft law is pending approval by the Chamber of Deputies and signature by the 
President before it becomes law. The Special Rapporteur conveyed his understanding that 
the draft law will be presented to the Chamber of Deputies on 27 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>1236. The Special Rapporteur noted that the draft law has been put forward due to 
concerns that currently, (1) magistrates and prosecutors are ordering too many wiretaps 
with little or no evidence of actual criminal wrongdoing and the media are publishing too 
many of the results before any judge or jury has had the chance to deliberate, and (2) such 
use of wiretapped information raises issues with regard to individuals&#8217; right to privacy and 
the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in accordance with the law. These 
concerns may be legitimate and the Special Rapporteur expressed that the publication of 
wiretapped information before the start of a trial may prejudice the outcome of a case. 
However, the Special Rapporteur raised two concerns in connection with his mandate.  
</p>
<p>1237. First, in the current version of the draft law, there is a provision that stipulates that 
anyone who is not accredited as a professional journalist and records any communication or 
conversation and publicizes them without the consent of the person involved can be 
sentenced to imprisonment for up to four years. The Special Rapporteur expressed his 
concern that the introduction of such a penalty will severely undermine all individuals&#8217; 
right to freedom of expression, including persons who are not professional journalists, as 
guaranteed in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which 
provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice.&#8221;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>183 
</b></p>
<p>1238. Second, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concern that the draft law introduces a 
penalty of up to 450,000 Euros and 30 days in jail for publishers and a penalty of up to 
10,000 Euros for journalists who publish the content of leaked wiretapped materials before 
the beginning of a trial. While noting that he is aware of the concerns regarding the 
publication by the media of leaked wiretapped information before the beginning of a trial, 
the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the punishment envisaged in the draft law is 
disproportionate to the offence. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur referred to the 
principle enunciated, inter alia, by the Human Rights Council in its Resolution 12/16, 
which calls upon all States to refrain from the use of imprisonment or the imposition of 
fines for offences relating to the media, which are disproportionate to the gravity of the 
offence and which violate international human rights law. In addition, these provisions may 
hamper the work of journalists to undertake investigative journalism on matters such as 
corruption, particularly given the fact that the period until the preliminary hearing in Italy 
varies between three to six years, in some cases extending to ten years.  
</p>
<p>1239. Given these concerns, the Special Rapporteur urged the Chamber of Deputies to 
refrain from adopting the current draft law, and to engage in meaningful dialogue with all 
stakeholders, in particular journalists and media associations, to ensure that their concerns 
are taken into account. The Special Rapporteur also expressed his readiness to provide 
technical assistance regarding the draft law to ensure that it is in compliance with 
international human rights standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1240. In a letter dated 3 September 2010, the Government sent a letter in response to the 
communication sent on 6 July 2010, as follows.  
</p>
<p>1241. First of all, it has to be underlined that the Draft Law in question is currently under 
discussion in the Italian Parliament, where all opinions are democratically duly reflected. 
Subsequently, the original text, to which you make reference, is the subject of a thorough 
and substantial debate among the different political forces, with several substantial 
amendments being introduced. According to the Italian Constitution the Draft Law will be 
final only once approved in the same text by both Chambers and promulgated by the 
President of the Republic. We therefore regard as premature disputing at this stage on 
specific provisions; moreover, urging that the Parliament refrains from exercising its 
legislative function seems quite disrespectful of the parliamentary sovereignty in the name 
of the Italian people. A proper evaluation of the bill and its possible impact on fundamental 
rights should also include the full consideration of the overall Italian constitutional and 
criminal procedural framework, which of course could be done only in due course.  
</p>
<p>1242. As it generally happens on any question pertaining to the field of criminal 
procedure, the aim of the Draft Law is to strike a satisfactory balance between the interest 
for security of the society (in this case the interest of criminal investigations) and, on the 
other hand, the individual fundamental rights, namely the right to respect for private and 
family life and, in this specific case, the right to freedom of expression and information. It 
may be not needless to remind that these principles, set forth by the Italian Constitution 
consistently with International legal tools, have equal dignity in International Human 
Rights Law and cannot be considered separately. The government of Italy is traditionally 
committed, internally and internationally, to the promotion and protection of fundamental 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>1243. Interceptions of communications and conversations are forms of cover surveillance 
techniques placing obvious restrictions on the right to respect for private and family life 
(article 17 International Covenant; article 7 Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European 
Union and article 8 European Convention on Human Rights, the latter being the only 
enforceable legal tool, through the European Court for Human Rights). Among the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>184</b>  
</p>
<p>requirements set forth by the European Convention and elaborated by the European Court 
for national laws to comply with the right to privacy, stand specific conditions for the 
publication of the content of interceptions of communications and conversations. The main 
goal of the Draft Law is therefore to achieve an effective balance between the right to 
privacy of individuals whose conversations are recorded in the course of criminal 
investigations and the right to freedom of expression and information of the public 9article 
19 International Covenant; article 10 European Convention on Human Rights; article 11 
Charter of Fundamental Rights in the European Union).  
</p>
<p>1244. In this context, it has to be pointed out that the Italian Government has brought in a 
specific amendment, in which the protection of individual privacy and that of the freedom 
of the press are further and fully harmonized. In particular, it has been stressed the principle 
that, in the course of investigations, the obligation of confidentiality concerning 
interceptions of communications and conversations can be overcome whenever the judge 
(customarily in a special hearing, in the presence of the parties in the proceedings) or the 
public prosecutor deem it particularly relevant.  
</p>
<p>1245. Therefore, the text of the Draft is in full compliance with article 10, paragraph 2, of 
the European Convention on Human Rights under which the exercise of some freedoms &#8211; 
including that of expression/information &#8211; &#8220;may be subject to such formalities, conditions, 
restrictions, or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society 
(&#8230;) for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of 
information received in confidence&#8230;&#8221;. These are exactly the requirements that the Draft 
under consideration intends to meet with the goal of ensuring the protection of the secrecy 
of pleadings, as well as the privacy of subjects not connected with the investigation, and the 
freedom of the press.  
</p>
<p>1246. Within the framework of effective and full cooperation with the special procedures 
of the Council, under which Italy recalls that it has extended stranding invitations, Italian 
Authorities reassure the utmost consideration for this issue, remain seized of the matter and 
will be honored to provide further update upon your request.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>1247. In a letter dated 20 May 2010, the government sent a letter in response to the 
communication sent on 1 March 2010 concerning the sentencing of Mr. <b>Roberto Malini</b> 
and Mr. <b>Dario Picciau</b>. Mr. Malini and Mr. Picciau are the co-presidents of the non-
governmental organization &#8220;EveryOne Group&#8221; and work to promote the rights of persons 
belonging to minorities, including the Roma. 
</p>
<p>1248. From the reports of the State Police, on December 20, 2008, Mr. R.M and Mr. D. P. 
burst, during an identification check by police officers &#8211; activity falling within the exercise 
of public functions of the Police -, in a public square in the Municipality of Pesaro. The two 
persons under reference addressed the Police officers with specious slander and thus 
interrupted the performance of public service. 
</p>
<p>1249. In terms of reconstruction of events, it is noted that of the three foreigners under 
identification control by the Police, only one person was in possession of identification 
documents. Moreover, Judicial Authorities have reported that none of these foreigners has 
applied for asylum. It is also worth-noting that Mr. R.M. and Mr.D.P., once brought to the 
Police headquarters, apologized for their behaviour. 
</p>
<p>1250. By &#8220;penal decree of condemnation&#8221;, the gentlemen under reference were convicted 
under Article 340 of the penal code for the interruption of a public service. The police, 
being unable to fulfil their duty to identify the three foreigners, have not submitted any 
complaint, resulting in the dismissal of the offense of abuse, originally objected to Mr. 
R.M. and Mr. D.P.. Please also note that in the event that the offence under Article 340 is </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>185 
</b></p>
<p>ascertained the relevant criminal proceeding starts <i>ex officio</i>. This is not the case for the 
latter offence, namely that of abuse of public officer &#8211; mainly existing in the civil law 
tradition.  
</p>
<p>1251. As for the effective implementation of the principle of the fair trial, the Italian 
Authorities firmly deny that the gentlemen in question have been convicted without a trial. 
The above penal decree, which was issued on May 11, 2009 against the persons concerned, 
is envisaged under Article 459 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This procedure responds 
to the need to deflate the backlog and workload of the judicial authorities only in the event 
that the situation meets strict law criteria. Besides this is activated upon request by the 
public prosecutor and released by the judge for preliminary investigations when there is a 
clear evidence of guilt. 
</p>
<p>1252. Under the given circumstances prescribed by law, it is therefore possible to apply 
such proceedings, which provide neither the preliminary hearing nor the trial in its ordinary 
form, but preserve its &#8220;rewarding nature1&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1253. Once issued this decree, the convicted person may, within 15 days, appeal it, with 
the specific ability to request or activate either the so-called immediate trial, or summary 
trial or plea bargain under Article 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
</p>
<p>1254. Such summary judgement does not affect the right of defence. Indeed, if the accused 
disagrees with such measure, s/he may in fact establish the normal criminal proceedings 
through opposition to the decree.  
</p>
<p>1255. In this case, the two defendants, through legal counsel, brought, on February 22, 
2010, opposition to the penal decree, and requested the establishment of the hearing and 
thus the trial, in its ordinary form.  
</p>
<p>1256. In terms of results, it has to be noted that the persons under reference have been 
convicted under that decree to pay a criminal fine of 1,140.00 euro each, and not 2.100,00 
euros. 
</p>
<p>1257. Last but not least, according to the Police report, it has not emerged that the owner 
of a Bar was there when the events under examination occurred. However, if any testimony 
is requested by the two defendants in the incoming trial, such evidence will be submitted, 
according to relevant law provisions and in due judicial course.  
</p>
<p>1258. For these reasons, Italian Authorities deem that in this specific case there has been 
no breach of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR). 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1259. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for reply received to his 
communication sent on 6 July 2010. However, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned 
about the situation of press freedom in Italy, and hopes that a mutually convenient set of 
dates to carry out a mission can be agreed upon in the near future.  
</p>
<p><b>  Jordan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1260. On 3 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation to the Government 
concerning restrictions to the right to freedom of expression in the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan, notably the trial of Mr. <b>Sufyan Aref Ahmad Tell</b>, journalist, and Mr. <b>Muwfaq </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>186</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Mohd Khalf Al Mahadin</b>, columnist for the daily &quot;Al-Arab Al-Yawm&quot;, as well as the 
banning of the media to report on allegations of corruption.   
</p>
<p>1261. According to information received, on 14 January 2010, Mr. Muwfaq Mohd Khalf 
Al Mahadin participated in a debate on the satellite television station Al Jazeera, during 
which he criticized the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan&#8217;s cooperation with the United States 
of America on security issues, while Mr. Sufyan Aref Ahmad Tell criticized the Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan&#8217;s &#8220;military presence outside its borders&#8221; during a talk show on a local 
television station, Nourmina. On 9 February 2010, Mr. Sufyan Aref Ahmad Tell and Mr. 
Muwfaq Mohd Khalf Al Mahadin were ordered to appear at a court in Amman for 
questioning by the Prosecutor of the State Security Court, Mr. Yousef Faouri, following a 
complaint filed by retired military officers who accused them of insulting the Jordanian 
armed forces.  
</p>
<p>1262. When they appeared at the court with their lawyer on 10 February 2010, the 
Prosecutor ordered them to be held for 15 days at Al-Juweida prison, based on the 
following charges: carrying out actions that would disturb the peaceful relations with a 
foreign country (article 118 of the Penal Code); inciting racism (article 130 and 150 of the 
Penal Code); disparaging the army (article 191 of the Penal Code); encouraging the public 
to change the current Government (article 159 and 161 of the Penal Code); and  taking 
actions that would impair the prestige of the State (articles 130 and 132 of the Penal Code). 
</p>
<p>1263. On 20 May 2010, the case was transferred to the Amman Court of First Instance, but 
the date for the trial is yet to be set. If found guilty, they risk being sentenced to up to 
fifteen years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>1264. In a separate case, on 9 March 2010, the Prosecutor of the State Security Court 
reportedly issued an order banning the news media from reporting or commenting on the 
case of alleged corruption involving the Jordanian Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC) 
without his personal approval. The ban was ordered following the arrest on 4 March 2010 
of Mr. Adel Kudah, former Minister of Finance and an official of JPRC, Mr. Ahmed Rifai, 
former executive of JPRC, Mr. Khaled Shahin, prominent businessman, and Mr. 
Mohammed Rawashdeh, Government economic advisor, for allegations of corruption 
related to an expansion project undertaken by JPRC.  
</p>
<p>1265. Concern was expressed that the charges against Mr. Sufyan Aref Ahmad Tell and 
Mr. Muwfaq Mohd Khalf Al Mahadin and the ban imposed on the media regarding 
allegations of corruption constitutes a direct attempt to stifle the right to peaceful freedom 
of expression on politically sensitive issues in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1266. In a letter dated 13 October 2010, the Government sent a letter in response to the 
communication sent on 3 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1267. Investigations have ascertained that the Amman Criminal Court has not yet 
concluded proceedings in the first case, regarding Mr. Sufyan Aref Ahmad Tell and Mr. 
Muwfaq Mohd Khalf Al Mahadin, and that the second case, involving the Jordanian 
Petroleum Refinery Company, is still being heard by the court of appeal.  
</p>
<p>1268. As regards the request for detailed information on how far articles 118, 130, 132, 
159 and 161 of the Criminal Code are in conformity with the international norms and 
standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression set forth in article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and on the order handed down by the 
Prosecutor of the State Security Court in the case involving the Jordanian Petroleum 
Refinery Company, attention is drawn to the following: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>187 
</b></p>
<p>1269. With regard to the question on the extent to which articles 118, 130, 132, 159 and 
161 of the Criminal Code are in conformity with the international norms and standards on 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression set forth in article 19 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all these articles have been incorporated into parts 1 
and 2 of the Criminal Code, which deal with State-security and law and order offences. 
Article 19, paragraph 3, of the Covenant stipulates: &#8220;the exercise of the rights provided for 
in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may 
therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by 
law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the 
protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or 
morals. 
</p>
<p>1270. Certain restrictions may thus be imposed on the right to freedom of opinion, as 
provided for in paragraph 2 of article 19, and cited by the Special Rapporteurs in their letter 
provided that they are sanctioned by law and are necessary in order to protect security or 
ensure respect of the rights or reputations of others. This principle is also reflected in the 
Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>1271. Paragraph 5 (n) of the Human Rights Council resolution referred to in the letter from 
the Special Rapporteurs stipulates that States must review their procedures, practices and 
legislation, as necessary, in order to ensure the full and effective implementation of all their 
obligations under international human rights law, including to ensure that any limitations on 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression are only such as are provided by law and are 
necessary for the respect of the rights and reputations of others, or for the protection of 
national security  or of public order (ordre public) or of public health or morals. 
</p>
<p>1272. All the offences with which the two persons involved in this case were charged are 
included in legislation enacted to protect State security. Proceedings brought on the basis of 
that legislation do not impinge on Jordan&#8217;s obligations under article 19 of the International 
Convention on Civil and Political Rights. Legal proceedings were not initiated against these 
persons merely because of the debates that they had participated in or because they had 
criticized Government policy. In this connection, it should be noted that the Press and 
Publications Act was amended to provide for the establishment, in courts of first instance 
and courts of appeal, of specialized criminal divisions to consider press and publications 
cases. The special division of the Amman court of first instance was granted exclusive 
jurisdiction to hear publications and publishing offences under the Press and Publications 
Act that constitute a threat to national security, either at home or abroad. Moreover, under 
the recently promulgated act amending the Criminal Code, fines rather than prison terms 
are imposed for certain press offences.  
</p>
<p>1273. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s decision was taken in accordance with the relevant 
legislation (art. 225 of the Criminal Code, art. 39 of the Press and Publications Act No. 8 of 
1998 , art. 11 of the Contempt of Courts Act and art. 13 of the Access to Information Act) 
and is in conformity with the relevant international standards, including article 19, 
paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which states that 
under the law, certain restrictions may be placed on freedom of expression and opinion 
when this is necessary to ensure respect for the rights and reputations of others.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1274. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the detailed response received to 
his communication dated 3 August 2010. The Special Rapporteur notes some of the 
measures that have been taken in an attempt to address some of the concerns expressed by 
protesters since the beginning of the year, and urges the Government to take the necessary 
measures to guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression of all individuals. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>188</b>  
</p>
<p>also encourages the Government to ensure an environment which is conducive to the work 
of human rights defenders, journalists and bloggers without fear of persecution.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1275. On 2 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, sent an urgent appeal 
regarding Mr. <b>Ershidin Israel</b>, 38 years old, ethnic Uyghur of Chinese nationality, 
currently being held at the Pretrial Investigation Center No. 1 of Almaty, Seifulina Street. 
</p>
<p>1276. According to the information received, Mr. Israel fled the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region of China to Kazakhstan in September 2009 after he had provided 
information to Radio Free Asia&#8217;s Uyghur Service about the alleged torture to death of a 
Uyghur detainee and the subsequent arrest of two individuals whom the Chinese authorities 
accused of providing information on the case to the same radio station.  
</p>
<p>1277. After his arrival in Kazakhstan, Mr. Israel applied for refugee status from the office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Almaty, which he 
was granted in mid-March 2010. Mr. Israel has also made an application to the Kazakh 
authorities for asylum, which is still pending.  At the end of March 2010, UNHCR had 
secured a resettlement offer for Mr. Israel from Sweden.  Mr. Israel was scheduled to depart 
to Sweden on 1 April 2010.   
</p>
<p>1278. Subsequently, the Kazakh authorities denied Mr. Israel&#8217;s application for an exit visa, 
indicating that his name appeared on Interpol&#8217;s terrorism watch list. Prior to that, the 
Chinese authorities had made an extradition request based on terrorism allegations against 
Mr. Israel.  
</p>
<p>1279. The authorities agreed that Mr. Israel live in a &#8216;safe place&#8217;/apartment designated by 
UNHCR and that Mr. Israel be accompanied by representatives of UNHCR to interviews 
that have been conducted by the authorities repeatedly over the past months and were 
focused on his background and how he crossed the border into Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>1280. On 23 June 2010, Mr. Israel was arrested by the authorities with a view to his 
possible extradition to China. A court hearing took place on 25 June and the court upheld 
and sustained the arrest in relation to the possible extradition. Mr. Israel appealed that court 
decision; the appeals proceedings are expected for today, 2 July 2010. Information received 
indicates that in case the appellate court upholds the lower&#8217;s court decision, the office of the 
Prosecutor-General is likely to request more information from the Chinese authorities in 
relation to the extradition request. 
</p>
<p>1281. Concern was expressed about the possible forcible return of Mr. Israel to China 
where he risks arrest and trial on terrorism charges in relation to the aforementioned 
information provided by him to Radio Free Asia.  Further concern was expressed about Mr. 
Israel&#8217;s physical and mental integrity if returned to China. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1282. On 8 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a communication to the 
Government concerning Mr. <b>Vadim Kuramshim</b>, Mr. <b>Zhumagali Omanbayev</b> and Mr. 
<b>Spandiyar Shymyrkulov</b>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>189 
</b></p>
<p>1283. According to the information received, on 6 October 2010 at 6 p.m., Mr. Vadim 
Kuramshin and Mr. Zhumagali Omanbayev, brother of a prisoner at 40th Colony Dolinka 
in Shakhtinsk, near Karaganda, were arrested following after they tried to arrange a meeting 
with the prison administration. The men were trying to obtain permission to meet with a 
prisoner, Mr. Spandiyar Shymyrkulov who, on his arrival at the Colony was allegedly 
beaten up and put in a punishment cell for refusing to clean a toilet.  
</p>
<p>1284. As Mr. Kuramshin and Mr. Omanbayev were leaving the prison building, the men 
were arrested by officers from the Shakhtinsk Police and staff of the Committee for the 
Criminal Investigation System (National prison administration), and taken to the local 
police station. Upon inquiring into the reasons for the arrest, Mr. Kuramshin was informed 
by Police Major Kashkynov that he had received information from certain persons accusing 
him of being involved in drug trafficking. These people remain anonymous.  
</p>
<p>1285. Mr. Zhumagali Omanbayev has reportedly been pressured to turn down help from 
Mr. Kuramshin. Mr. Kuramshin and Mr. Omanbayev are currently held at the Police 
Station in Shakhtinsk. With regard to the situation of Mr. Spandiyar Shymyrkulov, no 
information about his well-being was available at the time the communication was sent. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1286. In a letter dated 21 January 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 8 October 2010. V. Kuramshin and Z. Omanbaev were arrested on 6 October 2010 
as they were trying to meet with the administration of a correctional institution to obtain a 
meeting with the prisoner S. Shymyrkulov, who had been beaten for refusing to clean a 
toilet. 
</p>
<p>1287. Verification of the matter laid out in the complaint showed that, at approximately 10 
a.m. on 6 October 2010, V. Kuramshin, introducing himself as a representative of a human 
rights defenders&#8217; organization, and Z. Onbaev (in the communication of the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur, the family name is given as Omanbayev), stating he was the cousin of 
prisoner S. Shymyrkulov, came to the administration of the AK-159/6 institution of 
Karaganda province department of the Committee of the Penal Correction System (Dolinka 
colony, strict regime), asking for a meeting with S. Shymyrkulov.   
</p>
<p>1288. The meeting was refused because, pursuant to a decision by the head of the 
institution on 4 October 2010, S. Shymyrkulov was being held in a punishment cell for 15 
days for refusing to clean the quarantine area of the correctional institution (under article 
114 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, prisoners held in punishment cells are not allowed 
to have visits). 
</p>
<p>1289. It has not been proved that the institution administration used unauthorized measures 
against S. Shymyrkulov for refusing to clean a toilet. 
</p>
<p>1290. On the day in question, at 5.18 p.m., duty operator of Karaganda province Internal 
Affairs Department Central Operations Division received anonymous information, recorded 
under No. 1874, that unknown persons travelling in a vehicle were transporting narcotic 
substances into the AK-159/6 institution (Dolinka colony open prison).  
</p>
<p>1291. The information was promptly passed on at area level to Shakhtinsk police station, 
where the duty officer recorded it in the information register at 5.18 p.m. under No. 1874, 
and immediately instructed Dolinka neighbourhood officer to check the report. The vehicle 
was apprehended with driver Z. Onbaev and passenger V. Kuramshin at the entrance to the 
open prison. 
</p>
<p>1292. The neighbourhood officer used his powers to check the driver&#8217;s papers, carried out 
a visual inspection of the vehicle and then, in light of the information received, asked them 
to go to Shakhtinsk police station to give an explanation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>190</b>  
</p>
<p>1293. It should be noted that Z. Onbaev and V. Kuramshin drove independently, without 
the officer accompanying them, to Shakhtinsk police station, where only Z. Onbaev was 
actually questioned; V. Kuramshin refused to give any explanation.  Z. Onbaev&#8217;s statement 
was taken in the entrance hall of the police station in front of the duty officer, where he 
wrote by hand that he had come to Dolinka on the request of V. Kuramshin to meet an 
acquaintance of the latter.  
</p>
<p>1294. They were not detained, there was no unlawful action by the police officers against 
them, and they remained in Shakhtinsk police station no longer than 30 minutes. V. 
Kuramshin and Z. Onbaev made no complaints to the procurator&#8217;s office about unlawful 
actions by officers of Shakhtinsk police station, or the administration of institutions in the 
area of Dolinka colony. 
</p>
<p>1295. It should be noted that, on 19 October, the administration of institution AK-159/6 
allowed V. Kuramshin and Z. Onbaev to meet briefly with S. Shymyrkulov. The meeting 
lasted one hour, during which V. Kuramshin offered his services and encouraged S. 
Shymyrkulov to make a complaint about the actions of the open prison administration, but 
the latter refused to do so.   
</p>
<p>1296. Given those circumstances, the conclusions drawn in the communications from the 
Special Rapporteurs have not been substantiated. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1297. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response received to his 
communication dated 8 October 2010. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that at the 
time of the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to his 
communication of 2 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>1298. The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to take the necessary measures 
to ensure an environment of tolerance of diverse and critical views which would allow 
journalists and human rights defenders in particular to carry out their legitimate work 
without fear of persecution.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1299. On 30 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Mr. 
<b>Keneth Kirimi</b>, a human rights activist working with the non-governmental organization 
Release Political Prisoners (RPP), and member of Bunge la Mwananchi, a grassroots 
movement fighting social injustice and promoting accountable leadership. 
</p>
<p>1300. According to the information received, on 22 April 2010, Mr. Keneth Kirimi was 
arrested by plain clothed officers in Nairobi, together with two other individuals who were 
with him at the time. The arrest reportedly took place near the headquarters of the General 
Services Unit of the police. Mr. Kirimi and the two other individuals were allegedly forced 
into a vehicle and driven around the Eastlands for several hours and interrogated.  
</p>
<p>1301. While the two other individuals were released on the same day, Mr. Kirimi was 
allegedly detained in Thika, where he was blindfolded and sedated, and taken to an isolated 
house in Suswa. During his detention he was allegedly subjected to torture and ill-
treatment, including sexual assault, intimidation by gunshots fired in a small room and 
threats of sexual violence against his wife. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>191 
</b></p>
<p>1302. Mr. Kirimi was allegedly interrogated about RPP, the work carried out by Stephen 
Musau, the executive coordinator of RPP, the organization&#8217;s work on extrajudicial killings 
and the sharing of their report with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions, Mr. Philip Alston.  
</p>
<p>1303. Mr. Keneth Kirimi was found on 25 April 2010, at Suswa market, reportedly in 
serious physical condition and is currently undergoing medical treatment.  
</p>
<p>1304. Concern was expressed that the arrest, arbitrary detention and torture and ill-
treatment of Mr. Keneth Kirimi may be related to his legitimate work in defence of human 
rights, in particular his work on political prisoners and summary executions in Kenya. 
Further serious concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Kirimi. Further concern was expressed regarding threats against human rights 
defenders who have been in contact with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions in connection with his visit to Kenya in February 2009. A 
communication containing such concerns was sent to your Government on 13 March 2009. 
No response addressing the concerns has yet been received to that communication. In this 
context we wish to recall that in a statement to the 11th session of the Human Rights 
Council in June 2009, the representative of your Government regretted and condemned the 
killings of human rights defenders from the Oscar Foundation and reassured that no human 
rights defenders will be intimidated or harassed.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1305. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply the communication sent on 30 April 2011, 
particularly given the seriousness of the allegations received and concerns expressed. He 
also regrets not having received a response from the Government to the communications 
sent earlier on 30 April 2010, 19 October 2009, 13 March 2009 and 18 February 2009. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken.  
</p>
<p><b>  Kuwait 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1306. On 11 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent an 
urgent appeal to the Government regarding the detention of and charges against Mr. 
<b>Mohammad Abdul Qadar Al-Jasim</b>, journalist and lawyer.  
</p>
<p>1307. According to information received, on 1 April 2010, a Kuwaiti trial court convicted 
Mr. Al-Jasim on criminal slander charges based on remarks he made at a private gathering 
in a house of a member of parliament at which he allegedly questioned the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
fitness for office and called for his removal. He was sentenced to six months in prison, but 
Mr. Al-Jasim has reportedly appealed his sentence. His sentence was thus suspended 
pending the appeal.  
</p>
<p>1308. On 11 May 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was summoned to the department of National 
Security for interrogation, and was allegedly questioned for more than fifteen hours over a 
period of two days by state security officers. From 11 to 18 May, Mr. Al-Jasim allegedly 
went on hunger strike to protest his detention. He has been held in detention since then. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>192</b>  
</p>
<p>1309. On 24 May 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was presented before the court in Kuwait City for 
the first session of his trial on charges of &#8220;instigating to dismantle the foundations of 
Kuwaiti society&#8221;, &#8220;slight to the personage of the Emir&#8221;, and &#8220;instigating to overthrow the 
regime&#8221;. The lawsuit was reportedly filed by Shaikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, 
Minister of Amiri Diwan Affairs and the son of the Emir. These charges are linked to 32 
articles published on his personal blog &#8220;Al Meezan&#8221; over the last five years, which 
allegedly criticised public officials in connection with the exercise of their offices. 
</p>
<p>1310. On the same day, public prosecutor&#8217;s office reportedly banned coverage of the case 
in all media, without providing any legal justification or compelling reasons for such a ban.  
</p>
<p>1311. On 7 June 2010, Mr. Al-Jasim was presented before the court for the second session 
of his trial. During the session, Mr. Al-Jasim and his lawyers allegedly complained that 
according to Article 44 of the Law on Penal Procedures, the 21-day maximum period of 
precautionary detention of Mr. Al-Jasim ended on 31 May 2010 and, since there had been 
no court order to renew his detention, his continued detention is thus illegal. The defence 
team also reportedly complained that prior to both trials, Mr. Al-Jasim had not been given 
due notification of the session, in breach of the Law on Penal Procedures. It was also 
allegedly claimed that Mr. Al-Jasim&#8217;s detention, alongside convicted prisoners in cases 
related to State security, is a violation of articles 25 and 26 of the Law on Prisons. The case 
has been adjourned until 21 June 2010 to hear the testimony of the investigation officer. 
</p>
<p>1312. Over his career, Mr. Al-Jasim has reportedly been the object of more than 20 formal 
complaints filed because of his writings and statements.  
</p>
<p>1313. Concern was expressed that the detention of and charges against Mr. Al-Jasim 
constitute an attempt to stifle the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in particular 
expression that is critical of Government officials. Moreover, concern was expressed that 
the ban of any media coverage of the case violates the public&#8217;s right to receive information.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1314. On 3 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants, sent an urgent appeal regarding the alleged <b>arrest and detention 
of 33 Egyptian nationals, as well as forced deportation </b>of some of these concerned 
nationals.   
</p>
<p>1315. According to the information received, 33 Egyptian citizens lawfully residing and 
working in Kuwait were arrested by the Kuwait State Security on 8 and 9 April 2010.  It is 
alleged that their arrests were connected to their involvement in the &#8220;National Association 
for Change&#8221;, a political group founded by the Egyptian opposition candidate, Dr. 
Mohammad Al-Baradei.   
</p>
<p>1316. The first round of arrests took place on 8 April 2010.  Three Egyptian nationals were 
arrested and detained after they attended a meeting of Al-Baradei supporters at a local caf&#233;.  
Then on 9 April 2010, 30 Egyptian nationals were arrested by the State Security while they 
were gathering in front of the Sultan Center supermarket and restaurant in Al-Samia to 
discuss the arrests which took place on 8 April 2010.  The arrest and detention of these 33 
Egyptian nationals have been reportedly carried out pursuant to Kuwait&#8217;s law prohibiting 
non-citizens from participating in processions, demonstrations, or public gatherings in 
Kuwait.   
</p>
<p>1317. 17 of those arrested have been reportedly deported to Egypt on 10 April 2010.  
There are concerns about the safety of those who were deported, in light of reports that 
more than 90 demonstrators calling for political reforms in Egypt, including supporters of 
Dr. Mohammad Al-Baradei, have been subjected to violence and arrested by the Egyptian 
security forces in the month of April.   </p>

<p>1326. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government of Kuwait had not transmitted a response to his communication of 11 June 
2010 and 3 May 2010. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, 
and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent 
prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1327. On 22 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
Mr. <b>Azimzhan Askarov</b>, a prominent Kyrgyz human rights defender, and director of the 
human rights organization Vozdukh (Air), which forms part of regional human rights 
network in southern Kyrgyzstan. He has been documenting police ill-treatment of detainees 
in the village of Bazar Korgan, and in other parts of the Jalal-Abad region of Kyrgyzstan 
for several years.  
</p>
<p>1328. According to the information received, on 15 June 2010, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov 
was detained by representatives of the Bazar Korgan District Police Department. According 
to information provided by his first lawyer appointed by the police, his detention was not 
officially registered until 16 June 2010, albeit he was arrested on 15 June 2010 and such 
registration under the law should have taken place within 3 hours following the arrest.  
</p>
<p>1329. From 15 to 20 June 2010, Azimzhan Askarov was held incommunicado in a pre-trial 
detention centre in Bazar Korgan. According to his brother, who was arrested together with 
him and who was released on 17 June 2010, Azimzhan Askarov and he were subjected to 
daily torture during interrogations. Upon his release, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s brother 
appealed to human rights defenders with the request for urgent intervention, as Mr. 
Azimzhan Askarov allegedly feared for his life while in detention.  
</p>
<p>1330. On 17 June 2010, at 16:35, the prosecutor issued a decree accusing Mr. Askarov of 
crimes, foreseen under article 233 para 2 and 3, article 299 para 2 points 1 and 3 of the 
Penal Code under criminal case # 166-10-159.The court has sanctioned the arrest of Mr. 
Azimzhan Askarov for another two months, until 16 August 2010, in order to carry out 
investigation. On 21 June 2010, a complaint was lodged with the Djalalabad district court 
appealing the court&#8217;s decision to prolong Mr. Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s detention. Human rights 
defenders were allegedly forced to pay a small bribe (upload mobile telephone balance) to 
have their appeal registered. 
</p>
<p>1331. The first meeting of Mr. Azimzhan Askarov with an independent lawyer and his 
colleagues took place on 20 June 2010. According to them, Mr. Askarov was very bleak, he 
could not sit. Both meetings took place in the presence of several police officers. It is 
believed that Mr. Askarov was beaten on his kidneys. According to the press release issued 
by the law-enforcement officials, the medical examination has not revealed any signs of 
physical mistreatment.  
</p>
<p>1332. It was reported that Mr. Azimzhan Askarov was subjected to prolonged daily 
beatings by police officials, in order to force him to disclose the location of his film clips 
and video camera. Mr. Azimzhan Askarov has filmed violence, and arson attacks in the 
mainly Uzbek-populated district of Bazar-Korgon. Mr. Askarov is believed to have filmed 
rioters firing on unarmed civilians, while armed police officers present at the scene 
allegedly did nothing to prevent ransoms and even participated in them.  
</p>
<p>1333. On 15 June 2010, police conducted its first search of Mr. Askarov&#8217;s house.  When 
they demanded to open the gates and his wife refused to do so, they fired in the air and 
broke down the entrance door of the gate. Mr. Azimzhan Askarov&#8217;s wife managed to flee to 
a neighbour&#8217;s house. Two more searches were conducted on 17 June 2010, one during the 
day and another in the evening. Human rights defenders arrived at his house at the end of 
the first search. According to the neighbours, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov was brought with the 
police officers who carried out the second search. On both occasions, Mr. Askarov&#8217;s house </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>195 
</b></p>
<p>was ransacked, and all food and his car were taken away from the house. According to 
human rights defenders, searches were conducted without a witness. 
</p>
<p>1334. On 17 June 2010, the Ombudsman of Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Tursunbek Akun declared at 
a press conference that the detention and charges against Mr. Azimhan Askarov were 
unfounded. A similar statement was issued by Kyrgyz human rights defenders on 15 June 
2010, expressing concern concerning the arrest and detention of Mr. Askarov and stressing 
that he worked peacefully on monitoring human rights violations committed.  
</p>
<p>1335. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Azimzhan Askarov may 
be related to his peaceful activities as a human rights defender, in particular to monitoring 
and recording the violence and arson attacks related to the recent ethnic violence in the 
Jalal-Abad region. In light of the alleged prolonged beatings and incommunicado detention, 
further serious concerns are expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of 
Mr. Azimzhan Askarov.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1336. In a letter dated 22 July 2010, Government of the Kyrgyz Republic replied to the 
urgent appeal dated 22 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>1337. After mass disorders in the village of Bazar-Korgon, Dzhalal-Abad province, on 13 
June 2010, the organizers of the disorders resorted to particular brutality in killing local 
police inspector M. Sulaimanov; seven other officers were wounded to varying degrees. 
</p>
<p>1338. The same day, the procurator&#8217;s office in Bazar-Korgon district, Dzhalal-Abad 
province, initiated criminal proceedings for incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred, mass disorders and murder of a member of the law enforcement 
agencies and the military. 
</p>
<p>1339. On 16 June 2010, Mr. Azimzhan<b> </b>Askarov and another individual were arrested on 
suspicion of having committed the above-mentioned crime, and taken into custody at the 
Bazar-Korgon district internal affairs office. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s house was searched with the 
authorization of the Bazar-Korgon district procurator, and the following were found in a 
bookcase and removed: 10 cartridges for a 9-mm calibre PM pistol; various books and 
disks calling for the incitement of inter-ethnic discord.   
</p>
<p>1340. Mr. Askarov and another individual were charged under articles 233 (mass disorder) 
and 299 (inciting ethnic, racial, religious or interregional hatred) of the Criminal Code. The 
following day, the Bazar-Korgon district court ordered their pre-trial detention as a 
preventive measure. 
</p>
<p>1341. The charges against Mr. Askarov and another individual are supported by the 
evidence of six of the police officers who were victims, the official reports of the 
confrontations between the police and Mr. Askarov, evidence from a witness, and the 
official reports of his confrontation with Mr. Askarov.  
</p>
<p>1342. According to evidence from the above-mentioned police officers, on 13 July 2010, 
Mr. Askarov and another individual were in the crowd, encouraging people to refuse to 
obey the law enforcement agencies, to take hostage the head of the district internal affairs 
office, and to kill the other police officers. 
</p>
<p>1343. On 24 June 2010, Mr. N. Toktakunov, lawyer for Mr. Askarov, came to the Dzhalal-
Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office to submit a complaint concerning the alleged torture of 
his client. According to a forensic medical report dated 17 June, Mr. Askarov had bruising 
around his arm and lower back, serious enough to be considered impairment to health but 
not causing any short-term health disorder.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>196</b>  
</p>
<p>1344. The inquiry conducted as a result of the complaint found that Mr. Askarov was 
arrested on 16 June 2010 and held in the cell where two other individuals were being 
detained on suspicion of having participated in the mass disorders. The same day, on the 
grounds that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s illegal actions had led to his house being set on fire and many 
people being killed, one of the individuals hit Mr. Askarov around the head, causing Mr. 
Askarov to fall on his back on the concrete floor. 
</p>
<p>1345. On 25 June 2010, Mr. Askarov requested the Dzhalal-Abad procurator&#8217;s office not 
to charge said individual as he had no claims against him. Moreover, it was noted in the 
complaint that none of the police officers had beaten him, and he refused to undergo a 
forensic medical examination. 
</p>
<p>1346. On 29 June 2010, the provincial procurator&#8217;s office refused to initiate criminal 
proceedings against said individual because there had been no complaint from the victim; 
and in respect of the alleged use of torture, because no crime had been committed.  
</p>
<p>1347. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s participation in the mass disorders has been proved by materials in 
the case file. Investigations are now taking place in respect of the criminal case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1348. On 12 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Mr. <b>Ulugbek Abdusalamov</b>, 
an ethnic Uzbek journalist in detention in southern Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p>1349. According to the information received, Mr. Ulugbek Abdusalamov was detained on 
14 June on charges of &#8220;inciting ethnic hatred&#8221; under Article 299 of the Kyrgyzstani 
Criminal Code and transferred to a police detention centre in the town of Jalal-Abad two 
days later. Mr. Abdusalamov had a cerebral hemorrhage in 2009, suffers from high blood 
pressure, stomach ailments and a heart condition. On 29 June, he was transferred to a 
regional hospital after his lawyer filed six requests, but was later returned to police 
detention in Jalal-Abad. On 24 July, he was once again taken to the hospital upon his 
lawyer&#8217;s request, after his health continued to suffer. He was subsequently taken back to 
police detention, despite the fact that his condition is said to be very poor.  
</p>
<p>1350. Concern was expressed for the physical and physiological integrity of Mr. Ulugbek 
Abdusalamov, due to the lack of adequate medical attention. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1351. In a letter dated 5 October 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 12 August 2010. In another letter dated 2 November 2010, the Government 
submitted the same reply.  
</p>
<p>1352. In the letter dated 5 October 2010, the Government informed that Mr. Abdusalamov 
was apprehended in Nooken district as he attempted to cross the border of Kyrgyzstan into 
Uzbekistan on 14 June 2010. He was charged with incitement to ethnic hatred under article 
299 of the Kyrgyz Criminal Code. The court ordered Mr. Abdusalamov&#8217;s remand in 
custody on 16 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>1353. Mr. Abdusalamov is the editor of the provincial newspaper Diydor (Meeting). He 
has also held the post of vice-president of the Jalal-Abad Province Uzbek Ethnic Cultural 
Centre for some time. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>197 
</b></p>
<p>1354. Mr. Abdusalamov took advantage of his professional position and systematically 
published in Diydor articles voicing separatist views aimed at inciting ethnic hatred and 
advocating the supremacy of the Uzbek people over other peoples in Kyrgyzstan, in 
violation of article 23 of the Mass Media Act. 
</p>
<p>1355. The detainee undertook various activities between 2000 and June 2010, together 
with Mr. K. Batyrov, President of the Uzbek Ethnic Cultural Centre, Mr. O. Karamatov, 
Chancellor of the People&#8217;s Friendship University, and others, to advance the Uzbek 
diaspora&#8217;s position. The activities included demands to make Uzbek an official language, to 
open more institutions of secondary and higher education with instruction in Uzbek and to 
guarantee that 30 per cent of State and local government and law enforcement posts were 
held by ethnic Uzbeks. 
</p>
<p>1356. Mr. Abdusalamov ignored the law in force in Kyrgyzstan and purposely organized 
meetings of ethnic Uzbeks between April and May 2010 at A. Batyrov University, a private 
university in Jalal-Abad, and in places with a high concentration of ethnic Uzbeks in Jalal-
Abad and Osh provinces. Mr. Abdusalamov made explicit public calls for a violent seizure 
of high-level positions in State and law enforcement bodies and for the destabilization of 
their activities in the guise of criticizing the work of the country&#8217;s law enforcement bodies. 
</p>
<p>1357. Mr. Abdusalamov, together with Mr. Batyrov and others, emphasized in their 
statements that there had not yet been a political assessment of the ethnic conflict that 
occurred in Osh province in 1990, which the ethnic Uzbek people had been awaiting for 20 
years. He therefore called on ethnic Uzbeks to take decisive unlawful action. 
</p>
<p>1358. The statements by Mr. Abdusalamov and other persons were repeatedly broadcast 
on the television channels Osh TV and Mezon TV, in violation of article 23 of the Mass 
Media Act. These statements provoked a public outcry from the people in the southern 
regions and subsequently caused the Kyrgyz population to conduct grass-roots meetings in 
Jalal-Abad. 
</p>
<p>1359. The procurator&#8217;s office in Jalal-Abad stated that the accusations against Ulugbek 
Abdusalamov had emerged during the investigation of a violent incident that occurred at 
Batyrov University in Jalal-Abad on 19 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>1360. Mr. Abdusalamov was charged on 10 August 2010 with offences under article 221, 
paragraph 2 (Abuse of power by an employee of a profit-making or other organization), 
article 233, paragraphs 1 to 3 (Organization of mass unrest), article 295-1 (Separatist 
activity) and article 299, paragraphs 2 (2) and 2 (3) (Incitement to ethnic, racial, religious or 
interregional hatred), of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>1361. The criminal case was referred for trail to the municipal court in Jalal-Abad on 26 
August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1362. Neither Mr. Abdusalamov nor his lawyer filed a complaint or an application in the 
course of the investigation by the procuratorial bodies of Kyrgyzstan. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1363. On 18 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the government regarding Mr. <b>Azimzhan 
Askarov</b>, director of Vozdukh, a human rights organization which documents police ill-
treatment in detention. Mr. Askarov was the subject of a joint urgent appeal sent by the 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>198</b>  
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on 22 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>1364. According to the information received, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov, an ethnic Uzbek, 
was detained by the police on 15 June, suspected of being involved in the death of a police 
officer during the recent violence in the country. 
</p>
<p>1365. On 26 July, the Jalal-Abad city court upheld the decision of the prosecutor&#8217;s office 
not to investigate allegations that Mr. Askarov had been tortured following his detention. 
The authorities have argued that the large bruises on Mr. Askarov&#8217;s body were produced by 
his cellmate. In addition, the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office indicated that Mr. Askarov had 
confirmed that he had not been ill-treated. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer has not been allowed to 
meet with his client in private, and believes he is afraid of further ill-treatment if he files a 
complaint. 
</p>
<p>1366. During the time Mr. Askarov has been in detention, his sister-in-law and his lawyer 
were both attacked when they went to visit him at the police detention centre. The police 
reportedly failed to intervene to stop the aggression.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1367. In a letter dated 21 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 18 August 2010 by providing the same reply as to the communications sent on 22 
June 2010 (see above).  The Government sent another letter dated 6 October 2010 to the 
communication sent on 18 August 2010, but at the time of finalization of this report, the 
reply had not yet been translated. He hopes that he will be able to make his observations on 
the reply received in his future report.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1368. On 29 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding Mr. 
<b>Azimzhan Askarov</b>, director of Vozdukh, a human rights organization which documents 
police ill-treatment in detention, and Mr. <b>Nurbek Toktakunov</b>, Mr.Askarov&#8217;s lawyer. Mr. 
Askarov was the subject of joint urgent appeals sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on 22 June 2010 and by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers; the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, on 18 August 2010. 
Responses to the above communications were received on 23 July 2010 and 23 August 
2010, respectively. Mr. Toktakunov was the subject of a joint allegation letter sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers, on 12 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>1369. According to the new information received, Mr. Azimzhan Askarov is currently 
appealing a sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the regional court at Nooken, in the 
Jalal-Abad region of the Kyrgyz Republic,  after a trial allegedly characterised by severe 
procedural irregularities and allegations of torture and ill-treatment of the accused while in 
detention. Mr. Askarov and the other defendants, all ethnic Uzbeks, were found guilty of 
murdering a Kyrgyz policeman during ethnic clashes in Bazar-Korgon in June 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>199 
</b></p>
<p>1370. The trial was allegedly characterized by worrying irregularities with regard to fair 
trial procedure. At the opening of the trial hearing on 2 September 2010, family members of 
the deceased policemen reportedly verbally abused Mr. Askarov and threatened &#8220;to kill all 
the defendants and their children wherever they are&#8221;. During the hearing, relatives of the 
victim reportedly prevented Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives from entering the court room. It is also 
reported that they repeatedly interrupted the proceedings with threats and insults against the 
defendants, often making reference to the defendants&#8217; ethnicity. The judge allegedly did not 
intervene to maintain order in the court room. The defendants&#8217; lawyers were also attacked 
by relatives of the deceased police officer and injured police officers, who reportedly hit 
them with sticks, and threw a glass at them, which smashed against the bars of the cage 
holding the defendants, resulting in splinters of glass hitting one of the lawyers. It is 
reported that court officials, including the judge, intervened only sporadically to stop the 
violence and to restore order. Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyers were allegedly denied the opportunity 
to question witnesses or submit petitions during the hearing. When the lawyers expressed 
concern that they would not be able to defend their clients under these conditions, the judge 
threatened to have their licenses to practice revoked. 
</p>
<p>1371. Before the trial hearing on 6 September 2010 began, family members of the 
deceased policeman and injured police officers posted flyers on the walls of the court 
building containing offensive language against Mr. Askarov and co-defendants and calls for 
the application of death penalty. The hearing itself was characterized by yet further 
allegations of procedural irregularities. A request by Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer, Mr. Nurbek 
Toktakunov, that the hearing be deferred to allow him time to prepare an adequate defence 
was also denied; Mr. Toktakunov was also reportedly denied permission to meet with his 
client, and informed that he could only meet Mr. Askarov at the end of the trial process. 
Members of the audience, including family members of the deceased policeman, attempted 
to violently attack the defendants, and frequently subjected both the defendants and Mr. 
Toktakunov to verbal abuse; racist remarks; and threats.  It is reported that no witnesses for 
the defence were heard during the trial, and that when Mr. Toktakunov stated his intention 
to call a witness, he was told by the victim&#8217;s relatives that the witness would &#8220;not leave this 
place alive&#8221;. Further, members of the audience also reportedly directed questions to the 
defendants without authorisation from the judge, and the accused did not receive a full 
explanation of their rights and responsibilities. It is also alleged that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s relatives 
were subjected to intimidation and threatened not to attend the hearing. 
</p>
<p>1372. Serious concerns have been raised regarding the treatment of Mr. Askarov and the 
other defendants while in detention. At the trial hearing of 6 September 2010, four of the 
defendants, including Mr. Askarov, allegedly bore visible marks indicating that they had 
been subjected to beatings. A petition by Mr. Toktakunov that his client be given a 
thorough medical exam was denied. When questioned by the judge, Mr. Askarov denied 
that he was subjected to any harm, although concern is expressed that this may have been 
out of fear of retribution.  
</p>
<p>1373. On 15 September 2010, Mr. Askarov and all seven defendants were found guilty and 
sentenced to life imprisonment. The verdict in the trial was subsequently denounced by 
Kyrgyz Ombudsman, Mr. Tursunbek Akun, as being politically motivated. Mr. Akun also 
claimed that an alternative investigation into the policeman&#8217;s killing held by his office had 
found Mr. Askarov not guilty.  
</p>
<p>1374. On 25 October 2010, Mr. Askarov appeared before Tashkumyr city court in order to 
appeal against the sentence. It is reported that upon arriving at the court, witnesses for the 
defence were prevented from entering the court room by a group of individuals. Upon 
raising the issue with the judge, the defence lawyer was questioned as to why the defence 
team had not previously applied for protection for their witnesses. During the session, 
several defendants reportedly claimed that they had been subjected to torture during </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>200</b>  
</p>
<p>interrogation; however, the court reportedly failed to respond to the allegations. The next 
hearing in the appeal is scheduled for 3 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>1375. Concern was expressed that the conviction and sentencing of Mr. Azimzhan 
Askarov may be related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights in 
Kyrgyzstan. Grave concern was also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr. Askarov and his family, Mr. Toktakunov, and witnesses for the defence in this case, 
in light of the repeated allegations of torture and ill-treatment, attacks, harassment, and 
intimidation outlined above. Further concern was expressed regarding the aforementioned 
allegations of irregularities relating to due process during Mr. Askarov&#8217;s trial and appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1376. In a letter dated 16 December 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 29 October 2010. 
</p>
<p>1377. According to the review by the internal security service of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, at approximately 3 p.m. on 2 August 2010, in the course of inquiries into criminal 
case No. 166-10-159, remand prisoner A. Askarov, who was being held in the Bazar-
Korgon district temporary holding facility for offences under article 97, paragraphs 2 (4), 2 
(6), 2 (9), 2 (10), 2 (15) and 2 (16), article 299, paragraphs 2 (1) and 2 (3), article 233, 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and article 240 of the Criminal Code, was escorted to the district 
procurator&#8217;s office, where investigators of the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office 
were present. 
</p>
<p>1378. On completion of the inquiries, Mr. Askarov, accompanied by his lawyer, N. 
Toktakunov, was escorted back to the holding facility at the internal affairs office (militia 
station). There, Mr. Toktakunov requested a private interview with his client and was 
provided with a room on the premises. 
</p>
<p>1379. At that moment, relatives of the slain Bazar-Korgon district militia officer, Captain 
M. Sulaimanov, came to the station asking to see the district militia chief. To avoid a 
conflict between the relatives of Mr. Sulaimanov and Mr. Askarov, the militia chief gave 
orders for Mr. Askarov to be placed in the cells. Captain Sulaimanov&#8217;s relatives were then 
allowed onto the premises. Mr. Toktakunov was escorted from the station by militia 
officers and officials working for the provincial procurator&#8217;s office. 
</p>
<p>1380. In addition, the review found that Mr. Toktakunov&#8217;s claims &#8212; that he had been 
surrounded near the militia station on 23 June 2010 by a hostile crowd of local inhabitants 
threatening reprisals against him for defending an ethnic Uzbek and that Mr. Askarov&#8217;s 
wife, Turdihon Askarova, had been assaulted by Mr. Sulaimanov&#8217;s relatives on the 
premises of the militia station on 21 July 2010 &#8212; were not corroborated. 
</p>
<p>1381. This is also borne out by the fact that Ms. Askarova herself did not file a report on 
her assault with the militia station and that the matter of her having sustained bodily injuries 
was not recorded in the Bazar-Korgon district militia log. 
</p>
<p>1382. The findings of the review have been transmitted to the Jalal-Abad provincial 
procurator&#8217;s office to be included as evidence in the above-mentioned criminal case. 
</p>
<p>1383. Information on the consideration of the criminal case against the Kyrgyz national 
Azimzhan Askarov by the Office of the Procurator-General and Supreme Court of the 
Kyrgyz Republic: at approximately 10 p.m. on 12 June 2010, about 400 to 500 ethnic 
Uzbeks assembled at the intersection of Saidullaev and Jalal-Abad streets in the village of 
Bazar-Korgon in the Bazar-Korgon district of Jalal-Abad province and 400 to 500 ethnic 
Kyrgyz at the intersection of Jalal-Abad and Abduraimov streets in the same village. </p>

</b></p>
<p>1384. Subsequently, at approximately 8 a.m. on 13 June 2010, about 400 to 500 ethnic 
Uzbeks armed with firearms, steel rods, wooden sticks and knives assembled at the Bazar-
Korgon bridge on the Osh-Bishkek highway, blocked the highway and organized mass 
disturbances in connection with the inter-ethnic clashes in Osh. 
</p>
<p>1385. A special investigating team from the Bazar-Korgon district internal affairs office 
was dispatched to the scene of the incident. The militia officers&#8217; attempts to quell the 
criminal actions of those organizing and participating in the mass disturbances were met 
with resistance and disobedience; neighbourhood militia officer Captain M. Sulaimanov 
was seized, then stabbed repeatedly, which resulted in his death. 
</p>
<p>1386. On 13 June 2010, the Bazar-Korgon district procurator&#8217;s office opened criminal case 
No. 166-10-159 in connection with the above-mentioned mass disturbances and murder of a 
law enforcement officer. 
</p>
<p>1387. As a result of the investigation, charges were brought against A. Askarov, the head 
of the human rights organization Vozdukh, for offences under articles 28, 30-227, 
paragraphs 2 (1) and 2 (3), 241, paragraph 1, 299, paragraphs 1 and 2 (1), 233, paragraphs

against S. Mulavhunov under articles 242, paragraph 3, and 30-233, paragraph 2. 
</p>
<p>1388. Criminal case No. 166-10-159 was referred to court for trial on 11 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>1389. The Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office completed its investigation of criminal 
case No. 166-10-626, filed against I. Abduraimov separately from case No. 166-10-159 in 
connection with the ethnically motivated mass disturbances in the village of Bazar-Korgon 
in the Bazar-Korgon district on 13 June 2010 and also referred to the Bazar-Korgon district 
court for trial, on 26 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1390. The Bazar-Korgon district court ruled that the two criminal cases should be joined 
on 27 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1391. The assize court hearing of the criminal case against A. Askarov and the others, 
presided over by Bazar-Korgon district court judge N.K. Alimkulov, began at 11 a.m. on 2 
September 2010 in the Nooken district court. 
</p>
<p>1392. On 15 September 2010, the Bazar-Korgon district court found the defendant 
Azimzhan Askarov guilty of offences under articles 28, 30 and 277, paragraphs 2 (1) and 2 
(3), of the Criminal Code and sentenced him to 9 years of deprivation of liberty, and, under

</p>
<p>1414. The legal representatives of the victim, C. Bechelova and K. Sulaimanova, the 
defendants Mr. Rosbaev and Mr. Mulavhunov and the defence lawyers B. Kalmanov, A. 
Abylakimov, G. Shaimkulova, M. Akmatova, Ms. Usmanova, T. Tomina and A. Maytov 
appealed the district court judgement to the Jalal-Abad provincial court. 
</p>
<p>1415. The criminal and administrative chamber of the Jalal-Abad provincial court, by a 
judgement of 10 November 2010, upheld the 15 September 2010 judgement of the Bazar-
Korgon district court against Mr. Askarov, Mr. Mirzalimov, Ms. Mamadalieva, Mr. 
Mulavhunov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev, and the 
defence lawyers&#8217; appeals were denied. 
</p>
<p>1416. Relatives of the defendants Mr. Askarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. 
Mulavhunov, Mr. Mirzalimov, Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev on 5 November 2010 
applied to the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s office for measures to be taken against 
Jalal-Abad province special militia officers for causing the defendants bodily harm 
following legal proceedings at the Nooken district court on 4 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>1417. A review of the matter established that, on 4 November 2010, in the Nooken district 
court, the Jalal-Abad provincial court heard the appeal in the case of the murder of the 
Bazar-Korgon district militia officer M. Sulaimanov. 
</p>
<p>1418. The Jalal-Abad province internal affairs department chief mobilized 10 rapid 
response unit officers and 30 Jalal-Abad province patrol guard officers to keep the peace 
during the proceedings and ensure the safety of the parties. 
</p>
<p>1419. Deputy militia chief T. Torokanov and the head of the public security section of the 
Jalal-Abad province internal affairs department, I. Shatmanaliev, conducted an official 
inquiry into the alleged assault on the defendants by special militia officers following the 
proceedings and found no evidence to corroborate the allegation. In addition, forensic 
medical examinations found no sign of bodily harm of any kind caused to the defendants. 
</p>
<p>1420. Under these circumstances, the review concluded that there was no evidence of any 
wrongdoing in the actions of the rapid response unit officers. 
</p>
<p>1421. In this connection, on 18 November 2010 the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s 
office decided against instituting criminal proceedings on the basis of the application by the 
relatives of Mr. Askarov, Mr. Rasulov, Mr. Kochkarov, Mr. Mulavhunov, Mr. Mirzalimov, 
Mr. Abduraimov and Mr. Rozubaev and explained to them the procedures for appealing 
that decision. 
</p>
<p>1422. N. Toktakunov, Mr. Askarov&#8217;s lawyer, filed a complaint with the Jalal-Abad 
provincial procurator&#8217;s office on 24 June 2010 alleging that Mr. Askarov had been tortured. 
A forensic medical examination scheduled on 17 June 2010 established that Mr. Askarov </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>204</b>  
</p>
<p>had bruises around his arms and lower back, which were categorized according to their 
severity as having no short-term health effects. 
</p>
<p>1423. As a result of the review carried out of this complaint, it was established that on 16 
June 2010 Mr. Askarov had been detained and placed in an administrative detention cell, 
where Mr. Mahmujanov and Mr. Mirzalimov were being held on suspicion of involvement 
in mass disturbances. On the same day, Mr. Mahmujanov, on the pretext that his house had 
been set on fire and many persons killed because of Mr. Askarov&#8217;s unlawful acts, struck 
Mr. Askarov&#8217;s head with his hand, causing him to fall on his back against the concrete 
floor.  
</p>
<p>1424. On 25 June 2010, Mr. Askarov appealed to the Jalal-Abad provincial procurator&#8217;s 
office not to press criminal charges against Mr. Mahmujanov, as he had no claims against 
him. Furthermore, his statement indicated that no militia officer had beaten him, and he 
refused to undergo a forensic medical examination. 
</p>
<p>1425. On 29 June 2010, the provincial procurator&#8217;s office declined to initiate criminal 
proceedings against Mr. Mahmujanov because no complaint had been filed by the victim. 
Nor were any criminal proceedings instituted in respect of the alleged torture, owing to lack 
of evidence of an offence. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1426. On 16 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Independent Expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the <b>violation of due process rights and 
guarantees in the conduct of criminal proceedings in relation to the June 2010 
violence</b>, including allegations of torture and ill-treatment in Osh and Jalal-Abad Provinces, 
in the south of the Kyrgyz Republic.  
</p>
<p>1427. The alleged torture and ill-treatment of detainees, most of them ethnic Uzbeks, 
threats against lawyers and human rights defenders have been previously addressed in a 
number of communications sent on 20 July 2010, 12 August 2010, 18 August 2010, 15 
September 2010, 25 October 2010 and 29 October 2010. 
</p>
<p>1428. Furthermore, the cases of Mr. Azimjan Askarov, a prominent ethnic Uzbek human 
rights defender, and director of the human rights organization Vozdukh (Air), which forms 
part of the regional human rights network in southern Kyrgyzstan, and his lawyer, Mr. 
Nurbek Toktakunov, have been the subject of previous communications. Three joint urgent 
appeals on the case of Mr. Askarov were addressed to the Government respectively 22 June 
2010, 18 August 2010, and 29 October 2010. A communication was sent on the case of Mr. 
Toktakunov on 12 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1429. While acknowledging receipt of replies sent by the Government dated 22 July 2010, 
21 August 2010, 5 and 6 October 2010, 2 November 2010, and 16 December 2010, the 
Special Rapporteurs noted that responses to the communications dated 15 September 2010 
and 25 October 2010 have yet to be received. 
</p>
<p>1430. The summary below is divided into three parts: a general part (I); specific cases 
brought to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; attention concerning the conduct of criminal 
proceedings (II); and new information concerning Mr. Askarov and his co-defendants (III). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>205 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Part I: 
</i></p>
<p>1431. According to the information received, since the violence erupted in June 2010, 436 
bodies have allegedly been found in the south of the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 285 were 
identified as ethnic Uzbeks and 109 as ethnic Kyrgyz, while the remaining ones remained 
unidentified as of February 2011, according to official data shared by the General 
Prosecutor&#8217;s office and published in a local newspaper Delo No on 23 February 2011. In 
this context, criminal proceedings have been initiated to identify and bring to justice the 
perpetrators of these acts. However, the alleged unfairness of trials, the unequal treatment 
in the administration of justice and numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment have 
reportedly exacerbated tensions among ethnic communities in the southern part of the 
country and the general feeling of insecurity, in particular among ethnic Uzbeks. 
</p>
<p>  1. Status of investigations 
</p>
<p>1432. Two commissions have been established to conduct investigations into the June 
2010 events, namely the National Commission of Inquiry and the Parliamentary 
Commission, were specifically established to that end. According to its report submitted to 
Parliament on 11 January 2011, the National Commission of Inquiry found that the June 
2010 violence had been instigated by ethnic Uzbek community leaders and that law 
enforcement officials, the majority of whom were ethnic Uzbeks, had committed acts of 
torture against detainees. Concerns have been raised by some of its previous members 
regarding its lack of competence and impartiality, in particular with regard to its 
composition and terms of reference. Two members had reportedly withdrawn their 
membership prior to the publication of the Commission&#8217;s findings. Second, a Parliamentary 
Commission was established to investigate the political causes of the violence, but has not 
yet published its results. 
</p>
<p>1433. Despite the figures mentioned above indicating that ethnic Uzbeks were the main 
victims of ethnic violence, it is reported that investigations and trials have mainly been 
conducted against ethnic Uzbeks as defendants. We are informed that 5 302 criminal cases 
have been initiated in relation to the June 2010 violent ethnic clashes, in which 330 persons 
have been charged, of whom 260 are ethnic Uzbeks, 66 ethnic Kyrgyz and four persons of 
other ethnicities. Among the 330 persons charged, 290 persons were ordered by courts to be 
put into pre-trial detention, 240 of whom are ethnic Uzbeks, 48 ethnic Kyrgyz and two 
persons of other ethnicities.  
</p>
<p>1434. While the majority of cases are still under investigation, some have reached the trial 
stage. Many trials resulted in defendants, mostly ethnic Uzbeks, being sentenced to long 
prison terms following trials which allegedly failed to uphold due process rights and 
procedural guarantees. More than 58 life sentences have been handed down as of March 
2011, the majority of which were upheld by the court of appeal. 
</p>
<p>1435. It is alleged that a significant number of defendants were subjected to torture and ill-
treatment to extract confessions or statements implicating co-defendants. These statements 
were admitted as evidence in court and in some cases judicial proceedings reportedly relied 
heavily on them. Judges failed to order prompt and impartial investigations into the 
allegations of torture. 
</p>
<p>1436. During the trials, judicial authorities have allegedly failed to take disciplinary 
measures against individuals &#8211; relatives and supporters of victims, who repeatedly 
disrupted court hearings with ethnic-based violent attacks and verbal abuse against 
defendants and lawyers. It is alleged that in many cases, defence witnesses were not even 
summoned by the defence lawyers to give testimonies during court hearings because 
witnesses feared reprisals from relatives of the victims or from law enforcement officials. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>206</b>  
</p>
<p>In at least ten trials, relatives of ethnic Uzbek defendants stopped attending hearings after 
physical attacks or verbal threats by relatives and supporters of the victims.  
</p>
<p>1437. It is also reported that in at least four appeal trials, the Higher Court failed to 
conduct a full and genuine review of the conviction or sentence that defendants had 
received in the first instance courts. For example, on 1 February 2010, Osh Province Court 
confirmed the decision of Osh City Court, sentencing an ethnic Uzbek defendant to 15 
years&#8217; imprisonment after a session that lasted approximately 45 minutes. 
</p>
<p>  2.  Allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
</p>
<p>1438. From 27 August 2010 to 31 December 2010, 46 cases of torture and ill-treatment by 
law enforcement officers have been documented, of which 43 allegedly involved ethnic 
Uzbeks. In many cases, the authorities have reportedly failed to adequately address 
allegations of torture. While in many cases, victims have declined to file official 
complaints, even when complaints are filed, the prosecutor&#8217;s office appears to have been 
reluctant to open investigations.  
</p>
<p>  3.   Allegations of arbitrary detention 
</p>
<p>1439. From 27 August 2010 to 31 December 2010, 93 alleged cases of arbitrary detention 
or unlawful arrest have been documented, of which 92 reportedly involved ethnic Uzbeks. 
Law enforcement officers reportedly frequently extorted money to secure the victims&#8217; 
release.  
</p>
<p><i>  Part II - relating to the conduct of criminal trials have been brought to the Special 
Rapporteurs&#8217; attention 
</i></p>
<p>1440. On 5 November 2010, Jalal-Abad City Court convicted two ethnic Kyrgyz men of 
murder of two ethnic Uzbek civilians ethnic and other crimes, and sentenced them to 20 
and 25 years&#8217; imprisonment respectively and to confiscation of private property. Two other 
ethnic Kyrgyz men were given three year suspended sentences after being found guilty of 
participation in mass riots and inciting inter-ethnic hatred. It is reported that the decision 
was handed down after two hearings during which the two defendants, who were sentenced 
to long prison terms, testified that their confessions were extracted under duress. The judge 
allegedly failed to declare these confessions inadmissible. On 13 January 2011, at an appeal 
hearing in Jalal-Abad Province Court, the panel of judges ordered the re-investigation of 
the case. However, no investigation into the allegations of torture has been initiated. 
</p>
<p>1441. On 27 December 2010, five ethnic Uzbeks and one ethnic Kazak - were sentenced to 
life imprisonment and to confiscation of private property for the murder of the Kara- Suu 
Police Chief and his driver. Three co-defendants - all ethnic Uzbeks - were sentenced to 
prison terms ranging from five to 20 years on other charges. The verdict was pronounced 
after an appeal trial that lasted two sessions and left the sentence of the court of first 
instance unchanged. 
</p>
<p>1442. The Special Rapporteurs have been informed that lawyers and defendants stated in 
court that the defendants&#8217; confessions were extracted under torture and that the allegations 
of torture were also contained in appellate motions. In this regard, the Court of Appeal (Osh 
Provincial Court) reportedly stated that claims of ill-treatment of the accused &#8220;ha[d] no 
grounds&#8221; and that the judges relied mainly on evidence contained in confessions of the 
defendants. At least one lawyer submitted complaints of ill-treatment of two defendants 
with the prosecutor&#8217;s office at the end of October 2010. It is reported that they have not 
been addressed. There are also allegations that law enforcement officers beat several 
defendants during a break in the court hearing on 29 September 2010. Furthermore, two </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>207 
</b></p>
<p>lawyers have allegedly been punched by relatives of the victims outside the courtroom on 
30 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>1443. On 2 February 2011, the Osh Province Court affirmed the verdict of Osh City Court 
sentencing an ethnic Uzbek defendant to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of the 
murder of two police officers and participation in mass disorders in June 2010. Three co-
defendants, all ethnic Uzbek, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to 14 years 
for participation in mass disorders and deliberate destruction of property. 
</p>
<p>1444. The Special Rapporteurs have been informed that the defendants stated in court that 
they were tortured or ill-treated and forced to confess or implicate other suspects. Judges in 
both the first and second instance courts reportedly failed to order an investigation into 
these allegations, or to exclude confessions allegedly extracted under torture. The Court of 
Appeal allegedly failed to act in an impartial manner. In a court hearing on 2 December 
2010, the presiding judge rejected a defendant&#8217;s withdrawal of his previous confession. 
Photos reportedly showing injuries resulting from the ill-treatment of one defendant were 
rejected, apparently because they did not show the defendant&#8217;s face. 
</p>
<p>1445. There are also reports of acts of intimidation and physical attacks against defendants, 
their relatives and lawyers. On 13 October 2010, outside the court building, victim&#8217;s 
relatives punched and kicked one defendant, three defendants&#8217; relatives and a lawyer. The 
defendant and three relatives sought medical help for concussions and severe injuries. A car 
belonging to the defendants&#8217; relatives was vandalised. At a hearing on 29 November 2010, 
victims&#8217; relatives interrupted the trial shouting obscenities and threats at the defendants, 
their relatives and lawyers. While the judge called for respect for order in the courtroom, he 
did not warn or discipline any of the members of the audience. At another hearing on 14 
December 2010, despite a heightened security presence, relatives and supporters of the 
victims allegedly threw stones at the defendants inside the court after members of the 
security forces stopped them in their attempts to attack the defendants. A number of police 
officers were reportedly hit, while judges, lawyers and prosecutors had left the courtroom 
prior to the attack. 
</p>
<p>1446. On 16 December 2010, Osh Province Court confirmed the decision of Osh City 
Court, acquitting Mr. Farruh Gapirov of charges of illegal possession of weapons and 
participation in mass riots. On 26 October 2010, the decision rendered by Osh City Court 
stated that Mr. Gapirov was beaten and forced to confess to the crime of which he was 
accused. The judges therefore excluded the confession. The judges reportedly also issued a 
special ruling requesting the prosecutor to consider the allegations of torture. However, as 
of March 2011, no investigation has been initiated. 
</p>
<p><i>  Part III 
</i></p>
<p>1447. On 10 November 2010, the Court of Appeal had found Mr. Askarov and four co-
defendants guilty of murder of a police officer, inciting inter-ethnic hatred and organizing 
mass disorders and sentenced them to life imprisonment and confiscation of property. Three 
other co-defendants were sentenced to between nine and 20 years&#8217; imprisonment. 
According to recent information received in respect of these cases: 
</p>
<p>1448. On 26 January 2011, the Supreme Court commenced the review of the case of Mr. 
Askarov and seven co-defendants in Bishkek. On 8 February 2011, the Court accepted a 
motion by Mr. Askarov&#8217;s defense lawyer requesting a separate decision, along with the 
verdict, to address the legality of keeping defendants in the temporary police detention 
facility (IVS) for an extended period of time, as Jalal-Abad has no pre-trial detention 
facility (Sizo). The judges ordered an investigation into the conditions of detention in Jalal-
Abad and postponed the trial for an indefinite period. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>208</b>  
</p>
<p>1449. A lack of private meetings between Mr. Askarov and his lawyer has been reported, 
undermining the capacity to prepare Mr. Askarov&#8217;s defence. Lawyers complained about the 
lack of confidentiality, to which the Judge reportedly responded that he was not in the 
position to ensure confidential access to legal representatives. 
</p>
<p>1450. The authorities repeatedly failed to provide adequate medical care to the defendants. 
In November 2010, there was grave concern about the health of Mr. Askarov as well as the 
other defendants. Mr. Askarov was reportedly in need of urgent medical attention and 
treatment for injuries likely to have resulted from the alleged torture. On 12 November 
2010, Mr. Askarov was reportedly transferred to a detention facility in Bishkek (Colony 
No. 47), where he received medical treatment and has been detained to date. 
</p>
<p>1451. Furthermore, relatives of the victims repeatedly physically assaulted and verbally 
harassed defendants and their lawyers, which included ethnic insults, inside and outside 
courts. On 4 November 2010, four hand-written posters hung in the courtroom, one of them 
calling for &#8220;the sadist murderers to be sentenced to death.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1452. Concern was expressed that the conviction of Mr. Askarov may be related to his 
peaceful activities as a human rights defender, in particular to monitoring and recording the 
violence and arson attacks related to the recent ethnic violence in Jalal-Abad Province. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1453. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses transmitted to four 
of the five communications sent during the reporting period dated. However, he regrets that 
at the time of finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to 
his communication of 16 March 2011, and to earlier communications sent on 22 December 
2009 and 16 April 2009. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by 
him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent 
prosecutions as well as protective measures taken.

Nous accusons r&#233;ception de la r&#233;ponse du Gouvernement de votre Excellence re&#231;ue le 23 
septembre 2008. 
</p>
<p>1461. Selon les nouvelles informations re&#231;ues, le 5 octobre 2010, M. Abdallah aurait re&#231;u 
un appel t&#233;l&#233;phonique du Colonel Asmar, Chef de l&#8217;unit&#233; d&#8217;enqu&#234;te au sein du service de

</p>
<p>1462. Dans la matin&#233;e du 9 octobre 2010, M. Abdallah se serait rendu au bureau du 
Colonel Asmar o&#249; il aurait &#233;t&#233; interrog&#233; pendant trois heures. L&#8217;interrogatoire, qui n&#8217;aurait 
pas &#233;t&#233; enregistr&#233;, aurait port&#233;, entre autres, sur l&#8217;appartenance depuis 2002 de la PHRO au

<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1467. On 23 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a 
means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, the Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent 
appeal to the Government concerning the <b>deaths of at least 233 people and the excessive 
use of force against protesters by security forces in the context of the ongoing peaceful 
demonstrations</b>, which have taken place across the country since 15 February 2011, 
calling for democratic reforms and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>1468. According to the information received, after 14 protestors had been shot dead by 
security forces, thousands of people gathered for funeral prayers, resulting in the eruption 
of violence on 19 February 2011, in the city of Benghazi. Reports indicate that security 
officers fired indiscriminately on protesters, causing several deaths and leaving many 
injured, most of whom showed gunshot wounds in the head, neck and shoulders. 
</p>
<p>1469. In the context of the ongoing protests, security forces are using live ammunition, 
including machine gun fire against demonstrators in the cities of al-Bayda and Benghazi. 
According to unconfirmed reports, military aircraft would have been used against protestors 
in Tripoli and other cities. There have also been reports that the authorities have allegedly 
enlisted the assistance of &#8216;mercenaries&#8217; brought in from other countries to deal with 
demonstrators in Benghazi and other cities. Due to the excessive use of force, the death toll 
since 17 February 2011, is at least 233 people.  
</p>
<p>1470. The Special Rapporteurs have received information on the death of the following 
people: Naji Jumaa Jordane Al Kawafi, aged 18; Motaz Abdel Ati Al Darouqi, aged 19; 
Hamad Al Allam, aged 27; Faouzi Hussein Al Sabiri, aged 36; Marwan Al Shattat, aged 20; 
Mohamed Salem Boujnah, aged 21; Idris Ali Raslan Al Maghribi, aged 13; Rami Saleh Al 
Maghribi, aged 18; Moayed Fathi Boujlaoui, aged 26; Mohamed Abdeladim Al Saiti; 
Aboubakr Fathi Al Tachani; Ahmed Kamal Al Chahini; and Salem Abou Madi.  
</p>
<p>1471. In addition, the following cases of arrests of human rights defenders and activists, 
including their family members, have been brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteurs.  
</p>
<p>1472. Four brothers, Mr. Al Mahdi Saleh Hmeed, a lawyer and human rights defender; Mr. 
Sadek Saleh Hmeed, a taxi driver; Mr. Ali Saleh Hmeed, a taxi driver; and Mr. Fredj Saleh 
Hmeed, an employee, were arrested in their home in Alhadbah Al Khadraa, Tripoli, on 
Tuesday 16 February 2011, at 16:00 while being interviewed by Mr. Mohamed Srit, a 
journalist. Mr. Srit was also arrested and released later that evening. The four brothers are, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>211 
</b></p>
<p>reportedly, being held in an undisclosed location by the Libyan security forces and have not 
been charged. Their fate and whereabouts are unknown.  
</p>
<p>1473. The Special Rapporteurs have also received information concerning the arrest of Mr. 
Fathi Tarbal, a lawyer and human rights defender who actively worked on reporting cases 
of human rights violations to international organizations. Mr. Fathi Tarbal was arrested 
from his home on 15 February 2011, by members of the Libyan Interior Security (Amn al 
Dakhli) who reportedly entered his home, searched the entire house without presenting a 
warrant and confiscated his laptop and cell phones before taking him away. Mr. Tarbal had 
been closely following and reporting on the peaceful protests that are taking place in the 
country, including arrests and alleged use of force against demonstrators by the part of the 
security forces. Mr. Tarbal was released shortly after his arrest. 
</p>
<p>1474. Furthermore, unconfirmed reports indicate that a total of 17 activists, lawyers and 
former political prisoners have been arrested since the demonstrations began, including Mr. 
Abdelhafuz Ghogha, a prominent human rights lawyer who represented the families of 
those killed in the Abu Salim prison in 1996. 
</p>
<p>1475. Moreover, reports indicate that the authorities have cut all landline and wireless 
means of communication in the country. Websites have also reportedly been blocked, 
including the Al-Jazeera news website, as well as social networking sites such as <i>Twitter 
</i>and <i>Facebook</i>. Additionally, Al-Jazeera&#8217;s broadcast has reportedly been jammed on 
Arabsat satellite network. 
</p>
<p>1476. Concerns were expressed about the physical and mental integrity of the Hmeed 
brothers, Mr. Abdelhafuz Ghogha, and 17 activists, lawyers and former political prisoners 
who have been arrested since the demonstrations began. In addition, given the restrictions 
on the means of communications, further concern was expressed that many of the violations 
that are taking place in connection with the demonstrations cannot or are not being 
reported.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1477. On 14 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning 
the situation of Mr. <b>Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</b>, Iraqi national, working as a reporter for The 
Guardian newspaper since 2004, and Mr. <b>Andrei Netto</b>, a Brazilian journalist for the 
Brazilian newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. 
</p>
<p>1478. According to the information received, on 10 March 2011, Mr. Ghaith Abdul-Ahad 
and Mr. Andrei Netto were reportedly abducted by Government forces while travelling in 
the area called Zawiyah in western Libya where they have allegedly been reporting on 
clashes between rebels and local security forces that have reportedly been taking place 
since the peaceful demonstrations started on 15 February 2011.   
</p>
<p>1479. It is reported that Mr. Abdul-Ahad was last in touch with the daily he works for on 6 
March 2011, but no news from him has been received since then. Following several media 
inquiries, the Libyan authorities have reportedly admitted holding the two journalists, but 
have refused to inform of their whereabouts.   
</p>
<p>1480. It is also reported that on 7 March 2011, three BBC journalists, Mr. <b>Goktay 
Koraltan</b>, a Turkish national; Mr.<b> Feras Killani</b>, a Palestinian Syrian; and Mr. <b>Chris 
Cobb-Smith</b>, a British national, were abducted by security forces at a checkpoint near Az 
Zawiyah, taken to a military barracks in Tripoli, beaten and subjected to a mock execution </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>212</b>  
</p>
<p>by members of Libya&#8217;s army and secret police before being released 21 hours later. They 
fled the country immediately afterwards. In this connection, on 10 March 2011, the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a press release, condemning the 
detention and possible torture of BBC news team of three as it sought to cover the situation 
in the western Libyan city of Zawiyah. 
</p>
<p>1481. In this context, the attention of the Government was drawn to the joint urgent appeal 
sent on 23 February 2011 by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on the use of mercenaries; Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders; and Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, concerning the deaths of at least 233 people and the excessive use 
of force against protesters by security forces in the context of the ongoing peaceful 
demonstrations which have taken place across the country since 15 February 2011. It was 
noted that to date, no response has been received with respect to the circumstances 
regarding the cases of the persons named therein. 
</p>
<p>1482. In view of the allegation according to which the fate and whereabouts of Mr. Ghaith 
Abdul-Ahad and Mr. Andrei Netto remain unknown, concern was expressed about their 
physical and mental integrity. Further concern was expressed regarding allegations received 
indicating that their disappearance is connected to their work as journalists covering the 
situation in Zawiyah and reporting about human rights violations.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1483. On 18 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding a number of <b>recent cases of enforced disappearances</b> that have 
allegedly occurred in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. 
</p>
<p>1484. According to information received, Mr. <b>Safa Aldin Hilal Mohamed Al Shareef</b>, 25 
years old, Libyan citizen, engineer in the oil company of Ras Lanouf, resident in Al Baid, 
was allegedly arrested by Internal Security Forces agents at his workplace in Ras Lanouf, 
on 15 February 2011. It is alleged that this disappearance may be linked to the fact that he 
was allegedly running a group on an online social network calling for democratic 
demonstrations;  
</p>
<p>1485. Mr. <b>Adel Abdallah Almadaa Salah</b>, 35 years old, Libyan citizen, resident in Al 
Baida, was allegedly arrested by Internal Security Forces agents in a hotel in Tripoli on 18 
February 2011, as he was allegedly calling for democratic demonstrations in the capital; 
</p>
<p>1486. Mr. <b>Abdalsalem Alqanashi</b>, 35 years old, Libyan citizen, media activist, resident in 
Al Baida, was allegedly arrested by internal security forces agents at the Libyan-Egyptian 
border on 19 February 2011, as he was photographing and filming the demonstrations and 
the reaction of the security forces agents;  
</p>
<p>1487. Mr. <b>Ali Mubarak Omran</b>, 55 years old, Libyan citizen, officer in the Armed 
Forces, resident in Al Abrak, was allegedly arrested by a group of persons supporting the 
central military troops at Al Abrak airport on 19 February 2011, because he allegedly 
refused to fire on the demonstrators; 
</p>
<p>1488. Mr. <b>Alsadek Almabrouk Hamada Bridan</b>, 48 years old, Libyan citizen, teacher, 
resident in Bab al Shaha Al Gharbia, near Ali Ibn Ali Abu Talib &#8211; Derna, allegedly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>213 
</b></p>
<p>disappeared from Abu Slim prison when internal security forces were evacuating the 
prisoners on 16 February 2011. 
</p>
<p>1489. In addition, sources have reported that the persons mentioned below were abducted 
by a group of people allegedly supporting the central military troops stationed at Al Abrak 
airport during confrontations against the pro-democracy demonstrators in Al Abrak. These 
persons are: Mr. <b>Abdalkarim Mohamed Abdalkarim</b>, 25 years old; Mr. <b>Salah

<b>Masaoud Mohamed Idriss</b>, all Libyan citizens. According to the information received, 
they were all brought to Al Abrak airport where they were last seen on 19 February 2011, 
before military officers allegedly took them to an unknown location. 
</p>
<p>1490. Sources have also reported that hundreds of recruits of the Air Force Academy 
allegedly disappeared, some of whom were allegedly shot dead while trying to escape. 
Sources additionally report about an alarming figure of hundreds of persons that are 
allegedly detained in unknown places.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeal

<p>1491. On 31 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding <b>continuing attacks against 
journalists in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya</b>.  
</p>
<p>1492. While the Special Rapporteurs welcomed the release on 21 March 2011 of four <i>New 
York Times </i>journalists (Mr. Anthony Shadid, Mr. Stephen Farrell, Ms. Lynsey Addario and 
Mr. Tyler Hicks), who were captured in eastern Libya by forces allegedly loyal to Colonel 
Muammar el-Qaddafi, concern was expressed about the safety of journalists in the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya. In particular, concern was expressed with regard to reports of <b>two 
journalists who have been killed, as well as 14 journalists who have either disappeared 
or have been reported to be in the custody of the Government, but whose whereabouts 
remain unknown</b>.  
</p>
<p>1493. It was noted that since the beginning of demonstrations on 15 February 2011, three 
communications have been sent to the Government dated 18 March 2011, 14 March 2011 
and 23 February 2011 by the Special Procedures&#8217; mandate-holders, including concerns 
regarding attacks against, detention and disappearance of journalists and human rights 
defenders. Regret was expressed that no response has yet been received to these 
communications.  
</p>
<p>1494. According to new information received, 14 journalists have either disappeared or 
have been reported to be in the custody of the Government, but whose fate and whereabouts 
remain unknown, namely:  
</p>
<p>1. Mr. Ahmand Val Wald-Eddin (or Vall Ould Addin or Vall Ould el-Dine), Al-
Jazeera correspondent, national of Mauritania;  
</p>
<p>2. Mr. Lufti Al-Massoudi (or Lotfi al-Messaoudi), Al-Jazeera correspondent, 
national of Tunisia;  
</p>
<p>3. Mr. Ammar Al-Hamdan, Al-Jazeera cameraman and photographer, national 
of  Norway; and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>214</b>  
</p>
<p>4. Mr. Kamil Al-Tallou (or Kamel Atalua), Al-Jazeera cameraman, national of 
the United Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>1495. According to the information received, Al-Jazeera personnel have had no contact 
with them for almost two weeks after the journalists entered Libya near Zantan, at the 
Libyan-Tunisian border. Sources report that these persons were arrested by Libyan 
authorities in the western part of the country. The journalists were reportedly covering the 
fighting between the Government and rebel forces in Zawiya.  
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Dave Clark, aged 38, reporter with Agence France-Presse; 
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Joe Raedle, photographer at Getty Images; and 
</p>
<p>7. Mr. Roberto Schmidt, aged 45, reporter with Agence France-Presse. 
</p>
<p>Their last whereabouts were allegedly received via e-mail on the night of 18 March 2011, 
while they were about to leave Tobruk city to meet with rebel forces. Their fate and 
whereabouts remain unknown since then. Concerns are raised about the vulnerability of 
journalists while working in the zone of conflict and the risk of being deprived of their 
liberty or subjected to enforced disappearance.  
</p>
<p>8. Mr. Atef al-Atrash, contributor to local news outlets;  
</p>
<p>9. Mr. Mohamed al-Sahim, blogger and critical political writer;  
</p>
<p>10. Mr. Mohamed al-Amin, cartoonist;  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Idris al-Mismar, writer and former editor-in-chief of Arajin, a monthly 
culture magazine;  
</p>
<p>12. Ms. Salma al-Shaab, head of the Libyan Journalists Syndicate; and 
</p>
<p>13. Mr. Suad al-Turabouls, correspondent for the pro-government Al-Jamahiriya.  
</p>
<p>It has been reported that they were deprived of their liberty by forces loyal to the 
Government. Their fate and whereabouts remain unknown. 
</p>
<p>14. Mr. St&#233;phane Lehr, photographer at Polaris Images, national of France, 
allegedly disappeared on 20 March 2011. According to the information received, his 
last communication was received shortly after he left Benghazi to Ajdabiya, at 1:00 
p.m. local time. 
</p>
<p>In addition, information has been received concerning the killing of two journalists: 
</p>
<p>1. Mr. Ali Hassan Al-Jaber, cameraman of Al-Jazeera, who was killed in an 
ambush on 12 March 2011 as he was returning from Benghazi; and 
</p>
<p>2. Mr. Mohamed Al-Nabbous (also known as &#8220;Mo&#8221;), Libyan blogger and 
journalist with the TV station Libya Al-Hurra. According to the information 
received, he was shot dead on 19 March 2011, as he was providing live commentary 
regarding recent developments in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.  
</p>
<p>1496. Concern was expressed regarding the continuing targeting of journalists, including 
killings, arbitrary detention, and detention without disclosure of their fate or whereabouts, 
which would amount to enforced disappearance. Further concern was expressed regarding 
the vulnerable conditions of work of journalists to report in situations of armed conflict, and 
the potential risk of being subjected to detention, arrest or other forms of deprivation of 
liberty in an unknown location. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>1497. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his five communications of 31 March 2011, 
18 March 2011, 14 March 2011, 23 February 2011, and an earlier communication sent on 
22 January 2009. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to 
provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions 
as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1498. On 18 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur expressed his concerns regarding the 
use of excessive and lethal force against peaceful protesters in Libya through a public 
statement, issued jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.68 In the statement, the 
Special Rapporteur also called upon the authorities to ensure that journalists can work 
safely and freely to inform the public locally and globally of what is happening, and that all 
means of communication, including the Internet, remain open and accessible.  
</p>
<p>1499. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned by reports of continued repression of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in Libya, including arrests and prosecution of 
individuals who are critical of the Government on the basis lf laws that criminalize peaceful 
dissent, such as the Penal Code and Law 71 of 1972, which prescribe severe punishments, 
including the death penalty. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to release all 
prisoners who have been detained for peacefully exercising their legitimate right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, and to immediately end violence and all attacks against civilians 
and to address the legitimate demands of the population, including through national 
dialogue, as called for in Security Council resolution 1973 (2011).

<p><b>  Malawi 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>1506. On 30 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegations to the 
Government concerning the <b>recent proposed legislation in the Parliament of Malawi, 
</b>which, if signed by the President, would pose a threat to freedom of the press.   
</p>
<p>1507. According to information received, on 19 November 2010, the Parliament of Malawi 
passed an amendment to section 46 of the Penal Code on the &#8220;power to regulate 
publications&#8221;, which would allow the banning of newspapers from circulation at the 
Minister&#8217;s discretion: &#8220;If the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that the publication 
or importation of any publication would be contrary to the public interest, he may, by order 
published in the Gazette, prohibit the publication or importation of such publication.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>1508. In comparison to the previous text of the Penal Code, which gave the Ministry 
powers to regulate importation based on public interest, the proposed amendment appears 
retrogressive.  
</p>
<p>1509. The proposed amendment contravenes Section 36 of the Constitution of Malawi on 
&#8220;freedom of the press&#8221; which stipulates that, &#8220;[t]he press shall have the right to report and 
publish freely, within Malawi and abroad, and to be accorded the fullest possible facilities 
for access to public information.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal   
</b></p>
<p>1510. On 28 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding 
the situation of Mr. <b>Undule Mwakasungula, as well as the general situation of human 
rights defenders in Malawi</b>. Mr. Mwakasungula is the Executive Director of the Centre 
for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR), a Malawian NGO which was established in 
1995 with the objective of promoting good governance within the framework of 
international human rights instruments and Malawi&#8217;s national constitution.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>217 
</b></p>
<p>1511. According to the information received, on 20 March 2011, Mr. Mwakasungula 
received death threats via telephone from unknown individuals. It is alleged that first caller 
accused Mr. Mwakasungula of trying to tarnish the Government&#8217;s image and undermine the 
work and role of President Bingu wa Mutharika. The caller reportedly told Mr. 
Mwakasungula that he would be dealt with using whatever means necessary. During the 
second phone call, it is alleged that the caller threatened to kill Mr. Mwakasungula and 
urged him to exercise caution. The caller made reference to the manner in which Mr. 
Mwakasungula carried out his human rights work claiming that the underlying objective of 
his work was to influence the outcome of Presidential elections set to take place in 2014. 
</p>
<p>1512. It is reported that on 9 March 2011, armed police officers visited Mr. 
Mwakasungula&#8217;s home in Karonga. It is alleged that the police officers claimed this was a 
routine check.  
</p>
<p>1513. According to the information received, on 3 March 2011, at approximately 2:30 
a.m., a group of unidentified individuals broke into the CHRR offices in Lilongwe. They 
were allegedly in possession of machetes, knives and petrol. It is reported that nothing was 
stolen during the break-in; however the unidentified individuals demanded that the security 
guard on duty provide them with Mr. Mwakasungula&#8217;s home address. It is reported that the 
security guard told the group of individuals that he did not know Mr. Mwakasungula&#8217;s 
home address. The security guard was allegedly severely beaten by the group of individuals 
and abandoned near Area 18 Roundabout. The incident was later reported to police at Area 
Lingadzi police station.  
</p>
<p>1514. With regard to the general situation of human rights defenders in Malawi, it is 
reported that the death threats against Mr. Mwakasungula, as well as the break-in at the 
CHRR offices form part of an ongoing campaign against human rights defenders in 
Malawi. It appears that the campaign against civil society has intensified in recent weeks, 
as the Government reportedly began a public campaign of intimidation against human 
rights defenders in a bid to prevent public demonstrations demanding reforms. It is alleged 
that Government officials have publicly stated that they are prepared to utilise any means 
necessary in order to quell the climate of discontent.  
</p>
<p>1515. On 14 February 2011, police in Lilongwe City banned a peaceful march organised 
by civil society.         
</p>
<p>1516. On 23 February 2011, civil society groups issued a public statement condemning the 
recent wave of intimidation against them. It is reported that following the issuance of such a 
statement, the Human Rights Consultative Committee, a coalition of 90 organisations, 
received a letter signed by the National Youth Forum threatening to close down the 
coalition.  
</p>
<p>1517. On 6 March 2011, President Bingu wa Mutharika held a rally in Blantyre in order to 
demonstrate in relation to the high level of support which exists for the ruling Democratic 
Progressive Party. President Bingu wa Mutharika allegedly called on those present to 
support the Government and to fight those who opposed the views of the Government. It is 
alleged that President Bingu wa Mutharika announced that anyone wishing to organise a 
public protest would be required to seek permission, which would be subject to payment of 
a deposit of 2 million Kwacha, (13,000 USD).  
</p>
<p>1518. On 7 March 2011, top Government officials again reiterated the sentiment of the 
President, that those opposing the President would be silenced by any means necessary.  
</p>
<p>1519. It is further reported that the President recently made comments regarding a group of 
human rights defenders who presented a statement at the 16th session of the UN Human 
Rights Council in Geneva. It is alleged that the President stated that &#8220;there is a group of 15 
people roaming in Europe saying that there is a violation of human rights because we don&#8217;t </p>

</p>
<p>allow university professors to teach revolution&#8230; We are waiting for them to come back 
and to tell us what their agenda is&#8221;. A local newspaper reportedly published an article 
alluding to the possibility that UN aid to Malawi may be cut if human rights defenders 
continue &#8220;irresponsible reporting&#8221; to the Human Rights Council. Some Malawian 
newspapers, which are allegedly controlled by the State, reportedly criticised human rights 
defenders for what they perceived as a presentation on behalf of the human rights defenders 
with the objective of reporting the President to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders.    
</p>
<p>1520. Serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Mwakasungula considering the death threats issues against him in recent days. Concern was 
also expressed that the situation of Mr. Mwakasungula, as well as the break-in of CHRR 
offices, may be linked to the legitimate work of the organization in the defence of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1521. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a reply to his communications sent during the reporting 
period dated 20 December 2010 and 29 March 2011, and to a communication sent earlier 
on and 9 March 2010. The Special Rapporteur considers response to his communications an 
important part of the cooperation between governments and his mandate and requests that 
the Government of Malawi provide details about the issues raised in the aforementioned 
communications. 
</p>
<p>1522. The Special Rapporteur would also like to express his concern regarding reports of 
an increasing climate of intolerance of critical views and expression, particularly those that 
are critical of the Government. The Special Rapporteur thus urges the Government of 
Malawi to guarantee the right of all individuals to freedom of opinion and expression and to 
promote an environment of tolerance of divergent views and opinions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Maldives 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>1523. On 20 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief, sent a letter of allegations to the Government regarding 
provisions in the draft &#8220;<b>Regulations on protecting religious unity of Maldivian 
Citizens</b>&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1524. According to the information received, in May 2010, the Ministry of Islamic Affairs 
drafted new &#8220;Regulations on protecting religious unity of Maldivian Citizens&#8221; and 
submitted the draft Regulations to the Office of the President for gazetting. Concern is 
expressed that a number of provisions in the draft Regulations, if enacted in this form, may 
seriously hamper several human rights, including freedom of religion or belief and freedom 
of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>1525. Article 2 of the draft Regulations enumerates their aims, including &#8220;to maintain the 
religious harmony existing among Maldivians; solve conflicts that arise from disagreement 
among Islamic scholars on religious issues; ensure that information regarding such issues 
are spread so as not to sow discord in society; [&#8230;] maintain religious unity of Maldivian 
citizens [&#8230;]&#8221;. Article 12 of the draft Regulations envisages the &#8220;revoking or temporary 
suspension of licenses&#8221; for violating the regulations and enables stopping &#8220;any persons 
whose actions are deemed to be threatening religious unity&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>219 
</b></p>
<p>1526. Among the criteria for giving preaching licenses according to article 16 (b) of the 
draft Regulations, is the requirement that &#8220;the person must belong to any sect of the Sunni 
Muslims&#8221; and must have reached 25 years of age. In addition, article 19 of the draft 
Regulations stipulates that &#8220;foreign preachers who are given permission under these 
regulations should shape their sermons in reference to the Maldives culture and traditions&#8221;. 
Article 21 of the draft Regulations would impose &#8220;an obligation on the Government and all 
the people of Maldives to protect the religious unity of Maldivian citizens as Maldives is a 
100 percent Muslim nation and because Islam maintains harmony of Maldivian citizens and 
because Islam is the basis of the unity of Maldivian citizens&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1527. Article 24 of the draft Regulations would give the authority to deport anyone who 
propagates any religion other than (Sunni) Islam. Article 27 of the draft Regulations would 
prohibit, for example, &#8220;promoting one&#8217;s own individual opinion on issues that are in 
disagreement among Islamic scholars&#8221;, &#8220;inciting people to disputes&#8221; and &#8220;talking about 
religions other than Islam in Maldives&#8221;. Similarly, it would be prohibited to build places of 
worship of other religions (article 30), to commit any action that may offend Islamic 
thought (article 32), for Non-Muslims to express their religious beliefs or carry out their 
religious activities (article 33) and to propagate any religion other than Islam (article 34). 
</p>
<p>1528. Article 35 of the draft Regulations would make it &#8220;illegal to show or spread sound 
bites of programs on religions other than Islam, and any such literature, drawings, 
advertisements, music, and songs&#8221;, &#8220;to use any Internet website, blog, newspaper, or 
magazine to publish such material&#8221; and &#8220;to depict advertisements and make announcements 
in a way that affects Islamic way of life&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1529. The Special Rapporteurs appealed to the Government to ensure the right to freedom 
of religion or belief in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief 
and article 18 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Covenant, inter alia, guarantees 
&#8220;freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to 
manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching&#8221;. In addition, 
according to article 27 of the Covenant, persons belonging to religious minorities shall not 
be denied &#8220;the right, in community with the other members of their group, [&#8230;] to profess 
and practise their own religion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1530. The Special Rapporteurs also referred to the conclusions and recommendations in 
the 2006 mission report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, 
indicating that she was &#8220;disturbed by provisions of the Law on Religious Unity, which 
criminalize any action or form of expression intended to disrupt, jeopardize or disunite 
social and religious order and harmony, and considers that the law has the potential to limit 
the manner in which people choose to manifest their religion or belief. She considers that 
the law may fail to satisfy the requirement that any limitations on the right to manifest 
one&#8217;s religion or belief must be prescribed by law and must be necessary to protect public 
safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others&#8221; 
(A/HRC/4/21/Add.3, para. 63). In addition, she emphasized that restricting citizenship to 
people with certain religious beliefs is contrary to the principle of non-discrimination 
(A/63/161, paras. 39 and 70) and she encouraged the Maldivian legislators to consider 
introducing amendments to the citizenship law to bring it into compliance with treaty 
obligations, particularly with regard to non-discrimination provisions (A/HRC/4/21/Add.3, 
para. 67). 
</p>
<p>1531. Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to article 
19 of the ICCPR, which provides that &quot;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>220</b>  
</p>
<p>ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice.&quot;  
</p>
<p>1532. The Special Rapporteurs also noted that in his 2009 mission report to the Maldives, 
the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression also noted human 
rights concerns: &#8220;He further observed that people are prevented both by legislative 
provisions and through social pressure from expressing their views about issues relevant to 
religion or belief and as a result exercise self-censorship. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed of a recent case in which a journalist had been threatened due to comments made 
about religious beliefs in the country&#8221; (A/HRC/11/4/Add.3, para. 46). 
</p>
<p>1533. The Special Rapporteurs therefore urged the Government to reconsider the draft 
Regulations, specifically taking into account the international human rights standards on 
freedom of religion or belief and freedom of opinion and expression. To this end, the 
Special Rapporteurs called upon the Government to allow for further debate and revision of 
the draft Regulations due to concerns that their implementation could have a significant 
negative impact on human rights in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>1534. In a letter dated 1 September 2010, the Government responded to a communication 
sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders dated 4 
October 2005 regarding <b><i>Minivian</i></b> , the only independent newspaper and the biggest selling 
newspaper in the Maldives, as follows. 
</p>
<p>1535. The Government would like to inform that since the inception of a democratic 
system of government in the Maldives on 11 November 2008, following the first ever 
multi-party elections in the country, the Maldives has made tremendous progress towards 
guaranteeing human rights for all in its territory. As such, the persons referred to in the 
abovementioned letter have long been released. Furthermore, Ms Aminath Najeeb currently 
sits on the board of Maldives National Broadcasting Corporation (MNBC) and is a 
prominent journalist in the country, while Mr. Paul Roberts and Mr. Shauaib Ali both hold 
responsible posts at the President&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>1536. In addition, the Government would like to note that local as well as foreign 
journalists are free from any form of threat and/or harassment from the Government of 
Maldives and are free to express their thoughts and opinions, within the purview of the 
Constitution of the Maldives. The new Constitution ratified in August 2008 explicitly 
provides for freedom of the press and the Government does not prevent the media from 
disseminating and publishing news freely and independently. At present, press freedom is 
at an all time high, with frequent television and radio programmes and articles criticizing 
government policy and top government officials. Notably, the 2009 World Press Freedom 
Ranking, compiled by Reporters with Borders, declared the Maldives in 51st place; a 
prominent advancement for a country in the list with a previous position of 104th place. 
This, as Your Excellencies would agree, is a remarkable achievement for the new 
democratic Government of the Maldives. 
</p>
<p>1537. From a legislative point of view, laws relating to media freedom and the rights to 
information are at various stages of the law-making process. In November 2008, the 
Maldives Media Council Bill was ratified by the President. The Act established the Council 
as an independent, self regulatory body with responsibility for, <i>inter-alia</i>, establishing and 
preserving the freedom of media in the country, and conducting inquiries into complaints 
filed with the Council concerning the abuse of media freedom. 
</p>
<p>1538. A year later, in November 2009, the Majils adopted a Bill abolishing several articles 
of the current Penal Code under which defamation was prescribed a criminal offence. Most 
recently, The Maldives Broadcasting Corporation Act was enacted in April 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>221 
</b></p>
<p>1539. In light of these achievements, the Government wishes to assure you that the 
Government of Maldives is undertaking all necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and wish to convey that we are sincerely committed to maintaining 
our international human rights obligations, as well as fully guaranteeing all the rights and 
freedoms prescribed in the Constitution of the Maldives.

<p><b>  Observations

<p>1540. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 25 May 2010. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken.

de conseiller aupr&#232;s de la Commission nationale mauritanienne des droits de l'Homme, 
aurait fait une demande de renouvellement de passeport aupr&#232;s de la Direction de la s&#251;ret&#233;

</p>
<p>1543. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que ce refus ferait suite &#224; la participation de M. Biram Ould Dah Ould 
Abeid &#224; une conf&#233;rence intitul&#233;e &#171; L'esclavage en terre d'Islam : pourquoi les ma&#238;tres

Gulnara Shahinian, Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale des Nations unies sur les formes contemporaines 
d'esclavage, lors de sa visite officielle dans le pays en octobre et novembre 2009.  
</p>
<p>1544. En outre, au cours du mois de novembre, le portail d&#8217;information elbidaya.net aurait 
publi&#233; un article anonyme contenant des propos diffamatoires &#224; l&#8217;encontre de M. Biram 
Ould Dah Ould Abeid, article qui aurait &#233;t&#233; repris par plusieurs sites Internet mauritaniens.

</p>
<p>1545. Des craintes ont &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant au fait que le refus de renouveler le passeport

<p><b>  R&#233;ponse du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>1546. Dans une lettre dat&#233;e du 4 mai 2010, le Gouvernement a inform&#233; que M. Biram Ould 
Abeid a b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'une invitation personnelle au Festival du Film et Forum International 
sur les droits Humains pr&#233;vu du 5 au 14 mars 2010 &#224; Gen&#232;ve. A cette occasion, le Pr&#233;sident 
de la Commission Nationale des Droits de l&#8217;Homme a, par lettre no. 675 du 2 f&#233;vrier 2010, 
adress&#233; une demande de prorogation du passeport de service no. M00197773 &#233;tabli au nom 
de Biram Ould Dah Ould Abeid. Cette demande a &#233;t&#233; transmise au Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur 
et de la D&#233;centralisation par la Directrice Adjointe du Cabinet du Premier Ministre par 
lettre no. 012 du 3 f&#233;vrier 2010. 
</p>
<p>1547. Les passeports de service sont r&#233;glement&#233;s, en Mauritanie, par le d&#233;cret 62.160 en 
date du 12 juillet 1962 r&#232;glementant les titres de voyage qui dispose en son article 27 &#171; les 
passeports de service sont accord&#233;s par le Minist&#232;re de l&#8217;Int&#233;rieur &#224; la demande du 
Minist&#232;re des Affaires Etrang&#232;res. En Mauritanie, ils sont d&#233;livr&#233;s, renouvel&#233;s ou prorog&#233;s 
par le Minist&#232;re de L&#8217;Int&#233;rieur &#224; la demande du Minist&#232;re des Affaires Etrang&#232;res. &#187; 
L&#8217;article 30 du m&#234;me d&#233;cret pr&#233;cise : &#171; en Mauritanie, la d&#233;livrance, le renouvellement ou 
la prorogation d&#8217;un passeport de service est subordonn&#233;e &#224; la remise&#8230; d'une ampliation de 
l'ordre de mission de l'int&#233;ress&#233;. &#187; 
</p>
<p>1548. L&#8217;on rappelle que les ordres de mission pour les fonctionnaires de l'administration 
mauritanienne ne peuvent &#234;tre &#233;tablis que par le secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral du Gouvernement.  
</p>
<p>1549. Par ailleurs, l&#8217;article 29 d&#233;finit les personnes pouvant b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un passeport de 
service. Il pr&#233;cise, en effet, que &#171; peuvent obtenir un passeport.de service pour leur 
d&#233;placement &#224; l&#8217;&#233;tranger, pendant la dur&#233;e de leur mission:  
</p>
<p>1550. les fonctionnaires civils et militaires voyageant pour des raisons de services et 
poss&#233;dant dans la hi&#233;rarchie administrative ou militaire un grade jug&#233; suffisant par les 
minist&#232;res int&#233;ress&#233;s ; 
</p>
<p>1551. les personnes charg&#233;es par un d&#233;partement minist&#233;riel d&#8217;une mission importante 
rev&#234;tant un caract&#232;re national. &#187; 
</p>
<p>1552. Dans le cas d'esp&#232;ce, M. Biram Ould Abeid ne dispose que d'une invitation 
personnelle et ne pouvait sur cette base b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un ordre de mission pris en charge par 
l&#8217;Etat quant aux frais de s&#233;jour et de voyage. C'est pour cette raison qu&#8217;il ne pouvait pas 
voyager avec un passeport de service alors qu'il n&#8217;est pas d&#233;tenteur d'un ordre de mission 
&#233;tabli par les autorit&#233;s administratives comp&#233;tentes. Le passeport de service demand&#233; par 
M. Biram Ould Abeid est une facilit&#233; que le Gouvernement accorde aux fonctionnaires qu'il 
envoie en mission. Il ne pouvait pas b&#233;n&#233;ficier de cette commodit&#233; puisqu'il envisageait un 
voyage &#224; titre priv&#233;.  
</p>
<p>1553. Sur un autre plan, nous rappelons, &#224; cette occasion, que notre pays, la Mauritanie, a 
enregistr&#233; d&#8217;importants progr&#232;s en mati&#232;re de protection et de promotion des droits de 
l'homme. Ces progr&#232;s ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;s en application des principes de libert&#233; et d&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; 
&#233;dict&#233;s par l'Islam et garantis par la Constitution du 20 juillet 1991. Ces principes ont 
permis la reconnaissance de dizaines de partis politiques et de centaines d'associations de la 
soci&#233;t&#233; civile qui exercent leurs activit&#233;s en toute qui&#233;tude et souvent avec l'appui des 
institutions de la R&#233;publique (telles que le Commissariat aux Droits de l'Homme, &#224; l&#8217;Action 
Humanitaire et aux Relations avec la Soci&#233;t&#233; Civile et la Direction G&#233;n&#233;rale des Elections 
et des Libert&#233;s Publiques). C&#8217;est, aussi, dans ce cadre qu&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; institu&#233;e, par l'ordonnance 
2006.015 du 12 juillet 2006, la Commission Nationale des Droits de l&#8217;Homme afin de 
mener les investigations et entreprendre les actions n&#233;cessaires (auxquelles avait pris part 
M. Biram Ould Abeid en tant que Conseiller &#224; cette institution) pour lutter contre toutes les 
formes de discrimination, notamment les s&#233;quelles de l&#8217;esclavage et autres traitements 
d&#233;gradants, d&#233;nonc&#233;s par les d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l'homme.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>223 
</b></p>
<p>1554. Il importe de pr&#233;ciser, par ailleurs, que M. Biram Ould Abeid s'active au nom de 
l&#8217;initiative pour la r&#233;surgence du mouvement anti-esclavagiste (IRA - Section Mauritanie), 
une association ill&#233;gale en Mauritanie puisqu&#8217;elle n'a aucune existence juridique au regard 
de la loi mauritanienne, pas m&#234;me le d&#233;but du moindre dossier de reconnaissance aupr&#232;s 
des autorit&#233;s administratives. Malgr&#233; cela, M. Biram Ould Abeid a pu, jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent, 
s'exprimer et voyager au nom de cette association sans &#234;tre inqui&#233;t&#233;. Aussi, il nous semble 
exag&#233;r&#233; qu'une institution aussi importante et fondamentale pour la promotion et la 
protection des droits humains de part le monde, que le Haut Commissariat des Nations 
Unies  aux Droits de l'Homme puisse, se laisser entrainer dans la com&#233;die de M. Biram 
Ould Abeid dont le seul but est de faire du sensationnel en jouant la victime de pers&#233;cutions 
qui n&#8217;existent que dans son imagination. Pour notre part, nous n&#8217;admettons pas que la 
Mauritanie soit index&#233;e pour des suppositions ou all&#233;gations sans fondement. La 
Mauritanie est un pays de droit qui garantit et respecte les droits &#224; l&#8217;&#233;galit&#233; et &#224; la diversit&#233; 
pour l'ensemble de ses citoyens.

<b>allanamiento y robo en las instalaciones de la revista Contral&#237;nea en el Distrito

gubernamental, narcotr&#225;fico, lavado de dinero, as&#237; como sobre diversos temas sociales.  
</p>
<p>1565. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, entre los d&#237;as 10 y 11 de abril de 2010, varios 
individuos habr&#237;an forzado las puertas de acceso de las oficinas de las &#225;reas editorial y 
administrativa de la revista Contral&#237;nea, habr&#237;an sustra&#237;do documentaci&#243;n contable y 
period&#237;stica, ordenadores as&#237; como tel&#233;fonos m&#243;viles. El allanamiento habr&#237;a sido 
denunciado ante la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del Distrito Federal, que le habr&#237;a 
asignado el n&#250;mero de expediente FCH/CUH-6/T1/00542/10-04.   
</p>
<p>1566. Desde 2007, tanto la empresa Corporativo Internacional de Medios de 
Comunicaci&#243;n, S.A. de C.V. que edita, entre otras publicaciones, la revista Contral&#237;nea, 
como su Director, el Sr. Miguel Badillo, la periodista Ana Lilia P&#233;rez y los trabajadores de

<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>1610. Mediante carta fechada el 15 de septiembre de 2010 el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la carta 
de alegaciones con fecha de 5 de agosto de 2010. De acuerdo a la informaci&#243;n

<p><b>  Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>1619. El 20 de agosto de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron una carta de alegaciones 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n en 
la que se encuentran el Padre <b>Mart&#237;n Octavio Garc&#237;a Ortiz</b> (conocido como Padre 
Mart&#237;n), sacerdote cat&#243;lico que colabora con el Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray 
Bartolom&#233; Carrasco en el municipio de San Jos&#233; del Progreso, Oaxaca, y el Padre <b>R. 
Francisco Wilfrido Mayr&#233;n Pel&#225;ez</b>, mejor conocido como &#8220;Padre Uvi&#8221;. El Padre Uvi es 
defensor de Derechos Humanos, fundador del Centro Regional de derechos humanos 
&#8220;Bartolom&#233; Carrasco Brise&#241;o&#8221; AC. y coordinador de la Comisi&#243;n Diocesana de Justicia y 
Paz. 
</p>
<p>1620. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el Padre Mart&#237;n Octavio Garc&#237;a Ortiz vendr&#237;a 
siendo v&#237;ctima desde hace alg&#250;n tiempo de hostigamiento por parte de autoridades 
municipales debido a su activismo medioambiental y sus esfuerzos por informar a la 
comunidad sobre el impacto social y ecol&#243;gico de la mina de oro y plata San Jos&#233;, operada 
por la compa&#241;&#237;a Cuzcatl&#225;n S.A de C.V. y propiedad de la empresa canadiense Fortuna 
Mines, Inc. 
</p>
<p>1621. En mayo de 2009, coincidiendo con el auge de las movilizaciones de protesta contra 
la mina, habr&#237;a dado comienzo una campa&#241;a de desprestigio contra el Padre Mart&#237;n. En este 
contexto, varios diarios locales lo habr&#237;an acusado en diversas ocasiones de incitaci&#243;n a la 
violencia en el municipio de San Jos&#233; del Progreso. El 25 de noviembre de 2009, el 
Presidente Municipal de San Jos&#233; del Progreso habr&#237;a presentado una denuncia contra el 
Padre Mart&#237;n y le habr&#237;a acusado p&#250;blicamente de pertenecer al Ej&#233;rcito Popular 
Revolucionario (EPR), organizaci&#243;n guerrillera activa en el sur del pa&#237;s desde 1996.   
</p>
<p>1622. Seg&#250;n los informes recibidos, el 16 de junio de 2010, se habr&#237;a producido un 
enfrentamiento entre autoridades municipales de San Jos&#233; del Progreso y personas 
opositoras a la explotaci&#243;n de la mina, resultando muertos dos individuos: el Sr. Venancio 
Oscar Mart&#237;nez Rivera, Presidente Municipal de San Jos&#233; del Progreso, y el Sr. F&#233;lix 
Misael Hern&#225;ndez, Regidor de Salud.  En reacci&#243;n a estos hechos, un grupo de personas 
habr&#237;a retenido ese mismo d&#237;a, durante varias horas, al Padre Mart&#237;n, golpe&#225;ndolo y 
amenaz&#225;ndolo con matarlo, hasta que decidieron entregarlo a la polic&#237;a.  Como 
consecuencia de las agresiones f&#237;sicas que habr&#237;a sufrido el Padre Mart&#237;n durante su 
retenci&#243;n, &#233;ste habr&#237;a tenido que ser trasladado al hospital donde habr&#237;a permanecido hasta 
el d&#237;a 30 de junio.  Ninguna de las personas que participaron en la retenci&#243;n ilegal del se&#241;or 
Garc&#237;a Ortiz habr&#237;a sido detenida hasta la fecha.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>231 
</b></p>
<p>1623. Posteriormente, la Procuradur&#237;a General de Justicia del estado de Oaxaca habr&#237;a 
solicitado el arraigo del Padre Mart&#237;n por considerarlo sospechoso de la autor&#237;a intelectual 
del homicidio del Sr. Venancio Oscar Mart&#237;nez Rivera. Tras cumplir parte de su arraigo en 
el hospital para recuperarse de sus lesiones, el arraigo habr&#237;a sido suspendido y el Padre 
Mart&#237;n habr&#237;a sido puesto en libertad el 30 de junio de 2010.  Sin embargo, el proceso penal 
habr&#237;a continuado su curso por lo que el Padre Mart&#237;n contin&#250;a enfrentando una acusaci&#243;n 
penal, ahora en libertad. 
</p>
<p>1624. En este contexto, se ha recibido informaci&#243;n de que en los &#250;ltimos meses se han 
incrementado las notas period&#237;sticas y actos de intimidaci&#243;n en contra del Padre R. 
Francisco Wilfrido Mayr&#233;n Pel&#225;ez. El Padre Uvi habr&#237;a apoyado y acompa&#241;ado la defensa 
del Padre Mart&#237;n desde el momento de ser privado de su libertad por parte de las 
autoridades oaxaque&#241;as. Asimismo, el Padre Uvi habr&#237;a denunciado p&#250;blicamente el 
asesinato en abril de 2010 de la defensora Beatriz &#8220;Betty&#8221; Cari&#241;o y de Jiry Jaakkola y 
habr&#237;a intervenido como mediador en el caso a petici&#243;n del Municipio de San Juan Copala.  
Durante los &#250;ltimos meses, diversos medios locales habr&#237;an acusado al Padre Uvi de ser 
uno de los generadores de la violencia en el municipio.   
</p>
<p>1625. Se expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Padre 
Mart&#237;n Octavio Garc&#237;a Ortiz y por las alegaciones de que su situaci&#243;n actual, incluyendo el 
proceso penal actualmente en curso, pudiera estar relacionada con sus actividades de 
promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en particular su defensa del 
medioambiente y sus esfuerzos por informar a los afectados sobre el impacto social y 
ecol&#243;gico de la mina de oro y plata San Jos&#233;.  Asimismo, se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la 
situaci&#243;n del Padre R. Francisco Wilfrido Mayr&#233;n Pel&#225;ez y por las alegaciones de que los 
actos de desprestigio, acoso e intimidaci&#243;n que vendr&#237;a sufriendo estar&#237;an relacionados con 
sus actividades como defensor de los derechos humanos y, en particular, con su apoyo al 
Padre Mart&#237;n y con su labor de mediaci&#243;n en la situaci&#243;n del Municipio de San Juan de 
Copala.  
</p>
<p>1626. Las alegaciones arriba se&#241;aladas, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto 
de creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en 
M&#233;xico. En el Informe sobre la situaci&#243;n de las y los defensores en M&#233;xico, la OACNUDH 
se&#241;al&#243; que el Estado de Oaxaca era el Estado con mayor n&#250;mero de quejas por agresiones 
en contra de defensores/as y advirti&#243; el uso arbitrario del sistema penal como la segunda 
forma m&#225;s habitual de obstaculizaci&#243;n del trabajo de las y los defensores en M&#233;xico. 
</p>
<p><b>  Carta de alegaciones 
</b></p>
<p>1627. El 1 de octubre de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, y el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias, enviaron una carta de alegaciones 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el ataque 
armado en el cual perdiera la vida el reportero grafico <b>Luis Carlos Santiago</b>, de 21 a&#241;os de 
edad, y resultara gravemente herido su compa&#241;ero Carlos Manuel S&#225;nchez Colunga, ambos 
colaboradores del Diario de Ju&#225;rez, en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Chihuahua. 
</p>
<p>1628. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 16 de septiembre 2010, un comando armado 
integrado por sujetos no identificados habr&#237;a atacado con armas de fuego el veh&#237;culo en el 
que se trasladaban Luis Carlos Santiago y Carlos Manuel S&#225;nchez Colunga, en las 
inmediaciones del centro comercial  &#8220;R&#237;o Grande Mall&#8221;, ubicado en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, 
Chihuahua. Como resultado del ataque, perdi&#243;  la vida en el lugar el Sr. Luis Carlos 
Santiago, y el Sr. Carlos Manuel S&#225;nchez Colunga, con serias heridas de bala, fue 
trasladado a un centro asistencial en donde fue sometido a una intervenci&#243;n quir&#250;rgica. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>232</b>  
</p>
<p>1629. Seg&#250;n se informa de que el veh&#237;culo en el que ambos viajaban, era propiedad del 
se&#241;or Gustavo de la Rosa y era utilizado com&#250;nmente por su hijo Alejo de la Rosa, quien 
tambi&#233;n colabora en el Diario de Ju&#225;rez.  El Se&#241;or de la Rosa, es visitador de la Comisi&#243;n 
Estatal de los Derechos Humanos y se ha destacado por enfocarse a monitorear y denunciar 
violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas por el ej&#233;rcito en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, Chihuahua. 
Adem&#225;s, ha sido profesor de la Universidad de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, y es ampliamente reconocido 
por su labor de defensa de los derechos humanos en la comunidad.  En el a&#241;o 2009, habr&#237;a 
solicitado p&#250;blicamente la salida de las fuerzas armadas de Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, por lo que 
posteriormente fue objeto de diversos actos de hostigamiento y amenazas en su contra, 
situaci&#243;n que lo habr&#237;a obligado a trasladar su residencia a El Paso, Texas. 
</p>
<p>1630. Seg&#250;n se tiene conocimiento, el 17 de septiembre 2010, la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de los 
Derechos Humanos emiti&#243; un comunicado (CGCP/236/10) condenando el ataque y 
solicitando el esclarecimiento de los hechos. Se&#241;al&#243; que &#8220;con el homicidio de Luis Carlos 
Santiago se elev&#243; a 65 el n&#250;mero de periodistas asesinados del a&#241;o 2000 a la fecha&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1631. Se temi&#243; que el atentado en el cual perdi&#243; la vida el reportero grafico Luis Carlos 
Santiago, y resultara seriamente herido el Sr. S&#225;nchez Colunga, est&#233; relacionado con las 
actividades period&#237;sticas que ellos realizan. Asimismo, se expres&#243; una profunda 
preocupaci&#243;n por la vida, y por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica, tanto del Sr. Carlos 
Manuel Sanchez Colunga que sobrevivi&#243; al hecho, como del Sr. Gustavo de la Rosa y de su 
hijo Alejo de la Rosa, particularmente porque llevan a cabo su trabajo en un &#225;rea 
considerada de riesgo para el ejercicio de la profesi&#243;n period&#237;stica y de defensa de los 
derechos humanos. 
</p>
<p>1632. De ser confirmados los hechos, se enmarcan en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad 
para los periodistas en M&#233;xico, por lo que quisi&#233;ramos recordar al Gobierno de su 
Excelencia que tiene la responsabilidad de garantizar la seguridad de los periodistas y 
comunicadores sociales y de tomar las medidas necesarias para asegurar que ninguna 
violaci&#243;n contra un periodista o comunicador social quede en la impunidad. 
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>1633. El 16 de noviembre de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial 
sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento 
urgente se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n 
con los actos de hostigamientos y las amenazas recibidas por el Sr. <b>Jorge Arzave 
Orihuela</b>. El Sr. Arzave Orihuela es miembro de la Asociaci&#243;n de Vecinos Propositivos 
por Lomas de San Francisco Tepojaco, agrupaci&#243;n que trabaja por el derecho a la vivienda 
y medio ambiente sano de las habitantes de Lomas de Cuautitl&#225;n.  En este contexto, el Sr. 
Arzave Orihuela, con acompa&#241;amiento del Centro Prodh, ha interpuesto diversos recursos 
jur&#237;dicos con el objetivo de que se respeten los derechos a la informaci&#243;n p&#250;blica, a la 
vivienda y el acceso a la justicia de los habitantes de Lomas de Cuautitl&#225;n. 
</p>
<p>1634. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, desde agosto 2010, el Sr. Arzave Orihuela habr&#237;a 
sido v&#237;ctima de repetidos actos de hostigamientos y amenazas.  Estas se han materializado 
en forma de llamadas amenazantes al tel&#233;fono de su domicilio y recientemente, el 8 de 
noviembre, en una visita de un veh&#237;culo no identificado en horas de la madrugada en la 
direcci&#243;n de su domicilio.  
</p>
<p>1635. Seg&#250;n informes recibidos, el pasado 8 de noviembre 2010, un veh&#237;culo negro se 
habr&#237;a estacionado durante unos minutos a altas horas de la madrugada frente al domicilio 
del Sr. Arzave Orihuela en Cuatitl&#225;n Izcall&#237;.  Dicho vehiculo habr&#237;a estado aparcado unos 
minutos frente a la casa del Sr. Sr. Arzave Orihuela con m&#250;sica a muy alto volumen de 
cuya letra se habr&#237;a alcanzado a distinguir la frase &#8220;&#8230; del m&#233;rito de Michoac&#225;n&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>233 
</b></p>
<p>1636. Este hecho habr&#237;a sido precedido por dos llamadas a su tel&#233;fono dom&#233;stico. La m&#225;s 
reciente, con fecha 29 de octubre, la habr&#237;a realizado un individuo que se habr&#237;a 
identificado como integrante de &#8220;La Familia Michoacana&#8221;, un conocido grupo de crimen 
organizado que opera en el Estado de Michoac&#225;n.  Esta persona habr&#237;a indicado al Sr. 
Arzave Orhuela que una joven le habr&#237;a entregado unas fotograf&#237;as en las que aparec&#237;an &#233;l y 
su familia marcados con c&#237;rculos. Seg&#250;n este individuo, dichas im&#225;genes se las habr&#237;an 
proporcionado con el objetivo de que secuestrase al Sr. Arzave Orihuela. 
</p>
<p>1637. Anteriormente, el d&#237;a 17 de agosto, el Sr. Arzave Orihuela habr&#237;a recibido una 
llamada similar en la que se le habr&#237;a indicado que se le estaba investigando desde hace 7 
d&#237;as por &#243;rdenes de alguien &#8220;que le quer&#237;a hacer da&#241;o&#8221;.  El mismo individuo le habr&#237;a dado 
el nombre de su esposa y los datos de su domicilio para demostrarle que lo ten&#237;an vigilado.  
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la llamada intimidatoria se habr&#237;a producido en el contexto 
de la denuncia p&#250;blica realizada el mismo d&#237;a 17 de agosto por parte del Sr. Arzave 
Orihuela en un reportaje period&#237;stico en medios de comunicaci&#243;n locales y nacionales.  En 
dicho reportaje, el Sr. Arzave Orihuela habr&#237;a denunciado que la alcaldesa del municipio de 
Cuautitl&#225;n Izcall&#237; no habr&#237;a llevado a cabo las gestiones necesarias para proveer a la 
poblaci&#243;n de un derecho digno a la vivienda y a la salud, y se habr&#237;a referido al basurero de 
la zona, a las condiciones de salubridad del mismo y al riesgo de la acumulaci&#243;n de gases.  
</p>
<p>1638. De acuerdo con los informes recibidos, integrantes de la Agencia de Seguridad 
Estatal y de la polic&#237;a municipal se habr&#237;an presentado en el domicilio del Sr. Arzave 
Orihuela para facilitarle sus n&#250;meros de celular, con la finalidad de que los llamara si fuera 
necesario. Se ha recibido informaci&#243;n de que las patrullas de los elementos de seguridad 
estatal y municipal se habr&#237;an presentado espor&#225;dicamente en casa del Sr. Arzave Orihuela, 
lo cual no seria suficiente para garantizar su seguridad.   
</p>
<p>1639. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el se&#241;or Arzave Orihuela habr&#237;a interpuesto 
denuncias y solicitado medidas cautelares. Sin embargo, se alega que las autoridades 
competentes no habr&#237;an avanzado en las investigaciones de estas amenazas, ni en las 
medidas para garantizar de manera efectiva su seguridad y la de su familia. 
</p>
<p>1640. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica del Sr. Arzave 
Orihuela y tambi&#233;n por el hecho que estos actos de hostigamiento y amenazas pudieran 
estar relacionados con sus actividades de promoci&#243;n y protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, 
en particular en favor del derecho a la vivienda y medio ambiente sano de los habitantes de 
Lomas de Cuautitl&#225;n.  Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto 
de creciente violencia e inseguridad para los defensores de los derechos humanos en 
M&#233;xico.

en su contra y tambi&#233;n contra los integrantes del equipo del Centro de Derechos Humanos 
Fray Bartolom&#233; de las Casas, conocido como Centro Frayba. Los hechos referidos tuvieron 
lugar en la ciudad de San Crist&#243;bal de las Casas, en el Estado de Chiapas.  La Organizaci&#243;n 
ENLACE tiene sede social en el municipio de Comit&#225;n (Chiapas) y tiene por objetivo la 
construcci&#243;n de alternativas de desarrollo local sostenible en territorios suburbanos, 
ind&#237;genas y campesinos del sur de M&#233;xico.   
</p>
<p>1642. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 24 de noviembre de 2010, la Sra. Margarita

entrevista con un funcionario de la Oficina en M&#233;xico del Alto Comisionado de las 
Naciones Unidas, en la mencionada ciudad de San Crist&#243;bal de las Casas.  La reuni&#243;n 
habr&#237;a tenido por objeto dar seguimiento a anteriores incidentes de amenazas y agresiones 
con la Sra. Mart&#237;nez.   
</p>
<p>1643. Estos actos de los que habr&#237;a sido objeto la Sra. Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;an originado el 3 de 
marzo de 2010 el otorgamiento de medidas cautelares por parte de la Comisi&#243;n

incluye escolta policial.   
</p>
<p>1644. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, al salir de la cafeter&#237;a, la Sra. Margarita Guadalupe 
Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;a buscado a la persona que tiene asignada como escolta pero no la habr&#237;a 
encontrado. Habr&#237;a caminado una cuadra cuando habr&#237;a sido interceptada por dos personas, 
un hombre a bordo de una camioneta blanca sin placas de circulaci&#243;n, y  otro individua a 
pie. El &#250;ltimo le habr&#237;a indicado, amenaz&#225;ndola de muerte si no cumpl&#237;a las &#243;rdenes, que 
caminar&#225; dos cuadras hasta que se encontrara con una persona que le dar&#237;a indicaciones. 
Una vez realizado el recorrido, la Sra. Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;a recibido un papel con amenazas 
contra los integrantes del Centro Frayba. Los individuos le habr&#237;an exigido que transmitiera 
las amenazas y le habr&#237;an indicado que deber&#237;a caminar dos cuadras m&#225;s para tomar un 
taxi.  Seg&#250;n los informes recibidos, durante todo este tiempo, la Sra. Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;a sido 
seguida de cerca por la camioneta blanca.   
</p>
<p>1645. Se ha recibido informaci&#243;n indicando que el antecedente mas reciente a los 
incidentes mencionados habr&#237;a tenido lugar el 26 de febrero de 2010, cuando la Sra. 
Mart&#237;nez habr&#237;a sido secuestrada y amenazada de muerte cuando se dirig&#237;a a buscar a su 
hijo a la escuela. En esa ocasi&#243;n personas no identificadas le habr&#237;an colocado una bolsa de

amenazado de muerte, dici&#233;ndole &#8220;ya no vas a poder trabajar&#8221;, y la habr&#237;an instando a que 
desistiera de la denuncia penal iniciada el 23 de noviembre de 2009 en contra de 
funcionarios del Gobierno de Chiapas por los delitos de abuso de autoridad, allanamiento, 
tortura psicol&#243;gica y amenazas con el agravante de muerte. Sus agresores tambi&#233;n le 
habr&#237;an indicado que la agresi&#243;n contra ella se trataba &#8220;de un regalito del presidente

Chihuahua como protesta y exigiendo justicia por la muerte de su hija, Rub&#237; Marisol Frayre 
Escobedo, la cual habr&#237;a sido asesinada a los 16 a&#241;os de edad en Ciudad Ju&#225;rez por su

habr&#237;a llegado a la plaza principal de la ciudad de Chihuahua y se habr&#237;a acercado a la Sra. 
Escobedo Ortiz. Ella habr&#237;a corrido buscando refugio en el Palacio de Gobierno y, a sus

<p>1702.  Selon les informations re&#231;ues, des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; marocaines seraient entr&#233;es 
dans le camp Gdeim Izik situ&#233; au Sahara occidental o&#249; quelques milliers de tentes ont &#233;t&#233; 
dress&#233;es en octobre par des personnes sahraouies afin de protester contre leurs conditions 
sociales et &#233;conomiques, en vue de les d&#233;manteler. Le 8 novembre 2010, les forces de 
s&#233;curit&#233; marocaines auraient d&#233;mantel&#233; le camp et fait partir les manifestants. L&#8217;op&#233;ration 
de d&#233;mant&#232;lement aurait conduit &#224; un affrontement violent entre les r&#233;sidents du camp et 
les forces de s&#233;curit&#233;. La violence se serait propag&#233;e &#224; la ville d&#8217;El-Ayoun et aurait entra&#238;n&#233; 
la mort de 11 membres des forces de l&#8217;ordre et de 2 civils.  
</p>
<p>1703. Quelque 300 personnes auraient &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenues. Des rapports port&#233;s &#224; notre attention 
ont indiqu&#233; que des p&#167;ersonnes sahraouies auraient fait l&#8217;objet d&#8217;actes de torture et de 
mauvais traitements aux mains des forces de s&#233;curit&#233; marocaines lors du d&#233;mant&#232;lement du

personnes &#226;g&#233;es et des femmes, auraient &#233;t&#233; battues et subies d&#8217;autres mauvais traitements. 
Pendant leur arrestation et leur transport dans des v&#233;hicules de police aux centres de

auraient subi des coups, parfois entra&#238;nant une perte de connaissance, et de l&#8217;urine ainsi que 
des excr&#233;ments auraient &#233;t&#233; jet&#233;s sur eux. Certaines personnes d&#233;tenues auraient &#233;galement

<p>1706. En outre, les familles des personnes d&#233;tenues ont d&#233;plor&#233; le fait que les autorit&#233;s 
marocaines ne les aient pas inform&#233;es du moment et du lieu d&#8217;arrestation des membres de 
leur famille d&#233;tenus et qu&#8217;un droit de visite leur ait &#233;t&#233; refus&#233; pendant plus de 2 semaines. 
</p>
<p>1707. A El-Ayoun, suite au d&#233;mant&#232;lement du camp, des Sahraouis sont sortis dans les 
rues et commis des actes de violence, y compris contre des b&#226;timents publics li&#233;s &#224; 
l&#8217;administration marocaine. Les informations re&#231;ues indiquent que les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; ont 
tir&#233; par balle dans la ville d'El-Ayoun, blessant des civils. Des civils marocains auraient

personnes sahraouies. En outre, les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; marocaines ne seraient pas 
intervenues pour prot&#233;ger les sahraouis ou auraient elles-m&#234;mes particip&#233; aux attaques. Par 
exemple, dans le quartier de Colomina Nueva, des maisons appartenant &#224; des personnes 
sahraouies auraient &#233;t&#233; attaqu&#233;es les 8 et 9 novembre et les habitants auraient &#233;t&#233; rou&#233;s de

droits de l&#8217;homme ainsi que des activistes politiques sahraouis. 
</p>
<p>1709. Par ailleurs, nous souhaiterions &#233;galement attirer l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement de 
votre Excellence sur les all&#233;gations de violations ci-apr&#232;s:

<p>1710. Lors de l&#8217;op&#233;ration de d&#233;mant&#232;lement, un citoyen de double nationalit&#233; marocaine et 
espagnole et sa m&#232;re &#224; qui il venait rendre visite, auraient subi des actes de violence. Les 
forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient battu la m&#232;re d&#8217;Ahmed lui causant plusieurs blessures et des 
effets personnels lui auraient &#233;t&#233; vol&#233;s dans sa tente. Au cours de l&#8217;arrestation et de 
l&#8217;interrogatoire d&#8217;Ahmed, les agents de s&#233;curit&#233; l'auraient frapp&#233; &#224; l&#8217;aide de b&#226;tons, de 
tubes, de barres de m&#233;tal et de casques. Pendant sa d&#233;tention au si&#232;ge de la police de

<p>1711. Le 9 novembre 2010, un autre Sahraoui aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; &#224; son domicile dans le 
quartier de Colomina Nueva. Lors de son arrestation et interrogatoire, il aurait &#233;galement 
&#233;t&#233; frapp&#233; &#224; la t&#234;te, au dos et aux reins avec des b&#226;tons et des matraques entra&#238;nant une 
perte de connaissance &#224; deux reprises. Il est all&#233;gu&#233; que la police l'a r&#233;anim&#233; en d&#233;versant 
de l'eau sur lui. Il aurait en outre &#233;t&#233; priv&#233; de nourriture et d'assistance m&#233;dicale pour ses 
blessures. A la suite des attaques subies lors de sa d&#233;tention, il aurait souffert de 
nombreuses blessures et aurait eu des difficult&#233;s &#224; marcher.

<p><b>  Nepal 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>1714. On 31 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a letter of allegations regarding the 
death of Mr. <b>Devi Prasad Dhital</b>, also known as Hemraj, chairman of community radio 
Tulsipur FM.  
</p>
<p>1715. According to information received, on 22 July 2010, Mr. Devi Prasad Dhital was 
allegedly shot in the chest by at least four assailants while travelling on a motorcycle to 
Tulsipur from his home town of Urahari in the district of Dang. He reportedly died after 
being rushed to a hospital in Tulsipur. A man suspected of being one of the killers has 
allegedly been arrested by the police.  
</p>
<p>1716. It is alleged that Mr. Devi Prasad Dhital is the third media owner to be killed this 
year. 
</p>
<p>1717. While the motive behind the killing of Mr. Dhital is yet to be confirmed, concern 
was expressed regarding the safety of journalists and media personnel in the eastern and 
western regions of Nepal, as reports indicate that they are increasingly targeted by criminal 
groups.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1718. In a letter dated 20 January 2011, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 31 August 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1719. The investigation process has been initiated by the designated police team of the 
District Police Office, Dang, with regard to the incident that occurred on 22 July 2010 at 
Urahari VDC Ward No.4, Hemnagar Jaspur, Dang District, Nepal, when Mr. Devid Prasad 
Dhital, also known as Hemraj, chairman of Tulsipur FM, was shot dead while travelling on 
a motorcycle by an unknown group. As the investigation is currently ongoing, the 
government expresses its commitment to bring the perpetrators to justice on the basis of 
actual facts and evidences.  
</p>
<p>1720. The initial investigation into the case suggests that Mr. Dhital&#8217;s murder might 
equally have been motivated by other reasons rather than only his being a media person as 
he was also involved in various other businesses. He was the contractor for supplying ration 
to a Nepalese Army unit, had served as the chairman of Lions Club and Rapti Bus Board of 
Directors, had operated showroom of Toyota company in Nepalgunj, was involved in 
crusher business in Kapilbastu, and had been conducting economic transactions with Mr. 
Tulsiram B.K. who lived in Mumbai, India. The accuracy of the incident, however, would 
be clear when the results of the investigations are received in near future.  
</p>
<p>1721. With regard to the compensation to the family of the deceased, they will receive due 
remedy as per the prevailing law of Nepal on the basis of the results of the investigation as 
the case is currently being investigated. It may be noted that from the FY 2009/10 a 
Conflict-Affected Journalist Welfare Fund has been established in order to provide 
immediate relief to the conflict-affected journalists and their families. Moreover, the 
government has been providing financial assistance and compensation to the journalists by 
special decisions on the loss of their life, limb and property due to natural calamities and 
physical attacks.  
</p>
<p>1722. The Comprehensive Peace Accord, 2006 and the Interim Constitution of Nepal, 
2007 have committed full press freedom. Under the title of Fundamental Rights in Part 3 of 
the Constitution, every citizen has the freedom of opinion and expression as well as the 
freedom to engage in any occupation or be engaged in employment, industry and trade. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>244</b>  
</p>
<p>Government of Nepal is always effortful to protect and respect the rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution. The Working Journalists Act, 1993 has been formulated with the objective of 
protecting the interests and rights of the working journalists and ensuring their security. 
Similarly the Press Council has been constituted under the Press Council Act, 1992 for the 
development and promotion of healthy, independent and responsible journalism by way of 
maintaining the highest professional ethics of journalism. Likewise, the Press and 
Publication Act, 1991 intends to create an environment where the journalism sector can 
utilize the freedom of expression in a dignified and responsible way without fear.  
</p>
<p>1723. The Government of Nepal is committed to the protection of the journalists while 
maintaining peace and security in the country. Various security agencies are active in the 
country for ensuring security of all citizens including the journalists. The Local 
Administration Act, 1971 has made the provisions of district and regional security 
committees. Special security is provided to anyone by the decision of the District Security 
Committee if specific request is received from such person. It is worthwhile to note that 
various individuals and journalists have been utilizing such special security facilities from 
the government.  
</p>
<p>1724. The provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Accord, 2006 and the Interim 
Constitution of Nepal, 2007 have made clear that the promotion of human rights, protection 
of democratic values and norms and the end of impunity are matters of state priority. As the 
current state system is being led by the forces that had also led the peoples&#8217; movement 
while keeping democracy and protection and promotion of human rights at the centre, the 
Government of Nepal would like to reassure that there would not be any deviation or 
indifference on the part of the state in this respect.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1725. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to his 
communication dated 31 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>1726. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to guarantee freedom of the 
press and to create an environment where journalists and human rights defenders are able 
carry out their legitimate work without fear of persecution or restriction.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1727. On 19 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief, sent an urgent appeal concerning Mr. <b>Khalid Mehmood Naqash</b> and Mr. 
<b>Muhammad Afzal</b>, who are currently detained in district jail of Jhelum, and concerning 
Mr. <b>Zafar Iqbal </b>from Mohallah Suleman Paris.   
</p>
<p>1728. According to the information received, a blasphemy case was registered under 
section 295-C of the Pakistani Penal Code on 3 July 2008 (FIR no. 270/2008) at the police 
station in Saddar Jhelum against Mr. Khalid Mehmood Naqash, who authored a book 
entitled &#8220;Quran aur Hum&#8221;, and Mr. Muhammad Afzal, who wrote the preface of the book. 
They were arrested and detained in district jail of Jhelum on charges that the publication 
contained blasphemous content about Prophet Muhammad. Section 295-C of the Pakistani 
Penal Code provides that &#8220;whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible 
representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles 
the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished 
with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine&#8221;. On 20 May 2009, 
Lahore High Court Justice Malik Saeed Ijaz rejected the application for bail of Mr. Khalid </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>245 
</b></p>
<p>Mehmood Naqash and Mr. Muhammad Afzal. Their case is in the final stages and a 
decision is expected on 21 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>1729. During the proceedings at Session Court Rawalpindi, Mr. Zafar Iqbal acted as a 
witness for the defense. On 4 April 2010, around 11:00 a.m., two gunshots were fired by a 
veiled person in the direction of Mr. Iqbal&#8217;s house in Mohallah Suleman Paris. On 5 April 
2010, around 3:30 p.m., another four gunshots were fired at his house by two unidentified 
persons. On 8 April 2010, Mr. Zafar Iqbal tried to register a First Information Report with 
the District Police Officer of Jhelum, however, the police reportedly failed to do so or to 
provide protection to him and his family. 
</p>
<p>1730. A local religious leader, Mufti Mehmood Hussain Shaiq Hashmi, issued a fatwa on 
11 April 2010, entitled &#8220;Zafar Iqbal&#8217;s support for the person who degraded Holy Prophet 
(PBUH) and consequent verdict against him&#8221;. This so-called religious verdict against Zafar 
Iqbal states, inter alia, the following: &#8220;Khalid Naqash openly and repeatedly used 
blasphemous words. Babu Mohammed Afzal is accomplice, friend and supporter of Khalid 
Naqash. Consequently Zafar Iqbal automatically becomes accomplice of Khalid Naqash. If 
one is a staunch supporter of a blasphemous person, one turns blasphemous oneself. Hence, 
verdict is issued that Zafar Iqbal is an accomplice of Khalid Naqash and Babu Mohammad 
Afzal.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1731. Furthermore, it has been alleged that Mufti Mehmood Hussain Shaiq Hashmi sent 
instructions to his followers to kill Mr. Zafar Iqbal. Concerns have been expressed that the 
lives of Mr. Khalid Mehmood Naqash, Mr. Muhammad Afzal, Mr. Zafar Iqbal and their 
family members are under threat. 
</p>
<p>1732. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Khalid Mehmood Naqash, Mr. Muhammad 
Afzal and Mr. Zafar Iqbal are respected and, in the event that the Government&#8217;s 
investigations support or suggest the above allegations to be correct, the accountability of 
any person guilty of the alleged threats be ensured.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1733. In its letter dated 23 June 2010, the Government of Pakistan responded to the joint 
urgent appeal of 19 April 2010, requesting information about the alleged detention of the 
two accused and the alleged life threats to a witness for the defence of the accused, on the 
charges of publishing blasphemous content. 
</p>
<p>1734. The Government of Pakistan informed that the matter was referred to the authorities 
concerned for the necessary investigation and response. As a result of the information 
received, the Government of Pakistan informed that local authorities have conveyed that 
after carefully examining the content of the book, a blasphemy case was registered in 
accordance with the laws of the land, under section 295 C of the Pakistani Penal Code, on 3 
July 2008 in Jhelum, against the two accused on publishing blasphemous content in their 
book. Both the accused were arrested and challenged to the Court of Law. The case is 
pending in the court of the learned District before the Session Judge in Rawalpindi. 
</p>
<p>1735. The Government informed that with regard to the alleged firing at the house of the 
witness for the defence of the accused, it has been conveyed that the police officials visited 
the spot but did not find any evidence in this connection. In addition the Government of 
Pakistan informed that notables of the area have also expressed ignorance about any 
incident of firing. The Government of Pakistan informed that local authorities have been 
instructed to provide full protection to the life and property of the witness for the defence 
and his family members as and when requisitioned. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1736. On 30 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Mr. 
<b>Siddique Eido</b>, coordinator of the non-governmental organization Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan (HRCP)&#8217;s core group in Pasni, District Gwadar, and Mr. Yousaf 
Baloch. 
</p>
<p>1737. According to the information received, on 21 December 2010, Mr. Eido and Mr. 
Baloch were returning from a court hearing in Gwadar in a van, under police protection, 
when three vehicles, with no license plates, stopped the van in Pasni. Plainclothes men 
exited the first car, and men wearing uniforms of the Federal Paramilitary Force of Pakistan 
Frontier Constabulary the two other cars. They stormed inside the van, and despite some 
resistance from the police officers inside the vehicle, abducted Mr. Eido and Mr. Baloch. 
</p>
<p>1738. Mr. Eido and Mr. Baloch were under trial, with seven co-accused, in relation to an 
alleged attack on coastguards on 29 March 2010, in Pasni sub-district. Mr. Eido had been 
given pre-arrest bail in April 2010.  
</p>
<p>1739. Mr. Eido had received threats for reporting on human rights violations committed in 
the region. He feared that he might be disappeared. 
</p>
<p>1740. Serious concerns were expressed that the abduction of Mr. Eido may be related to 
his legitimate work in defense of human rights. Further concern was expressed for the 
physical and mental integrity of Mr. Eido and Mr. Baloch. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1741. On 24 January 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism, sent an urgent appeal expressing their condolences in relation to 
the killing of the late Governor of Punjab, Mr. <b>Salman Taseer,</b> on 4 January 2011. The 
Special Rapporteurs submitted the urgent appeal regarding their concerns at the 
circumstances surrounding the killing of Mr. <b>Taseer</b>, including issues related to the 
implementation of the blasphemy provisions and threats received by those opposing such 
provisions.  
</p>
<p>1742. According to the information received, Mr. Taseer&#8217;s opposition to the blasphemy 
provisions had allegedly incensed many groups and individuals, including his alleged killer 
Mr. Mumtaz Qadri, opposed to those seeking changes of the current criminal provisions on 
offences relating to religion (sections 295 to 298C of the Pakistan Penal Code). 
</p>
<p>1743. There is reportedly a general atmosphere of fear in Pakistan due to public incitement 
to violence against those seeking reforms of the blasphemy provisions. The examples set 
out below illustrate a number of cases of incitement to violence and hostility against those 
seeking reform of the law or alleged to have committed blasphemy.  
</p>
<p><i>  Events surrounding the killing of Mr. Salman Taseer:  
</i></p>
<p>1744. On 9 January 2011, following the killing of the Governor Mr. Taseer, a rally of 
50,000 people organized by Tahaffauz-e-Namoos-e-Risalalt, a conglomerate of parties 
opposed to changes to the blasphemy provisions, took place in Karachi. The participants in 
the rally were demonstrating against amendments to the blasphemy provisions in Pakistan 
and to show support for the alleged killer, Mr. Mumtaz Qadri. In the rally, Mr. Qadri was 
described as a hero and his courage was saluted. During the rally, some of the speakers 
openly called for those showing support for the amendment to the blasphemy provisions, to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>247 
</b></p>
<p>face the same fate as Mr. Salman Taseer. No action was taken in respect of those inciting 
violence and hatred, despite a reported presence of 3,000 police officers. 
</p>
<p>1745. The death of Mr. Salman Taseer had led to the Jamaate Ahle Sunnat Pakistan, one of 
the biggest religious organizations of the Barelvi representing 500 religious scholars, to 
state that &#8220;there should be no expression of grief or sympathy on the death of the governor, 
as those who support blasphemy of the prophet are themselves indulging in blasphemy&#8221;. 
The group of scholars noted the &#8220;courage and religious zeal&#8221; of Mr. Salman Tasser&#8217;s killer. 
Furthermore, the scholars said the action &#8220;had made Muslims around the world proud&#8221;. In 
addition, the group of scholars has reportedly said that the &#8220;so called&#8221; intellectuals, 
ministers, politicians and television anchors who oppose the blasphemy provisions and 
support those committing blasphemy should learn a lesson from Mr. Taseer&#8217;s death. 
</p>
<p><i>  Debate and events surrounding proposals for reform of the blasphemy provisions: 
</i></p>
<p>1746. In November 2010, a Parliamentarian and former Information Minister, Ms. Sherry 
Rehman, submitted a private members&#8217; bill to the National Assembly Secretariat seeking 
reform of the blasphemy provisions. The bill seeks to eliminate the death penalty for the 
use of derogatory remarks in respect of the Holy Prophet and penalize false blasphemy 
accusations. Subsequently, two fatwas demanding the death of Ms. Sherry Rehman have 
been declared. The first has been given by Mr. Munir Ahmad Shakir, Imam of the Sultan 
Mosque in Karachi. A second fatwa has been published in a pamphlet and distributed by 
the religious organization Tanzeem-e-Islami. Moreover, there have been attempts in 
January 2011 to file blasphemy charges against Ms. Rehman in the Punjab city of Multan. 
This has led to fears for Ms. Rehman's life and wellbeing. 
</p>
<p>1747. In addition, those seeking to report on such incitement to violence have been subject 
to death threats and are reportedly targeted by opponents to the reform of the blasphemy 
provisions. The journalist Mr. Kamran Ali Chisti has received death threats after lodging 
complaints against the Imam of Sultan Mosque in Karachi following the issuance of the 
fatwa against Ms. Sherry Rehman. 
</p>
<p>1748. Following the death of Mr. Salman Taseer, Mr. Shazad Kamran, who provides 
moral, legal and financial support for people convicted of violating the blasphemy 
provisions, is also reported to have received death threats. 
</p>
<p>1749. Some sections of the Pakistan media have given overwhelming coverage to clerics 
who have declared it an obligation for Muslims to kill blasphemers and offered cash 
rewards. The use of media, including social media, has led to websites on social networks 
in support of Mr. Mumtaz Qadri&#8217;s acts. There have been hostile references and death 
threats to other activists and lawyers, including Ms. Asma Jahangir (President of the 
Supreme Court Bar Association and former United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom 
of religion or belief), with threats such as the following, &#8220;so far as Asma Jahangir is 
concerned, she is about to be sent to her friend&#8221;, i.e. Mr. Salman Taseer. Furthermore, a 74-
page pamphlet against Ms. Jahangir has been distributed on 19 January 2011, and three 
journalists have written an article stating that she was a blasphemer. 
</p>
<p>1750. On 16 January 2011, it has also been reported that Ms. Sherbano Taseer, daughter of 
the late Mr. Salman Taseer, has received threats to her life, which include for example the 
warning that she &#8220;should refrain from issuing statements and must remember her father&#8217;s 
fate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><i>  Events surrounding the conviction of Ms. Asia Bibi: 
</i></p>
<p>1751. On 8 December 2010, the Imam Yousuf Quershi, of Mohabat Khan mosque in 
Peshawar, pronounced a reward of Rs. 500,000 for anyone who kills Ms. Asia Bibi, a 
member of the Christian minority who had been sentenced to death on blasphemy charges </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>248</b>  
</p>
<p>by Sheikhupura district and sessions court on 7 November 2010. Furthermore, in Ms. Bibi&#8217;s 
village Ittanwali, the cleric Mr. Maqsood Ahmed Masoomi has stated that anyone who 
commits blasphemy in the village &#8220;should be killed on the spot&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1752. It has been reported that the Minister for Minorities, Mr. Shabhaz Bhatti, has 
received death threats both during the case of Ms. Bibi and now publicly following the 
assassination of Mr. Salman Taseer. Fatwas calling for his beheading have been issued and 
messages of violence have been publicly spread. There has been no formal measure by your 
Excellency&#8217;s Government such as registering cases against those inciting to violence and 
prosecuting them. 
</p>
<p>1753. In view of the current situation in Pakistan, we express grave concern concerning the 
safety of Ms. Asia Bibi and those who have been imprisoned under blasphemy provisions. 
Furthermore, it has been reported that Ms. Bibi faces the threat of a suicide attack in jail. 
The threat is allegedly from a group called &#8220;Moauiya&#8221;, which plans to mount a suicide 
attack on Sheikhpura district jail where Ms. Bibi is currently being detained.  
</p>
<p>1754. On 29 October 2010, Muslim inmates at a prison in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, 
allegedly stoned a young Christian man named Imran Masih who had been convicted under 
the blasphemy provisions and sentenced to ten years imprisonment on 11 January 2010.  
</p>
<p>1755. In addition, concern has been expressed at the possibility of attacks on members of 
religious minorities, including on their places of worship. 
</p>
<p><i>  Recent blasphemy cases: 
</i></p>
<p>1756. On 11 January 2011, a Muslim prayer leader and his son were jailed to life 
imprisonment for blasphemy. The sentence was delivered on 11 January 2011, by an anti-
terrorism court in Dera Ghazi Khan, in the eastern Punjab Province. The prayer leader Mr. 
Mohammed Shafi and his son Mr. Mohammed Aslam were alleged to have torn down and 
trampled on a poster of a gathering to mark the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed. Both 
were arrested in April 2010. The defendants belong to the Deobandi school of Islam, while 
the complainant belongs to the Barelvi sect. The lawyers for the defendants claim that the 
allegations are motivated by intra-religious difference. The Barelvi sect is reported to be at 
the forefront of the recent campaign against any reforms of the blasphemy provisions. 
</p>
<p>1757. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief recalled the alleged 
incidents relating to blasphemy charges addressed in earlier communications dated 19 April 
2010, 27 July 2010 and 22 November 2010.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1758. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Pakistan for the reply to his 
communication sent on 19 April 2010 and 24 January 2011. However, he regrets that at the 
time of the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to his 
communication of 5 May 2011 and to earlier communications sent on 24 January 2011 and 
30 December 2010. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and 
to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent 
prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1759. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that blasphemy legislation should never 
be used to censure inter-religious and intra-religious criticism, as the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief has also underscored (see E/CN.4/2000/65, para. 111). The 
Special Rapporteur also recommends a review of the Penal Code and to consider an 
alternative to blasphemy law by protecting individuals against advocacy of national, racial 
or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>1760. El 19 de abril de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente 
se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la Lic. 
<b>Magaly Castillo</b> y la Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia. La Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia es 
una asociaci&#243;n de veinte organizaciones de la sociedad civil paname&#241;a, que trabaja con el 
fin de mejorar la administraci&#243;n de justicia en la Rep&#250;blica de Panam&#225;. La Alianza observa, 
examina y denuncia la corrupci&#243;n, abusos de autoridad y violaciones de los derechos 
humanos en Panam&#225;. La Lic. Castillo es abogada y Directora Ejecutiva de la Alianza 
Ciudadana Pro Justicia.  
</p>
<p>1761. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, durante las &#250;ltimas semanas la Lic. Castillo, la 
Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia y sus integrantes habr&#237;an sido objeto de una campa&#241;a de 
desprestigio por parte de las autoridades paname&#241;as. La campa&#241;a habr&#237;a empezado despu&#233;s 
de la suspensi&#243;n de un contrato de consultor&#237;a entre el Ministerio P&#250;blico y una empresa de 
consultor&#237;a, la Consultora Internacional Multidisciplinaria Aguilar y Asociados S.R.. El 18 
de marzo de 2010, el Ministerio P&#250;blico habr&#237;a comunicado la suspensi&#243;n del contrato a la 
Consultora Internacional Multidisciplinaria Aguilar y Asociados S.R. en una carta firmada 
por el Sr. Giuseppe Bonissi, el nuevo procurador general de la naci&#243;n. La carta habr&#237;a 
citado el nombre de la Lic. Castillo. La Consultora Internacional Multidisciplinaria Aguilar 
y Asociados habr&#237;an contactado a la Lic. Castillo como posible asesora en materia de 
derechos humanos. La labor de consultor&#237;a habr&#237;a sido adjudicada en una licitaci&#243;n 
internacional realizada por los Proyectos del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), 
que tiene previsto la capacitaci&#243;n de 30 funcionarios del Ministerio P&#250;blico durante un 
per&#237;odo de siete meses.  
</p>
<p>1762. Esta cancelaci&#243;n y la campa&#241;a de desprestigio habr&#237;an coincidido con la 
participaci&#243;n de la Lic. Castillo y la Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia en una audiencia 
tem&#225;tica ante el 138 Per&#237;odo de Sesiones de la Comisi&#243;n Interamericana de los Derechos 
Humanos (CIDH), que tuvo lugar el 23 de marzo de 2010. La audiencia trataba de la 
situaci&#243;n de la administraci&#243;n de justicia en Panam&#225;. Adem&#225;s, durante los &#250;ltimos meses la 
Lic. Castillo habr&#237;a criticado p&#250;blicamente la suspensi&#243;n reciente de la anterior procuradora 
general de la naci&#243;n, la Sra. Ana Matilde G&#243;mez.  
</p>
<p>1763. Durante los d&#237;as siguientes, varios funcionarios del Ministerio P&#250;blico y otras 
agencias gubernamentales habr&#237;an aparecido en programas de televisi&#243;n y de radio, y 
habr&#237;an hecho declaraciones sobre la participaci&#243;n de la Lic. Castillo en la consultor&#237;a. Por 
ejemplo, durante un programa de televisi&#243;n llamada &#8220;Encontremos Soluciones&#8221;, que se 
habr&#237;a sido transmitido en Canal 21 RCM el 24 de marzo, los presentadores habr&#237;an hecho 
referencia a la Lic. Castillo en relaci&#243;n con pagos que ella supuestamente habr&#237;a recibido 
del Gobierno. &#8220;Magaly Castillo es una de las que el procurador encargado Bonissi le acaba 
de suspender un contrato de Cientos de Miles de d&#243;lares... &#191;C&#243;mo es que est&#225;n 
emplanillados all&#225; con miles de d&#243;lares?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>1764. El 30 de marzo de 2010 la Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia habr&#237;a realizado una 
conferencia de prensa para rechazar las acusaciones en su contra y en contra de la Lic. 
Castillo. Las representantes de la Alianza habr&#237;an declarado sin lugar a equ&#237;vocos que 
nunca habr&#237;a existido un contrato entre la Lic. Castillo y la Consultora Internacional 
Multidisciplinaria Aguilar y Asociados S.R. . Habr&#237;an aclarado que la Lic. Castillo formaba 
parte de una lista de potenciales consultores que podr&#237;an participar en la consultor&#237;a, y que 
los honorarios previstos para la realizaci&#243;n de la consultor&#237;a eran de USD5,000 durante 
todo el per&#237;odo del contrato. Una comunicaci&#243;n de prensa publicada por la Alianza durante 
la conferencia habr&#237;a sido firmada por catorce organizaciones de la sociedad civil, quienes </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>habr&#237;an solicitan el fin de la campa&#241;a de desprestigio de la que estar&#237;a siendo objeto la Lic. 
Castillo.  
</p>
<p>1765. El mismo d&#237;a, la Secretar&#237;a de comunicaci&#243;n del Estado habr&#237;a enviado un 
comunicado a los medios de comunicaci&#243;n en Panam&#225;. Este comunicado confirm&#243; que el 
Gobierno de Panam&#225; apoya la libertad de expresi&#243;n y el derecho de la sociedad civil de 
expresar su opini&#243;n sobre decisiones que tome el Gobierno Nacional. Sin embargo, se 
declar&#243; que &#8220;lo que Magaly Castillo deber&#237;a hacer como miembro de la sociedad civil es 
aclarar la asesor&#237;a de 10 mil 400 d&#243;lares al mes que le adjudic&#243; la Procuradora separada, 
Ana Matilde G&#243;mez, en vez de echarle la culpa al Gobierno&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1766. El 6 de abril, dos ministras de Estado habr&#237;an criticado p&#250;blicamente a la Alianza 
Ciudadana Pro Justicia mientras aparec&#237;an en &#8220;Debate Abierto&#8221;, un programa de televisi&#243;n 
transmitido en Canal 4. Las Ministras habr&#237;an cuestionado sobre la constituci&#243;n de la 
Alianza, de sus estatutos y de su composici&#243;n, y habr&#237;an sugerido que la Alianza Ciudadana 
podr&#237;a carecer de legitimidad. La Sra. Alma Cortes, Ministra de Trabajo y Desarrollo 
Laboral, habr&#237;a sugerido que los grupos de sociedad civil no estaban cualificados para 
emitir opiniones. Asimismo, habr&#237;a declarado que iba a solicitar un censo de &#8220;todos estos 
gremios&#8221; para aprender en d&#243;nde est&#225;n ubicados y qui&#233;nes les representan, &#8220;porque si van a 
querer trabajar con nosotros - el Gobierno - tendr&#225;n que definir una postura y deponer 
intereses personales&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1767. La Ministra habr&#237;a criticado a la Lic. Castillo por su defensa de la previa 
procuradora, &#8220;que todo el mundo sab&#237;a de sus desatinos y a lo mejor de su incapacidad y la 
de su equipo, que administraba justicia con su grupito&#8221;.Asimismo la Ministra habr&#237;a 
criticado a la participaci&#243;n de la Lic. Castillo en la audiencia ante la CIDH. Ella habr&#237;a 
dicho, &#8220;Me tienes muy decepcionada&#8221;, porque las denuncias de la Lic Castillo &#8220;pueden 
constituirse en un instrumento calumnioso e injurioso, que para sus efectos son 
comunicados an&#243;nimos&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1768. Asimismo, durante el programa anteriormente mencionado las Ministras habr&#237;an 
revelado que la Lic. Ang&#233;lica Maytin, la Director Ejecutiva de la Fundaci&#243;n para el 
Desarrollo de la Libertad Ciudadana, que es una de las organizaciones constitutivas de la 
Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia, habr&#237;a sido investigada por el &#211;rgano Ejecutivo en relaci&#243;n 
con su declaraci&#243;n personal de renta anual. Se inform&#243; que es posible que otros integrantes 
de la Alianza puedan ser objeto de investigaciones similares.  
</p>
<p>1769. El 8 de abril, la Ministra de Trabajo habr&#237;a sugerido que si las organizaciones y 
grupos de sociedad civil quer&#237;an examinar la vida p&#250;blica y privada de los funcionarios 
p&#250;blicos, entonces las vidas p&#250;blicas y privadas de los representantes de sociedad civil 
tambi&#233;n podr&#237;an ser investigadas.  
</p>
<p>1770. Se temi&#243; que la campa&#241;a de desprestigio de la que habr&#237;a sido objeto de la Lic. 
Castillo, la Alianza Ciudadana Pro Justicia y sus integrantes est&#233; relacionada con las 
actividades que ellos realizaban para promover la administraci&#243;n de justicia en Panam&#225;. Se 
expres&#243; grave preocupaci&#243;n por le hecho de que estas declaraciones podr&#237;an ser indicios de 
intentos de intimidaci&#243;n y acoso a los grupos o individuos que critican a los funcionarios y 
autoridades paname&#241;as, y que estas alegaciones podr&#237;a ser una forma de represalia por la 
participaci&#243;n de la sociedad civil en la audiencia ante la CIDH durante el mes de marzo de 
</p><p>2010. Se expres&#243; especial preocupaci&#243;n sobre las implicaciones de estas alegaciones en el 
ejercicio de la libertad de expresi&#243;n en Panam&#225;. Las alegaciones, de ser confirmadas, se 
enmarcan en un contexto de gran vulnerabilidad para los defensores de los derechos 
humanos en Panam&#225;. </p>

se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la 
detenci&#243;n y retenci&#243;n de documentos de identificaci&#243;n del Sr. <b>Francisco G&#243;mez Nadal</b>, as&#237; 
como por el supuesto acoso y hostigamiento del que ha sido v&#237;ctima. El Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal, 
de nacionalidad espa&#241;ola, trabaja como periodista y posee una trayectoria de varios a&#241;os 
como defensor de derechos humanos en Panam&#225;.  
</p>
<p>1772. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el 4 de julio de 2010, el Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal se 
dispon&#237;a a viajar, cuando fue detenido en el Aeropuerto de Tocumen en Panam&#225; en base a 
una orden del Servicio Nacional de Migraci&#243;n. Sin mediar ninguna explicaci&#243;n, le habr&#237;an 
retenido su c&#233;dula paname&#241;a y su pasaporte espa&#241;ol, lo que habr&#237;a dado lugar a la 
intervenci&#243;n de la Embajada de Espa&#241;a en Panam&#225;. 
</p>
<p>1773. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, varias razones habr&#237;an sido presentadas por 
las autoridades para justificar la detenci&#243;n del Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal y la retenci&#243;n de sus 
documentos, entre ellas: supuestas irregularidades fiscales; una variaci&#243;n de las condiciones 
por las que le fue concedida la residencia; y la supuesta falta de pago al Seguro Social. 
</p>
<p>1774. Seg&#250;n se tiene conocimiento, el Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal habr&#237;a presentado documentaci&#243;n 
que demostrar&#237;a como infundados los argumentos presentados por las autoridades 
paname&#241;as. Por el momento su situaci&#243;n ser&#237;a incierta ya que las autoridades de Migraci&#243;n 
en Panam&#225; no habr&#237;an dado a conocer formalmente los motivos de esta acci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>1775. Asimismo, se tiene informaci&#243;n que el Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal se present&#243; ante la 
Direcci&#243;n general de Ingresos en donde le pidieron la &#250;ltima declaraci&#243;n de la renta. Sin 
embargo, despu&#233;s de haberla presentado, se le habr&#237;a negado el &#8220;paz y salvo&#8221; ya que, seg&#250;n 
las autoridades, ten&#237;a una deuda de $114.00 desde el a&#241;o 2007. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n 
disponible, el Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal poseer&#237;a actualmente un cr&#233;dito fiscal de $2,000.00 y nunca 
antes habr&#237;a tenido problemas para extender el &#8220;paz y salvo&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1776. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el Sr. G&#243;mez Nadal interpuso un recurso de 
Habeas Corpus ante la Corte Suprema de Justicia, para establecer la raz&#243;n por la cual se 
habr&#237;a indicado en el Aeropuerto que podr&#237;a salir del pa&#237;s pero no retornar.

<p>1777. Se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones de que la situaci&#243;n en la que se 
encuentra el Sr. Francisco G&#243;mez Nadal pudiera estar relacionada con su labor period&#237;stica

cuerpos y fuerzas de seguridad del Estado paname&#241;o y trabajadores de las plantaciones 
bananeras, en su mayor parte miembros de la comunidad ind&#237;gena Ng&#228;be-Bugle.  Desde el 
2 de julio, estos trabajadores se encontraban realizando una huelga en contra de ciertos 
art&#237;culos de la reci&#233;n aprobada Ley 30 de 12 de junio de 2010.  Tras varios d&#237;as de huelga,

Palacio habr&#237;a reaparecido el d&#237;a 12 de agosto y presentado en conferencia de prensa por el 
Director de la Polic&#237;a Nacional.   
</p>
<p>1784. Seg&#250;n los informes recibidos, tras los sucesos de Bocas del Toro, se habr&#237;an 
intensificado los actos de intimidaci&#243;n y acoso por parte de la prensa nacional y de 
miembros de partidos pol&#237;ticos contra ciertos sectores de la sociedad civil paname&#241;a, as&#237; 
como contra destacados defensores de los derechos humanos en el pa&#237;s.

<p>dentro del sumario del caso del Sr. Palacio.  La Sra. Castillo habr&#237;a acudido a dicha citaci&#243;n 
pero se habr&#237;a negado a prestar declaraci&#243;n por considerar que el Fiscal Auxiliar de Panam&#225; 
mantiene una opini&#243;n negativa sobre la sociedad civil, la cual habr&#237;a hecho p&#250;blica en 
varias ocasiones mediante declaraciones a la prensa.   
</p>

desaparici&#243;n de Valent&#237;n Palacio&#8221;.  El anuncio habr&#237;a acusado a miembros de la oposici&#243;n 
pol&#237;tica as&#237; como a organizaciones de la sociedad civil paname&#241;a, mencionando 
expl&#237;citamente a la organizaci&#243;n Human Rights Everywhere, de realizar falsas acusaciones

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1804. On 8 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, sent an allegation letter concerning the recent killings of four 
journalists, Mr. <b>Desidario Camangyan</b>, Mr. <b>Joselito Agustin</b>, Mr. <b>Nestor Bedolido</b>, and 
Mr. <b>Jose Daguio</b>.  
</p>
<p>1805. According to information received, on 14 June 2010, Mr. Desidario Camangyan, 
radio journalist and host of a discussion programme on Sunshine FM, was killed while 
hosting a singing competition in Manay, Davao Oriental province. The gunman reportedly 
shot him  in the back of the head while the journalist was seated on stage before 
fleeing. Mr. Camangyan and his colleagues had criticized local politicians and those 
responsible for illegal logging for almost a month and had received threats. He had also 
campaigned for the incumbent mayor of Mati City, the provincial capital, in elections held 
in May. 
</p>
<p>1806. On 15 June 2010, Mr. Joselito Agustin, radio journalist of DZJC Aksyon Radyo, was 
riding a motorcycle with his nephew when he was shot four times by two men on another 
motorcycle in Laog City, Ilocos Norte province. He died in hospital the following day and 
his nephew was wounded. Mr. Agustin was reportedly known for his candid on-air 
commentaries against official corruption and had accused a politician of corruption in his 
programme. He had received death threats in the weeks before being killed. Gun shots were 
also allegedly fired at Mr. Agustin&#8217;s home on 7 May 2010. 
</p>
<p>1807. On 19 June 2010, Mr. Nestor Bedolido, reporter for The Kastigador weekly 
newspaper, was shot six times by two gunmen in Digos City, Davao del Sur province. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>256</b>  
</p>
<p>died on his way to hospital. He was known for his critical writing about an influential 
politician in Davao Del Sur. 
</p>
<p>1808. On 3 July 2010, Mr. Jose Daguio, former radio commentator and part-time 
columnist, was shot at close range inside his house in Barangtay Tuga City. While the 
possible motive may be linked to a dispute over a road project contract, it has been reported 
that the killing may have been related to his work as a former journalist. 
</p>
<p>1809. Concern was expressed that the killings of Mr. Desidario Camangyan, Mr. Joselito 
Agustin, and Mr. Nestor Bedolido in particular are related to their criticisms of public 
officials and their work in exposing corruption. Further concern was expressed regarding a 
climate of impunity in the Philippines as journalists continue to be targets of attacks and 
killings.

Upham, a witness in the trials related to the &#8220;Maguindanao Massacre&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1816. The mandate-holders had previously addressed the Government in relation to the 
&#8220;Maguindanao Massacre&#8221; in a letter dated 30 November 2009, to which the Government 
replied in communications dated 10 December 2009 and 25 January 2010. The Special 
Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions noted in a report submitted to the Human Rights 
Council that he appreciated the responses provided by the Government about the actions 
taken by various Government branches and agencies to investigate and prosecute the 
alleged perpetrators of the Maguindanao massacre. However, the Government did not 
provided the requested information about the private militia of the family of the Governor 
of Maguindanao Province, the measures taken to disband the militia, and the relationship 
between the private militia and government security forces in Maguindanao. Furthermore, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>the Government did not provide the requested information on measures to prevent election-
related violence ( A/HRC/14/24 Add.1).

gunman shot and killed Mr. Suwaib Upham, a witness to the Maguindanao killings, in 
Parang municipality, Maguindanao. Reports made available to me indicate that Mr Upham 
had agreed in February 2010, to testify against suspects arrested in connection with the 
&#8220;Maguindanao Massacre&#8221; on condition that he is provided with witness protection. Three 
months before he was killed, protection concerns regarding Mr. Upham were raised with 
the Justice Department officials in Manila, reportedly the department was still considering 
his request for protection at the time of his killing. 
</p>
<p>1818. Mr. Upham had allegedly been a militia member for the Ampatuans, whose family 
members have been arrested in connection with the &#8220;Maguindanao's massacre&#8221;. It is alleged 
that Mr. Upham knew the inner workings of the Ampatuans' militia operations, their 
sources of weapons, and the command structure of the police, military, and paramilitary 
forces in Maguindanao. He also knew details of past abuses perpetrated by the Ampatuans 
and their private army. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1819. In a letter dated 20 October 2010, the Government informed that, with regard to the 
killing of Mr. Suwaib Upham in Parang, Maguindanao on 14 June 2010, he is not included 
as one of the witnesses for the prosecution of the &#8220;Maguindanao Massacre&#8221; case. Neither 
was his name embodied in the list of possible witnesses submitted by the prosecution to the 
court during the preliminary conferences. According to the latest information from the 
Criminal Investigation and Detection Group of the Autonomous Region of Muslim 
Mindanao (CIDG-ARMM), the investigation is still on-going to ascertain the identity of 
Mr. Upham's assailant.  
</p>
<p>1820. As to the status of the ongoing investigation and prosecution of the Maguindanao 
Massacre case itself (i.e. People v. Andal Ampatuan, Jr., et-al. Criminal Case Nos. Q-09- 
162148 to 72; Q-09-162216 to 31; and Q-10-162654 to 66), please be informed that on 24 
March 2010, the court admitted the amended information against one hundred ninety-six 
(196) other accused, including Andal Ampatuan, Sr. Zaldy Ampatuan, Sajid Ampatuan, 
Saudi Ampatuan, Anwar Ampatuan, Akmad Ampatuan, other Ampatuan relatives, police 
officers and civilian auxiliaries involved in the Massacre. As of 28 July 2010, seventeen 
(17) out of the one hundred ninety-seven (197) accused have been arraigned. Preliminary 
conferences ensued on 4, 5 and 11 August 2010, wherein the prosecution manifested that it 
will present a total of two hundred twenty-seven (227) witnesses, while the defense said 
that it will present three hundred seventy-one (371) witnesses, more or less, for accused 
Ampatuan, Jr. On 17 August 2010, the pre-trial was terminated.  
</p>
<p>1821. Discussions are currently ongoing between the public and private prosecutors on 
how to efficiently synchronize the current evidence presented against Andal Ampatuan, Jr. 
with future evidence or witnesses to be presented against the 197 new accused. 
</p>
<p>1822. In another letter dated 18 October 2010, the Department of Justice reported that on 
29 September 2010, the prosecution presented its tenth witness, Norodin Mauyag, to testify 
on his observations in Sitio Masalay, Barangay Salman, Ampatuan from 20 to 23 November 
2009, and to identify the accused Ampatuans and members of the 1507 and 1508 Police

<p>1826. On 27 October 2010, a pre-trial conference was held and the names of the witnesses 
in the case were mentioned, including Mr. Manuel Bayles and Ms. Vilma Tejada. Later on 
the same day, at around 5.00 p.m., three army men dressed in military uniforms entered the 
house of Ms. Vilma Tejada at Sitio Pamandayan, Brgy, Buenavista, Himamaylan City. 
They woke her up and pointed the barrel of a high powered rifle (M16) at her. The soldiers 
interrogated Ms Tejada about the case of Mr. Bayles. They stayed at her house for 
approximately 30 minutes. On 4 November 2010, at around midnight, 12 armed men in 
military insignia entered the house of Ms. Tejada. They threatened that if she testified in the 
case she would be killed and attempted to take her with them but she refused.  
</p>
<p>1827. Mr. Manuel Bayles, who is a brother to the deceased and a complainant/witness in 
the case, has indicated that he is under military surveillance. He indicates that at least twice 
a week, two men riding a motorcycle, wearing army uniforms and helmets, have been seen 
stopping near his house. Army men had also been asking his neighbors about him. 
</p>
<p>1828. The mandate-holders were also informed that Mr. Benjamin Ramos, legal counsel 
for the Bayles family, is also under threat. Other witnesses in the Bayles case have also 
received death threats or are under military surveillance, as well as Mr. Larry Trinidad and 
Mr. Jaime Lim, two journalists who are linking the military to the killing. 
</p>
<p>1829. Information made available to the mandate-holders also indicates that there are 
concerns that the ballistic evidence in the case may have been tampered with.  
</p>
<p>1830. The mandate-holders welcomed the steps that the Government had undertaken to 
secure the arrest of the suspects related to the killing of Mr. Benjamin Bayles. While they 
did not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations reported to them, they expressed 
their concern with regard to the allegations that members of the Philippine Army are 
harassing and intimidating witnesses related to the case, as well as journalists reporting on 
the case, and that ballistic evidence might be tampered with.  
</p>
<p>1831. Response from the Government to a communication sent before the reporting period 
</p>
<p>1832. In a letter dated 26 May 2010, the Government responded to the letter dated 8 
October 2009 pertaining to the killings of Mr. Romulo Mendova and Father Cecilio Pelito 
Lucero from Northern Samar.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>259 
</b></p>
<p>1833. Information obtained from the Philippine National Police (PNP) revealed that the 
case of Mr. Romulo Mendova was already filed at the Provincial Prosecutors Office, Basey, 
Western Samar for the crime of murder docketed under NPSVITT-09b-INV-09L-00125 
against Rodrigo Rosas, alias &#8220;Decoy&#8221; and two (2) John Does last 04 December 2009. The 
case is presently undergoing preliminary investigation.  
</p>
<p>1834. On the killing of Father Cecilio Pelito Luccro, a case was already filed last 24 
November 2009 at the Provincial Prosecutors Office, Northern Samar for the crime of 
murder docketed under IS No. VIII-II-INV-09K-00205 against Gerry Espera y Domasig, 
alias Tiyok, alias Mark Tonok, and four (4) John Does. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1835. In a letter dated 22 March 2011, the Government submitted the following 
information from the Presidential Human Rights Committee of the Philippines based on 
investigations made by the Philippine National Police.  
</p>
<p>1836. A case of murder, Criminal Case No.2747 was filed against suspects on 5 July 2010 
at the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.  
</p>
<p>1837. On the alleged harassment and intimidation of mediaman Larry Trinidad and Jaime 
Lim, both denied that there was such harassment, threat or intimidation against them 
relative to the case of Bayles.  
</p>
<p>1838. Police are still determining the whereabouts of Wilma Tejada, one of the witnesses 
in the killing of Benjamin Bayles, as she reportedly has relocated her residence to a 
mountainous area in Barangay Tooy, Himamaylan City.  
</p>
<p>1839. On the alleged harassment by the 61st Infantry Batallion of the Philippine Army, the 
report revealed that the said battalion was not in the area at the time of the crime&#8217;s 
commission since it was transferred to another location in Panay Island in August 2010 
prior to the occurrence of the alleged harassment and intimidation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1840. On 29 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning the situation of Mr. <b>Christopher 
Solano, </b>Mr. <b>Althea Villagonzalo</b>, Mr. <b>Whelgester Paglinawan</b>, and Mr. <b>Manuel 
Bentillo</b>. Mr. Solano, Mr. Villagonzalo, Mr. Paglinawan, and Mr. Bentillo are volunteers 
with Alliance for the Advancement of People&#8217;s Rights (KARAPATAN), an alliance of 
individuals, groups and organisations working for the promotion and protection of human 
rights in the Philippines. The aforementioned human rights defenders are also members of 
the human rights monitoring team in Sta. Catalina, Negros Oriental.   
</p>
<p>1841. According to the information received, since 14 February 2011, Messrs Solano, 
Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, and Bentillo have been based in the municipality of Sta. Catalina 
where they have been documenting alleged human rights violations in militarised 
communities in the region. 
</p>
<p>1842. It is alleged that on 17 March 2011, Messrs Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, and 
Bentillo travelled to the village of Barangay Nagbinlod, Sta. Catalina, in Negros Oriental in 
order to observe and document human rights violations allegedly carried out by the security 
forces, against members of the local community. It is alleged that there was a clash between 
the security forces and the New People&#8217;s Army (NPA). 
</p>
<p>1843. According to the information received, a group of local farmers informed the 
aforementioned human rights defenders that Mr. Marvin Villegas, a local resident, had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>260</b>  
</p>
<p>allegedly been shot by members of the 1st Scout Rangers Battalion of the Army while he 
was taking the family&#8217;s cattle to the fields. It is reported that Messrs Solano, Villagonzalo, 
Paglinawan, and Bentillo along with local village residents were organising medical 
assistance for Mr. Villegas when members of the Alpha Company of the 79th Infantry 
Brigade of the Philippines Army approached them. It is reported that the aforementioned 
human rights defenders, along with the local residents were arrested, held by soldiers on the 
roadside and questioned. It is alleged that nine of the local residents were released, while 
the rest of the group, including the human rights defenders, was taken to a police station in 
the Sta. Catalina municipality.  
</p>
<p>1844. It is reported that while in detention, Messrs Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, and 
Bentillo were accused by soldiers of being members of the New People&#8217;s Army. It was later 
alleged that Mr. Villegas and his mother were taken away by soldiers to Dumaguete City.        
</p>
<p>1845. Concern was expressed that Messrs Solano, Villagonzalo, Paglinawan, and Bentillo 
were arrested and detained by members of the security forces while attempting to seek 
medical assistance for a villager who had allegedly been shot by the security forces. Further 
concern was expressed that, considering the aforementioned human rights defenders were 
arrested during the course of their work, their arrests and detention may be linked to their 
legitimate human rights work, in particular the documentation of alleged human rights 
violations carried out by the security forces. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1846. In a letter dated 6 April 2011, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
communication sent on 29 March 2011 and informed that the communication has been 
forwarded to concerned authorities in the Philippines and will advise the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights as soon as information is received.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1847. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its responses to the 
communications sent during the reporting period, and looks forward to receiving a 
substantive reply to the communication sent on 29 March 2011, and to an earlier 
communication sent on 13 July 2009.  
</p>
<p>1848. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned regarding the persistent 
challenges faced by journalists and human rights defenders in the Philippines, including 
extrajudicial killing, threats and intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention, and illegitimate 
restrictions to the right of freedoms of opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and 
association. He urges the Government of the Philippines to conduct thorough investigations 
in each case and prosecute the perpetrators. This is crucial in order to create a safe 
environment conducive to the work of journalists and human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b>  Qatar 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1849. On 11 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the detention by State 
Security of Mr. <b>Sultan al-Khalaifi</b> and other human rights defenders who have allegedly 
been arrested and detained in the past few days. Mr. Sultan al-Khalaifi is a blogger and 
founder of a human rights organization which campaigns primarily on cases of detention in 
the State of Qatar and is registered in Switzerland. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>261 
</b></p>
<p>1850. According to information received, in the evening of 2 March 2011, Mr. Sultan al-
Khalaifi was allegedly arrested as he was leaving his parents&#8217; home in Doha by around 
eight individuals in plain clothes, believed to be members of State Security forces. He was 
reportedly taken to his own home, which they searched for approximately three hours, 
during which they seized CDs and a laptop. His family car was also searched. Mr. Sultan 
al-Khalaifi was then allegedly taken by force by these individuals, and his current fate and 
whereabouts are unknown, although it is believed that he is being held in the custody of 
State Security. Mr. Sultan al-Khalaifi had reportedly informed his wife earlier that day that 
State Security officials had contacted him, asking him to report to them, but that he did not 
know why. His latest blog entry reportedly contained critical comments regarding 
censorship of books in the State of Qatar.  
</p>
<p>1851. Additionally, other human rights defenders have also been allegedly arrested and 
detained recently in the State of Qatar.  
</p>
<p>1852. Concerns were expressed that Mr. Sultan al-Khalaifi&#8217;s detention by State Security 
places him at increased risk of torture or other ill-treatment, and that he has been detained 
as a result of his legitimate work as a blogger and human rights defender, and for exercising 
his right to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern was expressed regarding 
the reports that other human rights defenders have also been detained in recent days.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1853. In a letter dated 29 March 2011, the Government assured the Special Rapporteurs 
that it considers the communication sent on 11 March 2011 seriously, and that it will 
respond as soon as relevant information and data is received from the competent 
authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1854. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the acknowledgement of receipt 
of his communication sent on 11 March 2011 and looks forward to receiving a substantive 
reply as soon as possible addressing his concerns.  
</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1855. On 1 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent an  allegation letter concerning <b>threats and 
investigations initiated against the staff of the People&#8217;s Solidarity for Participatory 
Democracy (PSPD)</b>, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the 
United Nations Economic and Social Council.  
</p>
<p>1856. According to information received, on 11 June 2010, the PSPD transmitted an open-
letter, together with its 27-page report, to the Permanent Missions of the 15 Member States 
of the United Nations Security Council in New York. The report questioned the results of 
the investigation by the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group (JIG), which concluded 
that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was responsible for launching a 
torpedo attack against the Republic of Korea&#8217;s  &#8220;Cheonan&#8221; naval vessel on 26 March 
2010 that killed 46 navy personnel. The report also urged the Governments of the 
Republic of Korea and the DPRK to refrain from any provocative action which may 
threaten the peace on the Korean peninsula, and requested the Government of the Republic 
of Korea to re-investigate the incident and to disclose all available information to the 
public.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>262</b>  
</p>
<p>1857. Since 14 June 2010, a number of statements have allegedly been made by high-level 
Government officials, including the President, the Prime Minister, and the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade, which have depicted the PSPD as hindering the Government&#8217;s 
diplomatic efforts to push for action by the Security  Council to hold the DPRK 
accountable for the incident. Such statements have allegedly incited members of the public 
to verbally and physically attack the  PSPD and its staff, including threatening 
telephone calls and throwing of gas canisters and eggs at the building in which the PSPD 
office is located.  
</p>
<p>1858. On 16 June 2010, the Seoul Central District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office reportedly initiated 
an investigation on the PSPD on charges of benefitting the enemy (the DPRK) in violation 
of the National Security Law, defaming the members of the JIG by spreading false 
information, and interfering in the official duties of the Government&#8217;s diplomatic affairs. It 
has also been reported that Mr. Lee Tae-ho and Mr. Ko Gap-woo, PSPD staff who were 
involved in the compilation and submission of the letter and report to the Security Council 
Member States, are to be summoned for further investigation. 
</p>
<p>1859. Concern was expressed that the threats against and investigations of the PSPD staff 
are related to the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
which includes the right to impart information and ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1860. In a letter dated 15 September 2010, the Government informed that it is untrue that 
the Prosecutor's Office (hereinafter &#8220;P0&#8221;) initiated an investigation as to whether the act of 
sending a letter to the United Nations Security Council by the People's Solidarity for 
Participatory Democracy (hereinafter &#8220;PSPD&#8221;) can constitute a crime of benefiting the 
enemy, defamation, or obstruction of public duties. The PO is/conducting a preliminary 
inquiry, not a criminal investigation, pursuant to its receipt of a petition requesting an 
investigation of the PSPD activists, as is further explained below. Additionally, it is 
baseless and presumptuous to allege that the comments made by high-level government 
officials on the PSPD's decision to send a letter to the UN Security Council have provoked 
verbal and physical attacks by conservative groups against the PSPD.  
</p>
<p>1861. On 11 June 2010, several civic organizations including RIGHT KOREA lodged a 
petition with the PO demanding that the PSPD be prosecuted for sending a letter to the 15 
members of the United Nations Security Council in which it questioned the results of the 
investigation by the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group (JIG) of the sinking of the 
naval vessel Cheonan. The PO thereafter initiated a preliminary inquiry in accordance with 
Section 141(1) of the Regulation of Prosecutorial Affairs (Regulation of the Ministry of 
Justice). Currently, the PO is conducting a review of the case to determine whether or not 
the facts alleged in the petition are accurate and whether the petition has legal merit. If the 
review results in an affirmative answer on both counts, the PO will launch a criminal 
investigation in accordance with the Regulation of Prosecutorial Affairs, Section 143. 
Otherwise, the PO will discontinue the preliminary inquiry. Thus far, no competent Korean 
governmental authority has expressed its opinion on whether or not the government will 
prosecute the PSPD and whether or not the PSPD violated the law.  
</p>
<p>1862. Upon the PSPD&#8217;s request, police officers were deployed to protect the PSPD during 
the civic group demonstrations that took place around the PSPD building from 15 to 18 
June 2010. Moreover, a team of 5 officers remained to protect the PSPD&#8217;s staff and its 
facility for an additional 3 weeks. Additionally, the police referred this case to the PO on 22 
July for a decision on whether the demonstrations by 5 civic groups that took place from 15 
to 18 June in front of the PSPD&#8217;s building constitute a violation of the Assembly and 
Demonstration Act. The police are also currently working to identify a person suspected of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>263 
</b></p>
<p>engaging in violence against the PSPD staff and its facilities. Once the suspect's identity is 
verified, he will be charged in accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1863. On 23 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, sent an allegation letter 
concerning the situation of Messrs <b>Rae-gun Park</b> and <b>Jong-hoe Lee</b>, activists of Justice 
for Yongsan Evictees. 
</p>
<p>1864. According to the information received, on 24 January 2011, Mr. Rae-gun Park and 
Mr. Jong-hoe Lee received a three-year and one month jail sentence, and a two-year jail 
sentence respectively for their roles in creating a campaign calling for justice and 
reparations for the families of those who died in what became known as the Yongsan Fire 
Incident. However, both sentences are put on hold for four years and three years 
respectively, and an appeal is currently pending. 
</p>
<p>1865.   As background to this sentence, in order to protest against forced eviction from a 
building scheduled for demolition as part of &#8220;New Town&#8221; re-development project of the 
City of Seoul, a group of people had barricaded themselves in the building. On 20 January 
2009, the police then attempted to forcibly evict protesters from the building in question. 
During the eviction, a fire broke out and took the lives of five protestors and a police 
personal.  
</p>
<p>1866. Following the incident, Mr. Park, Mr. Lee and other activists allegedly accused the 
police for the incident, as they believed that the death and injuries were predictable at the 
time of eviction, given that the police reportedly did not take any precautionary measures.  
</p>
<p>1867. Mr. Park and Mr. Lee, along with other activists, publicly demanded an official 
apology, adequate compensation to victims and a thorough and impartial investigation into 
events that claimed six lives.  
</p>
<p>1868. In addition, according to the information received, Messrs Park and Lee, are also 
convicted for violation of the Assembly and Demonstration Act as well as general 
obstruction of traffic ordinance, following a series of assemblies which were carried on 
without police permission for about two months from 23 January 2009 to 7 March 2009. 
They had submitted the required notification to the responsible police station for holding an 
assembly, but it was turned down five times by the police. They are currently waiting 
further sentencing, pending a second trial.  
</p>
<p>1869. Concerns were expressed that the aforementioned sentencing of Messrs Park and 
Lee may be related to their human rights activities, in the exercise of their right to freedom 
of opinion and expression. Further concerns were expressed concerning their conviction for 
violation of the Assembly and Demonstration Act. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1870. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the reply to his communication 
of 1 July 2010, but regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the Government 
had not transmitted a reply to his communications sent on 23 March 2011.He urges the 
Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information 
regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective 
measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1871. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his appreciation to the Government of the 
Republic of Korea for the invitation to undertake a mission in May 2010, and looks forward 
to the implementation of his recommendations contained in A/HRC/17/27/Add.2.   </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1872. On 24 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. <b>Ion Guzun</b>, 
project coordinator with the Moldovan Institute for Human Rights (IDOM) and other 
members of <b>IDOM</b>. IDOM is one of the foremost non-governmental human rights 
organizations in Moldova. It was very active in documenting abuses in the April 2009 
events, and presented detailed evidence in this regard to the UN Committee Against Torture 
in November 2009. He has been among the groups pressing most strongly for 
accountability for members of the previous Government involved in human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>1873. According to the information received, on 30 August 2010, Mr. Ion Guzun received 
a threatening text message on his mobile phone with the following message: &#8220;don&#8217;t try to 
climb too high, you will fall down and&#8230;&#8221;. On 1 September 2010, Mr. Guzun filed a 
complaint regarding these threats with the General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and with the 
Intelligence and Security Services (SIS).  
</p>
<p>1874. In April 2010, the website of IDOM was hacked twice and threatening messages 
were posted on it.  
</p>
<p>1875. It is believed that the recent threats received by Mr. Guzun, as well as the hacking of 
the website of IDOM may be related to the organization&#8217;s activities in seeking 
accountability for members of the previous Government involved in human rights abuses 
related to the April 2009 events, as well as IDOM&#8217;s motion before the Chisinau Court of 
Appeal to cancel the decision of the Supreme Council of Magistracy dismissing the 
Chairman of the Supreme Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p>1876. Concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Ion 
Guzun and other staff members of IDOM.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1877. In a letter dated 22 November 2010, the Government indicated that in order to 
clarify the case and its circumstances brought to the Moldovan Government's attention by 
the Special Rapporteurs, appropriate requests were sent to the national competent 
authorities.  
</p>
<p>1878. In fact, with the reference to complaint of Mr. Ion Guam and other staff members of 
IDOM&#8222; the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova confirmed the 
reception of three complaints from 7 and 19 April 2010 and from 1 September 2010, 
investigated the allegations exposed in these complaints and, accordingly to the legal 
procedures and the functional competences, the case was sent to the Ministry of Domestic 
Affairs with, respective information of the IDOM.  
</p>
<p>1879. On 2 September 2010, the petitioner submitted to the Office of the General 
Prosecutor a similar request about receiving threats on the mobile. The allegations were 
investigated in accordance with the provisions of the Penal Procedure Code (PPC) of the 
Republic of Moldova. Following the investigations of the allegations was established that 
the real facts do not meet the elements of an infringement. In this context, on 15 September 
2010, according to the article 275 (3) PPC RM was emitted an ordinance on refusing to 
open a criminal file. 
</p>
<p>1880. On the basis of the mentioned above ordinance the Office of the General Prosecutor, 
as well as the Ministry of Domestic Affairs did not start another investigation procedure. 
Mr. Ion Guzun and other staff members of IDOM were informed about the refusal to open a 
criminal file.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>265 
</b></p>
<p>1881. At the same time, the competent authorities reaffirmed the necessity to make efforts, 
including legislative measures, in order to exclude similar situations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1882. On 22 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
persons, especially women and children, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
<b>Ms. Alina Radu</b>, an award-winning investigative journalist and director of the independent 
investigative newspaper <i>Ziarul de Garda</i> (<i>The Guard</i> newspaper). Ms. Radu is a member of 
the board of the International Association for Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT), 
the Moldovan Association of Independent TV Journalists and the South East European 
Media Organisation. Over the past few years, Ms. Radu has been investigating various 
affairs in the fields of corruption, human trafficking, smuggling and human rights abuses in 
Moldova. 
</p>
<p>1883. According to the information received, on 18 September 2010, a prosecuting officer 
of the Chisinau Police contacted Ms. Alina Radu in order to inform her that a request for 
prosecution against her was submitted. Reportedly, the request had been submitted by an 
individual whose name was revealed by Ms. Radu in a series of newspaper articles entitled 
&#8220;Jail in the brothel&#8221; as a person accused of trafficking 17 young women.  
</p>
<p>1884. According to the information received, on 21 September 2010, Ms. Radu received a 
summons informing her that she should go to the Criminal Investigation Department for a 
hearing concerning the complaint filed against her. Reportedly, on 24 September 2010, Ms. 
Radu and her lawyer Mr. Victor Pantaru, went to the Criminal Investigation department 
where Ms. Radu was interrogated. She was told by police that a criminal file against her 
would be opened.  
</p>
<p>1885. It has been reported that over the past few months, Ms. Radu has been receiving 
threats, including death threats, from people accused of trafficking in human beings.  
</p>
<p>1886. Concern was expressed that the threats and actual complaint filed against Ms. Alina 
Radu might be connected to her legitimate activities as an investigative journalist and 
human rights defender, in particular with her work documenting instances of human 
trafficking in the country.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1887. In a letter dated 3 January 2011, the Government informed that the Police Station of 
the Centre Sector of the Chisinau Municipality registered the claim of Mr. Victor 
Sorocovici who, in accordance with article 170 of the Criminal Code (Slander), submitted a 
complaint against Ms. Alina Radu, the author of a Series of newspaper articles entitled &quot;Jail 
in the brothel&quot;.  
</p>
<p>1888. At the same time, Mr. Sorocovici sent a similar complaint to the lawyer and a close 
relative of Ms. Radu. 
</p>
<p>1889. Following investigations in the case, Mr. Sorocovici was charged with human 
trafficking related to the recruitment, transportation and concealment of a person for 
commercial sexual exploitation, committed by deception (art. 165 Criminal Code), and he 
is wanted at the national and international levels.  
</p>
<p>1890. The investigation of the claim made against Ms. Radii established that the real facts 
do not meet the elements of a crime, and therefore an ordinance on non-initiating a criminal 
investigation was issued. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>266</b>  
</p>
<p>1891. The file was also sent to the Prosecutor Office of the Municipality of Chisinau 
which, in accordance with the art. 275(1) of the Criminal Code, refused to initiate a 
criminal investigation.  
</p>
<p>1892. Due to the fact that art. 170 Criminal Code (Slander) was abrogated, but is still a 
contravention (art. 70 Contravention Code), the police office was obliged to examine the 
complaint. Therefore the summons of Ms. Alina Radu was in compliance with legal 
provisions. In addition, Ms. Alina Raclu did not send a complaint to national legal 
authorities about the threats, including death threats, that she received from people accused 
of trafficking human beings.  
</p>
<p>1893. The legal authorities continue to investigate the cases, which have been noticed by 
Ms. Radu, in order to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators in accordance with the 
appropriate national laws. 
</p>
<p><b>  Responses received to communications sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>1894. In a letter dated 29 June 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent 
earlier on 22 December 2009 regarding Ms.<b> Tatiana Etco</b> and Mr. <b>Victor Mosneag</b>, 
journalists working at the weekly newspaper &#8220;<i>Ziarul de Garda (ZDG)</i>&#8221;, as follows. 
</p>
<p>1895. The competent authorities of the Republic of Moldova have been examining the case 
regarding the journalists working at the weekly newspaper &#8220;Ziarul de Garda&#8221; (ZDG), 
nominally Mrs. Tatiana Etco and Mr. Victor Mosneag. In the period of 26 November &#8211; 10 
December 2009 the above mentioned journalists published a series of articles entitled 
&#8220;Train of corruption from railway station Chisinau&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>1896. After those publications Mrs. Tatiana Etco and Mr. Victor Mosneag deposited a 
complaint which has been registered on 20 January 2010. In this context, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs started to verify all the circumstances indicated by the journalists, 
inclusively oriented for the insurance of their security and identification of the persons 
which was placing the information on the Internet.  
</p>
<p>1897. At the same time, the investigations has taken into account the national and 
international legislation, as well as Article 10 of the European Convention for the 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and Article 32 of the Constitution of 
the Republic of Moldova, according to which all citizens are guaranteed the freedom of 
opinion, as well as the freedom of publicly expressing their thoughts and opinions by any 
way of word, image or any other means possible.  
</p>
<p>1898. After the investigative measures, suspected persons weren&#8217;t identified, and the 
necessary information according to the stipulations of the Criminal Procedure Code has 
been sent to Prosecutor Office of the Central sector, mun Chisinau.  
</p>
<p>1899. In this regard, Prosecutor Office has delivered a decision/ordinance with the refuse 
to initiate a criminal pursuance, in the base of the fact that electronic messages, formally, 
doesn&#8217;t contain direct threat which will present real risk, and respectively absence of the 
constitutive elements of the offence components (article 155 Criminal Code of the Republic 
of Moldova &#8211; threatening murder or severe bodily injury or damage to health).  
</p>
<p>1900. Nevertheless, the Moldovan authorities remain fully confident on the 
implementation of the international commitments assumed in the field of protection of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of opinion and expression.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1901. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply.  </p>

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1902. On 3 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations concerning the safety of 
<b>Mr. Magomed Hanmagomedov</b>, investigative journalist working for Chernovik weekly 
newspaper in Dagestan.  
</p>
<p>1903. According to information received, on 9 July 2010, Mr. Magomed Hanmagomedov 
published an article regarding an operation by law enforcement officials of Dagestan which 
took place in the town of Derbent on 16 June 2010, during which four suspected armed 
fighters were killed. In his article, Mr. Magomed Hanmagomedov questioned the official 
version of the event provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which claimed that the 
four men in the car refused to stop and opened fire at the police. Instead, he suggested that 
the men in the car were led into an ambush and gunned down, and that individuals other 
than the suspected fighters may also have been present in the car. He also noted in his 
article that two of the names of the individuals killed were initially reported wrongly by the 
police.  
</p>
<p>1904. Alongside his article, Mr. Magomed Hanmagomedov posted a video clip on the 
newspaper&#8217;s website, which was allegedly recorded on a mobile phone by law enforcement 
officials during the operation. The video captures a voice pleading not to shoot, followed by 
a number of shots, after which the voice ceases.  
</p>
<p>1905. Following the publication of his article and the video clip, Mr. Magomed 
Hanmagomedov has allegedly received phone calls from law enforcement officials 
expressing indignation at his article, and a number of text messages from unknown 
numbers alleging that he is receiving funds from abroad and working for militants. It has 
also been reported that the local prosecutor&#8217;s office may be preparing a criminal case 
against Mr. Magomed Hanmagomedov.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1906. In a letter dated 20 December 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 3 August 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1907. According to available information, internal affairs agency officers attempted to stop 
a passenger vehicle in Derbent, Republic of Dagestan, in the course of investigative work 
there on 16 June 2010. In response, unidentified persons in the vehicle opened fire with the 
intent to kill. Five militia officers sustained gunshot wounds of varying severity as a result. 
Four criminals were killed in the exchange of fire. 
</p>
<p>1908. The Derbent interdistrict investigating agency of the investigation department for the 
Republic of Dagestan, a unit of the Investigative Committee attached to the Office of the 
Procurator of the Russian Federation, initiated criminal proceedings on 16 June 2010 in 
connection with this incident for offences under article 317 (attempt on the life of a law 
enforcement officer) and article 222, paragraphs 1 and 2 (unlawful acquisition, transfer, 
sale, storage, transport or carriage of weapons), of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>1909. The preliminary investigation established that the persons killed in the exchange of 
fire were members or accomplices of unlawful armed groups. 
</p>
<p>1910. Mr. Hanmagomedov&#8217;s account in Chernovik of the killing of civilians during the 
events of 16 June 2010, published on 9 July 2010, is not borne out by the facts.  Mr. 
Hanmagomedov was not interrogated during the investigation of this matter, nor were any 
criminal proceedings brought against him. No complaints about him being persecuted or 
appeals for safety measures to be taken were received. The allegation concerning a criminal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>268</b>  
</p>
<p>prosecution of Mr. Hanmagomedov in connection with the above-mentioned publication is 
groundless. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1911. On 19 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegations regarding the situation of 
<b>Mr. Aleksei Sokolov.</b> Mr Sokolov is the Head of &#8220;Pravovaya Osnova&#8221; (Legal Basis), an 
organization which campaigns against torture and other ill-treatment of people held in the 
Russian Federation&#8217;s places of detention, and a member of the civic supervisory committee 
on places of detention appointed by the Russian Federation Parliament.   
</p>
<p>1912. Mr. Sokolov has been in detention since May 2009 facing various charges and 
different judicial processes. Mr. Sokolov was the subject of a communication sent to the 
Government on 25 August 2009 by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The Special Rapporteurs acknowledged the reply received from the 
Government on 19 November 2009. 
</p>
<p>1913. According to the information received, on 18 August 2010, Mr. Sokolov was 
sentenced on appeal by the Regional Court of Sverdlovsk to three years&#8217; imprisonment in a 
high security colony. He will serve one year and a half, due to his previous detention on 
remand. Reportedly, Mr. Sokolov intends to lodge a second appeal. According to the 
information received, the documents manually drafted by Mr. Sokolov in preparation of the 
discussions with his lawyer have been consistently confiscated by the prison guards, 
therefore obstructing his right to defend himself.   
</p>
<p>1914. Mr. Sokolov was originally arrested on 13 May 2009 in relation to a robbery in 
</p><p>2004. On 14 May 2009, the Verkh-Isetsky court in Yekaterinburg authorized Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s 
arrest for a period of ten days. However, he was subsequently held in detention until 31 
July 2009 when the court ruled to overturn the decision to remand him in custody. New 
charges of robbery under Article 162, Part 4 of the Criminal Code were filed on 31 July 
2009, the same day that Mr. Sokolov was released from detention by the Sverdlovsk 
regional court. On 13 May 2010, Sverdlovsk regional court found Mr. Sokolov guilty of the 
robbery and he was sentenced to five years in prison. On 18 August 2010, during the first 
court appeal, Mr. Sokolov's had his sentence reduced from five to three years.  
</p>
<p>1915. On 25 August 2010, the family and legal representatives of Mr. Sokolov were 
informed that, at the decision of the Russian Prison Service, he had been transferred from 
Yekaterinburg to Krasnoyarsk, more than 2,000 kilometers away from where his family 
lives. Moreover, allegations received indicate that Mr. Sokolov was beaten by the police 
during the transfer from Yekaterinburg to Krasnoyarsk while he was detained at the FGU 
IZ-54/1 Remand Center in Novisibirsk (Western Siberia). Reportedly, on 30 August 2010, 
the Prosecutor's office confirmed the illegal use of physical force against Mr. Sokolov 
confirming the use of a special device &#8220;PR-73 (baton)&#8221; by the prison authorities on Mr. 
Sokolov. This transfer will make it more difficult for Mr. Sokolov to communicate with his 
family and lawyers.   
</p>
<p>1916. According to the reports received, since January 2010, Mr. Sokolov has suffered 
repeated attacks by his cell mates. On 17 January 2010, at the Kamychlov detention centre, 
Mr. Sokolov was assaulted by his cell mate who threw boiling water at him before 
attacking him. Officials reportedly witnessed the scene without intervening. One of them </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>269 
</b></p>
<p>finally entered the cell, and shouted to his colleagues: &#8220;Sokolov attacked a co-detainee and 
is beating another one&#8221;. Following this assault, on 18 January 2010, Mr. Alexei Sokolov 
was reportedly transferred to the Soukhoi Log detention centre, where he was assaulted by 
his new cell mate, who hit him in the jaw and threatened him as follows: &#8220;We already 
warned you but you still don't understand&#8221;. This cell mate is allegedly one of those 
responsible for the re-opening of the investigation against Mr. Sokolov on 23 April 2009. 
The various petitions for provisional release of Mr. Sokolov lodged throughout the process 
have been reportedly rejected by the court. 
</p>
<p>1917. Concern was expressed about the physical and mental integrity of Mr. Sokolov and 
about allegations indicating that his situation and the various judicial processes against him 
may be related to his activities as a human rights defender, more specifically his work 
against torture and ill-treatment including monitoring places of detention. Serious concern 
was expressed about the allegations received indicating that Mr. Sokolov was beaten by 
prison guards at the Novisibirsk Remand Center during his transfer to the Krasnoyarsk 
region. Moreover, concern is also expressed about allegations that Mr. Sokolov has been 
subjected to acts of violence and harassment by various cell mates and that the respective 
prison officials did not intervene. Finally, concern was expressed about information 
received indicating that Mr. Sokolov will serve his sentence in the Krasnoyarsk region of 
Siberia, more than 2,000 kilometers away from Yekaterineburg, where his family lives. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1918. In a letter dated 21 February 2011, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 19 October 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1919. Mr. Sokolov was sentenced by the Bogdanovich City Court of Sverdlovsk province 
on 13 May 2010 to 5 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty to be served in a strict regime 
correctional colony under article 158 (Theft), paragraph 3 (c), article 161 (Robbery), 
paragraph 3 (a), and article 69 (Sentencing for multiple offences), paragraph 3, of the 
Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. The sentence against Mr. Sokolov was commuted 
on 18 August 2010 to 3 years&#8217; deprivation of liberty, to be served in a strict regime colony, 
by decision of the Sverdlovsk provincial court criminal chamber, whereby he was 
sentenced under article 158, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, with the application of 
article 64, article 161, paragraphs 2 (a), 2 (c), 2 (d) and 2 (e), and article 69, paragraph 3, of 
the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>1920. The sentence took legal effect. Mr. Sokolov did not appeal his sentence. As the case 
file shows, Mr. Sokolov was convicted of acts unrelated to human rights work. 
</p>
<p>1921. Mr. Sokolov was detained during the preliminary investigation and judicial 
proceedings in remand centres FBU IZ No. 66/1 and FBU IZ No. 66/4 of the Central 
Department of the Federal Penal Correction Service for Sverdlovsk province. 
</p>
<p>1922. Between 17 and 18 January 2010, when Mr. Sokolov was in remand centre No. 
66/4, he had clashes with accused persons A.E. Golovin and E.G. Belyash because of 
personal differences, in the course of which Mr. Sokolov sustained bodily injuries that did 
not endanger his health. 
</p>
<p>1923. The internal affairs office for the Kamyshlov municipal area of Sverdlovsk province 
held an inquiry into the case in accordance with articles 144 and 145 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation and decided to take no further action on the 
basis of article 24, paragraph 1 (2), of the Code. Mr. Sokolov did not appeal against these 
decisions. 
</p>
<p>1924. Meanwhile, the procurator&#8217;s office of Sverdlovsk province issued a procuratorial 
recommendation to the head of the Central Department of the Federal Penal Correction </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>270</b>  
</p>
<p>Service for Sverdlovsk province. Pursuant to a review of the recommendation, officials of 
the institution, including the head of remand centre No. 66/4, were prosecuted for 
professional misconduct. 
</p>
<p>1925. No evidence was found of a violation of Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s right to submit proposals, 
applications and complaints during his detention in the remand centres of the Central 
Department of the Federal Penal Correction Service. Mr. Sokolov had the opportunity to 
file complaints with the authorities, the procurator&#8217;s office and the court and was able to do 
so. His applications were received by the administration of the remand centres without 
hindrance and sent on to the addressees. Nor was evidence obtained in the course of 
inquiries held of the confiscation from him of documents or notes pertaining to the criminal 
case. No violation of any kind was established of Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s right to meet with a lawyer 
or other persons for legal assistance. 
</p>
<p>1926. Indeed, Mr. Sokolov met with his defence counsels and lawyers on 126 occasions 
between 14 August 2009 and 20 August 2010. Furthermore, between 6 October 2009 and 
22 November 2010, he himself personally drafted and sent 20 letters to various authorities, 
including the Human Rights Commissioner of Sverdlovsk province, the Public Monitoring 
Commission of Sverdlovsk province, the procurator&#8217;s office responsible for monitoring 
compliance with the law in correctional institutions and various judicial bodies. 
</p>
<p>1927. The Office of the Procurator-General held an inquiry into Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s situation in 
April 2010, including a visit to Sverdlovsk province, in response to a letter submitted by the 
Moscow Helsinki Group Chairperson Mr. L.M. Alekseev. Mr. Sokolov explained in a 
statement that he did not have a complaint about the detention conditions in remand centres 
No. 66/1 or No. 66/4. 
</p>
<p>1928. On the basis of a court judgement and by order of the Russian Federal Penal 
Correction Service, Mr. Sokolov was transferred from the Central Department of the 
Federal Penal Correction Service for Sverdlovsk province on 25 August 2010 in order to 
ensure his personal safety, in accordance with article 81 of the Penal Enforcement Code, to 
serve his sentence of deprivation of liberty at the Central Department in Krasnoyarsk 
territory. The inquiry indicated that Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s life might be threatened, and it was not 
possible to ensure the prisoner&#8217;s safety without transferring him to a correctional institution 
in another region. 
</p>
<p>1929. Mr. Sokolov arrived at remand centre FBU IZ No. 54/1 of the Central Department of 
the Federal Penal Correction Service for Novosibirsk province on 27 August 2010, for 
subsequent transfer to the Central Department of the Service for Krasnoyarsk territory, 
where he was put in a one-person cell to protect his life and health. On 30 August 2010, 
during the daily rounds of the institution, Mr. Sokolov refused to comply with the 
legitimate demands of the officers at remand centre No. 54/1 that he leave his cell for a 
search of his person; he insulted officials with obscene and abusive language and physically 
resisted them. In these circumstances, force was used against the prisoner to suppress his 
unlawful actions. 
</p>
<p>1930. An inquiry into the use of force was conducted by the Dzerzhinsky interdistrict 
investigating agency, a unit of the investigation department for Novosibirsk province 
working under the Investigative Committee attached to the Office of the Procurator of the 
Russian Federation. The outcome of the inquiry established that an officer of remand centre 
No. 54/1 of the Central Department of the Federal Penal Correction Service for Novosibirsk 
province used force against Mr. Sokolov in accordance with the law of the Russian 
Federation. A decision not to prosecute the officer was taken in this case on the basis of 
article 24, paragraph 1 (2), of the Code of Criminal Procedure for lack of evidence of an 
offence under article 286 (Exceeding official authority), paragraph 3 (a). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>271 
</b></p>
<p>1931. A medical examination performed on Mr. Sokolov when he entered remand centre 
No. 24/1 of the Central Department of the Federal Penal Correction Service for 
Krasnoyarsk territory on 5 September 2010 revealed that he had sustained bodily injury in 
the circumstances described above at the remand centre in Novosibirsk. 
</p>
<p>1932. The administration of remand centre No. 24/1 sent evidence of the bodily injury 
sustained by Mr. Sokolov to the director of remand centre No. 54/1, in Novosibirsk, for 
decision. The fact that this was done in violation of the legislation on criminal procedure 
prompted the procurator&#8217;s office of Krasnoyarsk territory to take action, ordering the 
director of remand centre No. 24/1 to desist from activity not in compliance with the law. 
</p>
<p>1933. No unlawful coercive measures or special restraining devices were used while Mr. 
Sokolov was in institutions of the Krasnoyarsk territory correctional system. 
</p>
<p>1934. Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s conditions of detention in these institutions are in compliance with 
the penal enforcement legislation of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p>1935. The Russian Federation notes that a review of Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s situation does not fall 
under the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, or the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. In fact, Mr. Sokolov was 
convicted on criminal charges, entirely unrelated to human rights work, of theft and 
robbery; no evidence was found in this case of a violation of Mr. Sokolov&#8217;s right to freely 
express his opinion. Mr. Sokolov was detained in accordance with the law on the basis of 
evidence and testimony. Therefore, this case is in no way a matter of arbitrary detention. 
The Russian Federation calls on the special procedures in question to review information 
submitted to them carefully and, in future, to follow more closely the Code of Conduct for 
Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Human Rights Council, and specifically article 
3, subparagraph (a) and (d). 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1936. On 3 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal concerning the ongoing judicial harassment of 
<b>Mr. Oleg Orlov</b>, Chairman of human rights organisation Memorial. Mr. Orlov was the 
subject of an allegation letter sent by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on the situation of human rights defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, and Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression on 29 November 2007. Mr. Orlov was awarded the European 
Parliament&#8217;s Sakharov Prize on 16 December 2009.  
</p>
<p>1937. According to the information received, Mr. Oleg Orlov has been subjected to 
ongoing criminal proceedings and judicial harassment following remarks he made 
concerning the President of the Chechen Republic, Mr. Ramzan Kadyrov, in July of 2009.  
</p>
<p>1938. On 6 October 2009, the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow found Mr. Orlov guilty 
of libel, following the publication of a statement in which Mr. Orlov indicated his belief 
that Mr. Kadyrov or his administration was responsible for the murder of Ms. Natalia 
Estemirova, the head of Memorial&#8217;s office in Grozny, on 15 July 2009. Mr. Kadyrov 
subsequently lodged an administrative complaint against Mr. Orlov, claiming that the 
statement had damaged the &#8220;honour and dignity&#8221; of the President of the Chechen Republic, 
and demanding ten million rubles in damages. Having been found guilty, it is reported that 
Mr. Orlov was ordered to retract the statement and pay a personal fine of 20,000 rubles. 
Memorial was also ordered to pay a fine of 50,000 rubles. The sentence was upheld on 
appeal by Moscow City Court on 21 January 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>272</b>  
</p>
<p>1939. Furthermore, a criminal investigation concerning the same comments was opened on 
20 October 2010. Despite reports that Mr. Kadyrov had publicly stated on 9 February 2010 
that he would dismiss the criminal proceedings, on 18 June 2010, Mr. Orlov was informed 
that the charges against him remained pending, and summoned to appear before the 
Investigatory Department of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Central 
Administrative District of the City of Moscow on 6 July 2010 for further investigation. Mr. 
Orlov was subsequently charged with the criminal offence of libel under Article 29 parts 2 
and 3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, and subjected to questioning. 
</p>
<p>1940. In the subsequent trial hearing of 13 September 2010, serious concerns were 
reportedly expressed regarding criminal procedure, specifically with respect to Article 72 of 
the Russian Federation&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure, as it was alleged that Mr. Kadyrov&#8217;s 
lawyer had been interrogated as a witness during pre-trial investigation. Citing these 
concerns and others, on 22 October 2010, the European Parliament called upon the 
authorities of the Russian Federation to reconsider the decision to open the criminal trial. 
</p>
<p>1941. In the trial hearing of 25 November 2010, which took place before District Court 
No. 363 of Khamovniki district, Moscow, the first defence witnesses were examined. The 
next hearing is reported to be scheduled for 16 December 2010. 
</p>
<p>1942. Concern was expressed that the ongoing criminal proceedings against Mr. Oleg 
Orlov may be related to legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights, in 
particular his remarks made about the President, as well as that of the human rights 
organisation Memorial. These acts, if confirmed, would take place in a context of 
increasing harassment of and violence against human rights defenders in the Russian 
Federation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>1943. In a letter dated 21 February 2011, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 3 December 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>1944. On 13 August 2009, the Tverskoy District Court of the City of Moscow began its 
examination of a complaint by Mr. Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, President of the 
Chechen Republic, against the interregional non-governmental organization and human 
rights centre Memorial and the chair of its board, Mr. Oleg Petrovich Orlov, in which Mr. 
Kadyrov claimed that his honour, dignity and reputation had been damaged, demanding 5 
million roubles from each of the respondents in compensation for moral harm and the 
retraction of the libellous statements made against him in the mass media.  
</p>
<p>1945. The Court&#8217;s decision of 6 October 2009 gave partial satisfaction to those demands.  
</p>
<p>1946. Thus, Mr. Kadyrov&#8217;s claim was partially satisfied. The Court decided: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To accept that the statements made on the website www.memo.ru were false and 
damaging to the honour, dignity and reputation of Mr. R.A. Kadyrov;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Memorial to publish a retraction of the statements made on the 
aforementioned website within 10 days of entry of the Court&#8217;s decision into force;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Memorial to pay Mr. R.A. Kadyrov 50,000 roubles in compensation for 
moral harm;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To order Mr. O.P. Orlov, Chair of the board of Memorial, to pay Mr. R.A. Kadyrov 
20,000 roubles in compensation for moral harm;  
</p>
<p>1947. The dispute was settled by the court in accordance with civil procedure. On 21 
January 2010, the civil chamber of Moscow City Court upheld the decision. </p>

</b></p>
<p> <b>273 
</b></p>
<p>1948. As the result of a pretrial investigation, criminal proceedings were initiated against 
Mr. Orlov for the offence of libel on 20 October 2009. Mr. Orlov was charged with that 
offence under article 129, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (the case consequently being 
subject to a public hearing). 
</p>
<p>1949. The charges against Mr. Orlov are that, as Chair of Memorial, he accused Mr. 
Kadyrov, President of the Chechen Republic, of the murder of Ms. N. K. Estemirova, Mr. 
Orlov&#8217;s colleague at Memorial, and in so doing disseminated information that he knew to 
be false and that was damaging to the honour, dignity and reputation of Mr. Kadyrov.  
</p>
<p>1950. On 28 July 2010, the deputy prosecutor for the Central Administrative District of the 
City of Moscow confirmed the indictment and the case was referred to the court. 
</p>
<p>1951. The injured party, Mr. Kadyrov, maintained the charges against Mr. Orlov. 
</p>
<p>1952. On 12 August 2010, the criminal case against Mr. Orlov came before a justice of the 
peace of District Court No. 363 of the Khamovniki District of the city of Moscow for trial 
on the merits. 
</p>
<p>1953. On 17 August 2010, the justice of the peace issued a decision to schedule the trial 
hearing for 30 August 2010. 
</p>
<p>1954. On 30 August 2010, the trial hearing was adjourned until 13 September 2010 as a 
result of the failure of Mr. Orlov to appear. 
</p>
<p>1955. On 13 September 2010 (not 13 October 2010, as indicated in the appeal of the 
special rapporteurs), in accordance with article 72 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
lawyer Mr. G.M. Reznik filed an objection against the injured party&#8217;s representative, Mr. 
A.A. Krasnenkov, in connection with the latter&#8217;s having been questioned as a witness 
during the pretrial inquiry, purportedly &#8220;in accordance with the procedure for questioning a 
witness&#8221;. The justice of the peace dismissed the objection on the grounds that during the 
pretrial investigation, Mr. Krasnenkov had been questioned not as a witness but as a 
representative of the injured party. 
</p>
<p>1956. In accordance with article 42 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the injured party 
and his or her representative may be questioned both during the pretrial investigation and 
during the trial. 
</p>
<p>1957. During the trial hearing, witnesses Ms. A.A. Malsagova, Mr. U.S. Dzhumaliev and 
Mr. O.D. Dzubairaev were questioned. The trial was adjourned until 27 September 2010 so 
that witnesses who had failed to appear and the injured party could be summoned and 
questioned.  
</p>
<p>1958. During the trial hearing on 27 September 2010, witness Ms. T.A. Kagyarova was 
questioned. Mr. Krasnenkov, representative of the injured party, filed a request for the court 
to order an additional linguistic examination. The defendant, Mr. Orlov, and his lawyer, Mr. 
Reznik, raised an objection to the requested examination. Ms. T.V. Popova, assistant 
prosecutor, requested time to prepare for the submission of the findings. The trial was 
adjourned until 14 October 2010.  
</p>
<p>1959. During the trial hearing on 14 October 2010, witnesses Mr. S.K. Komkov, Mr. I.K. 
Dadalaev and Mr. N.S. Nukhazhiev were questioned. The trial was adjourned until 2 
November 2010 so that witnesses who had failed to appear could be summoned and 
questioned. 
</p>
<p>1960. During the resumed proceedings on 2 November 2010, written materials relating to 
the case were examined. The trial was adjourned until 25 November 2010 so that witnesses 
who had failed to appear and the injured party could be summoned and questioned. </p>

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1961. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses received to the 
communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets that at the time of 
the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to his 
communication of 8 April 2011. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised 
by him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, 
subsequent prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>1962. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned that journalists, human rights 
defenders and members of political opposition groups continue to face harassment, 
intimidation and attacks, including smear campaigns against prominent Government critics. 
The Special Rapporteur also expresses his serious concern regarding lack of effective 
investigations into attacks on and murders of human rights defenders and journalists, 
including the death of Ms. Anna Politkovskaya. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Rwanda  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>1963. On 6 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an allegation letter concerning the death of <b>Mr. Jean 
Leonard Rugambage,</b> Deputy Editor of the Rwandan local-language <i>Umuvugizi</i> 
newspaper. 
</p>
<p>1964. According to the information received, on 24 June 2010, at about 10:00 p.m., Mr. 
Rugambage was reportedly shot dead in front of his home in Nyamirambo, Kigali by 
unidentified gunmen. Witnesses indicated that they saw the gunmen flee in a car. The police 
arrived at the scene soon after the shooting and have opened investigations into the case.  
</p>
<p>1965. Mr. Rugambage had reportedly been investigating the assassination attempt of Mr. 
Kayumba Nyamwasa, the exiled former Chief-of-Staff of the Rwandan Army, which 
occurred in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 19 June 2010. On 24 June 2010, the day of Mr. 
Rugambage&#8217;s murder, <i>Umuvugizi</i> newspaper had published an on-line article, alleging that 
Rwandan intelligence officials were linked to the shooting. Prior to his killing, Mr. 
Rugambage had told his colleagues that he was under intensified surveillance.  
</p>
<p>1966. In 2007, Mr. Jean Bosco Gasasira, Editor of <i>Umuvugizi</i>, fled into exile in a 
neighbouring country after being assaulted by unidentified men in Kigali. 
</p>
<p>1967. Grave concern was expressed that the killing of Mr. Rugambage might be linked to 
the exercise of his right to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of journalists of <i>Umuvugizi</i>, and 
more generally, for journalists throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>1968. On 19 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government 
concerning Mr. <b>Pascal Nyilibakwe</b>, Executive Secretary of the Rwandan section of Human 
Rights League of the Great Lakes (LDGL). LDGL is an independent, regional umbrella 
organisation which works on human rights issues in Rwanda.  
</p>
<p>1969. According to the information received, in September 2010, Mr. Pascal Nyilibakwe 
was forced to flee Rwanda as a result of a campaign of threats and harassment against him, 
allegedly linked to his role as Executive Secretary of LDGL.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>275 
</b></p>
<p>1970. In light of Rwanda&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review (UPR), LDGL became involved in 
preparing the civil society report which was to be presented to the UN Human Rights 
Council in January 2011. 
</p>
<p>1971. In this connection, it is reported that, in September 2009, training sessions were 
organised by LDGL to create awareness of the existing regional and international 
protection mechanisms available to human rights defenders. Given the fact that the first 
training session was not well attended, a follow up training session was held over a three-
day period from 9 to 12 February 2010. The second training session was reportedly 
organised in conjunction with LDGL, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights and the National Commission for Human Rights, and was attended by thirty-two 
Civil Society Organizations. During this session it is reported that a steering committee was 
established to identify and investigate human rights issues with a view to drafting a report 
to be submitted as part of the Universal Periodic Review process. The final report was 
shared with Government agencies, diplomatic missions and other organizations that 
participated in the process. The report was submitted on 5 July 2010.   
</p>
<p>1972. It is alleged that in September 2010, LDGL was targeted by a smear campaign led 
by some of the civil society organizations that had participated in the aforementioned 
training sessions. These organizations reportedly disassociated themselves from the training 
and the report produced, stating that they had been falsely included in the report with the 
summary of the stakeholder&#8217;s information to be submitted to the Universal Periodic 
Review. It is reported that these organizations did so as a result of the pressure to retract 
their support from the mentioned initiative. 
</p>
<p>1973. Following the smear campaign, Mr. Nyilibakwe and the Chair of the steering 
committee fled the country after receiving threats against them and their families.  
</p>
<p>1974. According to the information received, on 11 September 2010, two officers from the 
Criminal Intelligence Division entered the offices of LDGL and began questioning the 
guard who was present at the time. Two other officers from the Criminal Intelligence 
Division remained outside the premises. Furthermore, shortly after Mr. Nyilibakwe had fled 
the country, his personal driver was detained and questioned by officers of the Criminal 
Investigation Division. He was questioned about how Mr. Nyilibakwe had fled the country.  
</p>
<p>1975. Allegedly, the threats and harassment experienced by Mr. Nyilibakwee originated in 
2008 when LDGL published a controversial report on legislative elections.  In 2008, the 
Immigration office allegedly refused to register LDGL, however as a result of international 
pressure, LDGL was eventually registered. In August 2010, LDGL was also involved in 
monitoring elections which were held in Rwanda. In August 2010, LDGL again published a 
controversial report exposing alleged breaches in the election procedure. It is reported that 
following the publication of this report, Mr. Nyilibakwee received numerous threats from 
Government officials.   
</p>
<p>1976. Concern was expressed over the allegations that Mr. Nyilibakwee may have been 
threatened and harassed as a result of his work in the defence of human rights, in particular 
due to his involvement in the publication of a shadow report for the UPR, and that this 
could have been an act of reprisal for trying to engage with a UN human rights body.  
Further concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Nyilibakwee should he decide to return to Rwanda as well as for the physical and 
psychological integrity of his family members. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>1977. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 6 July 2010 and 10 
March 2011. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>276</b>  
</p>
<p>provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions 
as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p><b>  Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1978. On 28 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Mr. 
Mohammed Saleh El-Bejadi,</b> supervisor of the website &#8220;Monitor of Human Rights in 
Saudi Arabia-Al-Marsad&#8221; and co-founder of the Saudi Civil &amp; Political Rights Association 
(ACPRA) established in October 2009. He was previously the host of a weekly on-line 
forum called &#8220;The Citizen and His Rights&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>1979. According to the information received, in March 2009, Mr. El-Bejadi was allegedly 
summoned to the Intelligence Police Department and interrogated about his involvement on 
internet reports and protest activities calling for democratic reforms and the release of 
detainees. It is alleged that following his interrogation, a travel ban was issued against him 
on 23 July 2009 by the passport authorities in Barida. 
</p>
<p>1980. On 2 March 2010, Mr. El-Bejadi&#8217;s passport was allegedly confiscated by a passport 
officer at the passport checkpoint at King Khalid airport in Riyad. Mr. El-Bejadi, who was 
on his way to Qatar, was informed that he was not allowed to travel. Mr. El-Bejadi argued 
that the travel ban issued against him in July 2009 had been lifted but was allegedly told 
that &#8220;the ban was reinstated three hours ago according to an order by the security affairs at 
the Ministry of Interior&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>1981. Furthermore, it is alleged that since 2009, Mr. El-Bejadi and members of his family 
have been threatened by phone calls and messages.  
</p>
<p>1982. Concern was expressed that the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Mr. El-
Bejadi and the acts of intimidation against him and members of his family might be directly 
related to his work in defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>1983. In a letter dated 10 March 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 28 April 2010, by stating that the competent authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia have indicated that the information received regarding the situation of Mr. 
Mohammed Saleh El-Bejadi is totally unsubstantiated insofar as neither he nor his family 
were found to have submitted any complaint or have been subjected to interrogation due to 
his publication of material on the Internet.  
</p>
<p>1984. The travel ban was imposed on him in accordance with a statutory measure based on 
article 6 of the Travel Documents Regulations promulgated by Royal Decree No. M/44 
dated 28/5/1421 AH (28 August 2010).  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1985. On 16 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent 
appeal regarding the situation of<b> Mr. Fahd Bin Abdu-Rahman Al-Harbi,</b> also known as 
Fahd Al Jukhaidib. Mr. Al-Harbi is the editor of the daily newspaper Aljazierah, and 
principal of a secondary school. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>277 
</b></p>
<p>1986. According to the information received, Mr. Al-Harbi was accused of leading a 
protest among residents of Qubba to the local electricity department, in order to demand 
that action be taken to resolve regular power cuts affecting the town. Mr. Al-Harbi also 
reportedly published the story on the front page of Aljazierah. Subsequently, the electricity 
company yielded to the demands of the local residents, and sent additional power 
generators to the town.  
</p>
<p>1987. However, following the protest, Mr. Al-Harbi was allegedly summoned by the 
police, interrogated, and charged with instigating protests. He was brought before a court in 
Qaseem and, on 26 October, sentenced to two months imprisonment and 50 lashes, 25 of 
which would take place in public, in front of the local electricity department. 
</p>
<p>1988. Mr. Al-Harbi has reportedly been assigned a lawyer to appeal his sentence. 
</p>
<p>1989. Given the severity of the corporal punishment to which he had allegedly been 
sentenced, concern was expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Fahd 
Bin Abdu-Rahman Al-Harbi. Further concern was expressed that the conviction of Mr. Al-
Harbi may be related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1990. On 16 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the arrest 
and detention of Mr. <b>Mohamed bin Abdullah bin Ali Al-Abdulkareem</b>. Mr. Al-
Abdulkareem, a professor of law in Mohamed ibn Saud University in Riyadh, is a member 
of the Association for Civil and Political Rights and the Arab Organisation for Liberties and 
Good Governance, as well as editor in chief of the Journal of the National Congress. 
</p>
<p>1991. According to the information received, Mr. Al-Abdulkareem was arrested at his 
home on 5 December 2010 by agents of the general intelligence directorate. It is reported 
that the agents did not possess a judicial warrant, nor did they inform Mr. Al-Abdulkareem 
of the reasons for his arrest. Mr. Al-Abdulkareem is currently detained in Al Hayr prison, 
near Riyadh.  
</p>
<p>1992. It is reported that, on the same day, one of Mr. Al-Abdulkareem&#8217;s close friends 
attempted to obtain information regarding the location of Mr. Al-Abdulkareem&#8217;s detention 
and the reasons for the same, but was unable to obtain such information from neither the 
Al-Alicha nor Al-Hayr prison, where Mr. Al-Abdulkareem is reportedly detained. The 
prison authorities have yet to officially confirm Mr. Al-Abdulkareem&#8217;s arrest.  
</p>
<p>1993. However, it is reported that Mr. Al-Abdulkareem has been able to contact his wife 
on two occasions via telephone since his arrest, and thus could inform her of his 
whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>1994. Concerns have been expressed by Mr. Al-Abdulkareem&#8217;s family, as well as the 
organisations of which he is a member, that his arrest is related to the publication of an 
academic article which analysed issues related to succession and the mechanisms for 
transfer of power in Saudi Arabia on his Facebook page. It is reported that the same article 
is available on many Internet sites and has generated debate in Saudi civil society 
concerning the organisation of power in the Kingdom. 
</p>
<p>1995. On 8 December 2010, a group of lawyers defending Mr. Al-Abdulkareem presented 
a request in his name calling for his fundamental rights guaranteed by national law to be 
respected including, inter alia, that he be provisionally released with immediate effect as he 
is not the object of a crime serious enough to merit his continuing detention. It is reported 
that the lawyers in question have yet to receive a response from the authorities. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>1996. On 3 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the detention 
of Mr. <b>Ahmad bin Sa&#8217;d al-Ghamdi</b>, Mr. <b>Abdul Aziz al-Wuhaibi</b>, Mr. <b>Muhammad bin 
Hussain al-Qahtani</b> and Mr. <b>Muhammad bin Nasser al-Ghamdi</b>, founders of a political 
party, the Islamic Omma Party. 
</p>
<p>1997. It is reported that on 16 February 2011, Mr. Ahmad bin Sa&#8217;d al-Ghamdi, Mr. Abdul 
Aziz al-Wuhaibi, Mr. Muhammad bin Hussain al-Qahtani and Mr. Muhammad bin Nasser 
al-Ghamdi, together with three other Saudi Arabian citizens, were arrested by members of 
the Interior Ministry&#8217;s General Intelligence. A week prior to their detention, on 9 February 
2011, the individuals mentioned above had submitted a request for recognition of what 
would be Saudi Arabia&#8217;s first political party, the Islamic Omma Party. All of them were 
asked to sign an undertaking that they would renounce their activities with the party. Mr. 
Ahmad bin Sa&#8217;d al-Ghamdi, Mr. Abdul Aziz al-Wuhaibi, Mr. Muhammad bin Hussain al-
Qahtani and Mr. Muhammad bin Nasser al-Ghamdi refused to do so and as a result have 
been placed in detention. The three others did sign such an undertaking and were 
subsequently released.   
</p>
<p>1998. The Islamic Omma Party was founded by nine citizens of Saudi Arabia, including 
intellectuals, writers and lawyers on 9 February 2011. According to the information 
received, they had stated that their values stem from Islamic teachings and the principles of 
justice, freedom and charity and that their goals include greater political freedoms in Saudi 
Arabia, such as recognition of elections, the separation of powers, the independence of the 
judiciary, social justice and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>1999. It is further reported that Mr. Abdul Aziz al-Wuhaibi was allowed a short telephone 
call to his family on 18 February 2011 and told them that he was being detained at al-Hair 
prison. Reportedly, he has not been allowed any other contact with the outside world. 
Although the whereabouts of Mr. Ahmad bin Sa&#8217;d al-Ghamdi, Mr. Muhammad bin Hussain 
al-Qahtani and Mr. Muhammad bin Nasser al-Ghamdi are unknown, there are reasons to 
believe that they are also being held incommunicado at al-Hair prison.  
</p>
<p>2000. Concerns were expressed at the allegation that Mr. Ahmad bin Sa&#8217;d al-Ghamdi, Mr. 
Abdul Aziz al-Wuhaibi, Mr. Muhammad bin Hussain al-Qahtani and Mr. Muhammad bin 
Nasser al-Ghamdi are being held in detention on the sole basis of the peaceful exercise of 
their right to freedom of expression and association. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2001. On 22 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the 
Government regarding the arrest and detention of Mr. <b>Muhammad al-Wad&#8217;ani </b>during a 
protest held in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 4 March 2011. 
</p>
<p>2002. According to the information received, on 4 March 2011, Mr. Muhammad al-
Wad&#8217;ani, a 25 year-old teacher, was arrested outside the al-Rajihi mosque in the eastern 
part of Riyadh by men in plain clothes, allegedly members of the General Intelligence. At 
the moment of his arrest, Mr. al-Wad&#8217;ani was participating in a protest held in Riyadh, 
which called for reforms in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is alleged that prior to the 
protest on 2 March 2011, Mr. al-Wad&#8217;ani posted a video on the YouTube website calling 
for the fall of the monarchy and the end of arrest and detention without charge or trial.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>279 
</b></p>
<p>2003. Some of the other individuals, who participated in the protest on 4 March 2011, 
were also allegedly arrested but soon released by the authorities. Similarly, reports have 
been received regarding the detention of 24 men on 3 and 4 March 2011, in connection with 
protests in the city of al-Qatif, which aimed at denouncing prolonged detention without trial 
of members of the Shi&#8217;a minority. They were subsequently released on 8 March 2011, 
without charge and allegedly only after having signed a pledge not to protest again.  
</p>
<p>2004. Mr. al-Wad&#8217;ani continues to be detained incommunicado and is believed to be at 
risk of torture or ill-treatment. There are reasons to believe that he might be currently 
detained at al-Ha&#8217;ir prison in Riyadh.   
</p>
<p>2005. Concerns were expressed at the allegation that Mr. al-Wad&#8217;ani is currently detained 
incommunicado solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. 
Similar concerns were expressed with regard to allegations that other protesters, in 
particular members of the Shi&#8217;a minority, have been detained without charge and trial.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2006. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government had only responded to one out 
of five communications sent during the reporting period, in which the Government 
indicated that the information contained in the communication is totally unsubstantiated. He 
also regrets that the Government has not responded to four communications sent in 2010, 
and urges the Government of Saudi Arabia to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to 
provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions 
as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2007. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about reported restrictions to the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in the country and urges the Government of Saudi 
Arabia to guarantee a climate where all individuals can express themselves freely without 
fear of persecution.

who was allegedly beaten and raped by a man who intended to &quot;cure&quot; her from her sexual 
orientation, and Ms. <b>Ndumie Funda</b>, a local community activist supporting victims of 
&#8220;corrective&#8221; rape.  
</p>
<p>2013. According to the information received, Ms. Gaika, a lesbian woman, and her friends 
were walking home when Mr. Andile Ngoza, a man she had known for a number of years 
and who had never objected to her sexuality before, asked her for a cigarette. She stayed to 
smoke with him, and followed him into his room when he refused to pass the cigarette to 
her. The man then locked the door and started hitting her while she tried to fight back. Ms. 
Gaika was strangled with a wire, tortured and raped for five hours by Mr. Ngoza who 
intended to &quot;turn her straight&quot;.  
</p>
<p>2014. Since this incident took place, the court-case addressing it has reportedly been 
postponed numerous times, last time to February 2011, and Mr. Ngoza is currently out on 
bail, roaming the same streets where Ms. Gaika lives. This has forced Ms. Gaika to go into 
hiding for fear of her safety. 
</p>
<p>2015. Ms. Ndumie Funda, a local community activist reached out to Ms. Gaika through a 
small local charity she set up in the Cape Town township of Gugulethu to rescue and 
support survivors of &quot;corrective&#8221; rape. She is currently covering and supporting the 
criminal proceedings of Ms. Gaika. Although Mr. Ngoza is forbidden to enter Gugulethu as 
part of his bail conditions, he has reportedly broken those conditions constantly and 
threatened Ms. Funda various times.  
</p>
<p>2016. Since his release he has allegedly asked family and friends to attack Ms. Funda, 
constantly harassed her and made threats against her life and against her partner. This has 
forced Ms. Funda to go into hiding as well, which has prevented her from carrying out the 
assistance work she provides to other women victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>2017. Serious concern was expressed about the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. 
Gaika and Ms. Funda. Further concern was expressed that these attacks do not constitute 
isolated incidents and that lesbian women in South Africa face an increased risk of 
becoming victims of violence, especially rape, because of widely held prejudices and myths 
that maintain they would change their sexual orientation if they are raped by a man. 
Furthermore, concern was expressed over increasing reports that hate crimes against 
lesbians are not being recognized or punished by the South African legal system. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2018. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 14 January 2011. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

<p><b>  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2019. On 17 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with<b> </b>the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal concerning<b> the existence of a 
worrying and increasing trend aimed at delegitimizing the activities of human rights 
organizations, individual human rights defenders and journalists working in Sri 
Lanka</b>. Such information includes reports regarding physical attacks, threats, intimidation 
and public smear campaigns.  
</p>
<p>2020. Such attacks and threats, while experienced since 2006, have tangibly intensified 
following the Special Session of the Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka, which was held 
on 26-27 May 2009. It is reported that the Human Rights Minister, Mr. Mahinda 
Samarasinghe commented in The Hindu newspaper that &#8220; The people who go and sit in the 
cafeterias in the UN and lobby people in a very subjective manner putting forward those 
kind of sentiments (against Sri Lanka) would be inviting a very stern response from the 
government of Sri Lanka&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2021. In another article published in the online edition of the newspaper Divayina on 25 
May 2009, it was alleged that &#8220;an NGO team goes to Geneva to defend the LTTE 
leadership. A team of people from NGOs in this country, including a representative of the 
Free Media Movement, has reached Geneva airport (&#8230;) with the aim of going before the 
Human Rights Council with inaccurate and false statements against the government of Sri 
Lanka and the security forces&#8221;. It is further reported that the Inspector General of the Police 
claimed in an interview on ITN TV station on 28 May 2009, that several journalists were on 
LTTE payroll. The Inspector General of the Police further alleged that these journalists 
have committed treason and distorted and misreported against Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>2022. On 3 March 2010, the Sri Lankan news website Lanka News Web published an 
article and a list containing the name of 31 human rights defenders and journalists allegedly 
compiled by the Sri Lankan State Intelligence Services. The list includes human rights 
defenders and journalists categorized according to their work, and a brief description of the 
activities of each individual. The list contains the names of individuals who have been 
engaged in &#8220;international outreach&#8221; on human rights related issues and grades them 
according to their perceived importance to the intelligence services. Several human rights 
defenders and journalists are referred to as &#8220;providing information on human rights issues 
and IDPs to several local and international outlets&#8221;, as &#8220;international platform speaker on 
media/human rights&#8221; and as a person who &#8220;speaks on human rights and media freedom and 
involved in advocacy overseas&#8221;. While the purpose of the list remains unclear, it gives rise 
to a serious concern about the physical and psychological integrity of the individuals 
contained therein. 
</p>
<p>2023. The head of Transparency International&#8217;s Sri Lanka office, Mr. J. C. Weliamuna is 
at the top of the list. It was reported on 8 March 2010 that the Government of Sri Lanka is 
planning to arrest Mr. Weliamuna in connection with the alleged misuse of funds. This 
information comes amidst a media campaign targeted against the Sri Lankan branch of 
Transparency International. It is feared that the allegations may be related to reports that 
Transparency International issued in December 2009 and January 2010, which included 
allegations about violation of election laws and misuse of public resources by the ruling 
party, and would be aimed at discrediting organizations engaged in monitoring elections. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>282</b>  
</p>
<p>Mr. Weliamuna was the subject of a communication sent on 6 October 2008 by the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Chairman of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances. We have not yet received a response to this communication 
from your Excellency&#8217;s Government. The communication related to a grenade attack on the 
house of Mr. Weliamuna, causing damages to his property. It is reported that no credible 
inquiry has been carried out into this attack.  
</p>
<p>2024. Mr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy 
Alternatives, has been listed number three in the list. Mr. Saravanamuttu has been receiving 
death threats mainly in connection with the extension of GPS Plus (Generalized System of 
Preferences) status by the European Union to Sri Lanka in case it should have been 
rejected. Mr. Saravanamuttu was the subject of an urgent appeal sent on 24 August 2009 by 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. A 
response from your Excellency&#8217;s Government to this communication was received on 25 
August 2009.  
</p>
<p>2025. Mr. Sunanda Deshapriya, a prominent journalist and human rights defender, who is 
number six on the list, has been living in exile in Switzerland since May 2009, due to the 
threats received and the ongoing denigration campaign in the media following his 
participation and intervention at the March 2009 session of the Human Rights Council and 
the 11th Special Session on Sri Lanka. He has been accused of being a &#8220;traitor&#8221; and a &#8220;liar&#8221; 
due to his participation at the Special Session. Videos containing death threats against him 
have been posted on the social networking site Facebook; he has received numerous 
threatening text messages and has been vilified in television and radio shows and a number 
of editorials. The Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa allegedly stated in 
an interview on 7 June 2009 in The Nation that it was a betrayal by Mr. Deshapriya to talk 
against his own country and to say that Sri Lanka violates human rights, while countries 
like India, China and Russia were firmly standing by the Government. In an interview with 
ITN TV on 4 June 2009, Mr. Mahinda Samarasighe, the Minister of Disaster Management 
and Human Rights allegedly did not object to the talk show host&#8217;s suggestion that Mr. 
Deshapriya should be expelled from the country for his intervention at the HRC Special 
Session. Mr. Deshapriya was the subject of urgent appeals sent on 7 June 2006 and 23 May 
2005 by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. A response from the Government to this communication was 
received on 27 June 2006.  
</p>
<p>2026. Concern was expressed that threats and harassment of, and intimidation against 
human rights defenders and journalists, including media smear campaigns, may be related 
to their legitimate activities in defense of human rights, in particular to their international 
advocacy and outreach efforts. Further serious concern was expressed that some of the 
threats may be related to their having cooperated with the UN Human Rights Council and 
Special Procedure mandate holders. Given the extent of the allegations, an overarching 
concern was expressed that the threats, attacks and media smear campaigns may form part 
of a broader attempt to delegitimize the activities of human rights defenders who are critical 
of actions and policies of the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2027. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 17 March 2010, and to 
earlier communications sent on 9 February 2010, 6 November 2010, 15 October 2010, 9 
October 2010, and 8 October 2010. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1

<p> <b>283 
</b></p>
<p>raised by him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, 
subsequent prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2028. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned about the situation of 
journalists and human rights defenders in Sri Lanka, and restrictions to the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, as well as the rights to freedom of assembly and association. In 
particular, he expresses his grave concern regarding physical assaults, abduction, 
intimidation and harassment of journalists, and lack of effective investigation into such acts 
and prosecution of perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>2029. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses his continued concern regarding the 
disappearance of Mr. Prageeth Eknaligoda since 24 January 2010, who had been reporting 
on the 26 January 2010 presidential elections and had completed an anlysis that favoured 
the opposition candidate, Mr. Sareth Fonseka. He urges the Government to undertake 
independent and effective investigation into his whereabouts and the circumstances of his 
disappearance, and to bring responsible persons to account.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2030. On 23 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and 
the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of <b>Mr. Abdelrahman Mohamed 
Al-Gasim</b>, Legal Aid and Training Coordinator of the Darfur Bar Association, and a 
member of the Executive Committee for the Sudanese Human Rights Monitor; <b>Mr. 
Abdelrahman Adam Abdallah and Mr. Derar Adam Abdallah</b>, Deputy Director and 
Administration Officer of the Sudan-based Human Rights and Advocacy Network for

activists; and <b>Mr. Jaafar Alsabki Ibrahim, </b>a Darfuri editor working for the newspaper Al 
Sahafa in Khartoum. 
</p>
<p>2031. According to the information received, on 29 October 2010, Mr. Abdelrahman 
Mohamed Al-Gasim was reportedly arrested by members of the National Intelligence and 
Security Services (NISS) in Khartoum. On 31 October, NISS agents informed his family 
that he had been arrested, but did not specify the charges brought against him. Neither his 
lawyer, nor his family were allowed access to him. The whereabouts of Mr. Abdelrahman 
Mohamed Al-Gasim remain unknown as of the time of the communication.  
</p>
<p>2032. It was further alleged that Mr. Abdelrahman Mohamed Al-Gasim received threats 
from Sudanese officials while participating in the 15th session of the Human Rights 
Council in Geneva in September 2010. Mr. Abdelrahman Mohamed Al-Gasim lobbied for 
the extension of the mandate of the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in 
the Sudan, and delivered a number of oral interventions before the Council on alleged 
human rights violations committed by the Sudanese authorities in the country. He was also 
a panelist in a side-event entitled &#8220;Sudan: Impunity, Repression and Conflict on the Rise&#8221;, 
co-sponsored by the non-governmental human rights organizations Cairo Institute for 
Human Rights Studies (CIHRS), Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the 
International Federation for Human Rights. Furthermore, Mr. Abdelrahman Mohamed Al-
Gasim was scheduled to take part in the stakeholder's submission, co-sponsored by CIHRS 
and its partner organizations in the Sudan, on the Universal Periodic Review of the Sudan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Abdelrahman Mohamed Al-Gasim was due to attend the 48th session of the 
African Commission for Human and Peoples Rights in Banjul in November 2010. 
</p>
<p>2033. On 30 October 2010, Mr. Abdelrahman Adam Abdallah, Mr. Derar Adam Abdallah, 
Mr. Manal Mohamed Ahmed, Ms. Aisha Sardo Sherif, Ms. Aziza Ali Idris, Mr. Abu Gasim 
Al Din, and Mr. Zakaria Yacoub were arrested by NISS agents, following the participation 
by some of them, in a youth forum hosted allegedly by a pro-democracy student movement 
called Girifna. During the forum, the issues of social development and the administration of 
justice in Darfur were discussed. Lawyers and families have reportedly been denied access 
to the detainees and their current fate and whereabouts are unknown. 
</p>
<p>2034. On 3 November 2010, Mr. Jaafar Alsabki Ibrahim was arrested by NISS agents at 
the premises of Al Sahafa in Khartoum. He was prevented from making a call to his family 
before being taken to an undisclosed location. 
</p>
<p>2035. Serious concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of the nine 
aforementioned persons were linked to their legitimate activities in defence of human 
rights. In view of the fact that their fate and whereabouts were unknown, further concerns 
were expressed for their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2036. On 4 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, and  the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in the Sudan, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>arrests during peaceful 
demonstrations</b>, including Mr. <b>Lois Ewell</b>, also known as Louis Awil Weriak, a student 
and General Secretary of the Students Union at the University of Khartoum; Mr. <b>Tharwat 
Swaraldahab</b>, a Canadian citizen and member of  Liberal Democracy Party of Sudan; and

and Mr. <b>Mohamed Amir Musa</b>, journalist for a Turkish news agency Al-ikhlas.  
</p>
<p>2037. According to the information received, on 30 January 2011, peaceful demonstrations 
were organized in several cities, including Khartoum and Omdurman, to call for democracy 
and an improvement in socio-economic conditions. During these demonstrations, Mr. Ewell 
was arrested in Khartoum by the National Intelligence and Security services (NISS), was 
allegedly badly tortured and is now in very serious condition at an undisclosed NISS 
detention facility. Since his arrest, he has not been charged with any offence. He has also 
not been granted access to his families or lawyers. It is unclear whether he is being 
provided with medical or other assistance. 
</p>
<p>2038. Mr. Tharwat Swaraldahab was arrested at 10:00am on 30 January 2011, near the 
medical faculty of the University of Khartoum. He was held at an undisclosed location and 
has been reportedly tortured to the point where he has been hospitalised. He is being denied

<p>2041. On 28 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Independent Expert on 
the situation of human rights in the Sudan, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working 
Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances, sent an urgent appeal concerning the continued detention at 
Kober prison in Sudan of Mr. <b>Abu Zara al-Amin</b>, deputy editor of the opposition daily 
newspaper Rai al-Shaab, and the alleged detention in an unknown location of Mr. 
<b>Suleiman Wida&#8217;a</b>, Ms. <b>Fatima Bashir</b> and Ms. <b>Fathia Tinga</b> of Al-Midan newspaper, as 
well as Mr. <b>Jaafar Alsabki Ibrahim</b> of Al-Sahafa newspaper. 
</p>
<p>2042. According to the information received, on 16 May 2010, Mr. Abu Zara al-Amin, a 
deputy editor of the opposition daily newspaper Ral al-Shaab, together with Mr. Ashraf 
Abdelaziz, an editor for the same newspaper, and Mr. Dahab Ibrahim, a senior political 
reporter, were arrested by the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) at the 
newspaper&#8217;s offices in Khartoum, Sudan. All of them were accused of &#8220;undermining the 
constitutional system&#8221; and &#8220;publishing false information&#8221; and were convicted on 15 July 
</p><p>2010. Mr. al-Amin was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Mr. Abdelaziz and Mr. 
Ibrahim were sentenced to two years of imprisonment which, following an appeal in 
November 2010, was reduced to one year. At the hearing in November 2010, Mr. 
Abdelaziz and Mr. Ibrahim were informed that their newspaper Ral al-Shaab was 
reportedly suspended for one year.  
</p>
<p>2043. While Mr. Abdelaziz and Mr. Ibrahim were released on 6 February 2011, Mr. al-
Amin continues to be held in detention at Kober prison. Reportedly, his health condition is 
rapidly deteriorating as a result of alleged torture and the absence of adequate medical 
treatment. Upon their release, both Mr. Abdelaziz and Mr. Ibrahim reported acts of torture 
inflicted upon them by NISS agents while at Kober prison and the fact that they were at no 
point informed of the reasons for their arrest.  
</p>
<p>2044. It is further reported that on 3 February 2011, Mr. Suleiman Wida&#8217;a, Ms. Fatima 
Bashir and Ms. Fathia Tinga, all journalists working for the Al-Midan newspaper, were 
arrested allegedly by NISS forces in connection with their coverage of street protests on 30 
January 2011, and since then their current fate and whereabouts are unknown. Mr. Jaafar 
Alsabki Ibrahim, a journalist for Al-Sahafa newspaper, has been reportedly detained since 3 
November 2010, and his current fate and whereabouts are unknown.  
</p>
<p>2045. Concerns were expressed at the allegation that the aforementioned journalists are 
detained solely due to their pacific exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Grave 
concerns were also expressed at the allegation that the fate and whereabouts of most of 
these journalists are unknown. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response received to communication sent earlier

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2052. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 28 March 2011, 4 
February 2011, 21 November 2010 and to five earlier communications sent in 2009 (14 
December 2009, 17 April 2009, 2 April 2009, 24 March 2009 and 4 February 2009). He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2053. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concerns expressed in his communications, in 
particular arbitrary arrests of journalists for their coverage of the elections. He also remains 
concerned about reports of arrests, torture and ill-treatment, and prosecution of perceived 
critics of the Government for exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression, 
assembly and association. He reiterates his recommendation to the Government to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression of all 
individuals and to ensure that journalists and human rights defenders are able to operate in a 
safe environment without fear of persecution. <b>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2054. On 13 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with The Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal concerning the arrest, and alleged disappearance 
of <b>Mr. Ismail Abdi</b>. Mr. Abdi is a lawyer and member of the board of trustees of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>287 
</b></p>
<p>Committees for the Defence of Democracy Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria 
(CDDFHRS), and has written numerous articles concerning the situation of human rights in 
the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>2055. According to the information received, on 23 August 2010, Mr. Abdi was arrested 
by members of the Amn al Dawla (State Security Forces) in Aleppo Airport, Syrian Arab 
Republic, as he attempted to return from the Syrian Arab Republic to his residence in 
Germany, along with his wife and three of his children. Since his arrest, Mr. Abdi's family 
and colleagues have received no information regarding neither his location nor his fate. 
</p>
<p>2056. It was reported that while in the airport, Mr. Abdi was taken aside by members of 
the Amn al Dawla for a security check, before being taken away by the security agents 
without being able to communicate further with his family.  
</p>
<p>2057. Upon inquiring at the time of arrest as to where Mr. Abdi would be taken, Mr. 
Abdi's family members were reportedly informed by a member of the Amn al Dawla that 
he would probably be taken to the State Security headquarters in Qamishli. However, when 
asked, officials at said headquarters denied holding anyone by the name of Ismail Abdi. 
</p>
<p>2058. Mr. Abdi's family had expressed concern that the arrest and alleged disappearance 
are related to his work on CDDFHRS' publication, in February 2010, of a list of some 600 
names of individuals who had allegedly been tortured and killed in Syrian prisons between 
2008 and 2010. 
</p>
<p>2059. Concern was expressed that the arrest and alleged disappearance of Mr. Abdi are 
related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in defence of human rights, in particular 
with respect to the aforementioned publication.  Furthermore, mindful of the fact that the 
location of Mr. Abdi's detention allegedly remains unknown and the lack of any formal 
charges brought against him, concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government

<p>2060. In a letter dated 1 December 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 13 October 2010 as follows.   
</p>
<p>2061. With regard to the information that you have received in respect of Mr. Isma`il 
Abdi, a lawyer, we hereby inform you that Mr. Abdi was lawfully arrested on 23 August 
2010 for publishing inflammatory articles that seek to undermine respect for the State, 
national sentiment and national unity, for bringing the country into disrepute abroad, for 
attacking the system of government in Syria and for communicating with Al-Mustaqillah 
and Al Jazeera satellite channels and making statements on the so-called persecution of the 
Kurds in the Syrian Arab Republic that would encourage the spread of sectarianism. 
</p>
<p>2062. Mr. Abdi was duly transferred to the Syrian courts, where the required legal action 
will be taken against him by means of an impartial and fair trial. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2063. On 9 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of<b> Mr. 
Haytham Al-Maleh</b>. Mr. Al-Maleh, aged 79, has been a lawyer since the 1950s and in 
2001 founded the Human Rights Association in Syria (HRAS).  
</p>
<p>2064. Mr. Al-Maleh was the subject of a Joint Urgent Appeal from the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>288</b>  
</p>
<p>Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
dated 23 February 2004; a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
in human, or degrading treatment or punishment dated 21 October 2009; and a Joint Urgent 
Appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of Judges and Lawyers; the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression; the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health; the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, in human, or 
degrading treatment or punishment dated 18 March 2010. The response of your 
Excellency&#8217;s government to the Joint Urgent Appeals dated 21 October 2009 and 18 March 
2010 was received on 1 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>2065. According to information now received, on 4 July 2010, Mr. Haytham Al-Maleh 
was sentenced to three years imprisonment by a Syrian Military Court, on charges of 
disseminating false information which could harm the nation.  
</p>
<p>2066. Concerns have been expressed regarding the fairness of Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s trial before 
a Military Court, given that Mr. Al-Maleh holds no military status, and the crime of which 
he was found guilty was not of a military nature. Furthermore, the Code of Military 
Procedures, in accordance with which Mr. Al-Maleh was sentenced, allegedly fails to offer 
many of the fair trial guarantees stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Syrian Code of Criminal Procedures. 
</p>
<p>2067. On 15 October 2010, the appeal lodged by Mr. Al Maleh&#8217;s lawyer was rejected by 
the Damascus Appeals Court, Military Room. It is reported that Mr. Al-Maleh has no 
further recourse to appeal within Syria.  
</p>
<p>2068. Serious concerns have also been expressed regarding Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s treatment 
while in detention and the conditions in which he is detained. Mr. Al-Maleh suffers from 
diabetes and an overactive thyroid gland, and it is alleged that, while he has been provided 
with some medication, he reportedly continues to be denied access to the medication 
specifically prescribed to him for his illnesses by his doctors. We hereby acknowledge 
receipt of the response provided by your Excellency&#8217;s Government on 1 April 2010 
concerning the medical assistance provided to Mr. Al-Maleh.  However, we regret that the 
response did not provide substantive information regarding allegations indicating that Mr. 
Al-Maleh is being denied the specific medical assistance as prescribed by his doctors.   
</p>
<p>2069. It was reported that Mr. Al-Maleh shares a cell with as many as 60 other prisoners, 
in which there are no beds and a limited number of mattresses, and that the water in the 
prison is often cut off, leading to health risks. It is also reported that Mr. Al-Maleh has 
developed a degenerative knee infection, back problems, and recurrent influenza.  
</p>
<p>2070. Given Mr. Al-Maleh&#8217;s age, state of health and the conditions in which it is alleged 
that he is detained, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological 
integrity. Concern was also expressed that the rejection of the appeal against Mr. Al-
Maleh&#8217;s sentence may be related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human 
rights, including as a lawyer. In this connection, further concern was expressed that the 
aforementioned decision forms part of a pattern of ongoing judicial harassment against 
human rights defenders and lawyers in Syria. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2071. On 11 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>289 
</b></p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur 
on the independence of judges and lawyers , sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
<b>Mr. Muhannad Al-Hassani</b>, President of the Syrian Human Rights Organization 
&#8220;Sawasiya&#8221; and a Commissioner of the International Commission of Jurists, currently 
serving a three year prison sentence for &#8220;weakening national sentiments and encouraging 
racist and sectarian feelings&#8221;, and &#8220;transferring false and exaggerated news that weaken 
national sentiments&#8221;. In October 2010, Mr. Al-Hassani received the 2010 Martin Ennals 
Award for human rights defenders and the Dean Award of the Amsterdam Bar Association.  
</p>
<p>2072. The case of Mr. Al-Hassani has previously been addressed by the Special 
Procedures Mechanisms in a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Vice-Chair Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders; and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment dated 3 August 2009; a Joint Urgent Appeal 
sent by the Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders; the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers; and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, dated 10 December 2009; and 
a Joint Urgent Appeal sent by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers dated 6 
July 2010. In these communications concern was raised that the disbarment, charges, trial 
and sentencing of Mr. Al-Hassani were related to his peaceful and legitimate activities in 
defence of human rights, including as a lawyer. The response of the Government to the 
communication dated 10 December 2009, was received on 29 July 2010. 
</p>
<p>2073. According to information now received, on 28 October 2010, Mr. Muhannad Al-
Hassani, who reportedly shares a cell with at least 30 convicted criminals, was attacked and 
severely beaten by a cell-mate, whose name is known to us. The attack reportedly caused a 
wound in his forehead which required ten stitches, as well as swelling of his left eye and 
cheek. The alleged attacker is reported to be serving a prison sentence for rape, armed 
robbery and forming a criminal gang. As he assaulted Mr. Al-Hassani, the perpetrator 
allegedly accused him of being an agent for a foreign entity and not being a Syrian 
nationalist.  
</p>
<p>2074. It is reported that the prison authorities subsequently launched an investigation into 
the assault. However, it is alleged that in the process of the said investigation, comments 
made by the alleged attacker before the investigation committee in which he threatened to 
kill Mr. Al-Hassani were not recorded in the charge sheet. It is further alleged that despite 
making a request to transfer the alleged perpetrator to another cell, Mr. Al-Hassani remains 
imprisoned in the same cell along with his attacker. 
</p>
<p>2075. On 29 October 2010, the day following the attack, the Penal Chamber at the Court of 
Cassation reportedly rejected Mr. Al-Hassani&#8217;s appeal, confirming the three-year sentence 
passed by the Second Damascus Criminal Court on 23 June 2010, and leaving Mr. Al-
Hassani with no further legal recourse within the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>2076. Given the serious risk that Mr. Al-Hassani may be subjected to further attacks, grave 
concern was expressed for his life, and physical and psychological integrity. Further 
concern was expressed that both the attack against Mr. Al-Hassani and subsequent rejection 
of his appeal before the Court of Cassation may have been related to his legitimate and 
peaceful activities in defence of human rights, particularly as a lawyer. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2077. On 25 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>290</b>  
</p>
<p>everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the situation of Mr. <b>Amro Okleh</b>, a writer and 
a political activist, who works as a government employee at the &#8220;Board of Control and 
Inspection&#8221; of Al Hassaka, the Syrian Arab Republic. Mr. Amro Okleh is a member of the 
Damascus Declaration for national democratic change and the author of a number of 
articles published in the Syrian press. Mr. Okleh is married with two children and lives in 
the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>2078. According to the information received, on 15 November 2010, Mr. Okleh, aged 46, 
was allegedly arrested by agents of the State Security Services. It is reported that the 
security agents did not present any judicial warrant, nor did they explain the reason for Mr. 
Okleh&#8217;s arrest. They reportedly raided Mr. Okleh&#8217;s home and confiscated various personal 
belongings, including his mobile phone, a laptop and a computer.  
</p>
<p>2079. It is reported that Mr. Okleh was subsequently taken to the Security State Services 
branch in Al Kameshli where he is currently held in incommunicado detention. It is further 
reported that Mr. Okleh has not been allowed to see his family, nor has he been provided 
with medical treatment, despite his serious health condition. Mr. Okleh had reportedly been 
suffering from cardiac condition and heart disease. 
</p>
<p>2080. Given that Mr. Okleh continues to be allegedly held incommunicado, concern was 
expressed about his physical and psychological integrity. Further concern was expressed 
that the arrest and subsequent incommunicado detention of Mr. Okleh may be related to his 
peaceful and legitimate political activities, particularly his recent activities linked to 
publishing in the local media.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2081. On 9 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the detention of and charges against Mr. <b>Ali Al-
Abdullah</b>, member of the National Council of the Damascus Declaration for National 
Democratic Change, a legislative body composed of numerous opposition groups and 
activists who have been advocating for democratic reforms in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
Mr. Al-Abdullah has allegedly been imprisoned on three previous occasions: he spent six 
months in detention after returning from abroad to live in the Syrian Arab Republic in the 
1990s; he served almost six months in prison in 2005 for his involvement with the Jamal al-
Atassi Forum, where he read out a statement by the exiled Muslim Brotherhood leader who 
called for pluralism and human rights to be respected in the Syrian Arab Republic; and he 
served a six-month sentence in 2006 for having participated in a protest outside the 
Supreme Security Court (SSSC) against the trials that do not comply with international fair 
trial standards. 
</p>
<p>2082. According to recent information received, on 17 December 2007, Mr. Ali Al-
Abdullah was detained by State security officials after he and others associated with the 
Damascus Declaration met to elect a new executive committee. He was sentenced by a 
criminal court in Damascus, together with 11 other activists, to two and a half years of 
imprisonment on vaguely defined charges of &#8220;weakening the national sentiment&#8221; and 
&#8220;spreading false or exaggerated news that would affect the morale of the country&#8221; (article 
286 of the Penal Code).  
</p>
<p>2083. During his detention, Mr. Al-Abdullah wrote an article criticizing the Islamic 
Republic of Iran&#8217;s Wilayat-al-Faqih doctrine, which grants absolute political authority to a 
religious figure, as well as alleged human rights violations committed during the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>291 
</b></p>
<p>presidential election in the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 23 August 2009, the article 
reportedly appeared online, and on 19 April 2010, Mr. Al-Abdullah was allegedly 
interrogated by a prosecutor from the State Security Court. In June 2009, he also allegedly 
made a statement via telephone to the Italian AKI news agency in which he praised the 
elections that had taken place in Lebanon and then criticized the Iranian authorities&#8217; use of 
excessive force against peaceful protestors demonstrating that month against the disputed 
presidential election results. 
</p>
<p>2084. On 17 June 2010, at the end of their prison terms, all detainees were released, except 
for Mr. Al-Abdullah. He was informed by the officials of Political Security, one of Syrian 
Arab Republic&#8217;s security services, that his case will be referred to the military prosecutor 
for new charges relating to the article that he wrote on the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 19 
September 2010, he was charged by a military investigative judge with &#8220;spoiling Syria&#8217;s 
relations with another country&#8221; (article 278 of the Penal Code), for which, if found guilty, 
he could be sentenced to up to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. On 1 December 2010, a military 
court confirmed the charge.  
</p>
<p>2085. On 7 February 2011, a hearing took place before the Second Criminal Military Court 
in Damascus, where the judge informed Mr. Al-Abdullah that the charge of &#8220;spoiling 
Syria&#8217;s relations with another country&#8221; relate to his statement regarding the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. His lawyers have allegedly been unable to meet him without an officer 
from the security forces monitoring their conversations. Additionally, his lawyers have not 
had access to the full case file. His next hearing is scheduled to take place on 23 February 
</p><p>2011.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2086. On 18 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, sent an urgent appeal regarding the sentencing of Ms. <b>Tal al-
Mallohi</b>, a 19 year old high school student and blogger. Her blog 
(http://talmallohi.blogspot.com) contains poems and commentary on social and political 
issues. Ms. al-Mallohi does not belong to any political group.  
</p>
<p>2087. According to information received, on 27 December 2009, Ms. al-Mallohi was 
summoned to Damascus for interrogation by Syrian Arab Republic&#8217;s State Security (Branch 
279) relating to an article she published on her blog. She was immediately detained without 
charge. Two days later, on 29 December 2009, members of State Security reportedly went 
to Ms. al-Mallohi&#8217;s house and confiscated her computer, CDs, books, and other personal 
effects. She was held in incommunicado detention at an undisclosed location without 
charge or access to her family for the first nine months of her detention. Her family was 
allowed to visit her once at Doma prison in Damascus on 30 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>2088. On 5 October 2010, it was reported that Ms. al-Mallohi had been charged with 
spying for a foreign country. On 14 February 2011, Ms. al-Mallohi appeared before 
Damascus State Security Court in a closed trial, and was sentenced to five years of 
imprisonment for &#8220;divulging information to a foreign State.&#8221; The court did not disclose any 
evidence nor details of the reason behind the verdict. The State Security Court&#8217;s verdict is 
final and there is no possibility of appeal. Since 30 September 2010, other than during her 
court appearance, Ms. al-Mallohi is being held in solitary confinement in Doma prison. 
</p>
<p>2089. Concern was expressed that Ms. al-Mallohi was held in incommunicado detention 
without charge for nine months, sentenced to five years of imprisonment on unclear 
charges, and now held in solitary confinement because of articles posted on her blog. 
Further concern was expressed regarding the right to physical and mental integrity of Ms. 
Tal al-Mallohi. </p>

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2090. On 30 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning the <b>assault and arrest of dozens of human 
rights defenders and family members of prisoners of conscience</b> who had gathered at 
the Syrian Ministry of Interior on 16 March 2011 to petition for the release of all political 
prisoners.   
</p>
<p>2091. According to the information received, on 16 March 2011, about 150 individuals 
gathered outside the Ministry of Interior in Damascus, to present a petition calling for the 
release of prisoners of conscience and to express disappointment that a significant number 
of these prisoners were not covered by the 8 March 2011 amnesty adopted to mark the 
Baath Revolution Day. Most of the individuals involved in the demonstration were human 
rights defenders and relatives of prisoners of conscience.  It is reported that when families 
started raising pictures of their detained relatives, they were confronted by security services 
agents armed with batons and individuals in plain clothes who proceeded to violently beat 
and break up the demonstration. Reportedly children, women and elderly individuals were 
among those beaten. Demonstrators who tried to flee the assault were reportedly chased 
down and arrested. An estimated 40 people were arrested at the scene of the demonstration.  
</p>
<p>2092. It is reported that security services agents subsequently transported a number of the 
demonstrators, including an unidentified boy in his early teens, to the Mantaqa branch of 
Military Security. One of these individuals, Mr. Bader Shalah was reportedly hit over his 
eye with a baton, causing bleeding. Security services agents allegedly interrogated some of 
these individuals and asked for passwords to their Facebook accounts 
</p>
<p>2093. On 17 March 2011, a day after the peaceful demonstration was violently dispersed 
the Syrian authorities interrogated and charged 32 of the demonstrators for alleged 
violations relating to &#8220;weakening national sentiment&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;deeds committed, writings 
composed, or speeches held with the intention of inciting sectarian or racial strife or 
provoking conflict between the religions and the various members of the nation&#8221; (Articles 
285 and 307 of the Criminal Code). The 32 individuals charged and detained are: Omar Al-
Labwani, Riba Al-Labwani, Laila Al-Labwani, Ammar Al-Labwani, Siba Hafiz Hassan, 
human rights defender Sereen Khouri, Nahid Badawieh, Naret Ibrahim Abdul Karim, Badr 
Eddin Al-Shallash, Kamal Shaikho member of the Committee for the Defence of 
Democratic Liberties and Human Rights in Syria (CDF), Suhair Al-Attassi, President of the

Saeed, Bisher Jawdat Saeed, Ghaffer Hikmat Muhammad, Dana Ibrahim Al-Jawabra, Wafa 
Mohamed Al-Lahman, Nabil Walid Shurbaji, Fahima (Herveen) Saleh Awsi, a member of

Central Prison of Adra or Douma Prison for Women where they are alleged to have joined 
the hunger strike started by a group of 12 prisoners of conscience and human rights 
defenders on 7 March 2011.  
</p>
<p>2094. To date, there has been no information concerning the situation of several other 
family members who were reportedly arrested in relation to the peaceful demonstration. 
These individuals include: Hussein Al-Labwani, Hannibal Awwad, Mahmoud Ghawrani, 
Mohammad Adib Matar, Mohammad Darwish, Ghaffar Hikmat Muhammad, Abdul </p>

abovementioned individuals. Further concern was expressed that their arrest and detention 
is related to their peaceful activity and the legitimate exercise of their freedom of opinion

</p>
<p><b>  Responses received to communications sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>2096. In a letter dated 29 June 2010, the Government replied to the communication sent on 
10 December 2009 regarding Mr. Mustafa Ismail as follows.   
</p>
<p>2097. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic thanks you for your concern and 
appreciates your efforts to monitor human rights violations throughout the world. It is 
pleased to cooperate with you in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and international norms 
and standards and in accordance with your mandate as set out in the various Human Rights 
Council resolutions. 
</p>
<p>2098. With regard to the information that you have received in respect of Mr. Mustafa 
Isma`il, we wish to clarify that Mr. Isma`il is a Syrian citizen who enjoys his full rights as 
guaranteed by the Syrian Constitution and under Syrian law. Under Syrian law, all Syrian 
citizens are granted their rights to freedom and to engage in lawful activities; in return, they 
are subject to Syrian laws, which impose penalties on any person who commits an unlawful 
act. 
</p>
<p>2099. In view of the above, and in view of the unlawful acts committed by Mr. Isma`il, 
which are punishable under the Syrian Criminal Code, he was arrested on 12 December 
2009 by the competent authorities for investigation. He was subsequently transferred to the 
Office of the Military Public Prosecutor in Aleppo, with the record of the investigation into 
his case, where it was decided to institute public proceedings against him on the basis of the 
documents available and the investigation into two offences, namely: 
</p>
<p> 1. Engaging in acts that would harm Syrian relations with a foreign State, under 
article 278 of the General Criminal Code; 
</p>
<p> 2. Membership of a prohibited political party, under article 267 of the General 
Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>2100. The case for prosecution and the preliminary investigation file were presented to the 
military investigating officer in Aleppo, who conducted a judicial investigation into Mr. 
Isma`il&#8217;s case and, consequently, decided to remand him in custody for the two offences 
that he is alleged to have committed. The case remains under consideration. 
</p>
<p>2101. With regard to the assertion in your letter that Mr. Isma`il was held incommunicado 
and the concern that you expressed for his physical and psychological health, we wish to 
reiterate our hope that you take into consideration that most of the sources upon which you 
rely for information in respect of the Syrian Arab Republic provide you with false 
information and incorrect facts, and that you attend to those sources accordingly. Mr. 
Isma`il was not held incommunicado but was treated as other prisoners in the Syrian Arab 
Republic are treated in accordance with all of the international standards for the treatment 
of prisoners. We also wish to reassure you with regard to Mr. Isma`il&#8217;s physical and 
psychological health that he receives the same medical care in prison as he would if he 
were not in prison. In prisons, full-time physicians attend to the health of prisoners and 
provide them with health care and psychological care; any prisoner with a health condition 
is treated immediately. In this regard, we hope that you will not hesitate to notify us should </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>294</b>  
</p>
<p>you receive information that any harm has been done so that those responsible can be held 
to account, should it be proven. 
</p>
<p>2102. Lastly, we wish to emphasize that Mr. Isma`il is a Syrian citizen and is protected by 
the Syrian Constitution and Syrian laws. He is subject to the judicial procedures set out in 
Syrian criminal law, which is consistent with all international conventions, charters and 
standards and with the common practice of most countries of the world. We wish to 
underscore that should an investigating judge find during the investigation that there is 
sufficient evidence to charge him and bring him to trial before the criminal court, then Mr. 
Isma`il will be subject to a fair trial before a fair and impartial court. In addition, we wish to 
reaffirm that we are committed to continued cooperation with you and to replying to all 
your questions so that we can achieve our common goals of promoting and protecting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2103. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communications of 30 March 2011, 18 
February 2011, 9 February 2011, and to three earlier communications sent on 25 November 
2010, 11 November 2010, 9 November 2010, 3 August 2009, and 2 February 2009. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2104. The Special Rapporteur would also like to express his ongoing concerns regarding 
lack of tolerance of dissent, including the use of state of emergency powers by the 
authorities to punish and silence critics, including bloggers, human rights defenders, 
political activists, and Kurdish minority rights activists. This includes arbitrary arrests, 
banning from travelling aboard, and arbitrary imprisonment following trials before the 
Supreme State Security Court or military or criminal courts which do not comply with 
international human rights norms and principles on the right to a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>2105. The Special Rapporteur remains watchful of the situation in the Syrian Arab 
Republic, and calls upon the Government to fully guarantee the rights of all individuals to 
exercise their right to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly.  
</p>
<p><b>  Tajikistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2106. On 9 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding 
<b>increased pressure on independent media in Tajikistan</b>, including launching of tax 
inspections of newspapers and publishing houses and blocking of websites. 
</p>
<p>2107. According to information received, on 19 September 2010, an army convoy was 
attacked by militants in Rasht Valley, which killed at least 25 Tajik soldiers. Following the 
attack, several newspapers criticized the Ministry of Defense for the way it handled the 
situation.  
</p>
<p>2108. On 25 September 2010, a statement was delivered by representatives of the Ministry 
of Defence at a news press conference, broadcast on State television channels, which 
reportedly accused the independent media of attempting to weaken the country&#8217;s leadership 
by criticizing the Government&#8217;s response to recent security challenges, including the event 
on 19 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>2109. Since 28 September 2010, tax evasion investigations have been initiated into several 
newspapers, including Farazh, Negah, Millat and Paykon, as well as private publishing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>295 
</b></p>
<p>houses, including Intishor, Mushfiji, and Olia-print. It has been reported that two major 
newspapers in the country, Farazh and Paykon, have not been published since 13 October 
2010, as publishing houses have refused to do so for allegedly &#8220;technical reasons&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2110. Since 29 September 2010, several Tajik and international websites have reportedly 
been blocked in the country, including www.fergana.ru, www.centrasia.ru, www.avesta.tj, 
and www.tjknews.com.  It has been alleged that these websites have been blocked 
following a letter from the Ministry of Transport and Communications to all Internet 
service providers in the country.  
</p>
<p>2111. On 4 October 2010, the Defence Minister issued a written statement which allegedly 
accused independent media of biased and one-sided coverage of the 19 September 2010 
attack and sympathizing with militants who attacked the convoy. He also reportedly 
referred to the criminal responsibility that offering support to terrorism may entail.  
</p>
<p>2112. Concern was expressed that the recent actions mentioned above constitute an 
attempt to restrict independent reporting and criticism in Tajikistan, thus stifling the right to 
freedom of expression in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2113. The Special Rapporteur expresses his regret that the Government has not responded 
to his communication dated 9 November 2010, and remains concerned about attempts to 
restrict independent reporting and criticism in Tajikistan. The Special Rapporteur considers 
response to his communications an important part of cooperation by Governments. He 
urges the Government to provide detailed information to concerns raised by him.   
</p>
<p><b>  Thailand 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2114. On 16 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent an allegation letter concerning the 
<b>blocking of websites and the signal of a news station, and the alleged use of excessive 
force by the security forces during clashes with anti-government protesters that 
resulted in the killing of at least 21 people.</b> 
</p>
<p>2115. According to information received, on 7 April 2010, Prime Minister Abhisit 
Vejjajiva declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and nearby provinces amid escalating 
anti-government protests spearheaded by the United Front for Democracy against 
Dictatorship (UDD), which began in early March.  
</p>
<p>2116. On 8 April 2010, the Minister Sathit Wongnongtoey of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office 
reportedly announced that the Government&#8217;s Centre for Public Administration in 
Emergency Situations had successfully blocked the signals of the People&#8217;s Television, 
which is operated by the UDD. The online news portal &#8220;Prachatai&#8221; (http://prachatai.com) 
was also allegedly blocked by order of Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban. In 
addition, 35 other websites, which are supportive of the UDD, were also reportedly shut 
down.  
</p>
<p>2117. During the clashes on 10 April 2010, live ammunition was allegedly used by 
security forces against the protesters. At least 21 people were killed, including 4 military, 
16 civilians and over 700 persons were injured. Among those killed was a television 
cameraman with Reuters, Mr. Hiro Muramoto, 43 years old, who died from a bullet wound 
in the chest.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>296</b>  
</p>
<p>2118. According to the authorities, the protesters attempted to enter into the 1st Army 
Regiment compound and this triggered the need of a stronger response and the eventual 
recovery of the main rally site (Pan Fah Bridge site) from the protesters. We are informed 
that the authorities have indicated that the use of violence was necessary due to the actions 
of demonstrators who used violent methods to counter the advance of the security forces at 
the main rally site. 
</p>
<p>2119. With regard to the alleged blocking of websites and the signal of People&#8217;s 
Television, the Special Rapporteurs reiterated the principle enunciated by Human Rights 
Council Resolution 12/16, which calls on States, while noting that article 19, paragraph 3, 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) provides that the 
exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities, to refrain from imposing restrictions which are not consistent with 
paragraph 3 of that article, including on (iii) access to or use of information and 
communication technologies, including radio, television and the Internet.  
</p>
<p>2120. Additionally, the Special Rapporteurs requested from the Government information 
on the inquiries into the clashes and their outcomes, on the measures taken to hold those 
responsible for killings accountable, and on the measures taken to prevent further outbreaks 
of deadly clashes during protests.  
</p>
<p>2121. In this respect, the Special Rapporteurs noted that the ICCPR, to which Thailand is a 
party, provides that every individual has the right to life and security of the person, that this 
right shall be protected by law, and that no person shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her 
life (Article 6).   
</p>
<p>2122. With regard to the alleged killings from excessive use of force by the security forces, 
the Special Rapporteurs noted that Article 6 of the ICCPR which requires that force be used 
by law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary, and that force must be in 
proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved. As expressed in the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (&#8220;Basic Principles&#8221;), this 
requires that law enforcement officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means 
before resorting to the use of force (Basic Principles, Principle 4).  Further, whenever the 
lawful use of force is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall exercise restraint and act 
in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, minimize injury, and respect human life 
(Basic Principles, Principle 5). 
</p>
<p>2123. With regard to the allegation that the use of excessive force was justified, the Special 
Rapporteurs drew the attention of the Government to the Basic Principles, Principle 9 
which provides that &#8220;Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons 
except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious 
injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to 
life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent 
his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these 
objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly 
unavoidable in order to protect life.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>2124. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions has expounded in detail in his 
report presented to the Human Rights Council the notions of proportionality and necessity 
as they apply to the use of firearms. He notes on the one hand, that the applicable standard 
of necessity is that the resort to this potentially lethal measure must be made &#8220;only when 
less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives&#8221;. With respect to the use of 
firearms, the applicable standard of necessity is that the resort to this potentially lethal 
measure must be made &#8220;only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these 
objectives&#8221;.  In general, the way in which law enforcement officials should determine the 
necessary level of force is by starting at a low level and, in so far as that proves insufficient </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>297 
</b></p>
<p>in the particular case, graduating, or escalating, the use of force. Force should not normally 
be the first resort: so far as the circumstances permit, law enforcement officials should 
attempt to resolve situations through non-violent means, such as persuasion and 
negotiation. As expressed in the Basic Principles, &#8220;They may use force and firearms only if 
other means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result&#8221; 
(Basic Principles, Principle 4) If it should become necessary to use force, the level of that 
force should be escalated as gradually as possible. As a first step, officials should attempt to 
&#8220;restrain or apprehend the suspected offender&#8221; without using force that carries a high risk 
of death &#8212; perhaps by physically seizing the suspect. If the use of firearms does prove 
necessary, law enforcement officials should &#8220;give a clear warning of their intent to use 
firearms, with sufficient time for the warning to be observed, unless to do so would unduly 
place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to 
other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the 
incident&#8221; (Basic Principles, Principle 10). On the other hand proportionality deals with the 
question of how much force might be permissible; proportionality is a requirement 
additional to necessity. The principle of necessity will, thus, never justify the use of 
disproportionate force. If all proportionate measures have proved insufficient to apprehend 
a suspect, he or she must be permitted to escape. (2006<i> Report to the General Assembly 
(A/61/311, para 33-45)</i>. 
</p>
<p>2125. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to ensure that arbitrary or abusive 
use of force by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence (Basic 
Principles, Principle 7). There must be thorough, prompt and impartial investigations of all 
suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions. Superiors and other 
public officials may be held responsible for acts committed by officials under their 
authority if they had a reasonable opportunity to prevent such acts (Principle 19 of the 
Prevention and Investigation Principles, see also Principle 24 of the Basic Principles) &#8211; all 
the more so, if they ordered the executions.     
</p>
<p>2126. The Special Rapporteurs took note that the Government has proposed the 
establishment of a Committee to investigate the causes of death of persons that were killed 
during the clashes between the Security forces and the protesters. While commissions of 
inquiry may be a very appropriate measure in the case of inter-communal violence, they are 
not sufficient. Principle 18 of the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation 
of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (&#8220;Prevention and Investigation 
Principles&#8221;) provides that &#8220;Governments shall ensure that persons identified by the 
investigation as having participated in extra-legal, arbitrary or summary executions in any 
territory under their jurisdiction are brought to justice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2127. In a letter dated 19 November 2010, the Government responded to the 
communication sent on 16 April 2010, in which it provided additional information on the 
Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation B.E. 2548 (2005) to 
clarify the nature and implication of the Emergency Decree, allegations on the closure of 
media outlets, and the rights of those arrested during the incidents, among others.  
</p>
<p><i>  The use of Emergency Decree in certain areas of the country  
</i></p>
<p>2128. It is the Government&#8217;s intention to return to normal legal procedures as soon as 
possible. Accordingly, since the UDD protests ended, the Emergency Decree has already 
been lifted in 20 provinces where security agencies are certain that law and order can be 
maintained through normal measures. The Decree remains in effect in Bangkok and three 
surrounding provinces as a precautionary measure to enable security agencies to work in a 
more integrated, effective and expeditious manner to prevent a recurrence of violence.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>298</b>  
</p>
<p>2129. However, while the overall situation has returned to normalcy since the protests 
ended in May 2010, there continue to be attempts to instigate disturbances in Bangkok and 
its vicinity. Hence, it is necessary to remain vigilant.  
</p>
<p>2130. Be that as it may, the use of the Decree has not affected the ordinary people, whether 
locals or foreigners, in the conduct of their daily life and businesses. Even in the case of 
political activities, these have been allowed so long as they are conducted within the bounds 
of the law. For example, the Decree did not stand in the way of the UDD&#8217;s peaceful 
gatherings on 19 September and 10 October 2010 in Bangkok which were attended by 
several thousands of their supporters.  
</p>
<p>2131. All in all, the Government, in working to resolve the ongoing political conflict, has 
always given due respect to the principle of human rights, including civil and political 
rights. The Prime Minister takes all concerns related to human rights seriously and has 
recently ensured that there are measures to allow human rights monitors to interview people 
who have been detained.  
</p>
<p>2132. Furthermore, as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), Thailand has always been transparent about the exercise of its right of derogation 
under the Covenant in light of the declaration of a severe emergency situation in certain 
parts of the country. It has also been observing the letter and the spirit of the Thai 
Constitution, especially those provisions dealing with freedom of expression, and 
emphasizing as its core policy the importance of the rule of law and good governance.  
</p>
<p><i>  The allegations over the detainees under the Emergency Decree  
</i></p>
<p>2133. According to the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES), no 
individual is currently being held in custody under the Emergency Decree. Those held 
following the recent unrest have either already been released or charged in accordance with 
the Criminal Procedure Code. Currently, a total of 185 persons are being held in prisons, 
with give being held at the Central Women Correctional Institution, and twelve at youth 
Observation and Protection Centres &#8211; all under the normal judicial procedure. As for those 
charged and sentenced for violating the Emergency Decree &#8211; which carries a maximum 
penalty of two years&#8217; imprisonment or a fine of 40,000 baht, or both &#8211; they have been 
accorded due process of law in accordance with Thai criminal law and procedures.  
</p>
<p>2134. In any case, the Emergency Decree provides for various safeguards against human 
rights abuses, such as arbitrary detention, detainees&#8217; rights, risk of disappearance, as well 
asimpunity.  
</p>
<p>2135. On detention, the Emergency Decree provides for an adequate level of judicial 
oversight. The competent authorities do not possess arbitrary powers in arresting suspects. 
Section 12 of the Decree stipulates that the authorities must first seek court permission 
before making an arrest and detention shall not exceed seven days, and that court 
permission is required for extension of the custody period which can be extended by seven 
days at a time not to exceed a total period of thirty days. Upon the expiration of such 
period, if further detention is required, the competent official shall proceed under the 
normal Criminal Procedure Code. In addition, suspected persons shall not be treated as a 
convict.  
</p>
<p>2136. On detention locations, designated locations to be used for detaining suspects under 
the Decree have always been clearly specified, and the Decree provides that the competent 
official must file a report on the arrest and detention of suspected persons for submission to 
the court. A copy of such report shall be deposited at the office of the competent official so 
that relatives of the suspects may access such reports for the entire duration of the 
detention. There is therefore no risk of disappearances.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>299 
</b></p>
<p>2137. On the rights of detainees, the fundamental human rights of those arrested have 
always been fully respected and accorded in accordance with the Thai Constitution and 
within the perimeters of the ICCPR. Torture, cruel or degrading treatment is prohibited by 
the law. In addition, relatives of suspects and lawyers may visit the suspects.  
</p>
<p>2138. On impunity, the Emergency Decree does not provide &#8220;blanket immunity&#8221; for 
officers operating under it. Under Section 17 of the Decree, an official remains fully liable 
for any acts that are discriminatory, unreasonable, exteed the extent of necessity or are 
performed without good faith, and they could also be sued for civil liability in accordance 
with the law on liability for wrongful acts (Tortious Liability of Officials Act B.E. 2539 
(1996)). As officials know that they can be held accountable for abuses and mistreatment, 
the risk of human rights abuses is minimised. Indeed, Section 17 is not unique to Thailand 
as similar clauses appear in other countries&#8217; legislation dealing with emergency situation. 
Moreover, investigations being conducted into the events that occurred, including those 
carried out by the National Human Rights Commission, will cover the conduct of officials.  
</p>
<p>2139. The fundamental human rights of those arrested have thus been fully respected in 
accordance with the Thai Constitution and within the parameters of the ICCPR and other 
relevant international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p><i>  The allegations of the Government closing down the UDD&#8217;s satellite television and other 
forms of media such as community radio stations and newspapers  
</i></p>
<p>2140. Thailand respects freedom of the perss and restrictions have been applied only to the 
extent necessary to protect public order by preventing misuse of the media as mediums to 
spread false information and manipulate and incite violence and hatred among people, 
which contributed towards the widespread violence as witnessed during April &#8211; May 2010 
and could lead to further incidents. These have in no way affected the media in their normal 
dissemination of facts and information.  
</p>
<p>2141. Restricting expressions to prevent violence through incitement, such as hate 
speeches, is not uncommon. Several countries in Europe and elsewhere have prohibitions 
and restrictions for various reasons &#8211; some specific to their respective history or belief.  
</p>
<p><i>  Further clarifications on the nature of the Emergency Decree  
</i></p>
<p>2142. The Emergency Decree is a temporary, time-bound measure to address specific 
concerns. Each time it has been reviewed, it has been extended for months, after which the 
Cabinet has to consider whether to approve another three-month extension. The Decree is 
also area-bound in a sense that announcement has to be made where the Decree will be 
enforced.  
</p>
<p>2143. The Emergency Decree was promulgated with a view to enabling the competent 
officials responsible for addressing an emergency situation to act in an integrated and more 
effective manner.  
</p>
<p>2144. In normal circumstances, the legal power in dealing with emergency situations is 
dispersed over different legislations, such as the Constitution, the Criminal Code, the 
Criminal Procedures Code, the Special Investigation Act and the Anti-Money Laundering 
Act. This creates a problem in dealing with an emergency situation as responsibilities are 
given to different agencies and different ministries. But under the Emergency Decree, all 
the relevant laws are brought together under the same umbrella with a clearly deifned chain 
of command and division of authority and responsibility so that actions could be undertaken 
in a timely manner. In this regard, powers and responsibilities of the miniters concerned in 
relation to the emergency situation will be temporarily transferred to the prime minister. 
The prime minister may therefore decide to delegate the powers in question to one of the 
deputy prime ministers as deemed necessary. All these have to be identified in a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>300</b>  
</p>
<p>notification issued by the Council of Ministers. Likewise, measures as provided for under 
the Emergency Decree which are to be put into force have to be announced. Utmost care is 
taken to ensure that such measures are as necessary and proportionate, and would not 
unduly affect the general public.  
</p>
<p>2145. It should also be noted that as opposed to the Martial Law, the use of the Emergency 
Decree is under civilian control. It must be announced by the Prime Minister, with approval 
from the Cabinet, which must be either before the announcement is made or &#8211; in the case of 
compelling emergencies &#8211; within three days thereafter.  
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2146. On 1 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation concerning numerous 
arrests of and charges against Ms. <b>Chiranuch Premchaiporn</b>, editor of Prachatai, an 
online media portal that contains news, opinion and a discussion forum, for comments 
posted by readers on the website. Ms. Premchaiporn is also an advocate for freedom of 
expression and freedom of the media and is actively involved in the &#8220;Citizen Net&#8221; network 
which monitors the state of censorship in Thailand.  
</p>
<p>2147. According to information received, on 6 March 2009, Ms. Chiranuch Premchaiporn, 
also known as Jiew, was arrested on the basis of a warrant alleging that she violated articles 
14(1), 14(3), 14(5) and 15 of the Computer Crimes Act for having allowed readers to post 
comments on Prachatai&#8217;s online discussion forum that allegedly defamed the King of 
Thailand. On 31 March 2010, she was arrested again for the same alleged offence, but with 
the additional charge of violating the l&#232;se majest&#233; provision of the Criminal Code (article 
112).  
</p>
<p>2148. On 24 September 2010, Ms. Chiranuch Premchaiporn was arrested at Suvarnabhumi 
airport in Bangkok upon returning from her trip to Lithuania and Hungary, where she 
participated in the Internet Governance Forum organized by the United Nations and a 
conference on Internet freedom organized by Google and the Central European University 
respectively. At passport control, immigration officers allegedly took her to the 
immigration office for questioning for two hours, after which she was transported in a 
police car to Khon Kaen police station, located approximately 450 kilometres from 
Bangkok. She was allegedly shown an arrest warrant relating to material posted on the 
Prachatai website in April 2008 which, according to the warrant, violated the same 
provisions as those listed in the previous warrants.  
</p>
<p>2149. On 25 September 2010 at approximately 1:00 a.m., Ms. Premchaiporn was released 
on bail after paying a 200,000 baht fine (approximately USD 6,500). She was required to 
report to the Khon Khaen Muang district police station every month. Her next mandatory 
visit to the police station was scheduled on 24 October 2010. Ms. Chiranuch Premchaiporn 
was awaiting trial for the charges mentioned above, which in total could lead to a 50-year 
prison sentence.   
</p>
<p>2150. Serious concern was expressed regarding the numerous charges against Ms. 
Chiranuch Premchaiporn, as she is being held liable for content that she herself did not 
write. Further concern was expressed regarding the l&#232;se majest&#233; provision of the Criminal 
Code (article 112) which unduly limits the right of all individuals to peaceful freedom of 
expression, as communicated to your Excellency&#8217;s Government on numerous occasions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Responses from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2151. In a letter dated 6 October 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 1 October 2010 as follows. The above-mentioned matter has been duly forwarded to 
the concerned authorities for further examination. Thailand, as an open society, upholds the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>301 
</b></p>
<p>people&#8217;s right to freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed by the Constitution.  The 
exercise of such rights, however, must bear in mind considerations regarding national 
stability and social harmony.  Importantly, it has to be in accordance with the law and 
viewed in a societal context.  Views that are disrespectful of the monarchy, or advocate 
hatred or hostile feelings towards this important national institution, or those which incite 
hatred or violence are generally unacceptable in the Thai society.   
</p>
<p>2152. In fact, article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
stipulates that the exercise of freedom of expression &#8220;carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities&#8221; and the exercise of this right &#8220;may therefore be subject to certain 
restrictions but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary for respect 
of the rights and reputation of others&#8221;. In this regard, the legal proceedings against Ms. 
Pemchaiporn are in accordance with Thai law.  Furthermore, Ms. Pemchaiporn has been 
and will be accorded due process as provided by the Thai Criminal Code, including the 
right to fair trial, due opportunity to contest the charges and assistance from her lawyer.  
</p>
<p>2153. In another letter dated 17 February 2011, the Government informed that the Court 
has not yet ruled on the case of Ms. Premchaiporn, and further witness hearings are 
scheduled in September 2011. Therefore, it is important not to prejudge the decision of the 
Court at this stage. Ms. Premchaiporn has been freed on bail.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2154. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the replies received to his 
communications sent during the reporting period. However, he regrets that at the time of 
the finalization of this report, the Government had not transmitted a response to seven 
communications sent earlier on 28 August 2009, 16 March 2007, 28 March 2006, 10 
November 2005, 7 October 2005, 28 June 2004, and 27 May 2004. He urges the 
Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information 
regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective 
measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2155. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his ongoing concerns regarding 
restrictions to the right to freedom of opinion and expression in Thailand, mainly through 
the Emergency Decree, lese majest&#233; law (as set out in article 112 of the Penal Code), and 
Computer-related Crimes Act of 2007. Despite his concerns raised in his communication of 
16 April 2010, he regrets that access to tens of thousands of websites continues to be 
blocked on the grounds of national security and breaches of lese majest&#233; law. The Special 
Rapporteur also expresses his serious concern regarding recent increase in the number of 
lese majest&#233; cases reportedly being investigated by the police and accepted by the courts, 
leading to a broader chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>2156. While the Special Rapporteur appreciates the replies received from the Government 
of Thailand to justify the necessity of lese majest&#233; law, he remains concerned that there are 
insufficient guarantees to ensure that the right to freedom of expression is not unduly and 
arbitrarily restricted, and that there are disproportionate penalties imposed, both of which 
leads to a broader chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression in the country, 
including in the academia. The Special Rapporteur thus urges the Government to consider 
repealing or amending the problematic provisions to bring them into conformity with 
international human rights standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression.  </p>

cadre des protestations des mois de d&#233;cembre 2010 et janvier 2011</b>. 
</p>
<p>2169. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, le 17 d&#233;cembre 2010, M. Mohamed Bouazizi, 26 ans, 
jeune dipl&#244;m&#233; de l&#8217;universit&#233;, se serait immol&#233; devant le si&#232;ge des autorit&#233;s de la ville de 
Sidi Bouzid, &#224; environ 200 km de Tunis, afin de protester contre la confiscation par la 
police de sa charrette de fruits et l&#233;gumes, sa seule source de revenus. Le 2 janvier 2011, &#224; 
la suite de deux semaines pass&#233;es en soins intensifs, il aurait succomb&#233; &#224; ses blessures. Cet 
incident aurait d&#233;clench&#233;, depuis lors, une vague de protestations contre les conditions de 
vie, le ch&#244;mage et la corruption &#224; travers le pays. 
</p>
<p>2170. Dans ce contexte, les 8 et 9 janvier 2011, les forces de s&#233;curit&#233; auraient ouvert le feu 
sur des manifestants dans les villes de Thala, Kasserine et Regueb, dans le centre de la 
Tunisie, entra&#238;nant le d&#233;c&#232;s d&#8217;au moins 21 personnes, chiffre par ailleurs confirm&#233; par les 
autorit&#233;s tunisiennes. 
</p>
<p>2171. Depuis, les manifestations se seraient poursuivies et le pays aurait connu, ces 
derniers jours, une escalade de la violence. La police aurait lanc&#233; des grenades

descentes nocturnes prenant pour cible des d&#233;fenseurs des droits de l&#8217;homme, journalistes,

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2180. On 21 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to 
the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and the 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr. <b>Murad Akincilar</b>, born in 1962, secretary 
of the labour union UNIA at Geneva and political refugee in Switzerland. 
</p>
<p>2181. According to the information received, on 30 September 2009, at 8 a.m., Mr. Murad 
Akincilar was arrested by police in Istanbul, where he wanted to visit his sick mother. He 
was held and interrogated at length numerous times in a police lock-up in Istanbul until 4 
October 2009. He was then transferred to Metris Prison (Istanbul) and later to Edurne 
Prison, 300 km north of Istanbul, where he is currently being detained without charges. 
</p>
<p>2182. Mr. Murad Akincilar has not been provided with any information on the crime he is 
suspected of, nor has he received an official indictment. This situation renders it difficult 
for him to defend himself or challenge his detention. It appears that his detention may be 
based on political motives, since he has published two articles in a journal critical of the 
Government (&quot;Demokratik D&#246;n&#252;s&#252;m&quot;), and has been politically active in an organisation 
named &quot;Devrimci Karag&#226;t&quot;. 
</p>
<p>2183. In the course of the interrogations at the police in the beginning of October 2009, he 
was allegedly deprived of sleep on numerous occasions and was a number of times forced 
to look into extremely bright lights. Due to this treatment, it is reported that Mr. Murad 
Akincilar is loosing his eyesight because of retinal detachment. He started encountering 
problems with his eyesight on 11 October, while detained in Metris Prison. However, the 
responsible officials allegedly refused to grant him medical care. During his transfer from 
Metris to Edurne Prison over a distance of 300 km he was reportedly shackled with chains; 
a week after the transfer, his wife could still observe that his legs were swollen and that he 
bore serious haematoma. On 16 October 2009, Mr. Murad Akincilar went on hunger strike, 
demanding urgent medical consultation for his eyes, which was eventually granted the same 
evening. Despite two belated operations on his eyes, he has lost already 65% of his eyesight 
of his right eye. On 26 March 2010, a further retinal detachment in his left eye was 
diagnosed and he again underwent surgery. 
</p>
<p>2184. Concern was expressed regarding the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. 
Murad. With a view to his rapidly deteriorating eyesight, particular concern was expressed 
at the conditions of detention and the lack of medical care. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2185. On 23 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, sent an allegation 
letter concerning <b>continued prosecutions against and sentencing of journalists under 
the Law to fight terrorism, Act 3713, as amended, (henceforth Anti-Terror Act), in 
particular article 7 which prohibits &#8220;spreading propaganda relating to a terrorist 
organization&#8221;</b>. 
</p>
<p>2186. According to information received, on 4 June 2010, Mr. <b>Irfan Aktan</b> was sentenced 
to a year and three months imprisonment for an article he wrote regarding the strategy of 
the Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party (PKK) entitled &#8220;Weather Conditions in the Region and in 
Qandil: No Solution without Fighting&#8221;, which was published in Express magazine on 15 
October 2009. Mr. Merve Erol, editor of the magazine, was sentenced to a fine of 16,000 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>306</b>  
</p>
<p>Turkish Lira. Both were found guilty of dispersing propaganda material relating to a 
terrorist organization in violation of article 7(2) of the Anti-Terror Act.   
</p>
<p>2187. In a separate trial held on the same day, Mr. <b>Filiz Kocali</b>, former publisher of 
Gunluk, and Mr. Ramazan Pekgoz, its editor, and Mr. Ziya Cicekci, its owner, were 
sentenced to seven and a half years in prison each under the same article of the Anti-Terror 
Act for reports published on 8 and 9 August 2009. These reports allegedly contained 
interviews carried out in Northern Iraq with Murat Karayylan, the top commander of the 
PKK.  
</p>
<p>2188. On 10 June 2010, Mr. <b>Ragip Zarakolu</b>, who has been on trial since May 2009 on 
charges of violation of article 7(2) of the Anti-Terror Act for publishing a novel entitled 
&#8220;More Difficult Decisions than Death&#8221; written by Mr. Mehmet Guler, was acquitted. 
However, at the same trial, Mr. Mehmet Guler was convicted to a fifteen month prison term 
for &#8220;spreading propaganda&#8221; of the PKK.  
</p>
<p>2189. While the Special Rapporteurs welcomed the acquittal of Mr. Zarakolu, concern was 
expressed that repeated and frequent use of the Anti-Terror Act against journalists whose 
writings are unfavourable to the Government stifles the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in the country. In this regard, the Special Rapporteurs noted that a total of 103 
people, including 15 journalists, were arraigned in the first four months of 2010 alone on 
charges related to the Anti-Terror Act.  
</p>
<p>2190. With a view to the overly broad application of the term terrorism in the Anti-Terror 
Act, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism in his report on the visit to the country in 
2006 (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 14, 18, 28-33), expressed his concern about prosecutions 
for acts related to freedom of expression, association and assembly in relation to the notion 
of terrorism. In this report, he also highlighted that there are elements both in the Anti-
Terror Act which may put severe limitations on the legitimate expression of opinions 
critical of the Government or State institutions, on the forming of organizations for 
legitimate purposes, and on the freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>2191. Given the above, the Special Rapporteurs appealed to the Government to take all 
necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, which provides that &#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of 
expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and 
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of 
art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2192. In addition, the Special Rapporteurs made reference to Human Rights Council 
Resolution 12/16, para. 5 o), which calls upon States to refrain from using counter-
terrorism as a pretext to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in ways that 
are contrary to their obligations under international law. Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs 
wish to draw your Excellency&#8217;s Government&#8217;s attention to resolutions of the Human Rights 
Council (13/26, para. 1) and of the General Assembly (64/168) which reaffirmed that States 
must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism comply with their obligations 
under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian 
law. 
</p>
<p>2193. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons are respected and that 
effective measures are adopted to prevent the recurrence of these acts.   </p>

<p><b>  Response received to a communication sent earlier 
</b></p>
<p>2194. In a letter dated 18 March 2011, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 7 January 2010, regarding Mr. <b>Muharrem Erbey</b> and the <b>Human Rights Association 
(Insan Haklari Dernegi &#8211; IHD)</b>. Mr. Erbey is a human rights lawyer, the General Vice-
Chairperson of IHD and the Chairperson of IHD&#8217;s Branch in Diyarbakir Province. The 
Human Rights Association <b>(Insan Haklari Dernegi &#8211; IHD) </b>works on, <i>inter alia</i>, the right 
to life and enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>2195. The Diyarbakir Chief Prosecutor initiated an investigation (No.20077997) pertaining 
to the activities of Koma Civaken Kurdistan (KCK) terrorist organization. As a result of the 
synchronic operations carried out on 24 December 2004 by the Diyarbakir, Batman, Bitlis, 
Mardin Siit, Sanliurfa, Surnak and Van Province Police headquarters and Diyarbakir-Silvan 
district headquarters, 27 people including Muharrem Erbey were taken into custody. It 
should be noted that these people were immediately before the judge on 25 December 2009.  
</p>
<p>2196. Contrary to allegations, in 24 hours Muharrem Erbey was brought before the Chief 
Public Prosecutor, without his statement being taken or being accused of any charges. 
Muharrem Erbey&#8217;s statement was taken by the Chief Public Prosecutor and following the 
Chief Public Prosecutors investigation (No.2007/996) he was heard by the Diyarbakir 
Heavy Penal Court and taken under detention pursuant to Article 314 of the Criminal Code 
Law No. 5237 for &#8220;being a member of an illegal terrorist organization&#8221; and was sent to 
Diyarbakir D type prison.  
</p>
<p>2197. On the other hand, in the framework of the pending Chief Public Prosecution&#8217;s 
investigation (No. 2007/996), the premises of Human Right Association was searched. 9 
hard disks were seized and copies of these disks were given to Serdar Celebi (registered 
lawyer to Diyarbakir Bar) on 11 January 2011 in accordance with the Chief Prosecutors 
instruction, in charge of the investigation.  
</p>
<p><b>   Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2198. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communications of 6 April 2011, 23 June 
2010 and 21 April 2010. He urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by 
him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent 
prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2199. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate his concerns regarding the use of 
various articles in the Penal Code to prosecute individuals for the expression critical views 
in relation to the armed forces, minority groups in Turkey, and ongoing criminal 
prosecutions such as the Ergenekon case. He also reiterates his concerns expressed in his 
communications regarding the use of anti-terrorism laws, which carry longer prison 
sentences and results in pre-trial detention orders, to restrict the right to freedom of 
expression. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned at continued blocking of 
access to websites in Turkey.  
</p>
<p><b>  Turkmenistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2200. On 1 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, sent an urgent appeal concerning an alleged plan to 
assassinate <b>Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin, </b>currently resident in Austria. Mr. Tukhbatullin is the 
director of the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TIHR), a non-governmental </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>308</b>  
</p>
<p>organisation founded in 2004 and based in Vienna, Austria. The TIHR publishes 
information and submits reports regarding the human rights situation in Turkmenistan.  
</p>
<p>2201. According to the information received, on 9 and 11 October 2010, Mr. Farid 
Tukhbatullin was informed by reliable sources that agents of the Ministry of National 
Security (MNS) of Turkmenistan were allegedly planning to assassinate him. According to 
said sources, Ministry officials had discussed assassinating Mr. Tukhbatullin in such a way 
as not to give rise to suspicion of foul play, such as through an orchestrated &#8220;accident&#8221; or 
by inducing heart failure. 
</p>
<p>2202. The alleged assassination plot had reportedly been linked to an interview given by 
Mr. Tukhbatullin concerning the TIHR&#8217;s assessment of the human rights situation in 
Turkmenistan. The interview was broadcast on the satellite television channel K+ on 28 and 
29 September 2010.  
</p>
<p>2203. In a possibly related incident, the TIHR&#8217;s website was subsequently attacked by an 
unknown group of hackers and was largely inaccessible for several days following the 
broadcast of the interview. 
</p>
<p>2204. It was reported that on 18 October 2010, Mr. Tukhbatullin, along with the founding 
chairman of the Republican Party of Turkmenistan in exile, Mr. Nurmuhammet Khanamov, 
were denied registration as participants in the OSCE Review Conference at Hofburg Palace, 
Vienna. However, On 19 October 2010, the decision was taken to grant Messrs 
Tukhbatullin and Khanamov admission to the conference, which allegedly prompted the 
official delegation of Turkmenistan to leave the conference room.  
</p>
<p>2205. It was reported that the Turkmen authorities have on various occasions attempted to 
hinder the work of the TIHR, such as through attempting to identify its correspondents 
within Turkmenistan, whose identities are not disclosed. It was alleged that in June 2010, 
officials from the MNS visited several schools in Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s former home town, 
and interviewed former classmates, teachers, and friends of Mr. Tukhbatullin&#8217;s sons with a 
view to identifying such correspondents. 
</p>
<p>2206. It had also been reported that in April 2008, Mr. Tukhbatullin was warned by a 
Turkmenistani diplomat to &#8220;tone down&#8221; criticism of the Turkmenistani authorities on his 
organization&#8217;s website, or cease his activities entirely. 
</p>
<p>2207. Mr. Tukhbatullin, who has worked on environmental and human rights issues in 
Turkmenistan since 1993, was arrested and imprisoned in Turkmenistan in December 2002, 
allegedly as a result of his human rights activities. Following his release from prison in 
April 2003, he left Turkmenistan for Austria, where he was granted refugee status, and 
founded the TIHR in November 2004.  
</p>
<p>2208. Concern was expressed that the alleged plot to assassinate Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin 
may be related to his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights in 
Turkmenistan. In this connection, serious concern was also expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Mr. Farid Tukhbatullin and his family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2209. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 1 November 2010. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2210. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate his deep concern at the severe restrictions 
on the freedom of expression in the country, and the suppression of all forms of dissent. He </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>309 
</b></p>
<p>is seriously concerned by reports of harassment and intimidation of journalists and human 
rights defenders, particularly after the call made by the President to the Security Ministry to 
fight those who &#8220;defame our law-based democratic state&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to guarantee all individuals&#8217; right to freedom of opinion and expression, and to 
promote an open environment where individuals can express diverse and critical views and 
opinions without fear of harassment or persecution.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2211. On 22 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter regarding the 
<b>proposed amendment to the 1995 Ugandan Press and Journalist Act</b>, which is currently 
before the Ugandan cabinet. 
</p>
<p>2212. According to information received, the Press and Journalist (Amendment) Bill 2010 
(hereafter the &#8220;proposed bill&#8221;), if adopted, will amend the 1995 Ugandan Press and 
Journalist Act. According to the proposed bill, newspapers will be required to submit an 
annual application to the Media Council to obtain operating licenses. It is further stated that 
the Media Council can revoke the licence of an outlet if it publishes material deemed to be 
&#8220;prejudicial to national security, stability and unity&#8221;, which is &#8220;injurious to Ugandan 
relations with new neighbours or friendly countries&#8221;, or causes &#8220;economic sabotage&#8221;. The 
Media Council may also deny licenses based on factors such as &#8220;social, cultural and 
economic values of the newspaper&#8221;, and &#8220;proof of existence of adequate technical 
facilities&#8221;. In addition, although the members of the Media Council are already appointed 
by the Government, the proposed amendment further stipulates that the Information 
Minister will nominate its Chairman.  
</p>
<p>2213. Concern was expressed that the provisions of the proposed amendment will further 
restrict the right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>2214. In particular, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that the bases on which the 
licenses of newspapers may be revoked are ambiguous, broadly-worded and subject to 
abuse. In this regard, he recalled that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR), which has been ratified by the Government on 21 June 1995, 
provides that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice&#8221;. Although article 19(3) of the ICCPR provides that the right to 
freedom of expression may be subject to certain restrictions, the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted the principle enunciated in the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, 
Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, as endorsed in E/CN.4/1996/39 of 1996, 
that any law restricting the right must be accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly and 
with precision so as to enable individuals to foresee whether a particular action is unlawful. 
The proposed amendment as it currently stands does not meet these criteria, as it is unclear 
what kinds of expression may be considered &#8220;prejudicial&#8221; to national security, stability and 
unity. Moreover, expression deemed to be &#8220;injurious to Ugandan relations with new 
neighbours or friendly countries&#8221; or those that cause &#8220;economic sabotage&#8221; are not one of 
the permissible grounds listed under article 19(3) on the basis of which the right to freedom 
of expression may be restricted.  
</p>
<p>2215. Moreover, the appointment of the Chairman of the Media Council by the 
Information Minister raises concerns regarding the independence and impartiality of the 
body that is mandated to grant or revoke the licenses of newspapers.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>310</b>  
</p>
<p>2216. Furthermore, the provisions in the proposed amendment which grants the Media 
Council the authority to deny newspaper licenses based on &#8220;social, cultural and economic 
values of the newspaper&#8221; or &#8220;proof of existence of adequate technical facilities&#8221; may entail 
that only well-funded media houses which support the official line of the Government will 
be allowed to publish.  
</p>
<p>2217. Given these concerns, the Special Rapporteur appealed to the Government to ensure 
that any proposed amendment to the existing Media Law is in line with the Government&#8217;s 
obligations under international human rights law, in particular with article 19 of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2218. On 12 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an allegation letter concerning Mr. <b>Joram 
Bintamanya</b>, Mr. <b>Prosper Businge</b> and Mr. <b>Gerald Kankya</b>, journalists and members of 
the &#8216;Twerwaneho Listeners Club&#8217;. Twerwaneho (&#8220;Let&#8217;s Fight for Ourselves&#8221;) Listeners 
Club is an non-governmental carrying out human rights advocacy through radio 
programmes and human rights monitoring. 
</p>
<p>2219. According to the information received, on 1 April 2010, Prosper Businge was 
summoned by the police in Fort Portal, interrogated and later released. On 6 April 2010, 
Mr. Joram Bintamanya and Mr. Gerald Kankya were arrested by the police in Fort Portal 
and interrogated about statements they allegedly made during a talk show on Better FM; a 
local radio station. During the talk show they have reportedly requested the Government to 
release the report into the 2007 death of the former permanent secretary of the Defence 
Ministry, Brigadier Noble Mayombo. A report by a team appointed by President Museveni 
has reportedly not been made public.  
</p>
<p>2220. Mr. Gerald Kankya was released on the same day without charges. Mr. Joram 
Bintamanya was released on bail the following day, 7 April 2010 and charged with 
sedition. Since their release, Mr. Bintamanya and Mr. Businge have had to report to the 
police in Fort Portal on a weekly basis, where they are reportedly intimidated by police 
officers and warned to abandon their human rights activities. According to the information 
received, there has been no advancement in their case since April 2010.  
</p>
<p>2221. Concern was expressed that the arrest and interrogation of Mr. Joram Bintamanya, 
Mr. Prosper Businge and Mr. Gerald Kankya may be related to their peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights, in particular their exercise of freedom of opinion and expression. 
Further concern was expressed regarding the requirement of reporting weekly to the police 
while the criminal case against them is open, since this may be applied as a means to force 
them to abandon their human rights activities.  
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2222. On 23 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, 
the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms while countering terrorism, sent and urgent appeal regarding the arrest and 
current situation of <b>Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi</b>, of Kenyan nationality and Executive 
Coordinator of Muslims Human Rights Forum (MHRF), and <b>Mr. Mbugua Mureithi</b>, of 
Kenyan nationality and a human rights lawyer.  Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi has worked to 
expose and document human rights violations, arbitrary detention and unlawful renditions 
in the context of counter-terrorism operations in the East and Horn of Africa. Mr. Mbugua 
Mureithi represents the families of Kenyan suspects transferred to Uganda on allegations of 
involvement in the 11 July 2010 bombings in Kampala. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>311 
</b></p>
<p>2223. According to the information received, on 16 September 2010, the Ugandan police 
arrested the two Kenyan human rights defenders at the Entebbe International Airport. Both 
men were travelling to Kampala for the court hearing of Kenyan suspects arrested in 
connection with the bombings that killed 70 people in Kampala on 11 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>2224. According to reports received, the two human rights defenders were transferred to 
the Rapid Response Unit headquarters in Kireka, a suburb of Kampala, where they were 
reportedly held incommunicado and had no access to a lawyer.  
</p>
<p>2225. It had been reported that on 18 September 2010 Mr. Mbugua Mureithi was released 
from police custody in Kampala and immediately expelled to Kenya. Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi 
was reportedly held incommunicado at the Ugandan police&#8217;s Rapid Response Unit 
Headquarters in Kireka, Kampala, without charges or access to legal representation, until 
21 September.  On this date, it had been reported that Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi was brought 
before a judge and remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison on charges of murder 
and attempted murder as well as terrorism-related charges in connection with the bombings 
that took place in Kampala in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>2226. Due to their arrest, detention and, in the case of Mr. Mureithi, expulsion, the two 
men had not had a chance to meet with their clients, who are charged with offences 
including murder and terrorism, punishable by death under Ugandan law. The court case 
involving their clients had continued in their absence. 
</p>
<p>2227. Concern was expressed at the arrest of Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi and Mr. Mbugua 
Mureithi and at allegations received that their arrest could be linked to their work, 
respectively as human rights lawyer and in denouncing and documenting unlawful practices 
by the authorities in counter-terrorism operations.  Further concern was expressed about 
allegations indicating that Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi had no access to a lawyer since the time of 
his arrest and until he was remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison.   
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2228. On 1 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions, sent an allegation letter concerning the death threats 
against and subsequent murder of <b>Mr. David Kato</b>. Mr. Kato was the advocacy officer of 
Sexual Minorities Uganda, a coalition of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
human rights organizations working to promote the human rights of the LGBT community 
in Uganda. 
</p>
<p>2229. According to the information received, on 26 January 2011, at approximately 13:00 
a man entered the home of David Kato and hit him twice on the head. The man then fled 
the scene by car. Mr. Kato died on his way to Kawolo hospital as a result of injuries 
sustained during the beating.  
</p>
<p>2230. In recent months Mr. Kato had received numerous death threats in connection with 
his work on LGBT rights, and especially following the publication of an article entitled 
&#8220;Hang them&#8221; in Rolling Stones, a local newspaper. The article provided names, addresses 
and photos of members and perceived members of the LGBT community in Uganda. Mr. 
Kato&#8217;s photo was featured on the front cover. Although the motives of his attacker have not 
yet been clearly determined, Mr. Kato is a well-known public figure and face of the LGBT 
movement in Uganda, and has long been considered a prime target for anti-gay vigilantism.  
</p>
<p>2231. According to information received, the murder of Mr. Kato forms part of an 
increasing trend of attacks and intimidation against human rights defenders, particularly 
those working on LGBT issues. The attacks take place against a background of media 
reports which appear to incite discrimination, hostility and violence, as well as proposed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>312</b>  
</p>
<p>legislation to further entrench the criminalization of homosexuality and to provide for 
increased criminal penalties against persons found to be homosexual. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2232. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of finalizing the present report, the 
Government of Uganda has not responded to the communications sent during the reporting 
period, and has not responded to any of the 8 communications sent earlier. He considers 
response to his communications an important part of cooperation by Governments, and 
urges the Government to respond to concerns raised by him and provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, prosecutions as well as protective 
measures taken.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>2233. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern about the situation of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in Uganda, including the proposed Press and Journalists 
(Amendment) Bill, as conveyed in his communication of 22 April 2010. He urges the 
Government to respond to the concerns expressed in his communication and to ensure that 
any new legislation which may restrict the right to freedom of expression is in full 
compliance with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b>  Ukraine 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2234. On 21 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding <b>Mr. Andrey 
Fedosov</b>, a human rights activist and member of the non-governmental organization &#8216;Uzer&#8217; 
(Ukrainian organization of users of psychiatric care), which monitors conditions in 
psychiatric institutions in the Crimea.  
</p>
<p>2235. According to the information received, during the week of 19 April 2010, Mr. 
Fedosov and his organization, Uzer, monitored the living conditions in six public 
psychiatric hospitals in the Crimea. They found the conditions in three of these institutions, 
namely the Crimea Republican Psychiatric Hospitals No. 2 and 4, and City Psychiatric 
Hospital No. 3 in Fedosia so poor that the NGO asked the prosecutor&#8217;s office to initiate 
investigations. On 25 April 2010, Mr. Fedosov announced on his Facebook page his 
intention to file a complaint with the prosecutor&#8217;s office regarding conditions in the three 
psychiatric institutions mentioned. On the same day, he received a phone call from an 
individual who identified himself as Nikolai Vasilievich, warning him not to make his 
findings public and threatening that his life could be in danger.  
</p>
<p>2236. On 11 May 2010, Mr. Fedosov was attacked and beaten by several unknown 
assailants in Evpatoria, where Uzer was preparing to host a workshop. Mr. Fedosov 
sustained minor injuries and was briefly hospitalized in the evening of 11 May 2010. Mr. 
Fedosov has reported the threats to the prosecutor&#8217;s office.  
</p>
<p>2237. Concern is expressed that the threats and attack against Mr. Andrey Fedosov may be 
connected to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular his activities to 
monitor conditions in psychiatric institutions in Ukraine. In light of the threats and attack, 
further concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Fedosov.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2238. On 3 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent an urgent appeal regarding an attack against 
<b>Mr. Timur Lysenko and Ms. Anastasia Medco</b>, along with other members of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>313 
</b></p>
<p>organisations Insight, Fulcrum, and the Visual Cultural Centre in Kiev, Ukraine. Insight is 
an organisation that works to improve the lives of people who identify themselves as part of 
the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community in Ukraine. The 
Visual Cultural centre is a platform for the integration of contemporary artistic practices 
and scientific disciplines within the academic field.  
</p>
<p>2239. According to the information received, on 20 November 2010, Insight organized a 
candlelight vigil, film exhibition and discussion on transgender issues, in cooperation with 
the Visual Cultural Centre, to promote the Transgender Day of Remembrance held in 
memory of those who have been killed due to anti-transgender violence in Ukraine.  
</p>
<p>2240. While the film was being screened, a group of ten men wearing masks reportedly 
attempted to enter the Visual Cultural Centre by force; however, they were denied entrance 
by the organizers of the event including Mr. Timur Lysenko, the coordinator of the 
transgender programme of Insight. The masked men consequently attacked and beat Mr. 
Lysenko. Furthermore, before fleeing, the intruders reportedly also sprayed tear gas at those 
present, severely injuring Mr. Lysenko and Ms. Anastasia Medco, a representative of the 
NGO Fulcrum, among others. It is reported that Mr. Lysenko was subsequently hospitalised 
and diagnosed with internal injuries and facial chemical burns. 
</p>
<p>2241. Numerous complaints had reportedly been lodged with the police regarding the 
attack which, it is reported, was characterised by the police as &#8220;hooliganism&#8221;. The alleged 
victims, however, claim that it bears the hallmark of a planned attack with the intention of 
disrupting an LGBTI event, and have thus urged the police to characterise the attack as a 
hate crime. The police, however, have reportedly refused to do so. 
</p>
<p>2242. Concern was expressed that the attacks against Mr. Timur Lysenko and Ms. 
Anastasia Medco may be related to their legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human 
rights, particularly with regard to the LGBTI community in Ukraine. Further concern was 
expressed that these acts, if confirmed, would reflect a context of increasing violence and 
other forms of harassment against LGBTI organisations in Ukraine.   
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government  
</b></p>
<p>2243. In a letter dated 21 February 2011, the Government replied to the communication 
sent on 3 December 2010 by transmitting information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
of Ukraine with regard to the official inquiry into the report of bodily injury sustained by 
Ms. A.A. Medko and Mr. T.V. Lysenko, as follows.  
</p>
<p>2244. It has been established that on 20 November 2010, in the building of the Visual 
Culture Research Centre, which is located on the premises of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy 
(No. 2, Skovoroda Street), Mr. T.V. Lysenko, manager of the non-governmental 
organization &#8220;Insight&#8221;, organized a candlelight vigil, a film screening and a discussion to 
commemorate the day of remembrance of victims of violence against transsexuals in 
Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>2245. Following the film screening, some 10 youths wearing black clothing and masks 
gathered outside the Centre and attempted to enter the building using force. Two of the 
participants in the event, Ms. A.A. Medko and Mr. T.V. Lysenko, attempted to restrain 
them at the entrance door, as a result of which Ms. Medko was punched in the face and Mr. 
Lysenko in the stomach. 
</p>
<p>2246. On 20 November 2010, Mr. T.V. Lysenko, Ms. A.A. Medko, D.A. Pichakhchi and 
D.S. Marchika presented themselves at the Podol District Department of the Main 
Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the city of Kyiv to report that they had 
sustained bodily injury during the struggle with the unidentified persons at the Visual 
Culture Research Centre. The applicants were recommended to undergo a forensic medical </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>314</b>  
</p>
<p>examination in order to establish the degree of seriousness of the bodily injuries sustained 
and were advised of the relevant procedure; however, they did not present themselves for 
such an examination.  
</p>
<p>2247. A police investigation team visited the scene of the incident to survey the site and to 
gather evidence. 
</p>
<p>2248. Citizens who had been on the premises of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in their free 
time and the security guards of the institution reported when interviewed that they had not 
seen any suspicious persons, nor had they been aware of any disturbances. 
</p>
<p>2249. It was established that arrangements for access to the premises of the Kyiv-Mohyla 
Academy were poor and that the entry of visitors was not controlled. 
</p>
<p>2250. As the result of consideration of the reports filed by the applicants with the Podol 
District Department, a decision not to institute criminal proceedings was issued on the basis 
of article 6 (Circumstances precluding criminal proceedings), paragraph 2, of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure of Ukraine and the applicants were notified accordingly. Efforts to 
establish the identity of the persons reported by the applicants to have committed acts of 
criminal mischief were unsuccessful.  
</p>
<p>2251. The decision issued by the office of the procurator for the Podol District of the city 
of Kyiv is considered to be justified and has been left unchanged. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2252. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the response to the 
communication sent on 3 December 2010, but regrets that the Government of Ukraine has 
not responded to the communication sent on May 2010. He considers response to his 
communications an important part of cooperation by Governments, and urges the 
Government to respond to concerns raised by him and provide detailed information 
regarding investigations undertaken, prosecutions as well as protective measures taken.

on the situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Chair-Rapporteur of the

<p>2254. According to the information received, on 4 February 2011, Mr. Hassan Mohamed 
Al Hamadi, a 52 year old human rights defender was arrested following a speech he made 
in support of the demonstrations in Egypt.  
</p>
<p>2255. Mr. Al Hamadi is an active member of the Teachers Association in the United Arab 
Emirates and a researcher on the occupied Palestinian territory. He was also a Vice-Chair of 
the Sharjah Educational Zone for 25 years, receiving a number of prizes. In 2007, he was 
fired from this position due to his calls for reform in the United Arab Emirates and his 
opinions regarding the question of the occupied Palestinian territory. Mr. Al Hamadi is also 
a member of the &#8220;Association calling for reform&#8221; (Jamiat Dawat Al Islah) which aims to 
institute reforms and enhance civil and political rights in the United Arab Emirates. 
According to the information received, Mr. Al Hamadi had previously been arrested in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>315 
</b></p>
<p>December 2008, while participating in the organization of a conference in protest at the 
events occurring in the Gaza strip.  
</p>
<p>2256. It is reported that in the hours preceding his arrest dated 4 February 2011, during the 
midday prayers at a mosque in Khor Fakkhan, Sharjah, Mr. Al Hamadi discussed the recent 
demonstrations against President Hosni Mubarak&#8217;s regime in Egypt. On that occasion, he 
expressed support with the demonstrators in Tahrir square and other Egyptian cities calling 
for democratic change in the country. 
</p>
<p>2257. As a result, on 4 February 2011, at 7:00 p.m., a number of police agents from Khor 
Fakhan and five members of the State Security Forces in plain clothes arrested Mr. Al 
Hamadi in the absence of an arrest warrant. For three days, Mr. Al Hamadi was held 
incommunicado in a solitary confinement at the police station of Khor Fakhan. According 
to the information received, Mr. Al Hamadi was allowed one call to his family on 6 
February 2011, during which he briefly explained his whereabouts and that he was soon 
going to be transferred.  
</p>
<p>2258. In the morning of 9 February 2011, Mr. Al Hamadi was transferred to the 
headquarters of the State Security in Abu Dhabi. It is reported that Mr. Al Hamadi has not 
been officially charged nor has he been informed of the reasons justifying his detention. 
Mr. Al Hamadi has had no access to a lawyer or family visits. Given that Mr. Al Hamadi 
suffers from diabetes, concerns are expressed at the fact that he might not have access to 
prescribed medicine.    
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2259. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of the United Arab Emirates 
has not responded to the communication sent on 16 February 2011, and to an earlier 
communication sent on 15 February 2010. He considers response to his communications an 
important part of cooperation by Governments, and urges the Government to respond to 
concerns raised by him and provide detailed information regarding investigations 
undertaken, prosecutions as well as protective measures taken.

<p><b>  Allegation letter 
</b></p>
<p>2260. On 11 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sent a 
letter of allegation concerning the sentencing of <b>Mr. Maxim Popov</b>, psychologist, founder 
and director of the non-governmental organization Izis, founded by young medical 
professionals which works on HIV/AIDS prevention. Izis has also implemented HIV 
prevention activities, including under contracts with UNICEF, UNFPA and UNAIDS.  
</p>
<p>2261. According to the information received, Mr. Maxim Popov was arrested in January 
2009 and convicted in July 2009. His conviction was publicly disclosed only at the end of 
February 2010. Mr. Popov was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for charges which 
included theft by embezzlement, concealment of foreign currency, tax evasion, inducing 
minors to antisocial behaviour, indecent assault without violence against a minor and 
inducing engagement in the use of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. 
</p>
<p>2262. It is believed that Mr. Popov was convicted in connection with writing and 
distributing HIV/AIDS prevention materials. Mr. Maxim Popov is the author of the 
brochure &#8220;HIV and AIDS today&#8221;, a publication funded by UNAIDS and UNICEF. He was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>316</b>  
</p>
<p>also convicted for distributing HIV prevention materials published by UNAIDS and other 
UN agencies to adolescents that explicitly refer to drug use, sex work and homosexuality.  
</p>
<p>2263. Concern was expressed that the arrest and sentencing of Mr. Maxim Popov may be 
related to his peaceful activities in defence of human rights, in particular his work on 
HIV/AIDS prevention  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2264. In a letter dated 30 June 2010, the Government responded to the communication sent 
on 11 May 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>2265. IZIS, a voluntary organization, was registered in 2003 with the Tashkent Justice 
Department as a legal entity, with Maxim Popov, an Uzbek national, as director. The 
organization&#8217;s basic aims were to work on problems relating to the education, health and 
social protection of children and to assist in the social integration of the aged, the poor or 
other vulnerable sections of society. 
</p>
<p>2266. In accordance with article 21 of the Non-State Non-Commercial Organizations Act, 
the Tashkent Justice Department, as the registering body, carried out checks on IZIS in 
2008 to ensure that it was carrying out its statutory aims and purposes and acting in 
accordance with the law.  The checks showed that the organization conducted its activities 
under agreements concluded with a number of international organizations, including the 
local office of the foreign non-governmental organization Population Service International 
(PSI), and with United Nations agencies in Uzbekistan, such as the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF).  In 
partnership with these organizations, IZIS carried out a wide variety of projects, aimed 
largely at injection-drug users and persons living with HIV. 
</p>
<p>2267. In the course of the verification process, it was found that the requirements of the 
statute had been breached and that there had been violations of Uzbek law, some of them of 
a criminal nature.   
</p>
<p>2268. In order to avoid untoward consequences and to take the proper legal action against 
IZIS, the materials of the verification process were handed over to the public prosecutor&#8217;s 
office. 
</p>
<p>2269. According to information provided by the law enforcement agencies, criminal 
charges were brought against IZIS and, once the preliminary investigation had been 
completed, the case was transferred to Chilanzar District Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>2270. On 9 June 2009, the Chilanzar District Criminal Court found Maxim Vladimirovich 
Popov, the director of IZIS, guilty. It sentenced him to seven years&#8217; deprivation of freedom 
and stripped him of the right to hold any office involving the direction of an organization or 
economic administration for two years.  
</p>
<p>2271. In view of the above, and given the evidence of a number of breaches of the statute 
and the law in the activities of IZIS, the Tashkent Justice Department, as the registering 
body, applied to the Tashkent Civil Court for IZIS to be wound up. This application was 
granted on 30 September 2009. 
</p>
<p>2272. In accordance with the Court&#8217;s decision of 29 October 2009, the Central 
Administrative Board of the Tashkent Justice Department adopted the decision to terminate 
the activities of IZIS and to remove it from the register as a legal entity. 
</p>
<p><i>  The case of Maxim Popov 
</i></p>
<p>2273. Maxim Vladimirovich Popov, an Uzbek national and executive director of the 
voluntary organization IZIS, was found guilty by the Chilanzar District Criminal Court on 9 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>317 
</b></p>
<p>June 2009 of committing offences under articles 167, paragraph 3 (a); 178, paragraph 2 (a) 
and (c); 184, paragraph 3; 127, paragraph 3 (b) and (c); 129, paragraph 1; 274, paragraph 2 
(c); and, in accordance with articles 45, 59 and 61 of the Criminal Code, was sentenced to 
seven years&#8217; deprivation of freedom and stripped of the right to occupy any office relating 
to the direction of an organization or economic administration for two years. This sentence 
was upheld by the Tashkent Criminal Court, Appeal Division, on 14 July 2009. 
</p>
<p>2274. Popov&#8217;s criminal activities did not end there. Knowing that the rent of the IZIS 
office was paid for the period from January to December 2008 under the tripartite 
agreement, at a cost of $700 a month, Popov, acting in collusion with Kostyuchenko and in 
abuse of his official position, claimed $200 a month for the office rental for the period 
January-December 2008, with no justification, thus embezzling the grant resources 
entrusted to him in the amount of 802,000 sum.  
</p>
<p>2275. Over the period 4 June 2008 to 11 December 2008, Popov misappropriated material 
goods placed in his charge, in the form of 990 Shield contraceptives, valued at 47,900 sum, 
purchased with the funds provided by UNDP, 24 T-shirts worth 132,000 sum and 263 
vouchers worth 15,100 sum provided by the UNICEF office, at a total value of 193,100 
sum. 
</p>
<p>2276. Moreover, in pursuance of his vile beliefs, which led him to entice young people 
into using narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to encourage an antisocial and 
amoral way of life by acting on their unformed minds and outlook, Popov distributed in 
Uzbek educational establishments attended by schoolchildren and students engaging in 
academic, sporting or communal activities a book that promoted narcotic drug use and 
antisocial behaviour among the young over the period 2006&#8211;2007. The book was entitled 
Healthy Lifestyles. Teacher&#8217;s Guide XXI, 200 copies of which he had received under the 
contract with PSI. Popov was well aware of the nature of the book&#8217;s contents. 
</p>
<p>2277. Knowing what the book contained, Popov deliberately distributed this book with a 
view to the promotion of depraved acts by persons whom he knew to be under 16. The 
book contained texts instructing young people in sexual activities and propaganda for 
homosexuality, prostitution and pornographic images among young people, including those 
attending educational institutions in Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>2278. Popov&#8217;s guilt in respect of the offences in question is confirmed by witness 
statements, expert conclusions, checks, inventories, receipts and transfers, inspection and 
confiscation reports using material evidence, bills and other records required for a criminal 
case.  The Supreme Court is not in possession of any information relating to the use of 
impermissible investigation methods.  The sentence imposed on Popov has now become 
enforceable. 
</p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2279. On 28 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a letter of allegation concerning the situation 
of <b>Ms. Salomata Boimatova, Ms. Zoe Yangurazova, Ms. Gavkhar Ismoilova, Ms. 
Elena Urlaeva, Ms. Tatyana Dovlatova and Messrs. Rasulzhon Tadzhibaev, 
Akromkhodzhe Mukhitdinov, Vladimir Khusainov and Anatolii Baraksin</b>, members of 
the Human Rights Alliance of Uzbekistan, as well as of <b>Mr. Bakhodyr Namazov,</b> leader 
of the organization Committee of Prisoners of Conscience.  
</p>
<p>2280. According to the information received, on 12 April 2010, five policemen in plain 
clothes allegedly forcibly entered Ms. Dovlatova&#8217;s house. They asked her to follow them to 
the Khamzinsky police department in Tashkent. Following her refusal, they came back later 
the same day and allegedly searched her house. It is further alleged that during the house </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>318</b>  
</p>
<p>search, which was conducted without a search warrant, the police officers tried to forcefully 
bring her to the police station. 
</p>
<p>2281. On 13 May 2010, Ms. Boimatova, Ms. Yangurazova, Ms. Ismoilova, Ms. Urlaeva 
and Messrs. Tadzhibaev, Mukhitdinov, Namazov and Baraksin were allegedly prevented 
from leaving their houses to attend a commemoration of the 2005 Andijan events by 
officers of the Special Forces. It is also alleged that Ms. Dovlatova and Mr. Khusainov 
were prevented from reaching the place where the demonstration was being held by police 
officers. 
</p>
<p>2282. Concern was expressed the acts of intimidation against Ms. Boimatova, Ms. 
Yangurazova, Ms. Ismoilova, Ms. Urlaeva, Ms. Dovlatova and Messrs. Tadzhibaev, 
Mukhitdinov, Khusainov, Namazov and Baraksin might be directly related to their  
peaceful activities in the defense of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2283. In a letter dated 11 August 2010, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 28 May 2010 as follows. In respect of the allegations that special service officers 
prevented Ms. T. Davlatova, Ms. S. Boimatova, Ms. Z. Yanguzarova, Ms. G. Imoilova, Ms. 
E. Urlaeva, Mr. R. Tadzhibaev, Mr. A. Mukhitdinov, Mr. V. Khusainov, Mr. A. Baraksin 
and Mr. B. Namazov from leaving their houses to take part in a demonstration on 13 May 
2010, we would inform you that there were no demonstrations in the city of Tashkent on 
that day.  
</p>
<p>2284. No procedural or operational exercises were carried out by the Tashkent law 
enforcement agencies in respect of the individuals mentioned on 13 May 2010. 
</p>
<p><i>  Criminal proceedings against Ms. T. Davlatova 
</i></p>
<p>2285. At 9 a.m. on 8 January 2010, Ms. T. Davlatova and Ms. N. Dzhurabaeva were 
involved in a brawl outside the Aviasozlar Market branch of the National Bank of 
Uzbekistan on Sholokhov Street; both the individuals concerned received bodily injuries.  
The forensic medical report concluded that the bodily injuries to Ms. T. Davlatova and Ms. 
N. Dzhurabaeva were &#8220;light&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2286. On 21 January 2010, the Khamzinsk district internal affairs department investigating 
agency brought proceedings under article 277, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code against 
Ms. N. Dzhurabaeva in respect of the above events. The procedural action taken in the case 
produced evidence incriminating Ms. T. Davlatova. 
</p>
<p>2287. On 6 April 2010, in the presence of a lawyer, Ms. Davlatova was informed of the 
decision to charge her as a suspect. Ms. Davlatova declined to sign an acknowledgement 
that she had been shown the decision and left the investigator&#8217;s office. Subsequently, she 
did not react to repeated summonses to report to the district internal affairs department.  
</p>
<p>2288. An order was issued for suspect Ms. T. Davlatova to appear before the district 
internal affairs department. On 12 April 2010, the investigative task force went to her place 
of residence to enforce this.  
</p>
<p>2289. On the officers&#8217; arrival, Ms. T. Davlatova categorically refused to open the door, 
threatening to release a dog, and refused to go to the district internal affairs department. The 
investigative task force drew up a report and, in the presence of neighbours, took a video 
film of Ms. Davlatova&#8217;s actions. No search was made of Ms. Davlatova&#8217;s place of 
residence. 
</p>
<p>2290. On 15 April 2010, officers of the Khamzinsk internal affairs department again went 
to suspect Ms. T. Davlatova&#8217;s place of residence to enforce a new order issued by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>319 
</b></p>
<p>investigator for her to appear. However, no one was there.  On inquiring of the neighbours, 
it was ascertained that Ms. Davlatova had not been to the house recently and they did not 
know where she was. 
</p>
<p>2291. On the same day, the investigating agency of Khamzinsk internal affairs department 
charged Ms. Davlatova in absentia under article 277, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code and 
declared her a wanted person (pretrial restraining order in the form of travel restraints). 
Criminal case was brought under article 364, paragraph 2 (1), of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure, in respect of absence of the suspect. Ms. Davlatova was arrested on 27 May 
2010; inquiries have now been reopened and the necessary procedural action is being taken. 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal  
</b></p>
<p>2292. On 15 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal regarding the arrest and detention 
of Ms. <b>Gulshan Karaeva</b> and Mr. <b>Nodir Akhatov</b>. Ms. Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov are 
members of the Karshi branch of the &#8220;Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan&#8221; (HRSU). 
</p>
<p>2293.  According to the information received, on 25 November 2010, Ms. Karaeva and 
Mr. Akhatov were arrested while observing a demonstration outside the building of the 
National Security Service (SNB) in Karshi. It is reported that the demonstration, which 
began at approximately 10:00 a.m., was organised by a group of Muslim women in protest 
over the alleged mass arrests of their children on 16 November 2010.  
</p>
<p>2294. At approximately 11:00 a.m., the protest was reportedly interrupted by a convoy of 
SNB officers, arresting a number of participants in the demonstration, as well as Ms. 
Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov, all of whom were subsequently brought to the Karshi City 
Police Department, where they were subjected to interrogation until approximately 7:00 
p.m. It is alleged that during their interrogation, police officers attempted to force Ms. 
Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov to admit involvement in organising the protest, reportedly 
claiming that some of the participants in the demonstration had stated that this was the case. 
Ms. Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov were subsequently released without charge; however, it is 
alleged that the police officers issued a threat to both individuals and their families, warning 
them to &#8220;calm down&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2295. Subsequently, on 27 November 2010, Ms. Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov were 
reportedly summoned to the Prosecutor&#8217;s office to act as witnesses. However, it is reported 
that upon arrival, they were instead subjected to further interrogation concerning their 
alleged involvement in organising the demonstration. Having been interrogated throughout 
the day, Ms. Karaeva and Mr. Akhatov were reportedly allowed to leave after Ms. Karaeva 
fell ill due to blood pressure problems.  
</p>
<p>2296. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Ms. Gulshan Karaeva and 
Mr. Nodir Akhatov may be related to their peaceful and legitimate work in defence of 
human rights. Taking into account the threats allegedly issued against them, concern was 
also expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Ms. Karaeva, Mr. Akhatov, 
and their families. 
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2297. In a letter dated 14 January 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 15 December 2010 as follows.  
</p>
<p>2298. On 25 November 2010, on the basis of a report by staff of the Karshi municipal 
internal affairs division about the organization of an unauthorized demonstration beside the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>320</b>  
</p>
<p>administrative building of the provincial national security services division, the following 
persons were asked into the internal affairs office of Karshi municipal internal affairs 
division: G. Karaeva, L. Bekmurodova, R. Shodmonova, D. Khodzhieva, B. Boltaeva and 
N. Akhatov. 
</p>
<p>2299. Ms. L. Bekmurodova, Ms. R. Shodmonova, Ms. D. Khodzhieva and Ms. B. 
Boltaeva explained that they had arrived at the provincial national security services division 
building at 10 a.m. on 25 November 2010 to receive permission from the investigator to 
meet their relatives who were being detained in connection with a criminal case. At that 
point, Ms. G. Karaeva and Mr. N. Akhatov came up to them and offered to help them free 
their relatives from custody if they agreed to participate in a demonstration beside the 
provincial national security services division building. Then G. Karaeva and N. Akhatov 
began noisily to attract the attention of people around. Ms. G. Karaeva and Mr. N. Akhatov, 
in their explanations, categorically denied taking part in an attempt to organize a 
demonstration, saying that they were near the provincial national security services division 
building purely by chance, and that the women there that day were slandering them, saying 
that they were somehow trying to organize an unauthorized demonstration. 
</p>
<p>2300. During the interview, the city procurator officially cautioned Ms. G. Karaeva and 
Mr. N. Akhatov that holding an unauthorized demonstration was prohibited and an offence 
under the law. 
</p>
<p>2301. G. Karaeva and N. Akhatov were not detained, and law enforcement officers did not 
commit any unlawful acts against them. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2302. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the responses provided to his 
communications dated 30 June 2010, 11 August 2010 and 14 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>2303. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned at the situation of journalists 
and human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, including reports of acts of intimidation, 
arbitrary arrest, and imposition of disproportionate penalties following unfair trials. He 
urges the Government of Uzbekistan to promote an environment that is conducive to the 
expression of diverse views and opinions and to guarantee that journalists and human rights 
defenders can carry out their legitimate work without fear of persecution or harassment.  
</p>
<p><b>  Vanuatu 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Allegation letter  
</b></p>
<p>2304. On 5 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a joint urgent appeal, together 
with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the 
situation of Ms. Esther Olul and her family. Ms. Olul lives with her family in the Cook 
barracks of Vanuatu Mobile Forces (VMF) located in the Anabrou neighborhood in Port-
Vila. She is employed in Bougainville&#8217;s high school. 
</p>
<p>2305. According to the information received, on 29 March 2009, Ms. Olul reportedly 
witnessed the killing of Mr. John Bule, a prisoner who had escaped from the prison of Port-
Vila, by VMF officers inside the Cook barracks. According to the coroner report&#8217;s, Mr. 
Bule &#8220;died as a result of complications of injuries sustained in the setting of blunt force 
trauma&#8230; The deceased suffered at least 32 different apparent injuries to his head, chest, 
abdomen, right upper limb, left upper limb, right lower limb, left lower limb and back&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2306. On 9 December 2009, Mr. Selwyn Olul, Captain of VMF and husband of Ms. Olul, 
was warned by his superior Commander Willy Vira, acting reportedly on orders from 
Police Commissioner Joshua Bong, that if his wife was to give testimony to the Supreme </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>321 
</b></p>
<p>Court during the trial concerning Mr. Bule's death in March 2010, they could both end up in 
jail as a reprisal. Despite these alleged threats, Ms. Olul took the decision to deliver her 
testimony to the court in March 2010. 
</p>
<p>2307. On 1 January 2010, Mr. Olul received his transfer order to Luganville, on Santo 
Island. He moved on 25 January, expecting his family to follow him shortly thereafter. 
Upon arrival, he found that the quarters made available to him and his family were suitable 
for a single person only. 
</p>
<p>2308. In March 2010, Ms. Olul testified before the Supreme Court that she witnessed 
VMF officers beating Mr. John Bule to death. 
</p>
<p>2309. On 26 April 2010, Ms. Olul sent a letter to the Police Commissioner Joshua Bong, 
complaining about her situation. The letter was left unanswered. 
</p>
<p>2310. On 7 June 2010, the non-governmental organization Transparency Vanuatu, acting 
on behalf of Ms. Olul, sent a letter to Police Commissioner Joshua Bong, calling him to 
&#8220;reconsider the decision of the transfer of Captain Olul as it has caused an adverse impact 
on the complainant&#8217;s family&#8221;. A follow-up letter was sent on 29 July 2010. Both letters 
were left unanswered. 
</p>
<p>2311. On 30 August 2010, around 6 p.m., a military truck nearly hit Ms. Olul inside the 
Cook barracks. Ms. Olul, shocked, was admitted to hospital where she stayed for three 
days.  
</p>
<p>2312. On 24 September 2010, Mr. Olul was instructed by Officer James Aru to tell his 
wife to leave the barracks, which she refuses to do as she is entitled to marital housing since 
the allowance is deducted from her husband&#8217;s wages. 
</p>
<p>2313. Because of this situation, the health situation of Ms. Olul has seriously deteriorated. 
She was reportedly admitted to hospital for three weeks due to stress-related heart 
problems, and needs to take medicine. Ms. Olul and her children are ostracized within the 
barracks&#8217; community. In addition, Ms Olul&#8217;s eldest son, who works as an ambulance driver, 
has reportedly been denied access to the VMF barracks. It is finally alleged that Ms. Olul&#8217;s 
quarters in the barracks are not being maintained, despite Ms. Olul paying all her bills. In 
particular, the water pipes are leaking, leading to an increase in water bills. 
</p>
<p>2314. Concerns were expressed that the aforementioned acts of intimidation and 
harassment against Ms. Olul and her family, including the transfer of her husband, may be 
in reprisal for her testimony. Further concerns are expressed for the physical and 
psychological integrity of Ms. Olul and her family. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2315. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 5 November 2010. He 
urges the Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed 
information regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as 
protective measures taken.

se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con el Sr. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>322</b>  
</p>
<p><b>Oswaldo &#193;lvarez</b>, venezolano, nacido el 10 de febrero de 1943 en la ciudad de Maracaibo, 
Estado Zulia. 
</p>
<p>2317. De acuerdo con las informaciones recibidas, el Sr. Oswaldo &#193;lvarez fue detenido el 
23 de marzo de 2010 en la ciudad de Caracas. La detenci&#243;n se basar&#237;a en la difusi&#243;n de una 
opini&#243;n  en una emisi&#243;n en la televisi&#243;n venezolana del programa &#8220;Al&#243; ciudadano&#8221;. Se le 
acusa de conspiraci&#243;n y difusi&#243;n de informaci&#243;n falsa. 
</p>
<p><b>  Llamamiento urgente 
</b></p>
<p>2318. El 14 de junio de 2010, el Relator Especial, junto con la Relatora Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos humanos, enviaron un llamamiento urgente en 
relaci&#243;n con la orden de b&#250;squeda y arresto emitida contra el <b>Sr. Guillermo Zuloaga 
N&#250;&#241;ez, Presidente de Globovisi&#243;n</b>.  Glovisi&#243;n es un canal de noticias de televisi&#243;n que 
emite con se&#241;al abierta y que se propone realizar un periodismo independiente, cr&#237;tico y sin 
censura.   
</p>
<p>2319. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, el d&#237;a 11 de junio de 2010, el Fiscal General 
habr&#237;a emitido una orden de b&#250;squeda y arresto contra el Sr. Zuloaga y contra su hijo 
acusados de irregularidades en un negocio de compra-venta de veh&#237;culos. Actualmente, 
tanto el Sr. Zuloaga como su hijo se encontrar&#237;an en paradero desconocido.  
</p>
<p>2320. El Sr. Zuloaga ha sido objeto de un llamamiento anterior enviado por el Relator 
Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n del derecho a la libertad de opini&#243;n y de 
expresi&#243;n y la Relatora Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los defensores de los derechos 
humanos el 27 de enero de 2010, donde se habr&#237;an detallado alegaciones de m&#250;ltiples actos 
de hostigamiento, intimidaci&#243;n, amenazas y procesos disciplinarios contra los trabajadores 
de Globovisi&#243;n as&#237; como la investigaci&#243;n criminal en curso contra el Sr. Zuloaga.  En una 
sentencia del 3 de marzo de 2009, la Corte Inter-americana habr&#237;a responsabilizado al 
Estado venezolano por las agresiones y ataques contra los trabajadores de Globovisi&#243;n.  
Hasta la fecha, el Gobierno de Venezuela no habr&#237;a respondido a estas alegaciones.   
</p>
<p>2321. Se expres&#243; seria preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones de que el proceso penal y la 
reciente orden de b&#250;squeda y arresto contra el Sr. Zuloaga y su hijo pudieran estar 
conectados con sus actividades de promoci&#243;n y defensa de una prensa libre e independiente 
en Venezuela.  La historia de intimidaci&#243;n y amenazas contra los trabajadores de 
Globovisi&#243;n, as&#237; como las alegaciones acerca de la motivaci&#243;n del proceso penal abierto 
con el Sr. Zuloaga, de ser confirmados, se enmarcar&#237;an en un contexto de gran 
vulnerabilidad para los defensores de los derechos humanos y para el derecho a la libertad 
de expresi&#243;n en Venezuela.

</p>
<p>2326. Mediante carta fechada el 22 de diciembre de 2010, el Gobierno respondi&#243; a la carta 
de alegaciones con fecha 31 de mayo de 2005 en relaci&#243;n con <b><i>Radio Alternativa de 
Caracas 94.9 FM</i></b> , una emisora comunitaria. 
</p>
<p>2327. En fecha 10 de mayo de 2005, funcionarios de CONATEL notificaron a la 
Fundaci&#243;n Radio y Televisora Alternativa de Caracas, el inicio del procedimiento 
administrativo sancionatorio, contenido en le Providencia Administrativa N&#176; 587 de fecha 9 
de mayo de 2005, por el presunto establecimiento y explotaci&#243;n de redes de 
telecomunicaciones, as&#237; coma el uso de porciones del espectro radioel&#233;ctrico sin contar con 
la habilitaci&#243;n administrativa y concesi&#243;n requerida a tal fin, supuesto previsto y 
sancionado par la Ley Org&#225;nica de Telecomunicaciones en el numeral 1 del art&#237;culo 166, 
numeral 1 del art&#237;culo 173, y el art&#237;culo 175.  
</p>
<p>2328. Asimismo, la Providencia Administrativa N&#176; 587, ordeno la aplicaci&#243;n de las 
medidas cautelares de car&#225;cter provisional&#237;simo de suspensi&#243;n inmediata del uso y 
explotaci&#243;n de la frecuencia 94,9 MHz par parte de la Fundaci&#243;n Radio y Televisora 
Alternativa de Caracas, as&#237; coma la incautaci&#243;n de los equipos empleados par la 
mencionada Fundaci&#243;n para la prestaci&#243;n del servicio de radiodifusi&#243;n sonora, ambas 
previstas en los numerales1 y 3 del art&#237;culo 183 de la Ley Org&#225;nica de Telecomunicaciones.  
</p>
<p>2329. En la actualidad, el procedimiento administrativo sancionatorio iniciado a la 
Fundaci&#243;n Radio Televisora Alternativa de Caracas, concluy&#243; la fase de sustanciaci&#243;n, y se 
encuentra en etapa de decisi&#243;n. Asimismo, a la fecha, la mencionada Fundaci&#243;n no ha sido 
habilitada par el &#211;rgano competente para la prestaci&#243;n de servicios de telecomunicaciones 
y no se tiene conocimiento quo se encuentre al aire. 
</p>
<p>2330. En relaci&#243;n con la presunta confiscaci&#243;n de los equipos transmisores de Radio 
Alternativa de Caracas realizada por funcionarios de la Comisi&#243;n Nacional de 
Telecomunicaciones y efectivos del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional bolivariano, hacemos las siguientes 
consideraciones: La Ley Org&#225;nica de Telecomunicaciones prev&#233; la incautaci&#243;n como 
medida cautelar y no consagra de modo alguno la figura de la confiscaci&#243;n. Lo anterior es 
importante resaltarlo, debido a la diferencia que existe entre las dos figures jur&#237;dicas.  
</p>
<p>2331. La incautaci&#243;n implica la acci&#243;n por parte del Estado, a trav&#233;s de la autoridad 
competente, para tomar  posesi&#243;n de los bienes do un particular. En el caso de la Ley 
Org&#225;nica de Telecomunicaciones, la incautaci&#243;n esta prevista como una medida cautelar, es 
decir una medida preventiva adoptada por la Administraci&#243;n, con la finalidad de evitar quo 
los particulares realicen acciones que atenten contra el inter&#233;s general y los bienes jur&#237;dicos 
tutelados por la Ley, durante el curso del procedimiento administrativo sancionatorio. De 
este modo, la incautaci&#243;n es una medida cautelar, no una sanci&#243;n, y en consecuencia la 
privaci&#243;n de los bienes es provisional, y dure hasta tanto se decide el procedimiento, en </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>324</b>  
</p>
<p>cuyo caso la Administraci&#243;n podr&#237;a declarar el comiso o devolver los bienes objeto de 
incautaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>2332. Por lo anteriormente planteado, aclaramos quo CONATEL no declare la 
confiscaci&#243;n de los bienes empleados por los particulares en la prestaci&#243;n de los servicios 
de telecomunicaciones, si no quo se limita a ejercer las potestades que le confiere la Ley 
Org&#225;nica del Telecomunicaciones, incautando y comisando aquellos equipos y materiales 
empleados en la instalaci&#243;n, operaci&#243;n&#8222; prestaci&#243;n o explotaci&#243;n de servicios de 
telecomunicaciones sin poseer los t&#237;tulos habilitantes que se requieren para ello. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>2333. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno las respuestas recibidas. Sin embargo, 
lamenta que al finalizar este informe, no se hab&#237;a recibido respuestas a 8 comunicaciones. 
El Relator Especial considera que el responder a las comunicaciones representa un 
elemento fundamental para la cooperaci&#243;n de los Estados con el mandato, es por ello que 
insta al gobierno venezolano a que le proporcione una respuesta tratando los asuntos 
mencionados.  
</p>
<p>2334. El 17 de junio de 2010, el Relator Especial exhort&#243; a las autoridades venezolanas a 
retirar las &#243;rdenes de arresto contra Guillermo Zuloaga, presidente del canal privado de 
televisi&#243;n Golobovisi&#243;n, y su hijo. 
</p>
<p><b>  Viet Nam 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2335. On 7 February 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a joint urgent appeal concerning the 
sentencing of <b>Mr. Vi Duc Hoi</b>, member of Bloc 8406, a network of pro-democracy and 
human rights activists which has published a Manifesto on Freedom and Democracy in Viet 
Nam, who has written extensively about corruption and injustice in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>2336. According to information received, on 26 January 2011, Mr. Vi Duc Hoi was 
sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, followed by five years of house arrest by a court 
in northern Lang Son province. He was convicted of &#8220;spreading anti-government 
propaganda&#8221; in violation of article 88 of the Penal Code for having posted articles on the 
Internet calling for democracy. No foreign media or diplomats were allegedly permitted to 
be present at the hearing.  
</p>
<p>2337. He was arrested on 27 October 2010 and placed under four-month detention. Prior to 
his arrest, public security officials raided his home on 7 October 2010, after which he was 
detained and interrogated for one week.  
</p>
<p>2338. Concern was expressed that Mr. Vi Duc Hoi has been sentenced to imprisonment 
solely for exercising his legitimate right to freedom of opinion and expression, and that his 
case is part of an ongoing trend of utilizing the vaguely worded provisions of the Penal 
Code to imprison peaceful dissidents and Government critics. Further concern was 
expressed for the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Vi Duc Hoi and at least 30 
other peaceful dissidents who are currently serving long prison terms or are in detention 
awaiting trial.  
</p>
<p>2339. Without prejudging the accuracy of these allegations, the Special Rapporteurs 
appealed to the Government to take all necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression in accordance with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the Government of Viet Nam ratified on 24 September 
1982, and provides that &#8220;everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>325 
</b></p>
<p>shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any 
other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>2340. Additionally, the Special Rapporteurs reminded the Government that while the right 
to freedom of expression may be limited for the protection of national security or of public 
order in accordance with article 19(3) of the ICCPR, such restrictions must be provided for 
by law, meaning that the law must be accessible, unambiguous, drawn narrowly and with 
precision so as to enable individuals to foresee whether a particular action is unlawful.  
</p>
<p>2341. The Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern that article 88 of the Penal Code, 
which prohibits &#8220;conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam&#8221;, does 
not meet the above-mentioned criterion due to the vagueness of the types of expression or 
publication which are prohibited. More specifically, it is unclear what types of expression 
or actions would constitute &#8220;propagating against, distorting and/or defaming the people&#8217;s 
administration&#8221;, &#8220;propagating psychological warfare and spreading fabricated news in order 
to foment confusion among people&#8221;, or &#8220;making, storing and/or circulating documents 
and/or cultural products with contents against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2342. Moreover, the Special Rapporteurs reiterated that any restriction to the right to 
freedom of expression on the grounds of protecting national security is only legitimate if 
the Government can demonstrate that the expression is intended to incite imminent 
violence, it is likely to incite such violence, and there is a direct and immediate connection 
between the expression and the likelihood or occurrence of such violence (see Principle 6 
of the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to 
Information, as endorsed by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression in E/CN.4/1996/39 of 1996). In this case, it is 
unclear how Mr. Vi Duc Hoi&#8217;s peaceful expression constituted such direct and imminence 
violence and thus a threat to national security.  
</p>
<p>2343. Further, Human Rights Council Resolution 12/16 calls upon States to refrain from 
imposing restrictions to the right to freedom of expression which are not consistent with 
article 19(3), including on discussion of Government policies and political debate; reporting 
on human rights, Government activities and corruption in Government; engaging in 
election campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including for peace or 
democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief.  
</p>
<p>2344. In addition, the Special Rapporteurs referred to the fundamental principles set forth 
in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &quot;everyone has the right 
individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and 
realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international 
levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and 
implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as 
may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and 
other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its 
jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights 
and freedoms in practice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2345. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteurs brought the attention of the Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 6, points b) and c) which provide that everyone has the right, individually and 
in association with others as provided for in human rights and other applicable 
international instruments, freely to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, 
information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms; and to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>326</b>  
</p>
<p>study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, 
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other 
appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration which provide that the State shall take all 
necessary measures to ensure the protection by the competent authorities of everyone, 
individually and in association with others, against any violence, threats, retaliation, 
de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a 
consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights referred to in the 
Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in association 
with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or 
opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, 
attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, as well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect 
the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>2346. Finally, the Special Rapporteurs recalled the recommendations that have been 
accepted by the Government of Viet Nam following the Universal Periodic Review, 
including to engage in dialogue with international experts on legal developments on the 
review of its Penal Code to allow less scope for open interpretation of these provisions by 
judges and courts; to continue to work to ensure key pieces of national legislation, 
including the 1999 Penal Code and 2003 Criminal Procedures Code, are consistent with its 
international human rights treaty commitments; and to strengthen efforts in the areas of 
civil and political freedoms, including freedom of expression and the press (A/HRC/12/11).  
</p>
<p>2347. The Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide details on how the 
sentencing of Mr. Vi Duc Hoi to eight years of imprisonment and give years of house arrest 
for peacefully expressing his views via the Internet is in conformity with international 
human rights norms and principles highlighted above. In particular, the Special Rapporteurs 
requested the Government to provide information on how his imprisonment is necessary, 
proportionate and directly linked to the protection of national security.  
</p>
<p>2348. In addition, the Special Rapporteurs requested the Government to provide 
information on how article 88 of the 1999 Penal Code, which carries penalties of three to 12 
years of imprisonment, is compatible with article 19 of the ICCPR, and in particular, how 
this provision is compatible with:  
</p>
<p> (a)  the principle that laws restricting the right to freedom of expression must be 
&#8220;accessible, unambiguous, draw narrowly and with precision so as to enable individuals to 
foresee whether a particular action is unlawful&#8221;; and 
</p>
<p> (b)  the principle that any sanctions must be proportionate and the least intrusive 
means to attain a legitimate aim.  
</p>
<p>2349. The Special Rapporteurs urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Vi Duc Hoi are respected and that 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. They also requested 
that the Government adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts.  
</p>
<p><b>  Response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>2350. In a letter dated 14 April 2011, the Government responded to the communication 
sent on 7 February 2011 as follows.  
</p>
<p>2351. Mr. Vi Duc Hoi was a member of Huu Lung district&#8217;s authority in Lang Son 
province, in Northern Viet Nam, an area very diversified in terms of ethnics and religions. 
From 2006 to 2007, Mr. Vi Duc Hoi benefitted from his status as an authority&#8217;s member, 
colluded with hostile forces and exile organizations and groups, in both Viet Nam and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>327 
</b></p>
<p>abroad, in instigating riots, social instability and disorder. He also produced and circulated 
documents of defamation to incite confusion, suspicion, violence, hatred and division 
between ethnic and religious communities in the province.  
</p>
<p>2352. Mr. Vi Duc Hoi was accused of activities violating Vietnamese laws and sentenced 
by the People&#8217;s Court of Lang Son province to 8 years in prison and 5 years of probation 
according to article 88 of the 1999 Penal Code which reads &#8220;those who propagate 
psychological warfare and spreading fabricated news in order to foment confusion among 
people shall be sentenced to between three and twelve years of imprisonment.&#8221; Mr. Vi Duc 
Hoi has confessed his violations and implored for mercy. The arrest and criminal 
proceedings initiation against Mr. Vi Duc Hoi are carried out in strict compliance with the 
sequence and procedures stipulated in existing Vietnamese laws, particularly the 2003 
Criminal Procedures Code and also in line with international standards on human rights, 
particularly the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. The trial was public with the participation of lawyers, witnesses 
and the presence of the family of Mr. Vi Duc Hoi. The presence of media, including foreign 
media, and diplomats at the hearing totally falls within the competence of the court as 
stipulated in the 2003 Criminal Procedures Code.  
</p>
<p>2353. Article 88 of the 1999 Penal Code is strict compatible with article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which reads &#8220;The exercise of the right 
to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore 
be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and 
necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; or (b) for the protection of 
national security or of public order, or of public health or morals.&#8221; As in many other States 
of law in the world, in Viet Nam, all violations by law, causing harm to national security 
and public order must be punished in order to ensure the respect of law and to guarantee the 
rights of other people and the peace, security and development which are common interests 
of the society. Activities carried out by Mr. Vi Duc Hoi were well organized, repeated and 
clearly aimed to incite violence and hatred between different ethnics and religious 
communities. The punishment of these violating activities is absolutely in compliance with 
standards of international law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2354. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communications of 21 April 2011, 25 
November 2011 and an earlier communication sent on 9 March 2009. He urges the 
Government to respond to the concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information 
regarding investigations undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective 
measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2355. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the reply to his communication 
of 7 February 2011 dated 14 April 2011. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that the 
Government has failed to provide information that he had requested, including detailed and 
concrete information on how Mr. Vi Duc Hoi&#8217;s activities amounts to direct incitement of 
violence and hatred, as well as clarification of vague and ambiguous terms contained in 
article 88 of the Penal Code. Contrary to the response of the Government, the Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that this article does not meet international human rights standards on 
the right to freedom of expression, which requires any law restricting the right to be (1) 
clear and unambiguous, so that individuals can foresee what kinds of expression are 
unlawful; (2) justified as being necessary to protect one of the specific aims listed in article 
19, paragraph 3 of the ICCPR; and (3) proportionate to the aim, meaning that the restriction 
must be proven as the least restrictive means available to achieve the purported aim. With 
regard to the last element, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the penalty of between </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>328</b>  
</p>
<p>three to 18 years of imprisonment constitutes a disproportionate sentence, which also leads 
to a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression in the country. The Special 
Rapporteur thus urges the Government to bring this provision in line with international 
standards, and to fully guarantee that all individuals can exercise their legitimate right to 
freedom of opinion and expression without fear of imprisonment or harassment.   
</p>
<p>2356. More generally, the Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned about 
restrictions to the right to freedom of opinion and expression, including dissemination of 
information and opinions via the Internet, and related rights to freedom of association and 
assembly in Viet Nam. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned that over 30 
individuals reportedly remain imprisoned, including members of banned political groups, 
independent trade unionists, bloggers, journalists and writers. He is also concerned by 
reports of dissidents being placed under house arrest. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
reiterate that reporting on or denouncing human rights violations should never be subjected 
to restrictions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Yemen 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2357. On 3 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal to the Government regarding the <b>deaths of 
at least 16 people, and violence against journalists in the Republic of Yemen in

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2375. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to his communication of 3 March 2011 and to 
earlier communications sent on 21 January 2010, 2 December 2009, 13 October 2009, 29 
September 2009, 25 August 2009, 23 July 2009 and 4 May 2009. He urges the Government 
to respond to the concerns raised by him. 
</p>
<p>2376. The Special Rapporteur remains seriously concerned about the situation of the right 
to freedom of expression in Yemen, including reports of harassment, prosecution and 
imprisonment of journalists and media representatives. He calls upon the Government to 
fully guarantee all individuals&#8217; right to freedom of opinion and expression, including via 
the Internet, as well as their collective expression in the form of peaceful assemblies. The 
Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to ensure that the media are able to report 
freely on the situation in Yemen.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2377. On 29 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the situation of 
<b>Mr. Okay Machisa</b>. Mr. Machisa is the National Director of the Zimbabwe Human Rights 
Association (ZimRights). Composed of a network of human rights organisations and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>331 
</b></p>
<p>including over 700,000 members, ZimRights works to promote human rights by carrying 
out education programs and lobbying, providing legal aid and by researching and 
publishing on human rights issues. In particular, ZimRights has promoted the constitution-
making process, and has campaigned on the right of people to be involved in the drafting of 
the new constitution as well as by carrying out public education campaigns about the 
constitutional process.  
</p>
<p>2378. Mr. Machisa and other members of ZimRights had reportedly been subject to 
ongoing harassment, including arbitrary arrest, threats and intimidation. According to the 
information received, on 23 March 2010, Mr. Machisa was reportedly arrested in Harare by 
local police officers and held for several hours before being released. Mr. Machisa was 
checking on final preparations for the opening of a photography exhibition at the Gallery 
Delta in Harare. The exhibition, entitled &#8220;Reflections&#8221;, was due to be opened on 24 March 
2010 by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, and forms part of a national programme of 
healing which aims to encourage reflection and reconciliation following the political 
violence that took place in relation to the elections of 2007. The &#8220;Reflections&#8221; exhibit, 
organised by ZimRights, was part of this campaign by promoting the message that 
&#8220;violence and intimidation never yield any progress&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2379. At approximately 4:00pm, about 20 police officers, both uniformed and plain 
clothed, arrived at the Gallery in two trucks and began to remove the 65 photographs which 
comprised the exhibition, although they allegedly did not have a warrant to do so. It is 
reported that during this raid, the police officers acted in a threatening and intimidation 
manner towards Mr. Machisa before arresting him and taking him to Harare Central District 
Police Station. The police also reportedly confiscated two mobile phones belonging to Mr. 
Machisa, and it is reported that the police had come to the Gallery to take photos of the 
exhibition materials earlier that morning, without authorization.  
</p>
<p>2380. The Commanding Officer of the Harare Central District allegedly claimed that he 
had not approved the launch of the exhibition and gave Mr. Machisa seven days to present 
&#8220;letters of consent from individuals and organisations&#8221; featured in the pictures. Mr. 
Machisa was allegedly warned that if he did not do so he could face criminal charges. He 
was later released at 6:30 pm that evening following the intervention of lawyers from the 
organisation, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR). The following day, on 24 
March 2010, the High Court ordered the police to return the photo exhibits to ZimRights 
within an hour, following an urgent legal application filed by ZLHR's lawyers. The police 
complied with the ruling and the materials were returned.  
</p>
<p>2381. It was alleged that ZimRights had notified the relevant authorities about the 
preparations for the exhibition during the week of 15 March 2010, and it is reported that 
ZimRights obtained a High Court Order to allow the exhibition to go ahead. On 17 and 18 
March 2010, Ms. Olivia Gumbo, the ZimRights National Programme Manager, and Mr. 
Machisa were allegedly summoned by the police to answer questions about the exhibition.  
</p>
<p>2382. ZimRights filed a police report under number IR 030 117 on 2 March 2010 in 
relation to threatening messages received by members of the organisation. These included 
an email received on 16 February 2010 by Mr. Machisa from a person claiming to be called 
Dzapasi Mumunda. The message said: &#8220;Be careful my friend a number of people at my 
workplace have been assigned to bring you down. I refused to be involved. Be careful 
especially at your home&#8221;. This followed an incident in November 2009 in which several 
armed men waited at the gate of Mr. Machisa's house until he returned home from a 
meeting. They left only when Mr. Machisa alerted the police and various colleagues.  
</p>
<p>2383. It was further alleged that on 25 February 2010, Mr. Nunurai Jena, ZimRights' 
Regional Chairperson of ZimRights for Mashonaland West, Mr. Netsai Kaitano, Regional 
Chairperson of ZimRights in Chitungwiza, and Mr. Jabulisa Tshuma, Treasurer of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>332</b>  
</p>
<p>ZimRights, also received various threatening messages on their mobile phones warning 
them to stop their work educating the public about the constitution-making process. The 
messages threatened them with death if they did not do so, and asked about their motives in 
working with ZimRights. The messages were sent from the same mobile phone number, 
which was later unreachable.  
</p>
<p>2384. Mr. Machisa also received a threatening message during the same period, which 
said: &#8220;You enjoy flying in and out of the country demonizing your country, why don&#8217;t you 
go and stay there? They monitor, soon you will all stay out&#8221;. It is believed that the threat 
related to his participation in a European Union meeting in Brussels regarding the sanctions 
targeted against a number of Zimbabwean political figures. 
</p>
<p>2385. The threats against and harassment of members of ZimRights seem to form part of a 
larger pattern of intimidation against civil society in Zimbabwe in recent months. In the 
first three months of 2010, there have been reported incidents involving members of the 
General Agriculture and Plantation Workers Union of Zimbabwe (GAPWUZ), Zimbabwe 
Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition (CZC), Civic Education 
Trust (Civnet), Counselling Services Unit (CSU), as well as Women of Zimbabwe Arise 
(WOZA). These incidents include threats, arrests, detention, interrogations, raids of office 
premises, and disruption of meetings, as a result of which at least one human rights 
defender has gone into hiding.  
</p>
<p>2386. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Mr. Machisa, and the aforementioned 
threats and acts of harassment against members of various human rights organisations 
including ZimRights, are related to their work in defence of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2387. On 22 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with together with the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal regarding 
the situation of <b>Million, Mavis Sibanda, Jenni Williams, Magodonga Mahlangu, Clara 
Manjengwa and Celina Madukani</b>, members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA). 
WOZA is a grassroots organization working to promote and protect women&#8217;s activism. 
WOZA members had been the subject of previous communications by special procedures 
mandate-holders on 29 September 2004, 27 October 2004, 19 April 2005, 20 May 2005, 28 
June 2005, 16 February 2006, 15 September 2006, 7 December 2006, 12 June 2007, 28 
September 2007, 6 June 2008, 8 July 2008, 27 October 2008 and 21 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>2388. According to the information received, on 13 April 2010, Million and Mavis 
Sibanda were allegedly arrested by two plain clothed police officers during a public 
meeting convened by the Competition and Tariff Commission in the City Hall of 
Bulawayo. Two hundred members of WOZA were attending this public meeting to present 
their views to the Commission on the poor electricity services provided by the Zimbabwe 
Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA). It is alleged that the police officers searched the bags 
of Million and Mavis Sibanda before bringing them to the Central police Station. 
</p>
<p>2389. Million and Mavis Sibanda were then allegedly questioned about the meeting of the 
Commission and their life history. Yellow cards, which were handed over by WOZA 
members to ZESA on 12 April 2010 in protest of poor service and high tariffs to the 
Management of the electricity provider, were found on Million and allegedly confiscated. 
During the interrogation, other police officers reportedly insisted on Million and Mavis 
Sibanda being released as they believed WOZA should be allowed to protest on the 
electricity issue. Million and Mavis Sibanda were released on the same day. 
</p>
<p>2390. On 15 April 2010, Jenni Williams, WOZA&#8217; National Coordinator was allegedly 
arrested by the police during a peaceful march to ZESA headquarters in Harare. The 
peaceful protest was organized by WOZA to hand over &#8220;yellow cards&#8221;. It is alleged that as 
WOZA members were waiting outside ZESA premises to meet with the management, riot 
police with tear gas and weapons arrived at the scene. They reportedly arrested Ms. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>333 
</b></p>
<p>Williams on the insistence of ZESA security guards. Sixty one WOZA members handed 
themselves in solidarity to Ms. Williams. It is reported that all but four WOZA members 
were released on the same day.  
</p>
<p>2391. Jenni Williams, Magodonga Mahlangu, Clara Manjengwa and Celina Madukani 
were allegedly detained without charge for six days at the Harare Central Police Station. On 
20 April 2010, the four WOZA members were reportedly released following the Attorney 
General&#8217;s office refusal to press charges against them due to lack of sufficient evidence.  
</p>
<p>2392. It was alleged that Jenni Williams, Magodonga Mahlangu, Clara Manjengwa and 
Celina Madukani were verbally abused by police officers upon arrival at the Harare Central 
Police Station. During their detention, officers from the Law and Order Department 
allegedly pressurized them to pay &#8216;admission of guilt&#8217; fines to &#8216;buy&#8217; their freedom which 
they refused. It is also alleged that because of the poor prison conditions and in particular 
the lack of hygiene, the four WOZA members got rash all over their bodies and diarrhea. 
</p>
<p>2393. Concern was expressed the arrest and detention of the above-mentioned members of 
WOZA might be directly related to their peaceful activities in the defense of human rights. 
Further concern is expressed that these arrests and detentions might form part of a broader 
pattern to intimidate members of WOZA. 
</p>
<p>2394. On 17 June 2010<b>,</b> the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers sent a joint urgent appeal regarding the case of <b>Mr. Farai Maguwu</b>, director of the 
Zimbabwean non-governmental organization Centre for Research and Development (CRD). 
The CRD has documented human rights abuses in the Marange diamond fields, and is 
involved in the Kimberly Process, an international coalition of Governments, industry and 
civil society organizations which aims at breaking the links between the diamond trade and 
the funding of violence. 
</p>
<p>2395. According to the information received, on 26 May 2010, Mr. Farai Maguwu shared 
information with an independent monitor for the Kimberley Process in Zimbabwe on 
alleged human rights abuses in the diamond fields.  
</p>
<p>2396. On 27 May, armed security agents reportedly raided both the office and home of Mr. 
Farai Maguwu, and confiscated his passport, computer and other personal belongings. Mr. 
Farai Maguwu escaped and went into hiding.  
</p>
<p>2397. On 3 June, Mr. Farai Maguwu handed himself to the Harare Central Police Station, 
and was immediately arrested.  On 7 June, Mr. Farai Maguwu was charged with 
communicating information prejudicial to the State. Mr. Farai Maguwu has been denied 
bail, and remains detained at the Harare Central Police Station. He has further been denied 
access to his medication to treat a chest and throat infection. A court has reportedly ordered 
that he be allowed to receive his medication. 
</p>
<p>2398. During the aforementioned raid, the nephew of Mr. Farai Maguwu, Mr. Lisbern 
Maguwu, was arrested and was subsequently beaten in custody. Lawyers attempting to 
meet him received threats from police officers. Mr. Lisbern Maguwu was released on bail 
after being charged with violence against security agents. He is currently awaiting trial. 
Since the raid, other members of Farai Maguwu&#8217;s family have reportedly been interrogated 
and beaten by police officers. Other CRD staff members went into hiding in fear for their 
safety.  
</p>
<p>2399. Serious concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Farai Maguwu 
may be related to his legitimate human rights activities, in the exercise of the right of Mr. 
Farai Maguwu to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern is expressed that the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>334</b>  
</p>
<p>arrest and detention of and charges against Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, as well as the acts of ill 
treatment against him, may be linked to the human rights activities of his uncle, Mr. Farai 
Maguwu. Finally, serious concern is expressed for the physical and psychological integrity 
of Mr. Farai Maguwu, members of his family, including Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, and CRD 
staff members.

</p>
<p>2411. On 7 June, Mr. Farai Maguwu was charged with communicating information 
prejudicial to the State. Mr. Farai Maguwu has been denied bail, and remains detained at 
the Harare Central Police Station. He has further been denied access to his medication to 
treat a chest and throat infection. A court has reportedly ordered that he be allowed to 
receive his medication. 
</p>
<p>2412. During the aforementioned raid, the nephew of Mr. Farai Maguwu, Mr. Lisbern 
Maguwu, was arrested and was subsequently beaten in custody. Lawyers attempting to 
meet him received threats from police officers. Mr. Lisbern Maguwu was released on bail 
after being charged with violence against security agents. He is currently awaiting trial. 
Since the raid, other members of Farai Maguwu&#8217;s family have reportedly been interrogated 
and beaten by police officers. Other CRD staff members went into hiding in fear for their 
safety. 
</p>
<p>2413.  Serious concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Farai Maguwu 
may be related to his legitimate human rights activities, in the exercise of the right of Mr. 
Farai Maguwu to freedom of opinion and expression. Further concern was expressed that 
the arrest and detention of and charges against Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, as well as the acts of 
ill treatment against him, may be linked to the human rights activities of his uncle, Mr. 
Farai Maguwu. Finally, serious concern was expressed for the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Farai Maguwu, members of his family, including Mr. Lisbern Maguwu, 
and CRD staff members.

<p><b>  Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>2414. On 1 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights defenders, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, sent an urgent appeal concerning the <b>arrest and 
detention of 45 activists in Harare</b>. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>336</b>  
</p>
<p>2415. According to the information received, on 19 February 2011, at approximately 4:00 
p.m., police arrested 45 social justice and human rights activists as well as some bystanders, 
who were attending a meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe on &#8220;Revolts in Egypt and Tunisia: 
what lessons can be learnt for the working class in Zimbabwe and Africa&#8221;. Their names are: 
<b>Munyaradzi Gwisai, Antonater Choto, Tatenda Mombeyarara, Michael Sozinyu, 
Eddson Chakuma, Hopewell Gumbo, Welcome Zimuto, Phillip Magaya, Prolific 
Mataruse, Godknows Biya, David Mupatse, Douglas Muzanenhamo, Ganizani Nunu, 
Reki Jimu, Josphat Chinembiri, Strutton Muhambi, Trevor Chamba, Clarence

Francisca Thompson, Masline Zvomuya, Nhamo Kute, Annie Chipeta, Tabeth 
Chideya, Charles Mubwandarikwa, Thomas Chibaya, Fatima Manhando, Blessing 
Muguzayaya </b>and <b>Robert Muhlaba</b>. 
</p>
<p>2416. The individuals listed above were taken to Harare Central Police station, where a 
dozen were allegedly beaten under their feet and on their buttocks with broomsticks, metal 
rods, pieces of timber, open palms, and some blunt objects. It is alleged that Zimbabwean 
security agents tortured them to induce detainees to become state witnesses and testify 
against other detainees. Additionally, those who were not tortured were threatened with 
torture if they did not become state witnesses. They were then denied medical treatment for 
their injuries. According to the information received, lawyers were initially denied access to 
those detained. Nevertheless, in the evening of 19 February 2011, the detainees&#8217; lawyers 
were advised that their clients would be charged under section 22(2)(a)(i) of the Criminal 
Law (Codification and Reform) Act.  
</p>
<p>2417. It was only in the course of the preliminary court proceedings which took place on 
23 February 2011, that the State Prosecutor accused the activists of treason under section 20 
of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, in addition to the initial charge of 
planning a removal of a constitutional government by unconstitutional means, as defined in 
section 22(2)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. Harare Magistrate 
Munamato Mutevedzi adjourned proceedings to 24 February 2011 to allow defence lawyers 
to confer with their clients, as they had not been afforded the opportunity to do so with 
regard to the new charge of treason. However, the principal prison officer allegedly barred 
defence lawyers from taking instructions from their clients and transferred the activists to 
Harare Remand Prison and Chikurubi Maximum Prison.    
</p>
<p>2418. On 24 February 2011, one of the detainees, Mr. Munyaradzi Gwisai, coordinator of 
the International Socialist Organisation, testified before Harare Magistrate during an 
application for refusal of placement on remand for the 45 human rights activists filed by the 
defence lawyer. Mr. Gwisai disclosed in court that they were subjected to torture sessions 
during their detention by the police at Harare Central Police Station. Mr. Gwisai also stated 
that these torture sessions were aimed at securing confessions from the activists which 
would implicate them in the commission of treason, a charge they are currently facing in 
court. Mr. Gwisai said that he was tortured together with five other detainees in a room in 
the basement at Harare Central Police Station by nine state security agents who included 
some police officers who had arrested them. The alleged torture sessions were administered 
through assaults all over the detainees&#8217; bodies, under their feet and buttocks through the use 
of broomsticks, metal rods, pieces of timber, open palms and some blunt objects. It is also 
alleged that the police subjected detainees to severe interrogation sessions where they 
attempted to coax some of the detainees to turn against their colleagues and be considered 
State witnesses in court proceedings.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/27/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>337 
</b></p>
<p>2419. In court, Mr. Gwisai further reported that the meeting held on 19 February 2011, 
was held in order to discuss International Socialist Organisation business and issues of 
democracy and constitutionalism and not to plot the toppling of the Government as alleged 
by the police and prosecutors. The meeting, which was attended by a HIV/AIDS activist, 
was also meant to commemorate the life of a deceased HIV/AIDS activist, Navigator 
Mungoni. 
</p>
<p>2420. The State Prosecutor, who applied for the placement of detainees on remand, will 
cross-examine Mr. Gwisai on 28 February 2011. It is reported that all 45 activists remain 
incarcerated in Harare Remand Prison and at Chikurubi Maximum Prison.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>2421. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted a response to any of his communication sent during the 
reporting period. In addition, the Government has not responded to communications sent 
earlier on 21 January 2010 and 7 May 2009. He urges the Government to respond to the 
concerns raised by him, and to provide detailed information regarding investigations 
undertaken, subsequent prosecutions as well as protective measures taken. 
</p>
<p>2422. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about ongoing reports of arbitrary arrests 
and detention of journalists and human rights defenders, as well as threats and acts of 
harassment against human rights defenders for exercising their legitimate right to freedom 
of opinion and expression. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of 
Zimbabwe to fully guarantee press freedom in the country and to promote an environment 
in which journalists and human rights defenders can carry out their legitimate work without 
fear of harassment or persecution.
