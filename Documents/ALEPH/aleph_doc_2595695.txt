FY2017 Outlook
Continued focus on cash margins and cost reductions
Sales Guidance:
− Mid West/Extension Hill sales of 2.8 - 3.1 million tonnes in FY2017.
− Extension Hill to contribute ~2.0Mt of standard DSO.
− Remainder to comprise mix of Iron Hill and/or Extension Hill low grade from stockpiles.
− Final sales mix dependent on timing of Iron Hill approvals and market conditions.
Cost Guidance:
– Average all-in cash cost target of  A$48-52/wmt FOB, including all operating, capital,
royalties and head office costs.
– Extension Hill all-in site cash costs of A$44-46/wmt FOB.
– Iron Hill development capital costs of $2-3 million expected for haul road and pre-stripping.
– Iron Hill operational costs expected to be consistent with current Extension Hill operations.

Future Potential
• Seawall insurance claim progressing:
 $86m property damage settlement agreed, all
funds received by end-July 2016.
 No restrictions on deployment of settlement
proceeds.

future production potential, subject to confirmation  
that the seawall can be rebuilt in safe and viable 
manner.
•
$1.5m committed to complete detailed seawall 
design and mine planning.
• Targeting significant reduction in average strip
ratio, and higher average product grade.

FY2016
Summary
MGX continues to generate strong performance and has real upside potential on multiple 
fronts:
• Proven cost reduction capability – all-in group cash costs reduced 26% in FY2016. 
• Proven ability to generate positive operating cashflow in a low price environment.
• Extension Hill sales to extend into early 2017, production from Iron Hill targeted in first
half of 2017 to further extend the Mid West operational life.
• Potential to bridge any timing gap with sales from low grade stockpiles, if financially
attractive.
• $86 million received from Koolan Island property damage insurance settlement.
• Business Interruption component of Koolan Island insurance claim progressing.
• Main Pit restart evaluation provides potential for future high quality production from
Koolan Island.
• Robust balance sheet provides maximum flexibility.
• Actively evaluating broad range of resources acquisition opportunities outside iron ore.
