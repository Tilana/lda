</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, other international human rights law 
</p>
<p>instruments and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 and decision 5/101 of 18 June 2007, 16/21 of 25 
</p>
<p>March 2011 and 26/16 of 26 June 2014, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>in particular</i> that the Human Rights Council has the mandate to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>serve as a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>that States bear the primary responsibility under international law to 
</p>
<p>promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to life 
</p>
<p>and security of person, and that such responsibility may include, as appropriate, the 
</p>
<p>enacting and enforcing of relevant national legislation, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person and is 
</p>
<p>entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> that hundreds of thousands of human beings of all ages around the world, 
</p>
<p>including women and children, continue to have their human rights, in particular their right 
</p>

<p>to life and security of person, negatively affected by the misuse, intentional or 
</p>
<p>unintentional, of firearms, and that a significant number of such killings of women have 
</p>
<p>occurred as a result of inter-partner violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that an effective national regulation of civilian acquisition, 
</p>
<p>possession and use of firearms may enhance the protection of the right to life and security 
</p>
<p>of person and thus contribute positively to diminishing the number of victims of the misuse 
</p>
<p>of firearms, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging also</i> the efforts made by different States at various levels, including 
</p>
<p>at the regional and subregional levels, to ensure that the civilian acquisition, possession and 
</p>
<p>use of firearms in their respective societies are effectively regulated, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reiterates its deep concern</i> at the fact that hundreds of thousands of human 
</p>
<p>beings of all ages around the world, including women and children, have lost their lives or 
</p>
<p>suffered injuries and psychological harm by the misuse of firearms by civilians, thus having 
</p>
<p>their human rights, in particular their right to life and security of person, negatively 
</p>
<p>affected; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls once more upon</i> all States to do their utmost to take appropriate 
</p>
<p>legislative, administrative and other measures, consistent with international human rights 
</p>
<p>law and their constitutional frameworks, in order to ensure that civilian acquisition, 
</p>
<p>possession and use of firearms are effectively regulated with the aim of enhancing the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, in particular the right to life and security of person, of all; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>present to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-second session a report on the different 
</p>
<p>ways in which civilian acquisition, possession and use of firearms have been effectively 
</p>
<p>regulated, with a view to assessing the contribution of such regulation to the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights, in particular the right to life and security of person, and to identify best 
</p>
<p>practices that may guide States to further develop relevant national regulation if they so 
</p>
<p>deem it necessary; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> all relevant special procedures, commissions of inquiry and human 
</p>
<p>rights treaty bodies to continue to bear in mind the present resolution within the framework 
</p>
<p>of their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
