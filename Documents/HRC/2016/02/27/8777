<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Progress report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Myanmar, Tom&#225;s Ojea Quintana</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/27, 
covers human rights developments in Myanmar since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second 
report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/19) and the submission of his report to the 
General Assembly (A/64/318) in October 2009. 
 The Special Rapporteur has travelled to Myanmar three times. He conducted his 
third country visit from 15 to 19 February 2010 at the invitation of the Government, which 
had postponed planned visits several times. 
</p>
<p> The present report elaborates on the issues related to the protection of human rights. 
The Security Council, the Secretary-General, the Human Rights Council, Government 
representatives from many nations, Nobel laureates and other respected leaders have all 
called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the more than 2,100 prisoners of 
conscience. However, the Government of Myanmar has not yet met this important step in 
its preparations for transition to democracy in the lead-up to the 2010 election. Likewise, 
the international community has urged the Government of Myanmar to announce an 
election date and an electoral framework that adheres to international standards for a free, 
fair, participatory and transparent election process. The basic rights to food, shelter, health 
and education, which are not only human rights in and of themselves, but are also essential 
for the exercise of other human rights, are denied to far too many of the people of 
Myanmar. At the same time, conflicts along the border areas continue to abet serious 
human rights abuses against civilian populations, including the ongoing recruitment of 
child soldiers. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the systematic and 
endemic discrimination faced by the Muslim community in Northern Rakhine State. This 
discrimination, which is framed as an immigration problem, leads to basic and fundamental 
human rights being denied to this population. Measures taken against this population

<p>include the restriction of movement, limitations on permission to marry, and forced labour. 
</p>
<p> As the Special Rapporteur stated in previous reports, there is a pattern of gross and 
systematic violation of human rights which has been in place for many years and still 
continues. Given the extent and persistence of the problem, and the lack of accountability, 
there is an indication that those human rights violations are the result of a State policy, 
originating from decisions by authorities in the executive, military and judiciary at all 
levels. The Government of Myanmar needs to take prompt and effective measures to 
investigate these facts.

<p><b>4</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
was established pursuant to resolution 1992/58 of the Commission on Human Rights, and 
most recently extended by Human Rights Council resolution 7/32. The current Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom&#225;s Ojea Quintana 
(Argentina), officially assumed the function on 1 May 2008. 
</p><p>2. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 10/27 
and covers human rights developments in Myanmar since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second 
report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/10/19) and the submission of his report to the 
General Assembly (A/64/318) in October 2009. 
3. Engagement with Myanmar by the international community has improved with 
some notable shifts from long-standing policies of isolating the Government of Myanmar. 
With the launch of the new human rights mechanism of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN), namely, the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, 
the Government of Myanmar is presented with another forum to address human rights 
concerns. The Special Rapporteur hopes that engagement, at all levels, will bring the 
improvement of human rights in Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>4. The Government of Myanmar has reiterated that national elections, planned for 2010 
as part of the seven-step road map to democracy to which the Myanmar authorities have 
committed, will go ahead. As of 5 March 2010, neither the election date nor the election 
law had been announced, and restrictions to freedoms of expression, assembly and 
association had not been lifted. The Special Rapporteur regrets that during his mission in 
February 2010 no further information was provided on the election date or the electoral 
framework. This election is an important opportunity for the Government to show its 
commitment to international human rights standards and democratic values, however, the 
ongoing delay offers serious doubts about the possibility to provide adequate time for 
examination of the electoral framework and preparation by all parties to fairly contest the 
elections. 
</p>
<p>5. The Security Council, the Secretary-General, the Human Rights Council, 
representatives of many States, Nobel laureates and other respected leaders have all called 
for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the more than 2,100 prisoners of conscience, 
particularly in the light of the expected upcoming elections. However, the Government of 
Myanmar has not yet met this important step in its preparations for transition to democracy. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in particular at Headquarters, in Bangkok and 
in New York, for assisting him in discharging his mandate. These thanks are also extended 
to the United Nations Country Team in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology and activities of the special rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>7. Since taking up the mandate in May 2008, the Special Rapporteur has adopted an 
open and clear approach to working towards the promotion and protection of human rights 
in Myanmar, including working in a cooperative manner with the Government to assist in 
the realization of those rights. He explained the approach in his first report to the Human 
Rights Council in June 2008 (A/HRC/8/12) and reiterated it in his statements to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/10/19) and the General Assembly (A/64/318). The Special 
Rapporteur intends to continue with this approach. </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur conducted his third country visit from 15 to 19 February 
2010 at the invitation of the Government, which had postponed planned visits several times. 
His previous two missions were carried out from 3 to 7 August 2008 and from 14 to 19 
February 2009. 
</p>
<p>9. As in the past, the Special Rapporteur was provided with his mission programme on 
a daily basis. The length of the mission agreed by the Government was only five days, 
during which time the Special Rapporteur visited Rakhine State, including the Sittwe and 
Buthidaung prisons, and met with state authorities, members of the Nasaka (Myanmar&#8217;s 
border and immigration forces) and Muslim community leaders. In Nay Pyi Taw, he met 
with the Ministers of Home Affairs and Labour, the Chief Justice and Attorney General, the 
Chief of Police and the governmental human rights body. In Yangon he visited Insein 
Prison and met with political party and ethnic nationality leaders, and the judges and 
lawyers involved in the most recent trial of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 
</p>
<p>10. With a view to gathering all relevant information on the country and maintaining an 
impartial and balanced approach, in addition to meeting with the authorities of Myanmar 
during missions, the Special Rapporteur keeps in contact with all those working on 
Myanmar &#8211; individuals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and diplomatic missions. 
He consults with countries in the region, especially ASEAN members given the important 
role they play in relation to Myanmar.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur met with the Secretary-General in October 2009, and is in 
regular contact with the office of his Special Adviser on Myanmar. In New York, the 
Special Rapporteur also met with the Special Adviser for the Responsibility to Protect, and 
representatives of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict and the Office of the Special Adviser on the Prevention of 
Genocide.  
</p>
<p>12. Between 1 August 2009 and 13 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent five 
communications to the Government of Myanmar regarding particular cases of alleged 
human rights violations. He sent those letters of allegation and urgent appeals jointly with 
other special procedures mandate holders, and he has received replies to two of those 
communications. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights issues 
</b></p>
<p>13. The human rights issues confronting Myanmar are many, complex and 
interdependent. At the centre of the daunting challenges to the full realization of human 
rights in the country is the pattern of widespread and systematic violations which has 
existed for many years and still persists. The prevailing culture of impunity, in fact, is a 
necessary consequence of the lack of accountability for grave human rights violations when 
they do occur. The lack of independence of the judiciary and weak rule of law are also 
preconditions for this pattern. The large number of prisoners of conscience in Myanmar 
demonstrates the abrogation of the fundamental rights to freedom of expression, assembly 
and association. The plight of ethnic minorities and civilians along the country&#8217;s border 
areas who are subject to discrimination and grave human rights abuses has continued for 
too long, due to the prevailing culture of impunity.  
</p>
<p>14. Recommendations made by the international community, including the four core 
human rights elements proposed by the Special Rapporteur, remain largely outstanding. 
Substantive action by the Government on the four core human rights elements would be 
necessary for the democratic transition to which Myanmar has committed. The four core 
human rights elements are: the release of all prisoners of conscience; review and reform of 
specific national legislation, in compliance with international human rights standards; </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>reform of the judiciary to assure independence and impartiality; and specific measures by 
the military and police including respecting international human rights and humanitarian 
law and establishing a permanent and meaningful training programme on human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Situation of prisoners of conscience and conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has repeatedly expressed grave concerns about the house 
arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the high number of prisoners of conscience and has 
called for the release of all prisoners of conscience without delay and without conditions. 
He recalls that one of the four core human rights elements that he proposed to the 
authorities is the progressive release of prisoners of conscience before the announced 2010 
elections. Nevertheless, during his recent mission, the Special Rapporteur did not receive 
any indication that the Government is willing to release all prisoners of conscience. The 
Government of Myanmar does not accept that there are any prisoners of conscience in 
Myanmar. While there was a release of 131 prisoners of conscience in September 2009 and 
29 prisoners in February 2009, these figures lack proportionality to the more than 2,100 
prisoners of conscience who remain detained. In fact, the number of prisoners of conscience 
has nearly doubled in the past two years. These prisoners come from all walks of life, and 
include monks, students, teachers, lawyers, journalists and political activists. Some have 
spent many years in prison and continue to suffer under long sentences. 
</p>
<p>16. In order to move forward concretely and urgently on the release of prisoners of 
conscience, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the proposal he put forward to the authorities 
to begin with certain categories of prisoners such as the elderly, those with health 
limitations, long-serving prisoners and women who have children. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to underline the utmost urgency of the release of those prisoners whose lives are at 
risk if proper medical attention is not received, including those who have endured torture 
and ill-treatment during years in detention in harsh conditions. There are reportedly 130 
prisoners of conscience in poor health, 19 of them requiring urgent medical treatment. 
</p>
<p>17. Over 260 sentenced prisoners have been transferred to prisons far from their 
hometowns, in isolated areas around the country, making it difficult for their families to 
ensure regular visits. At least 47 of them &#8212; including Htay Kywe, Min Ko Naing, Su Su 
Nway and Zarganar &#8212; have been transferred to prisons over 1,000 km away from their 
families. The impossibility to see each other on a regular basis can have a psychological 
impact on both the prisoners and their families. A number of prisoners have been 
transferred to other prisons without their families being notified, such that the families lose 
track of the prisoner&#8217;s whereabouts. There are serious concerns for the health and well-
being of prisoners of conscience who are unable to receive family visits as they do not 
receive important supplementary food or medicines.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has noted previously the importance of financial support 
that the International Committee of the Red Cross provides families so they can visit their 
detained relatives. He again invites the authorities to re-engage with the International 
Committee in order for it to conduct prison visits, in accordance with its established 
mandate, which have been suspended since December 2005.   
</p>
<p>19. On his latest mission, the Special Rapporteur was allowed to visit three prisons &#8212; 
Sittwe, Buthidaung and Insein &#8212; where he met with 14 prisoners of conscience and one 
former child soldier. While serious concerns on prison conditions remain, such as 
inadequate water and food rations and extortion by prison staff, the Special Rapporteur 
understands that the conditions in both Buthidaung and Insein had improved over the past 
few months. The Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the authorities to continue 
these efforts throughout the prison system. He invites the authorities to address effectively </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the requests of prisoners who staged hunger strikes in Insein and in Buthidaung in February 
2010 for better food and health care as well as for reading and writing material. 
</p>
<p>20. There are 44 prisons in Myanmar and at least 50 labour camps. Some do not have a 
prison hospital, and at least 12 of the prisons do not even have a prison doctor. 
</p>
<p>21. In this regard the Special Rapporteur would like to draw attention to the Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which provide for, among other things: the 
services of a qualified medical officer within prisons or detention facilities; the transfer of 
prisoners and detainees who require specialist treatment to specialized institutions or to 
civil hospitals; and the provision of sufficiently nutritious food for prisoners.  
</p>
<p>22. These provisions are still not being met in Myanmar as some of the prison facilities 
do not have a prison doctor, and prisoners in many cases have to purchase their own 
medicines beyond basic pain relief pills or pay for outside treatments. The Body of 
Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment 
also provides that &#8220;medical care and treatment shall be provided whenever necessary&#8221; (art. 
24).  
</p><p>23. On 16 October 2009 the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar along with the Special Rapporteurs on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, on the situation of human rights defenders and on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
and the Chairperson of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, wrote to the 
Government regarding the case of Hla Myo Naung, who has been at serious risk of total 
blindness unless he receives specialist medical treatment. He had already been the subject 
of a joint urgent appeal addressed on 5 November 2008. Hla Myo Naung had participated 
in demonstrations against the fuel price hike in August 2007 and was the main 
spokesperson for the 88 Generation Students. He was arrested on 10 October 2007, 
sentenced to a prison term of 65 years and 6 months in November 2008, and transferred to 
the remote Myitkyina prison shortly afterwards. An unsuccessful eye surgery was 
conducted while he was in detention and led to the loss of vision in one eye. He later began 
to experience the same symptoms in his functional eye that had led to blindness in the other 
eye. He is known to be suffering from keratitis and corneal opacity. No reply has been 
provided by the Government of Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur continues to receive reports on the alarmingly high number 
of deaths in prison. While official statistics have not been made available, it appears that 
both prisoners of conscience and regular prisoners are subject to conditions that lead to 
death. 
</p>
<p>25. Reports suggest that 143 prisoners of conscience have died in prison since 1988. 
Reports suggest that some prisoners died in prison from internal injuries that they sustained 
in interrogation camps and police stations where they were subject to brutal torture-like 
beating and kicking. Often, the bodies of the prisoners of conscience are cremated before 
the family can view them. 
</p>
<p>26. It is reported that in Sittwe Prison authorities register deaths of prisoners in prison as 
having taken place on the way to Sittwe General Hospital during the transfer process. In 
November 2009, four prisoners died in Sittwe Prison: Myo Kyaw, Daw Aung Tha Paing, U 
Sate Taung and Abu Ahlong. 
</p>
<p>27. Deprivation of food and water as punishment are reported to continue in Myanmar&#8217;s 
prisons. The State has the responsibility to ensure the protection and proper treatment of 
those put in detention, including providing adequate food and medical care in accordance </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>with universally accepted standards and the principles contained in international human 
rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>28. According to media reports six prisoners died in Insein Prison in Yangon during the 
week of 28 October &#8211; 4 November 2009. According to reliable sources they are: U Win 
Aung, former Foreign Minister U Win Aung, Ma Thida Soe from Pazuntaung, Mayanthee 
from Mingaladon, Ko Phyo, Myint Wei and Pho Si.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur wishes to remind the Government of Myanmar that the State 
has the responsibility to ensure adequate budget allocation to prisons to ensure proper 
health facilities and conditions. 
</p>
<p>30. On 23 December 2009 Tin Tin Htwe Ma Pae, aged 38, died in Insein Prison from a 
burst aneurysm. She was sentenced along with 14 other political activists because of their 
involvement in the 2007 demonstrations on 24 November 2007, under sections 332 
(hindering a public servant from carrying out their duty) and 294 (covering obscene acts 
and songs in public), to three years and three months with hard labour. She is the third 
prisoner of conscience to die in prison in 2009.  
</p>
<p>31. International standards require that an inquiry into the cause of death be held by a 
judicial or other authority and that the findings of such inquiry be made available upon 
request. The authorities must ensure that each death in detention is fully investigated, that 
causes for deaths identified, that families are informed in timely fashion, that lessons are 
learned and that accountability is clearly established. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to investigate all deaths of those in detention. 
</p>
<p>32. On 29 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in 
Myanmar, along with the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Chairperson 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, wrote to the Government regarding the case 
of Kyaw Zaw Lwin (a.k.a. Nyi Nyi Aung). On 3 September, Kyaw Zaw Lwin was arrested 
and taken to Insein Prison in Yangon. During his interrogation, he was subject to ill-
treatment. On 16 December, the same group sent a follow-up letter to the Government. He 
was originally accused of entering the country with the intention to prompt unrest in the 
nation. The Government of Myanmar replied on 8 February 2010 that Kyaw Zaw Lwin was 
found guilty of forging a national identity card, failing to declare currency at customs, and 
failing to renounce his Myanmar citizenship, and he was sentenced to five years in prison. 
</p>
<p>33. Of serious concern to the Special Rapporteur are reports that prisoners of conscience 
are subject to torture during the interrogation period and in detention. According to 
testimonies from prisoners of conscience who were released, there are systematic patterns 
of abuse and torture of detainees. Various forms of physical, psychological and sexual 
abuse by officials have been detailed in reports. Deliberately poor prison conditions 
combined with purposeful medical negligence cause extreme suffering of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress the importance of the need for human 
rights training for the military and prison staff to ensure their awareness of and compliance 
with international standards and rules for the treatment of prisoners. This is part of one of 
the four core human rights elements. During his meeting with the Chief of Police, the 
Special Rapporteur was told that the Government has started a training programme on 
human rights for new recruits at the township level. The Special Rapporteur did not receive 
substantive details about the training programmes and would welcome more information 
from the authorities.  </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Due process of law 
</b></p>
<p>35. Another core human rights element recommended to the Government by the Special 
Rapporteur is the establishment of an independent and impartial judiciary. Without such a 
judiciary, Myanmar does not have functioning rule of law. The current system of 
administration of justice is seriously flawed. 
</p><p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Constitution of Myanmar (2008), in chapter 1, 
paragraph 19, establishes important judicial principles: (a) to administer justice 
independently according to the law; (b) to dispense justice in open court unless otherwise 
prohibited by the law; (c) to guarantee in all cases the right of defence and the right of 
appeal under the law. However, in reality, many trials are conducted behind closed doors 
within prison compounds, without legal representation, without the presence or knowledge 
of their family members, without proof of evidence or with defective evidence, and 
pursuant to arbitrary decisions of the judges. 
37. The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Myanmar authorities to the 
existence of a body of internationally accepted standards and principles in the area of 
human rights in the administration of justice, including the treatment of prisoners, role of 
lawyers, role of prosecutors, independence of the judiciary and conduct of law enforcement 
officials, which must guide the authorities to ensure fair trials and due process of law. The 
Special Rapporteur underlines the necessity of legal reform through review of legislation 
and procedures to ensure conformity with human rights standards and respect for the basic 
principles of the presumption of innocence, due process of the law and independence of the 
judiciary. 
38. Defence lawyers face great difficulties ranging from not being informed of the dates 
and venues of the trials, to not being allowed to meet the detainees in private in advance of 
the trials. The right to defence through proper legal representation has to be ensured in law 
as well as in practice. Lawyers must be allowed to defend clients without harassment and 
without the threat of charges for the contempt of court. However, the Special Rapporteur 
has continued to receive disturbing information on the conviction of defence lawyers for 
contempt of court. The Contempt of Court Act (1926) contains such brief and broad 
formulations that it is open for any arbitrary interpretations. Some 11 lawyers are currently 
imprisoned. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to flag to the Government the 
Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur repeats his call for the termination of the detention of Daw 
Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest, which is in contravention to international and 
domestic law. He regrets the decision of the Supreme Court to reject her appeal against her 
house arrest on 26 February 2010. He regrets also that the Government did not grant his 
special request to meet with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on his third mission. 
</p>
<p>40. While the Special Rapporteur again commends the Government for the effective 
moratorium on the use of death penalty, he regrets that lower courts continue to hand down 
death sentences. During his last mission, the Special Rapporteur raised this issue with the 
Attorney General and Chief Justice as a step backwards for Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is also deeply concerned about reports that Aung Ko Htay, a 
child soldier, now aged 16, has been sentenced to death<b> </b>for involvement in the killing of a 
soldier during a fight. He was recruited into the army when he was 14 years old. The 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Myanmar is a State party, prohibits the 
execution of people for offences committed under the age of 18. According to the country&#8217;s 
Child Law (1993), chapter XVIII, article 71, a child should not be punished by death or 
imprisonment exceeding 10 years.<b> </b></p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>42. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second mission to Myanmar, the Chief Justice 
accepted his recommendation to engage with the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers. However, when the latter sent a visit request in March 2009, the 
Government replied in April that it had other commitments. The Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar again raised this recommendation on his third 
mission. The Chief Justice again said that the Government of Myanmar would welcome the 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. Such a mission would be an 
indication of seriousness in addressing the problem of judicial independence and 
impartiality.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of expression, assembly and association in the light of the 2010 
elections 
</b></p>
<p>43. The freedom of opinion and expression, as well as, freedom of assembly and 
association are fundamental rights enshrined in the UDHR and are guaranteed by 
international human rights treaties including those to which Myanmar is a State party, 
namely, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention concerning Freedom of 
Association and Protection of the Right to Organize, 1948 (No. 87) of the International 
Labour Organization (ILO). These freedoms are essential for the functioning of a 
democratic society, critical for the organization of meaningful and credible elections, and 
necessary for reflecting the diversity of a multi-ethnic society. They are exercised through 
the existence of an independent media, vibrant civil society and independent trade unions. 
</p>
<p>44. As 2010 is the year announced for holding national elections, freedom of opinion 
and expression, as well as assembly and association, are more necessary than ever. The 
elections cannot be free, fair, transparent and inclusive, in accordance with international 
standards, without those freedoms. At present essential conditions allowing for the exercise 
of these rights do not exist in Myanmar. Dissenting voices are not allowed, and all 
publications are subject to censorship by the Press Scrutiny and Registration Board of the 
Ministry of Information. Other censorship boards exercise control in the field of arts and 
culture. Journalists exercise a high level of self-censorship in order to survive or otherwise 
risk seeing their licences revoked as has happened to many journals and magazines. 
45. There are currently at least 12 journalists and many more bloggers<b> </b> in prison<i>. </i>In 
effect, many of the other prisoners of conscience are incarcerated for offences that are 
linked to a denial of this freedom, or sometimes charged for completely unrelated offences. 
</p>
<p>46. In its resolution 64/238, the General Assembly strongly calls upon the Government 
of Myanmar to lift restrictions on the freedom of assembly, association, movement and 
freedom of expression, including for free and independent media, including through the 
openly available and accessible use of Internet and mobile telephone services, and ending 
the use of censorship. In his previous report, the Special Rapporteur indicated several 
domestic laws that restrict the principles of freedom of association and assembly: most 
importantly, the Unlawful Association Act (1908), the State Protection Act (1975), as well 
as sections 143, 145, 152, 505, 505 (b) and 295 (A) of the Penal Code. 
</p><p>47. These laws continue to be used to restrict freedom of expression and association. 
With regard to freedom of opinion and expression, the Television and Video Law (1985), 
the Motion Picture Law (1996), the Computer Science Development Law (1996), 
Electronic Transactions Law (2004) and the Printers and Publishers Registration Act (1962) 
are being used to censor the media. 
</p>
<p>48. It is important to note that these laws are in contravention of international law, inter 
alia articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, articles 13 and 15 of </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as ILO Convention 87, to which 
Myanmar is a State party, and which explicitly calls upon Governments to ensure the full 
enjoyment of freedom of expression and association. As a State party to these conventions 
and a Member State of the United Nations, the Government of Myanmar should ensure 
compliance of domestic laws with its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>49. A review of national laws to ensure they are in compliance with international 
standards is one of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s four core human rights elements. According to 
the Attorney General, the Government has been reviewing national legislation and has 
found that half are not in line with the new Constitution, and 50 laws will be deleted. Some 
laws remain to be reviewed, but that should be completed before the end of the year. No 
details were provided on the specific laws mentioned above, which the Special Rapporteur 
enquired about during his third mission. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur has received information that several journalists have been 
convicted under the Electronic Transactions Law and the Television and Video Law. He 
remains concerned about restrictions on the media, including censorship of newspapers, the 
Internet and other sources of information, and the threatening of journalists with heavy 
prison sentences under the above-mentioned laws. Win Zaw Naing, 24, has been held since 
December 2009 by police in the Yangon district of Kyauktada, where he has not been 
allowed to see a lawyer. He was arrested under article 33 (a) of the Electronic Transactions 
Law, which provides for sentences of up to 15 years in prison. He was arrested for posting 
photos of the September 2007 protests, including of Buddhist monks, on his blog. 
According to reports, freelance reporter Hla Hla Win, age 25, was arrested in September 
2009 after visiting a Buddhist monastery in the northern town of Pakokku. She was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison on 31 December 2009 for an alleged violation of the 
Electronics Transactions Law. A man accompanying her was sentenced to 26 years in jail. 
</p><p>51. In Sittwe prison, the Special Rapporteur met Aung Tun Myint, age 33, a video 
journalist, who was arrested in 2008 for filming outside a polling station during the 
referendum on the new Constitution. Although the polling station was in Yangon, which is 
not near any border, he was sentenced to three years in prison under charges related to the 
immigration act. His three video cameras and mobile phone were confiscated, and he lost 
his work including interviews from the Cyclone Nargis aftermath. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur has continued to receive information about ongoing 
restrictions on the right to form trade unions. Several individuals have been detained, 
convicted and sentenced to long terms in prison for their association with trade unions, 
including the banned Federation of Trade Unions of Burma. 
</p>
<p>53. In Buthidaung Prison, the Special Rapporteur met Kyaw Min, age 23, who received 
a 28-year sentence for his activities related to organizing workers. He noted that everything 
he and his colleagues did was within the bounds of the law. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Minister of Labour of discussions 
between the Government and ILO about assistance in drafting a trade union act. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes this initiative and hopes that the law will conform to 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>55. The continuous building of democracy, which is the aim of the seven-step road map 
as declared by the Government, requires the active participation of civil society including 
independent NGOs. Organized groups such as associations of monks, students and human 
rights defenders have been harshly suppressed. Currently some 500 monks and students 
remain imprisoned. The well known 88 Generation Students group has been punished most 
severely for advocating peaceful democratic changes. Many of its prominent members have 
been arrested and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. During his last mission, the Special 
Rapporteur met two of its leaders, Htay Kywe in Buthidaung and Than Tin in Sittwe, </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>serving 65-year sentences far from their homes. Prisoners of conscience like these who 
believe in peaceful national reconciliation and democratic changes must be released to play 
a legitimate and important role in the upcoming elections. 
</p>
<p>56. On 3 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur, along with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders and the Chairperson for the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention, wrote an urgent appeal regarding the arrest and detention of 27 
members of the National League for Democracy. Three other members of the League were 
arrested around the same time, but later released. The Government responded on 29 
November that these members were attempting to create unrest and were questioned by the 
police and released on the same day. In section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is 
provided that a police officer has the right to arrest any person who intends to commit a 
crime without an order and warrant issued by a criminal judge if it appears to the police 
officer that there is no other way to prevent the crime. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The Constitution and transition to democracy </b></p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has previously noted the problem of impunity in Myanmar, 
and he has called for prompt measures to establish accountability and responsibility with 
regard to widespread and systematic human rights abuses. The Constitution contains one 
article in chapter XIV on transitory provisions which could be seen to enshrine impunity 
through permanent amnesties for crimes committed by military leaders and civilian 
personnel and requires clarification. Article 445 states that &#8220;no proceeding shall be 
instituted against the said Councils [State Law and Order Restoration Council and the State 
Peace and Development Council] or any member thereof or any member of the 
Government, in respect of any act done in the execution of their respective duties&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. Article 352 states that &#8220;the Union shall, upon specified qualifications being fulfilled, 
in appointing or assigning duties to civil service personnel, not discriminate for or against 
any citizen of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, based on race, birth, religion, and 
sex. However, nothing in this Section shall prevent appointment of men to the positions that 
are suitable for men only&#8221;. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women in reviewing the periodic report submitted by Myanmar in November 2008 
expressed concern that this and other provisions in the new Constitution may be 
incompatible with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>59. The provisions in the Constitution are currently confined to citizens, and the very 
restricted requirement of having both parents as nationals of the country for citizenship will 
render some people stateless. It is estimated that there are over 723,000 people without 
citizenship in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur notes that it is important to recognize that under 
international human rights law, some fundamental rights are non-derogable and that the 
derogation of certain rights in case of declared emergencies is clearly defined. In addition, 
he wishes to reiterate the principles he has outlined with regard to restrictions on the 
enjoyment of human rights. They shall (a) be defined by law, (b) be imposed for one or 
more specific legitimate purposes, and (c) be necessary for one or more of these purposes in 
a democratic society, including proportionality. Any limitation which does not follow these 
requirements and jeopardizes the essence of the right with vague, broad and/or sweeping 
formulas, would contravene the principles of legality and international human rights law. </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Protection of civilians </b></p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about ongoing conflict in border 
areas, particularly in eastern Myanmar. Since 1996, up to 1 million people in Myanmar, 
half of them in the eastern part of the country, have been displaced. Entire communities 
have been forced to relocate and their houses and food supplies burned to prevent their 
return. Those who refuse forced relocations and choose to hide risk military attacks. While 
the number of conflict-affected areas has been reduced with ceasefire agreements, armed 
clashes affecting civilians caught in the middle continue to be reported. 
</p>
<p>62. It is estimated that there are over 184,000 refugees originating from Myanmar. An 
estimated 2 million migrants from Myanmar are currently found in Thailand. Thousands of 
ethnic Chin have crossed the border to the State of Mizoram in India, where some 75,000&#8211;
100,000 undocumented Chin from Myanmar live. Muslim residents from Northern Rakhine 
State of Myanmar continue to seek asylum in neighbouring countries and beyond. 
Approximately 28,000 are residing in two refugee camps in Bangladesh and have been 
there since 1991 in addition to about 100,000&#8211;200,0001 residing in Bangladesh with no 
legal status. There are also some 40,000 individuals of concern from Myanmar in Malaysia. 
</p>
<p>63. The presence and conduct of the military are central to the plight of these civilians. 
Military operations have placed a particularly heavy burden on rural populations, affecting 
their ability to sustain livelihoods. There have been numerous and frequent reports of 
civilians being forced to serve as porters and guides for the military, to build and maintain 
roads, to construct military camps and to labour for infrastructure projects. Cases of rape 
and sexual violence, many of them against young girls and adolescents, have been reported 
by human rights organizations over the past years as committed by military personnel. As 
with all allegations of serious human rights violations, proper investigations must be 
conducted and justice provided to the victims. 
</p><p>64. While civilians living in conflict affected areas live in fear of being suspected as 
sympathizers of armed rebel groups, they are also vulnerable to abuses by some rebel 
groups. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur is alarmed by the dire human rights situation in Shan State. 
Since 27 July 2009, it is reported that the military have burned down over 500 houses and 
scores of granaries, and forcibly relocated almost 40 villages, mostly in the Laikha 
township. According to reports, over 100 villagers, both men and women, have been 
arrested and tortured. At least three villagers have been killed. This would be the largest 
forced relocation since 1996&#8211;1998, when over 300,000 villagers in southern and central 
Shan State were displaced. 
</p>
<p>66. Battles between Government forces and ethnic groups in Shan State in August 2009 
and along the Thai border region in June 2009 have raised serious concerns about security 
both inside Myanmar and its spillover effects in neighbouring countries. As many as 37,000 
people may have fled into Nansan County in China to flee fighting between Myanmar 
Government troops and Kokang fighters. Despite Government control of the Kokang 
territory following these battles, the situation in north-eastern Myanmar remains tense 
according to reports received by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the continuing armed conflict 
in Kayin State, which severely affects the civilian population. It has been reported that in 
Hsaw Law Kho village, three villagers were killed and over a dozen more tortured by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 According to estimates of the Government of Bangladesh. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>Infantry Battalion No. 48, in the Than Tha Bin Township in the Pegu Division on 5 
November 2009. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of its obligations to fully 
implement Legislative Order No. 1/1999 on the Eradication of Forced Labour. The Special 
Rapporteur has received specific reports about human rights abuses in relation to extractive 
industry projects. 
</p><p>69. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government and all armed groups to ensure the 
protection of civilians, in particular children and women, during armed conflict. In this 
regard, recruitment of child soldiers, displacement of villagers, the use of anti-personnel 
landmines and the forced labour of civilians should stop without any delay. 
</p>
<p>70. He calls upon the Government to abide by international humanitarian law, especially 
the four Geneva Conventions to which Myanmar is a party. In particular, article 3 of the 
Geneva Conventions provides for the protection of civilians from inhumane treatment and 
violence to life and person. 
</p>
<p>71. Since 2000, the Security Council has passed four resolutions finding that the 
growing use of violence against women in situations of armed conflict threatens 
international peace and security. Resolutions 1325, 1820, 1888 and 1889 require that 
specific measures be taken to ensure women&#8217;s right to equality and justice both during and 
after conflict. 
</p>
<p>72. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed 
deep concern at the high prevalence of sexual and other forms of violence, including rape, 
perpetrated against rural women from the Shan, Mon, Karen, Palaung and Chin ethnic 
groups by members of armed forces. The Committee also expressed concern at the apparent 
impunity of the perpetrators of such violence, although a few cases have been prosecuted, 
and at reports of threats against and intimidation and punishment of the victims.<b> </b></p>
<p>73. The use of anti-personnel mines along Myanmar&#8217;s border areas, particularly in the 
east, endangers villagers. Both the military and non-State armed groups use anti-personnel 
mines. It is reported that from May until June 2009 and again since September the 
Democratic Karen Buddhist Army has increased the number of landmines it has placed in 
civilian areas throughout the Bu Tho and Dweh Loh townships. According to the 
information, villagers are not being notified of the location of the new landmines, which are 
on busy paths used by villagers, in farm field huts, around paddy fields and along the banks 
of canals. 
</p>
<p>74. Of grave concern are reports that civilians are forced by the military to clear brush in 
suspected mined areas or to serve as porters for the military in areas where there is a mine 
hazard. According to sources, civilians have been ordered to remove mines without training 
or protective equipment or to repair fences of mined areas, which have caused serious 
casualties. The Special Rapporteur calls for a moratorium on the use of landmines and for 
Myanmar to accede to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, 
Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (1997), which 
some 156 states have already ratified, acceded to, accepted or approved. He encourages the 
authorities to seek effective international cooperation and support in order to begin 
demining efforts and to provide support to victims of landmines. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur commends the efforts of the Committee on the Prevention 
of Military Recruitment of Underage Children, which include: the education of officers, 
military personnel and communities on the law regarding recruitment of underage children 
and the purpose and activities of the Committee; training on adhering to the law; 
discharging soldiers who were found to be underage; and investigating complaints received 
from ILO on forced military recruitment. Nevertheless, reports from numerous reliable </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>sources of ongoing recruitment and the estimates of upwards of thousands of underage 
soldiers call for increased measures against recruiting officers and generals. 
</p>
<p>76. Despite measures by the Government of Myanmar to prevent and halt the 
recruitment and use of child soldiers, these practices still persist in the military and by non-
State actors. Children from vulnerable poor families are particularly at risk of being lured 
into the military with promises of jobs and food. There have been reports of threats of 
arrests to children who refuse to join the military. 
</p><p>77. In 2009, ILO received 78 complaints concerning underage recruitment, of which 34 
led to releases that year; an additional 10 complaints received in 2008 led to discharges in 
2009. According to information received by the Special Rapporteur, the Government has 
released 278 child soldiers. 
</p>
<p>78. The Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict released its conclusions on 
Myanmar on 28 October 2009 (S/AC.51/2009/4) which included strong condemnation of 
all recruitment and use of children in violation of national and international law as well as 
deep concern about continued lack of humanitarian access particularly in contested and 
ceasefire areas.2 
</p>
<p>79. Non-State armed groups have recruited and used children, including through forced 
recruitment. Although the situation has been well documented by several NGOs, due to the 
restrictions in access to the border areas the United Nations has been unable to monitor and 
verify the presence of children in these groups. A United Nations country task force has 
been established as a monitoring and reporting mechanism, but the effective functioning of 
such a mechanism requires strengthened capacity, unhindered access, freedom of 
movement and witness protection guarantees. The ILO complaint mechanism on forced 
labour encompasses recruitment of child soldiers and should be given the conditions and 
means to operate effectively, including strengthened capacity of the office. 
</p>
<p>80. Recruitment of child soldiers is a crime for which perpetrators must be held 
accountable in accordance with the law. Only legal prosecution of those involved will 
contribute to ending this practice. The Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict 
urged the Myanmar Government to prosecute as a matter of priority persons responsible for 
crimes committed against children.3 Punitive measures taken to punish those involved in 
the recruitment of child soldiers have been disproportionately light and largely ineffective. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur also encourages the Government to apply the principle that 
child recruits cannot be found guilty of desertion and to adjust its policies to ensure that 
children are not charged with desertion in the first place, and are not subject to any criminal 
charges, imprisonment or any other form of harassment. There appears to be a practice of 
arresting former child soldiers for desertion some years after the fact. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur raised the case of Myo Win with the Minister of Labour. 
Myo Win was arrested in September 2009 for desertion and sentenced to seven years in a 
military court without a lawyer. He had been forcibly recruited into the military in 1996 
while still in school but escaped back home after spending four and a half months in 
training and a week in his regiment.

<p><b>16</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p><b> F. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>83. Non-discrimination is a well-established fundamental human rights principle, 
explicitly referred to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 2), as well as in the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women. Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Declaration on the Rights 
of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (1992 
Declaration on Minorities) spells out the responsibility of the State to ensure that persons 
belonging to minorities exercise fully and effectively all their human rights and 
fundamental freedoms without any discrimination and in full equality before the law. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that ethnic minorities 
are granted fundamental rights. The ethnic minorities in Myanmar should have the right to 
enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion, and to use their own 
language, in private and in public, freely and without interference or any form of 
discrimination, in accordance with the 1992 Declaration on Minorities. Policies that prevent 
teaching in ethnic languages in ethnic populated areas need to be changed. Ensuring the 
enjoyment of culture rights for ethnic minorities would contribute to the richness of 
Myanmar as a diverse and multi-ethnic country and would contribute to its political and 
social stability. 
</p>
<p>85. In the light of the 2008 Constitution, especially articles 34 (freedom of religion), 347 
(equal rights of all persons before the law), and 348 (prohibition of discrimination based on 
race, birth, religion, official position, status, culture, sex and wealth), the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to undertake the amendment of domestic laws to ensure 
the full enjoyment of human rights without discrimination for all people in Myanmar. 
</p><p>86. During his last mission, the Special Rapporteur visited Northern Rakhine State. He 
is deeply concerned about the systematic and endemic discrimination faced by the Muslim 
community, known as the Rohingya, in this State. This discrimination, which is framed as 
an immigration problem, leads to basic and fundamental human rights being denied to this 
population. Measures taken against this population include restriction of movement, 
limitations on permission to marry, and forced labour. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to end the unacceptable 
discrimination, human rights abuses and resulting severe economic deprivation they face. 
This ethnic minority continues to be denied citizenship, under the 1982 Citizenship Act, 
which contravenes generally accepted international norms to ensure that there is no State-
sanctioned discrimination on the basis of religion and ethnicity. The right of children to 
nationality and registration at birth are guaranteed by the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. 
</p>
<p>88. Since 1994 the Myanmar authorities have refused to issue birth certificates to many 
Muslim children. As a consequence of their statelessness, these children face discrimination 
with regard to education, health care and employment. 
</p>
<p>89. Unlike other people of Myanmar, this Muslim community must apply for papers 
from Nasaka, the border and immigration forces in Northern Rakhine State, which checks 
for citizenship and age of majority, in order to get married. This process is reported to cost 
40,000 kyat (about $40), which many Muslims cannot pay, and can take up to several years 
to complete. As a consequence, many Muslims are arrested and sentenced up to five years 
in prison for offenses relating to these requirements. The majority of the prison population 
of Buthidaung were Muslim, most of them for charges related to immigration or marriage 
offenses. However, the Supreme Court in 2009 overturned two convictions for illegal 
marriage. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to consider these rulings and to </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>release all those prisoners currently serving sentences for illegal marriage, a topic he raised 
with the Chief Justice during his last mission. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government should comply with the 
conclusions of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which recommended that the 
Citizenship Act be repealed4 and that in the light of articles 2 (non-discrimination) and 3 
(best interests of the child) of the Convention, &#8220;abolish the categorization of citizens, as 
well as the mention on the national identity card of the religion and the ethnic origin of 
citizens, including children. In the view of the Committee, all possibility of stigmatization 
and denial of the rights recognized by the Convention should be avoided.&#8221;5 
</p>
<p>91. Also of concern are the extreme restrictions on movement placed on this Muslim 
population due to their lack of citizenship, which limits their employment opportunities. 
The situation of poverty appears to be exacerbated by the frequent imposition of arbitrary 
taxes and forced labour, which has been on the rise since November 2008, as a consequence 
of military expansion in the area, as well as by the construction of a barbed wire fence 
along the border in March 2009 to prevent Muslims from travelling back and forth. 
</p>
<p>92. The impact of these policies of discrimination is felt through family and social 
breakdowns in the community. The situation has resulted in the exodus of many from the 
community. In 2009 hundreds attempted the dangerous journeys by boat, risking their lives 
at sea. Some were pushed back to the sea. Others remain in detention facilities in the 
countries where they landed. The risk of another mass exodus of people remains unless the 
economic and social conditions for the community are adequately addressed with respect 
for their fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>93. In Rakhine State, it is said that only 13 per cent of households<b> </b> are able to meet their 
food needs for the entire year, and 26 per cent of the population suffers from malnutrition. 
Between 70 and 90 per cent of a household&#8217;s income is allocated to food purchase. Only 30 
per cent of the population is said to receive public health care. A third of the population has 
no access to clean water. Prevalent causes of mortality are malaria, diarrhoea, respiratory 
and skin infections, intestinal parasites and cholera. The maternal mortality rate is much 
higher than in the rest of Myanmar (380 women per 100,000 births). There are three doctors 
per 430,000 people in Maungdaw, and two per 280,000 in Buthidaung. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on its agreement to extend and 
strengthen the presence of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Northern Rakhine State, and its identification of key social and economic areas 
for cooperation, which will be facilitated by the support announced by some donors. The 
Special Rapporteur hopes that all members of the United Nations Country Team could 
contribute to this cooperation in the identified areas. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Living conditions, sustenance, humanitarian assistance 
</b></p>
<p>95. The enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is seriously impeded by the 
social, economic and development conditions in the country, affecting the most vulnerable 
populations, including those in remote states and those recovering from Cyclone Nargis. 
This vulnerability is the result of the Government&#8217;s policies, and is further exacerbated by 
the impact of the global economic crisis, food insecurity and climate change.

<p><b>18</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur recalls that it is the duty of the Government of Myanmar to 
expend available resources to address the realization of basic economic, social and cultural 
rights. The denial of economic, social and cultural rights has had devastating effects in 
Myanmar, affecting an immense proportion of the population. Serious investment in the 
public service sector is urgently needed in order to make available affordable and accessible 
heath care, education, and social security coverage. 
</p>
<p>97. Infant mortality remains high, with an estimated 1 in 10 births resulting in the death 
of the infant. More than 25 per cent of the population lacks access to safe drinking water. 
Approximately half of the malaria deaths in South-East Asia occur in Myanmar. More than 
30 per cent of Myanmar&#8217;s children are chronically malnourished. The national prevalence 
of underweight and stunting among children under 5 years is 32 per cent. 
</p>
<p>98. The Government of Myanmar spends 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product 
(GDP) on health, and 0.9 per cent of GDP on education, while the military and State-owned 
enterprises together account for 80 per cent of total State spending. 
</p>
<p>99. Regional disparities in poverty remain alarming. While the figure for people below 
the official food poverty line is 10 per cent countrywide, it is 40 per cent in Chin, 21 per 
cent in northern Shan State, and 20 per cent in eastern Shan State, according to estimates. 
</p>
<p>100. In Chin State, the evolving food crisis remains of great concern. According to 
information received, up to 100,000 people in more than 200 villages are in need of food 
aid, most urgently in the southern townships of Matupi and Paletwa. 
</p>
<p>101. Scarcity of food is also reported in Northern Rakhine State, Kayin State, North and 
East Shan State, and the cyclone-affected areas. According to reliable sources, nearly 5 
million people are in need of food aid. 
</p>
<p>102. Myanmar&#8217;s earnings from natural gas are recorded at the official exchange rate for 
the kyat, which overvalues the currency by 150 to 200 times its market value. According to 
reliable sources, it is estimated that in 2009 the Government of Myanmar earned almost $3 
billion in revenues from sales of oil and natural gas. Since 2000, $4.8 billion of $4.83 
billion of the Government&#8217;s revenues on the Yadana Project appears not to have been 
included in the national budget. 
</p>
<p>103. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, during his participation in a forum in Yangon in 
December 2009 sponsored by the Government and the Economic and Social Commission 
for Asia and the Pacific, noted that revenues from oil and gas provided an opportunity for 
the Government to &#8220;open up a new era if used well&#8221;. In fact, the Government of Myanmar 
is obligated by international treaties to which it is a State party to expend these available 
resources to the furtherance of the economic, social and cultural rights of the people of 
Myanmar. The Government&#8217;s compliance with the obligation to take appropriate measures 
is assessed in the light of available resources. Article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child states: &#8220;With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, States Parties shall 
undertake such measures to the maximum extent of their available resources and, where 
needed, within the framework of international co-operation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>104. With regard to the health sector, the Special Rapporteur notes that the right to health 
remains an obligation of the Government of Myanmar. Vulnerable groups, including 
widows and orphans, need special attention and protection as laid down in the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>105. An estimated 240,000 people are thought to be living with HIV/AIDS in Myanmar. 
Among them, 76,000 are in urgent need of antiretroviral treatment, yet less than 20 per cent 
of them currently have access to it. In 2008, about 25,000 people died of AIDS-related 
illnesses. </p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the return of<b> </b> The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria to Myanmar in November 2009. The Global Fund has agreed to 
provide Myanmar with $110 million to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, after 
pulling out of the country in 2005. 
</p>
<p>107. Although it is over a year and a half since Cyclone Nargis ripped through the 
Irrawaddy Delta, killing 140,000 and leaving 2.4 million destitute, the situation remains 
fragile. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the achievements of the Tripartite Core Group, 
established in May 2008 by the Government of Myanmar, ASEAN and the United Nations, 
in its relief efforts. The Post-Nargis and Regional Partnership Conference, held on 25 
November 2009 in Bangkok, reported that shelter was the most important need identified 
for now. There was still an overall gap of 178,000 households that required urgent shelter 
assistance and that had been waiting for support from the humanitarian community for over 
a year. 
</p>
<p>108. Myanmar receives one of the lowest levels of overseas development assistance. 
Donors cite the human rights situation as a key obstacle, along with issues of access and 
other restrictions on the delivery of aid. However, the social development indicators of the 
country call for concerted action and support. Urgent measures are required to ensure the 
most basic human rights of the most vulnerable people, especially those ethnic communities 
residing in remote border areas. According to the <i>Human Development Report 2009</i>, 
Myanmar is still one of the least developed countries, ranking 138th of 182 nations on the 
human development index, despite its rich natural resources. 
</p>
<p>109. Commitments by the authorities in addressing barriers to development assistance 
would be the fundamental step in encouraging stronger international support, such as lifting 
administrative restrictions that threaten to limit the work of NGOs and aid workers, and the 
release of those who have been imprisoned for involvement in post-Nargis relief efforts. 
</p>
<p>110. Access to international agencies and organizations would help facilitate not only 
humanitarian work but would also help verify information coming out of border areas and 
other restricted zones which, in complaints, the Government has characterized as inaccurate 
and resulting from malicious reports deliberately made by opposing forces. 
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur is aware of reports of human rights abuses associated with 
large-scale development projects in Myanmar, in relation to oil and gas industries, mining 
and the building of large-scale dams. The alarming depletion of resources in Myanmar is of 
concern, as is the relationship between the extractive industries and a vast array of human 
rights violations. In Myanmar the mining of gold, gemstones, copper and other plentiful 
mineral resources has been linked to land confiscation, forced labour, and violations of the 
right to a healthy environment and the right to water. 
</p>
<p>112. It has been reported that extraction activities have directly resulted in an increase in 
human rights and environmental abuses committed by the military against the people living 
along the PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited&#8217;s Yadana and Yetagun 
gas pipeline projects in the Tenasserim region of Myanmar. Reports highlight the close 
relationship between the extraction companies and the armed forces. The companies rely on 
the Myanmar military to provide security for their projects. Similar negative impact is 
caused in the context of the Kanbauk to Myaing Kalay gas pipeline project, operated by the 
Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, and the Shwe gas pipeline project, the majority 
stakeholder of which is Daewoo International. According to reports, there is rampant use of 
forced labour in the areas. 
</p>
<p>113. The Special Representative on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises has defined the policy framework in regard to 
this issue (see A/HRC/8/5). The framework rests on three complementary pillars: the State 
duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business, through </p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.10-11915 
</p>
<p>appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; the corporate responsibility to respect 
human rights, which in essence means to act with due diligence to avoid infringing on the 
rights of others; and greater access by victims to effective remedy, judicial and non-judicial. 
The Special Rapporteur hopes that this policy framework is incorporated and applied in 
Myanmar by all parties concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Developing cooperation in the context of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the cooperation between the United Nations 
Country Team and the Governmental human rights body. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Member States of the United Nations and the donor community 
to provide adequate resources and the necessary environment to the United Nations and 
financial institutions to assist the Government of Myanmar in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals. Children, women and all people of Myanmar should be given the same 
opportunity as those in any other Member State to achieve their economic, social and 
cultural rights. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government of 
Myanmar to cooperate with international organizations by facilitating necessary visas and 
allowing access for effective delivery of aid. 
</p>
<p>115. Myanmar is party only to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, as 
a Member State of the United Nations, it is still bound by the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights proclaimed on 10 December 1948 and subsequent Declarations adopted by 
the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>116. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women considered in 
November 2008 the second and third reports of Myanmar covering the period 2000&#8211;2006. 
The Government should take heed of the Committee&#8217;s requests that the State party provide, 
within one year, written information on the steps undertaken to implement the 
recommendations contained in paragraph 29 regarding the pursuance of sustained policies 
aimed at the promotion of women&#8217;s full and equal participation in decision-making in all 
areas of public, political and professional life, and paragraph 43, regarding violence and 
discrimination against women in Northern Rakhine State, of its concluding observations 
(CEDAW/C/MMR/CO/3). The Committee also requested the State party to consider 
seeking technical cooperation and assistance, including advisory services, if necessary and, 
when appropriate, for implementation of the above recommendations. 
</p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the extension of the Supplementary 
Understanding between the Government of the Union of Myanmar and the International 
Labour Office for one year from 26 February 2010. ILO operates, in agreement with the 
Government of Myanmar, a forced labour complaints mechanism which covers complaints 
of underage recruitment into the military and the inappropriate use of prison labour. 
Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur remains disturbed by the situation of four farmers 
associated with forced labour complaints to ILO who, following the release of 10 farmers 
on 17 February 2010, are currently in prison on charges which clearly breach the spirit and 
letter of the protections provided in the Supplementary Understanding. He is also concerned 
about the situation of a facilitator and a lawyer who had assisted the farmers, who remain in 
prison on allegedly unrelated charges. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and Recommendations 
</b>118. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Myanmar for 
its increased cooperation in facilitating his brief but very intensive third mission. </b></p>


<p>GE.10-11915 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The recommendations that the Special Rapporteur has made to the 
Government since his first report to the General Assembly in September 2008 
(A/63/341), including the four core human rights elements, still apply in the context of 
the announced intention to hold elections this year. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>As the Special Rapporteur stated in previous reports, there is a pattern of gross 
and systematic violation of human rights which has been in place for many years and 
still continues. The human rights that are part of this pattern are broad-ranging and 
include the rights to life, to liberty, to personal integrity, to freedom of expression, 
assembly and religion, to judicial remedy and due process of law, to nationality, to 
protection of civilians and internally displaced communities and to prohibition against 
discrimination, among others. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>Given the gross and systematic nature of human rights violations in Myanmar 
over a period of many years, and the lack of accountability, there is an indication that 
those human rights violations are the result of a State policy that involves authorities 
in the executive, military and judiciary at all levels. According to consistent reports, 
the possibility exists that some of these human rights violations may entail categories 
of crimes against humanity or war crimes under the terms of the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The mere existence of this possibility obliges the Government of Myanmar to 
take prompt and effective measures to investigate these facts. There have clearly been 
cases where it has been necessary to establish responsibility, but this has not been 
done. Given this lack of accountability, United Nations institutions may consider the 
possibility to establish a commission of inquiry with a specific fact-finding mandate to 
address the question of international crimes. At this particular stage in the history of 
Myanmar, the State faces this critical assignment which must be addressed by this 
Government and by a newly elected Government as well. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>With plans for the first national elections in 20 years, Myanmar faces an 
opportunity for positive change. Respect for human rights is a fundamental condition 
for that change to be positive. Nevertheless, during his last mission, the Special 
Rapporteur received no indication that all prisoners of conscience would be released, 
that freedom of opinion and association would be guaranteed in the context of these 
elections, and that ethnic communities would be able to fully participate. The Special 
Rapporteur hopes that the Government seriously considers and ultimately 
implements the necessary steps for ensuring credible elections and substantive 
changes to the human rights situation in Myanmar.
