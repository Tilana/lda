<p><i>Summary 
</i> In its resolution 11/10, the Human Rights Council decided that the independent 
</p>
<p>expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan would assume the mandate and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 7/16 and 9/17. In this 
</p>
<p>connection, the independent expert is submitting a report on the  implementation of the 
</p>
<p>remaining short- and medium-term recommendations identified in the first report of the 
</p>
<p>Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6), taking into account the final report of the Group of Experts 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/6/19) and the replies of the Government thereon. In its resolution 15/27, the 
</p>
<p>Council extended the mandate of the independent expert and requested him to submit a 
</p>
<p>report to the Council for consideration at its eighteenth session.   
</p>
<p> The independent expert has followed up the effective implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations through dialogue with the Government of the Sudan. He has assessed the

</p>
<p>measures taken by the Government to implement the recommendations compiled by the 
</p>
<p>Group of Experts and provides the Council with a description and analysis of the status of 
</p>
<p>implementation that is as detailed as possible. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of the information received, the independent expert concludes that the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Sudan has not taken any significant steps towards the implementation of 
</p>
<p>most of the recommendations since his previous report to the Council. He also notes that a 
</p>
<p>significant number of the recommendations has not been implemented in spite of the fact 
</p>
<p>that the time frame for implementation elapsed more than three years ago. The independent 
</p>
<p>expert notes that, while initial steps have been taken by the Government with regard to 
</p>
<p>certain recommendations, they have not had a sufficient impact on the ground. He reiterates 
</p>
<p>that the ultimate measure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>compiled by the Group of Experts has to be concrete improvement in the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Darfur. 
</p>
<p> The independent expert encourages the Government of the Sudan to take all 
</p>
<p>necessary measures to implement the recommendations compiled by the Group of Experts 
</p>
<p>on Darfur without further delay, in a more constructive engagement with the Council, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system in general and the international community. 
</p>
<p> Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts towards a process of cooperative engagement to 
</p>
<p>foster the effective implementation of recommendations, key recommendations are yet to 
</p>
<p>be implemented. The independent expert therefore recommends that the Council continue 
</p>
<p>its process of review, in accordance with the indicators for assessing implementation 
</p>
<p>developed by the Group of Experts, until such time as there is full implementation of all 
</p>
<p>recommendations. The Council may also wish to consider what further action is required to 
</p>
<p>concretely protect and promote the human rights of people in the Darfur region of the 
</p>
<p>Sudan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council adopted, without a vote, on 30 March 2007, resolution 
4/8 on the follow-up to its decision S-4/101. In its resolution 4/8, the Council decided to 
convene a group of seven mandate holders to ensure the effective follow-up and to foster 
the implementation of the resolutions and recommendations on Darfur adopted by the 
Council, the Commission on Human Rights and other United Nations human rights 
institutions, as well as to promote the implementation of relevant recommendations of other 
United Nations human rights mechanisms, taking into account the needs of the Sudan in 
this regard, to safeguard the consistency of these recommendations and to contribute to the 
monitoring of the human rights situation on the ground. The group of experts was presided 
over by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and 
comprised the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 6/34, the Council requested the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in the Sudan to ensure effective follow-up and to foster the implementation 
of the remaining short- and medium-term recommendations identified in the first report of 
the Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6) through an open and constructive dialogue with the 
Government of the Sudan, taking into account the final report of the Group of Experts 
(A/HRC/6/19) and the replies of the Government thereon, and to include information in this 
regard in her report to the Council at its ninth session. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 7/16, the Council urged the Government of the Sudan to continue 
and intensify its efforts to implement the recommendations identified by the Group of 
Experts, in accordance with the specified time frames and indicators. The Council invited relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, including the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, to continue to provide support and technical 
assistance to the Sudan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Group of 
Experts, and called upon donors to continue to provide financial and technical assistance 
and required equipment for the improvement of human rights in the Sudan and to continue 
to provide support for the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. 
</p>
<p>4. The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 11/10, in which the Council 
created the mandate of the independent expert and requested him to assume the mandate 
and responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 7/16 and 9/17, 
including following up and fostering the implementation of the remaining 
recommendations of the Group of Experts through open and constructive dialogue, and to 
include information thereon in his report. In resolution 15/27, the Council extended the 
mandate of the independent expert for one year and requested the expert to report to the 
Council during its eighteenth session. The present report reflects information received from 
the Government of the Sudan and from other sources including UNAMID, UNMIS and 
United Nations agencies, bodies and programmes with operational competence in Darfur.  
</p>
<p>5. Using the indicators contained in the annex to the Group&#8217;s report submitted to the 
Council (A/HRC/5/6), the independent expert provides an assessment of the Government&#8217;s 
activities in implementing the recommendations to be achieved in the short- and medium-
term, as well as the degree of impact reported on the ground in Darfur. Accordingly, the 
present report focuses on developments in Darfur from May 2010 to June 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>6. The independent expert continued to follow the methodology used by the Group of 
Experts in its work: 
</p>
<p> (a) To cooperate and work in a transparent manner with the Government of the 
Sudan and other relevant partners of the international community; 
</p>
<p> (b) To identify obstacles to the implementation of previous recommendations;  
</p>
<p> (c) To differentiate short-term from medium-term recommendations with a view 
to assisting the Government of the Sudan to implement fully the recommendations 
identified and to keep the victims of past and ongoing human rights violations of human 
rights and humanitarian law in central focus, with the aim of reducing such violations in the 
future.  
</p>
<p>7. In line with the indicators specified, this report focuses on the state of 
implementation on two levels: On the one hand, it examines to what extent the Government 
of the Sudan has undertaken recommended activities. This assessment is based on 
information provided and documentation submitted by the Government. On the other hand, 
the report analyses information received from UNAMID, UNMIS, UN agencies and other 
organizations which are operational in Darfur with a view to identifying whether and to 
what extent any tangible impact on the ground is being reported. This methodology permits 
the independent expert to conclude, in relation to each recommendation, whether (a) it was 
fully implemented (i.e., all recommended activities were carried out and, as a result, the 
situation on the ground has been reported to have improved accordingly); (b) significant 
activities have been undertaken and a tangible impact has been reported from the ground; 
(c) significant activities have been undertaken but little or no practical impact has been 
reported; (d) initial steps towards implementation have been taken; or (e) there was no 
implementation at all. While this report synthesizes the findings of the independent expert, 
the appendix sets out in detail information received from the Government and other sources 
as well as the independent expert&#8217;s assessment for each of the recommendations contained 
in the first report of the Group of Experts to the Council (A/HCR/5/6).  
</p>
<p>8. The independent expert summarizes the present status of implementation for each of 
the four main clusters of recommendations identified, namely: (a) human rights protection; 
(b) humanitarian access, including protection of humanitarian workers from harassment and 
attacks, and facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced; (c) accountability and 
justice; and (d) monitoring of implementation of recommendations. The report ends with 
the independent expert&#8217;s main conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p>9. The independent expert sought to ensure, as far as possible, that the information was 
based on first-hand observations, careful verification and, wherever appropriate, inter-
agency corroboration. The independent expert is grateful to all those who submitted 
information on the current status of implementation of recommendations according to the 
time frame and indicators specified by the Group of Experts on Darfur. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Status of implementation of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection of the human rights of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of the civilian population, including internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>10. Regarding the protection of the civilian population, the Group of Experts had 
proposed that the Government of the Sudan issue and enforce clear orders to the armed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>forces and any militias under Government&#8217;s control that it is prohibited to make civilians or 
civilian objects (including cultivated land and livestock) the target of attacks or to launch 
indiscriminate attacks (including burning of villages and aerial bombardments); that such 
attacks can amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, that suspects, including 
bearers of command responsibility, will be investigated and brought to justice, and that any 
immunities would be waived (recommendation 1.1.1).  
</p>
<p>11. Compared to previous years, very few aerial bombardments and indiscriminate attacks 
on civilians were documented. However, the security situation in Darfur deteriorated 
significantly from December 2010 onwards as a result of renewed fighting between 
Government forces and the armed movements. Fighting between the Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) and the SLA/MM in Shangil Tobaya and Dar el Salaam in North Darfur and 
Khor Abeche in South Darfur began in early December 2010 and continued throughout 
January and February 2011. Fighting also broke out between the SAF and the Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) around the same period in Dar es Salaam. It continued 
intermittently and involved ground attacks by soldiers, militia, and rebels and aerial 
bombardments by the SAF.  
</p>
<p>12. Bombing of several villages in North Darfur including Um Shisha, Sortony and Wadi 
Mura were reported in February. While it did not appear that civilians were specifically 
targeted, close to about 40,000 civilians were displaced from these clashes. More than 
15,000 of them sought temporary shelter around a UNAMID team site in Khor Abeche 
where UNAMID provided limited assistance. The rest migrated northwards to Zamzam 
IDP camp near El Fasher and to Tawila, north west of El Fasher estimated 2,000 
households (recommendation 1.1.1). 
</p>
<p>13. Civilians continued to be attacked by all parties to the conflict, including by the 
Sudanese Armed Force, the armed movement, militia groups and unknown armed elements. 
On 2 September 2010, an unidentified armed group attacked a market in the village of 
Tabarat, in North Darfur, killing more than 30 civilians. In Shangil Tobaya, civilians were 
reportedly killed when clashes erupted between members of a local Zaghawa community 
and an unidentified militia group between 31 May and 3 June. UNAMID&#8217;s investigation 
confirmed that at least 4 people belonging to the Zaghawa tribe were killed when they 
attempted to retrieve their stolen livestock from the militia group. Inter-tribal clashes, 
however decreased considerably during the reporting period. This may be attributable to 
UNAMID&#8217;s increasing robust military and police presence and the Government&#8217;s efforts in 
promoting reconciliation between communities. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government did not make any new effort to send regular patrols to protect 
vulnerable populations. However, it facilitated the deployment of more UNAMID troops on 
the ground. UNAMID in turn conducted more regular patrols to most camps for internally 
displaced persons in Darfur. Nevertheless, security in the camps remained precarious. 
Incidents of night time shooting and sexual violence against women who  ventured out of 
the camp continued to be reported in spite of UNAMID&#8217;s 24/7 patrols. There have been no 
joint patrols carried out between UNAMID and Sudanese forces (recommendation 1.1.5).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Protection of women against violence 
</b></p>
<p>15. Several statements were made by Government officials during the reporting period 
publicly acknowledging and condemning violence against women. For example the 
Governor of North Darfur in a keynote<b> </b>address commemorating the 16 Days of Activism 
against Violence Against Women on November 25, 2010 called on all Darfurians to join in 
the struggle to stop violence against women.<b> </b>In spite of the significant measures taken by 
the Government to address sexual violence in Darfur, the persistent climate of impunity 
continues to create an environment conducive to the perpetration of sexual violence. Many 
incidents of sexual violence were not reported due to fear of social stigma associated with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>rape, fear of reprisal and the victims&#8217; lack of trust in the police to effectively investigate and 
prosecute offenders. From May 2010 to June 2011, UNAMID documented more than 70 
cases of sexual and gender based violence. Furthermore, the police do not have the capacity 
to follow up and investigate cases of sexual violence in areas under the control or influence 
of armed groups. Notwithstanding these challenges, there have been a number of positive 
steps taken by the Government to combat sexual and gender based violence. UNAMID 
document 41 reported cases of sexual and gender based violence that were fully 
investigated by the police. In North Darfur, the authorities have significantly increased the 
number of female police investigators while in West and South Darfur, female police 
investigators have recently been posted in Family and Child Protection Units of the Police 
solely to handle cases of violence against women; statements were made by State officials 
regarding the overall weakness of the justice system to hold perpetrators accountable 
(recommendation 1.2.2).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Children and armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>16. In May 2010, the high ranking officers of the Sudan Armed Forces met with child 
protection representatives of UNAMID, UNMIS and UNICEF to discuss Sudan&#8217;s 
preparation of and commitment to an action plan to end the use of child soldiers. In a 
follow up meeting in October 2010, the Government agreed to include basic child 
protection principles proposed by the UN in the action plan and to submit regular progress 
reports through UNMIS and UNAMID. While the UN team acknowledged that the Sudan 
Armed Forces do not have a policy to recruit children for combat, it expressed concern over 
continuous association of children with armed elements. The Ministry of Defence agreed to 
enable access to all its facilities by the UN. (recommendation 1.3.2). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Protection against summary executions, arbitrary detention, disappearances and 
torture 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Government security apparatus, notably the National Security Service and the 
Sudan Military Intelligence continued to commit human rights violations including 
arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill treatment of detainees. Individuals targeted 
included human rights activists, community leaders and people perceived to have ties with 
the armed movements. During the reporting period, UNAMID documented at least more 
than one hundred cases of arbitrary arrests and detentions involving over two hundred 
victims. The detainees were often held for prolonged periods without charge and not given 
the opportunity to contest the lawfulness of their detention before a court of law. The 
Government did not issue new instructions that summary executions, arbitrary detention, 
enforced or involuntary disappearances and torture are illegal and will not be tolerated, and 
that they can amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>18. The state of emergency in Darfur and the application of the NSS Act 2010 and the 
Emergency and Public Safety Protection Act 1997 continue to curtail fundamental rights 
and freedoms. The law grants wide discretionary powers of arrest and detention to the State 
governors of Darfur without any effective judicial review. In October 2010, two IDPs who 
took part in a meeting with a visiting UN Security Council delegation to Abu Shouk IDP 
camp were arrested and detained by the NSS.  They were subsequently released but never 
charged with an offense. One of them was rearrested in November but released again. Two 
UNAMID staff arrested in April and May this year in South and North Darfur were 
detained for several weeks, without being charged with an offence. (recommendations 1.4.1 
and 1.4.2). 
</p>
<p>19. UNAMID human rights monitors do not have unfettered access to detention centers 
in Darfur especially access to persons held under emergency and national security laws. 
Access to NSS and Military Intelligence detention centers remain a challenge while limited </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>access to the prisons have been granted on ad hoc basis usually after the submission of 
written requests. (recommendations 1.4.3 and 1.4.4). The Convention against Torture has 
not been ratified by the Sudan (recommendation 1.4.5).  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Protection of witnesses and victims 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Government did not provide any information on measures taken to protect 
witnesses and victims against violence, reprisals and harassment by third parties. Human 
rights monitors were routinely denied full and unimpeded access to witnesses and victims 
of human rights violations. In South Darfur, the NSS denied human rights monitors, access 
to detainees reportedly arrested on 23 May 2010 without any justifiable reasons.  Again in 
South Darfur, Military Intelligence declined UNAMID&#8217;s request for access to the Head of 
the SPLM in Duma village who was detained in early October 2010, (recommendation 
1.5.1). 
</p>
<p>21. Human rights defenders working on Darfur related issues in Khartoum were 
subjected to intimidation and harassment by the NSS. Between late October and early 
November 2010, a group of human rights activists from Darfur affiliated with a radio 
station (Radio Dabanga) were arrested and held incommunicado by the NSS. The detainees 
were not charged nor were they provided with counsel or given the opportunity to challenge 
the lawfulness of their detentions. Nine of the activists were released between 13 and 21 
January 2011 while five remained in custody. One of the released activists told human 
rights monitors that he was beaten by NSS agents during interrogation sessions. On 13 
February, four of the released activists were rearrested. Six of them are currently standing 
trial for various offences under the Criminal Act 1991, three of which carry the death 
penalty (recommendation 1.6.2). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Humanitarian access 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Protection of humanitarian workers from harassment and attack 
</b></p>
<p>22. Compared to previous years, the reporting period witnessed a considerable decrease 
in targeted attacks on humanitarian actors and UNAMID peacekeepers.  This may be 
attributable to UNAMID&#8217;s increasing robust military and police presence and the 
Government&#8217;s efforts in promoting reconciliation between communities. Three crew 
members of the UN Humanitarian Air Service, the last of humanitarian actors to be held in 
captivity, were released unharmed almost 5 months after being kidnapped. There were, 
however, several serious incidents of attacks on UNAMID peacekeepers, two of them 
resulting in fatalities. On 30 June, a UNAMID peacekeeper was shot and mortally wounded 
in an ambush by unidentified gunmen in EL Geneina, West Darfur and on 5 April 2011, a 
UNAMID policewoman was killed in an ambush by unidentified gunmen near Kutum in 
North Darfur. 
</p>
<p>23. The Government has not taken any measures to reform the Organization of 
Voluntary and Humanitarian Act of 2006 which continues to restrict the work of 
humanitarian groups including through cumbersome procedural requirements 
(recommendation 2.2.3). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Facilitating access to civilians, including those displaced 
</b></p>
<p>24. Humanitarian access in Darfur remained uneven during the reporting period. Access 
to urban areas outside the State capitals improved thanks to the presence of UNAMID team 
sites, while access to other areas, such as Jebel Marra and Jebel Moon, in West Darfur, 
continues to be restricted due to persistent fighting between Government and the armed 
movements. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Accountability and justice 
</b></p>
<p>25. On the issue of Darfur crimes, the Minister of Justice decreed the appointment of a 
Special Prosecutor of Darfur Crimes in October 2010. The Special Prosecutor announced 
that his office planned to establish a witness protection programme. He however announced 
his resignation in April 2011. The Government announced the establishment of 
commissions of inquiries to investigate two major incidents of gross human rights 
violations during the reporting period. In October 2010, the Government established a 
commission of inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding an attack on a 
marketplace in Tabarat, North Darfur which killed over 30 civilians including women and 
children. A second commission of inquiry was set up to investigate a case involving the 
killing of civilians during fighting between a local Zaghawa community and an unidentified 
militia group between 31 May and 3 June. To date, the Government has not published the 
findings of the commissions and the perpetrators of the two incidents have not been brought 
to justice.  
</p>
<p>26. Legislations granting immunities to security personnel have effectively prevented 
the prosecution of security personnel in the regular courts. Immunities continue to exist for 
law enforcement and security agents under various laws, including the Police and Armed 
Forces Acts and NSS Act. While the Government has maintained these immunities are only 
procedural and could easily be lifted when the need arises, practice has shown that the 
waiver of such immunities is very cumbersome and time consuming, and very often 
requires decisions from authorities in Khartoum.     
</p>
<p>27. The Government of the Sudan has not cooperated with the International Criminal 
Court in investigating and prosecuting international crimes committed in Darfur. The 
Government maintains that it is not obligated to cooperate with ICC as Sudan is not a party 
to the Rome Statute which established the court, (recommendation 3.3). 
</p>
<p>28. The Government points to the reform NSS law as a significant step in guaranteeing 
the rights of detainees in NSS custody. However, many of the safeguards in the new law 
fall short of international standard. For example, while the NSS act grants detainees the 
right to communicate with family members or a lawyer, the exercise of this right is only 
assured if the NSS determines it will not prejudiced ongoing investigations. Furthermore, 
the new law does not provide detainees access to a judge or allow them the right to file a 
habeaus corpus petition to challenge their detention, (recommendation 3.4 and 3.5). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Monitoring implementation of recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government suspended the operation of the Darfur Human Rights Forum which 
has served as a useful mechanism for the exchange of information and dialogue on human 
rights concerns between the Government, the UN and international partners. The Forum has 
not met since the independent expert&#8217;s last report to the Council in September 2010. The 
Government has informed that it is evaluating the effectiveness of the Forum as a means of 
constructive dialogue and hopes to resume it shortly. In the meantime, the human rights 
sub-forum which was created to enhance local participation in the Darfur wide forum has 
operated successfully in West Darfur. The sub-forum in North Darfur has been repeatedly 
postponed is yet to get off the ground. 
</p>
<p>30. Human rights monitors continued to be denied unfettered access to detention 
facilities and were not allowed to interview victims and witnesses in private. Monitors were 
also not granted full access to police records, (recommendations 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.7). 
</p>
<p>31. The Government did not extend a standing invitation to special procedures during 
the reporting period. However, it provided full support and assistance to the independent </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>expert during his mission to the Sudan in March and May/June 2011. The Government also 
participated effectively in the Universal Periodic Review of the country which took place in 
May this year. Over 160 recommendations ranging from the establishment of a National 
Human Rights Commission compliant with the Paris Principles to the reform of Sudan&#8217;s 
national security apparatus were proposed for adoption by the Government of the Sudan. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>32. The independent expert notes that a significant number of the recommendations of 
the Group of Experts still remain without implementation in spite of the fact that the time 
frame for implementation elapsed more than three years ago. He also notes that, while 
initial steps have been taken by the Government with regard to some recommendations, 
they have not had a sufficient impact on the ground. The Government needs to take 
additional measures to improve the human rights situation on the ground in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>33. The information provided on the human rights situation from UNAMID, United 
Nations agencies, bodies and programmes with operational competence in Darfur and other 
relevant sources reflects a situation that requires further action from the Government. 
</p>
<p>34. In particular, the independent expert assesses the status of implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Experts (A/HRC/5/6, annex) as 
follows (see also the appendix): 
</p>
<p> (a) Full implementation (i.e. all recommended activities were carried out to lay 
the framework for improving the situation on the ground): recommendations 1.2.1, 1.2.6, 
1.3.1 and 4.1; 
</p>
<p> (b) Significant activities undertaken and implementation in process: 
recommendations 1.1.4, 1.2.4, 1.2.7, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.6.2, 3.4, 4.4 and 4.6; 
</p>
<p> (c) Some activities undertaken or reported, but little or no tangible impact 
reported on the ground: recommendations 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.5, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.5, 1.2.8, 
1.4.4, 1.5.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.4, 2.2.1, 2.2.3 and 4.7; 
</p>
<p> (d) Initial steps towards implementation undertaken: recommendations 2.2.2, 3.1, 
3.5, 4.2 and 4.3; 
</p>
<p> (e) No implementation at all, which has direct bearing on concretely improving 
the human rights situation on the ground: recommendations 1.2.9, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3, 1.4.5, 
1.6.1, 2.1.3, 3.2, 3.3, 4.5 and 4.8. 
</p>
<p>35. The independent expert, while acknowledging the activities undertaken by the 
Government of the Sudan, is concerned that reports received from the ground clearly 
indicate that, with very few exceptions, these efforts still have not yet led to an 
improvement in the situation of human rights in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>36. The independent expert acknowledges that full implementation of certain 
recommendations may be complex and that tangible impact could take time, especially 
where recommended activities have been undertaken only recently. He notes that, in certain 
specific instances, the feasibility of full implementation could have been affected by the 
absence of sufficient resources and technical assistance; however, several recommendations 
on protection against summary execution, arbitrary detention and torture, which were 
prioritized as short-term and could have been implemented within a short-term time frame 
(as they did not require lengthy administrative processes or additional resources) have not 
yet been implemented. The independent expert reiterates that the lack of resources cannot 
justify any act of violence against the civilian population or the lack of action to prevent 
such acts. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>37. The independent expert recalls the consensus of the Human Rights Council, 
welcoming the initial measures taken by the Government to implement the 
recommendations of the Group of Experts on Darfur and to address human rights concerns, 
but noting that a number of recommendations had not yet been implemented. 
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert recommends that the Council continue the process of 
reviewing the implementation of recommendations until such time as there is full 
implementation, or at least significant activities, and tangible impact has been reported 
from the ground. In recognition of the fact that the time frame for implementation of the 
short- and medium-term recommendations elapsed on 20 June 2008 and the Government of 
the Sudan still needs to effectively implement the majority of recommendations requested 
by the Council, the Council could ask the Government why it has been unable to implement 
the recommendations, and also consider what further action is required to concretely protect 
the human rights of people in the Darfur region of the Sudan. The transparent engagement 
and cooperation of the Government of the Sudan with the Council and other relevant 
partners of the international community will play an important role in the protection and 
promotion of human rights on the ground. It will also help to identify obstacles to the 
implementation of previous recommendations. The Council may also wish to consider what 
further practical action is required to protect the human rights of people in Darfur. </p>

<p>In North Darfur 
 
On 20 May 2010, HRS was informed by victims of alleged 
air strikes by SAF on 5 May in Galab and surrounding 
villages which killed two (2) women and one (1) child. A 
25-year-old woman and an 18-month-old child were 
reportedly killed in their house at Galab (about 40 km north 
west  of Shangil Tobaya) while a 40-year-old woman was 
reportedly killed at the water point at Gorbiya village (east 
of Galab). The bombings allegedly targeted the Justice and 
Equality (JEM) elements who were heading towards El 
Fasher. During HRS mission to the area, HRS interacted 
with the area commander of SLA/MM (Sudanese 
Liberation Army/Mini Minawi), the Sheiks of Galab and 
Umsiala villages, family members of the deceased, injured 
victims, and other residents. One the interviewees intimated

</b></p>
<p>to HRS that properties were destroyed by the bombing; he 
claimed that twenty five (25) houses were completely 
destroyed; five (5) donkeys and six (6) goats were killed 
while thirteen (13) goats were poisoned. He also reported 
that residents of Galab and surrounding village residents 
were suffering from cough and experiencing urine infection. 
During this visit, HRS also noted what appeared to be two 
(2) unexploded ordinances in the southern part of the 
village in question. 
 
On 02 September 2010, a group of Arab militias attacked 
the Tabara market, approximately 30km South West of 
Tawila. According to information gathered by HRS during 
a mission to Tabara from 7 to 8 September, the assailants 
entered the market and shot indiscriminately at the crowd. 
Reportedly, thirty-seven (37) people were killed and fifty-
three (53) injured. The reason of the attack is unclear. A 
committee of inquiry set up by the Government to 
investigate the incident is yet to make its findings public. . 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 16 December 2010, HRS was informed that about 
25,000 to 30,000 people were displaced followingclashd 
between SAF and SLA/MMs in Shangil Tobaya. The IDPs 
headed to the nearest IDP camps, namely Nifasha, Shaddad 
and Um Dresay. Two (2) children were reportedly shot and 
injured during the clashes; they received medical treatment 
at the UNAMID clinic in Shangil Tobaya team site.  
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A clash between Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minawi 
(SLA/MM) and the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) was 
reported on 7 January 2011, at Thabit Market. The local 
population claimed that nine (9) civilians were killed and 
several other persons injured.. In Kulbus, West Darfur, a 
clash between SAF and Justice and Equality Movement 
(JEM) was also reported on 11 January at Habila and Jeljela 
areas. Due to restrictions of movement, HRS could not 
confirm the exact number of civilian casualties. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 25 January 2011, clashes were reported in Thabit, 37 km 
north of Shangil Tobaya between SAF and joint forces of 
SLA/MM, SLA/AW and LJM. The clashes were reportedly 
followed by aerial raids by GoS from 26 to 27 January near 
Foula village, 14km north of the new IDP camp, blocking 
UNAMID verification patrols. It was alleged that ten (10) 
civilians were killed. However, due to security reasons, 
HRS could not confirm the number of casualties. Thabit is 
reported to be one of the strongholds of SLA/MM. 
 
On 23 February 2011, SAF soldiers and members of armed 
militia reportedly attacked Linda village, leaving one 
woman and her child wounded. A boy aged 16 years, was 
also reportedly abducted. The soldiers reportedly looted 
animals and groceries. During the attack, SAF allegedly 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/40/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>also told the people to leave for Umderesay or Shangil 
Tobaya; the village has subsequently been deserted. SAF 
also reportedly carried out aerial raids around Tabelldia 
Dawa, leaving behind about twenty (20) unexploded UXOs 
in the area. 
 
In West Darfur 
 
On 16 May 2010, HRS received information that about 
military operations conducted by SAF in the Northern 
Corridor. Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers reportedly 
committed several human rights violations especially 
around Kulbus. The attacks by SAF on villages around 
Jebel Mun started on 2 May, went from Grijegirje east of 
Jebel Mun and then spread to Jebel Om (NW of Jebel Mun). 
SAF soldiers together with armed Arab militia men stormed 
into villages early in the morning and attacked Hilelat 
harassing and torturing civilians on 2 May. Many women in 
Duhush were allegedly sexually assaulted. The soldiers 
reportedly contaminated all water points in Jebel Mun 
during the military operations, leaving the water unsuitable 
for human consumption. They were alleged to have carried 
their own water with them when they went into Jebel Mun 
and avoided using the contaminated water.  
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 25 Feburary 2011, UNAMID Teamsite in Sortoni 
(North Darfur) reported aerial manoeuvres  and raids 
around Sortoni during which an unspecified number of 
bombs were allegedly dropped by GoS in the Jebel Marra 
area bordering North and West Darfur . The source also 
informed of aerial raids of Burgo, Rowata and Owswajin, in 
West Darfur between 24 and 25 February. From 13 to 15 
March 2011, HRS conducted a fact-finding mission to the 
area to verify reports of GoS air strikes from 23 to 28 
February. HRS was able visit three (3) villages out of the 
twenty (20) villages reportedly air raided by GoS and 
abandoned by the civilian population. Through interviews 
with community leaders, relatives, victims and 
eyewitnesses, HRS concluded that twenty eight (28) people 
were killed, while eighteen (18) other were injured. It was 
also reported that over 65,000 people were displaced. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 6 May 2010, GoS air strikes were launched on Chawa 
village located 15 kms east from Labado, resulting in the 
displacement of civilians. Fleeing IDPs reported that an 
unknown number of people and animals were killed as a 
result of the bombings. Efforts by UNAMID Military and 
Police to verify and confirm the incident in Labado were 
unsuccessful, as the fleeing IDPs became aggressive, stating 
that UNAMID was unable to protect them even after they 
had sent messages to UNAMID through the community of 
Labado.

<p>On 10 December 2010, Khor Abeche village was attacked 
by SAF and following the attack, about 500 civilians, most 
of them women and children, sought refuge at the nearby 
UNAMID team site. On 11 December, house burnings and 
mass displacement of civilians continued to be reported. 
According to HRS findings, the 10 and 11 December 
clashes resulted in two (2) people dead and twenty-two (22) 
sustaining injuries, including eight in serious condition. On 
11 December, house burnings and mass displacement of 
persons was reported; persons who refused to leave their 
homes/houses were allegedly subjected to beatings.  
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Again on 17 December 2010, another clash between SAF 
and SLA/MM broke out in Khor Abeche. During a 
UNAMID integrated mission to Khor Abeche from 13 to 14 
December, eyewitnesses and victims of the earlier clashes 
of 10 and 11 December informed HRS that on 10 
December, SAF allegedly looted 28 shops and beat people 
in the market. Two people who were heading to the market 
at the time were also interrogated by SAF soldiers and were 
requested to reveal the whereabouts of SLA/MM fighters; 
HRS observed lacerations on their bodies consistent with 
their stories. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 15 May 2011, GoS aerial raids in Labado and Al-
Shariya reportedly resulted in at least nine (9) deaths, the 
injuring of seven (7) and destruction of civilian properties. 
HRS was able to interview some of the victims and 
witnesses of this incident. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Efforts by the government to prevent such attacks 
 
In 2007 the Government adopted the Armed Forces Act 
which penalizes violations of international humanitarian 
and human rights law and amended in 2009, the Criminal 
Act to include provisions on war crimes, crimes against 
humanity, and genocide. However, HRS has not received 
any information that orders were given to the armed forces 
and militias under Government&#8217;s control to prohibit attacks 
against civilians and civilian objects.  
 
On the contrary, civilians have, and continue to be attacked 
by SAF and militias allegedly supported by Government.  
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>During the reporting period, there were four (4) serious 
incidents in which UNAMID peacekeepers and those 
assisting humanitarian efforts were targeted.  
On 22 March 2011, armed assailants fired on a UNAMID 
team travelling from Masteri, West Darfur, to a nearby team 
site, and wounded two (2) UNAMID soldiers. The 
UNAMID quick reaction force deployed to the scene, 
apprehended three (3) suspects and handed them over to the 
GoS, which is investigating the incident.

Advisers together with UNICEF Country Representative, 
held a meeting with high ranking Officers at the Sudan 
Armed Forces Headquarters to discuss the preparation of 
and commitment to an action plan to end use of child 
soldiers. The meeting coincided with the release of the 
annual global Report of the Secretary-General on Children 
and Armed Conflict of 2010 (A/64/742&#8211;S/2010/181) in 
which SAF and armed groups in Sudan had been listed for 
the use of child soldiers since 2005.

</p>
<p>In a follow-up meeting with UNAMID/UNMIS Child 
Protection and UNICEF on discussion of preparation and 
commitment to an action plan to end the use of child 
soldiers,  on 21 October 2010, the Government of the Sudan 
(Ministry of Defence) agreed to the elements proposed by 
the UN which would be included in the action plan and to 
the submission to UNAMID, UNMIS (copied to the African 
Union), of progress reports on its implementation. 
UNAMID agreed to inform SAF of visits to military camps 
and the Ministry of Defence agreed that SAF would 
facilitate access during such visits. Any sightings of child 
soldiers would be brought to the attention of SAF 
leadership for immediate action.  
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>These criteria submitted to SAF and the armed groups 
include: acknowledgement of the definition of a child

On 3 December 2010, SLA/Abu-Gasim submitted an action 
plan to the UN. Under the action plan, SLA/Abu Gasim 
acknowledged the broad definition of a child soldier under 
the Paris Principles and made commitments to: end 
recruitment and use of child soldiers; release all children 
found within its ranks; fully cooperate with the North Sudan 
DDR Commission; take measures to prevent recruitment 
and re-recruitment of children; issue a Command Order 
prohibiting all its members from recruitment and use of 
child soldiers (which it had already done in April 2010); 
designate high-level focal points to liaise with the United 
Nations team during the implementation of the Action Plan; 
grant access by the United Nations team for monitoring and 
verification of the implementation of the Action Plan and  
submit Progress Reports on the implementation of the 
Action Plan to the Joint Special Representative for the 
African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur. Given the 
presence of the armed group in West Darfur including: in 
Mara in Sullu, Selma in Kereinik, South West Mourni, and 
Telga in Wadi Salih (confirmed to UNAMID in August 
2010). UNAMID expects the release of children in these 
areas.

<p>On 22 December 2010, JEM/Peace Wing submitted an 
action plan to the UN, to be implemented in El Geneina and 
Zalengi (Western Darfur). In April 2011, JEM/Peace Wing 
identified and submitted to the UN a list of 65 former child 
soldiers identified in three localities in West Darfur (Um 
Dukhun, Baida, Mugurni). This list has been submitted to 
the North Sudan DDR Commission (NSDDRC) for 
registration.

<p>On 23 December 2010, UNAMID Child Protection Adviser 
together with UNICEF Rep and two UNAMID Child 
Protection Officers visited Gur Lumbung (Golum Bay) in 
Jabel Mara, a strong hold of SLA Wahid, to discuss the 
issue of recruitment and use of child soldiers with the armed 
group.  The Team was warmly received by a group of 
commanders and members of the community including 
women. SLA Wahid confirmed that they previously had 83 
child combatants in their ranks between 2003-2004. They 
however indicated that all the children have now been 
released for reintegration in four locations (Fina, Saboun&#8211;al 
fagour, Daya and Baldoung) with the support of NGOs and 
UNICEF partners present in the area in 2005.  The armed

As per the information provided by UNAMID/ Child

<p>Some activities undertaken or

</p>
<p> 
The security in the camps is very relative. Incidents of 
night shooting and sexual violence are still reported in 
the camps. In addition in several areas where 
UNAMID provides 24/7 patrols to IDP camps and 
vicinities of townships, women are still being attacked 
and assaulted when they venture outside the camps. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>UNAMID cannot provide overall patrol services for all 
IDP camps and the Government in most (especially 
rural) areas is reportedly not able to provide enough 
staff/equipment for patrolling.  
 
UNAMID patrols have improved confidence and the 
general security situation and in curbing SGBV 
incidents. Patrols schedules are more flexible and 
frequent in several locations. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Police check points have been established in several 
locations and there is improved protection of women 
and girls through the establishment of Community 
policing by UNAMD police. Volunteers have better 
understanding of the local context and have access to 
local information. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>No firewood patrols are being conducted by the 
government of the Sudan. In addition there still exists 
mistrust between IDPs and SAF. For instance in some 
camps including Otash and Alsalam in South Darfur, 
GoS Police are stationed in the camp, and make regular 
patrols within the camps, but lack the capacity to 
investigate cases in and outside the camps. As at now, 
Kalma IDPs do not allow GoS forces to enter Kalma 
camp. Similarly, GoS security forces are not allowed to 
enter IDP camps in Zalingei (West Darfur)

</b>41 reported SGBV cases were investigated by police. 
9 cases were not reported to police for diverse reason 
including fear of reprisal, cultural stigma associated 
with rape and disenchantment with police&#8217;s alleged 
inaction when cases are reported. 
 5 cases were prosecuted; including one regarding 14 a

 4 cases were settled-out of court: all involving 3 
Central Reserve Police (CRP) and 3 SAF soldiers.

</p>
<p>On 20 January 2011, a 40-year-old woman from the 
Dito IDP camp in Graida, South Darfur informed HRS 
that on 27 December 2010, she was allegedly shot in 
the arm by a SAF soldier when she entered the room of 
her 14-year-old family member and saw a perpetrator 
attempting to rape the 14-year-old. The victims claimed 
that the perpetrator was arrested by the GoS police and 
they were asked to identify him at the military base 
near the Graida valley. However, the GoS police 
alleged that the perpetrator was not arrested and that 
the investigation had not been concluded. The police 
thinks there is a possibility that the perpetrator is not a 
SAF soldier.

<p> 
</p>
<p>In Zalingei , West Darfur, on 24 January 2011, HRS 
was informed by a relative of a 3-year-old victim that 
on 1 November 2010, the victim was allegedly raped 
by a 22-year-old GoS police officer, living near the 
victim&#8217;s house. The case was reported to the GoS 
police on 1 November and confirmed by the Zalingei 
Civil Hospital. The perpetrator was reportedly arrested 
and detained for about twenty days by the GoS police 
and transferred to the Zalingei Court. However, HRS 
was informed on 26 January that the Zalingei General 
Court dismissed the rape charge against the perpetrator 
on the grounds of his immunity as a police officer. The 
Court advised the complainant to file to appeal the 
General Court&#8217;s decision. HRS is following up the case 
with the Prosecutor and the Court.

<p> 
</p>
<p>On 6 April 2011, the HRS interviewed a 20-year-old 
female victim of attempted rape and her 70-year-old 
mother. The victim was allegedly attacked by two men, 
a soldier from GoS Omsadur military barrack and a 
civilian on 15 March, in her house GoS police 
reportedly arrested the civilian suspect while a 
complaint was lodged at Omsadur barrack where the 
suspected soldier was said to serve. The officer in-
charge of the military barrack mediated between the 
victim and the suspected soldier to resolve the matter 
&#8216;amicably&#8217;; with the soldier agreeing to pay 550SGD as 
compensation to the victim, and also giving a guarantee 
that he will not repeat such an act again. HRS

two boys was reported in Tawila, North Darfur on 13

<p> 
The number of cases on sexual and gender based
violence has fluctuated depending on the seasons;
during the farming season it increases when women
increase farming activities.   
 
The establishment of community based mechanisms
(groups of women accompanied by male escorts from
their villages, etc) as well as increased sensitization is
helping to curb cases. 
 
Any increase in SGBV cases is also due to increased
reporting as a result of more sensitization and does not

<p>In September 2010, the Nyala Special Court 
tried 11 suspects allegedly being affiliated 
with JEM and accused of attacking a convoy 
of the Government of the Sudan in Sanyi 
Afundu, Southern Darfur. Five of the 
defendants declared their ages to be between 
15 and 17. However, the Court only one of 
them as a child (age 16), following the 
opinion of Sudanese medical authorities, and 
sentenced him to &#8220;reform measures for 
juvenile delinquents&#8221; under article 69 of 
Child Act 2010. The same medical authorities 
opposed the age declarations of the remaining 
four and certified their ages to be between 18 
and 21. Subsequently, the judge sentenced all 
four to death by hanging, together with five 
other adult defendants. The Government of 
the Sudan has reaffirmed that all necessary 
legal remedies will be offered to the accused. 
The United Nations has appealed to the 
Government of the Sudan to stay the 
execution of the death sentence, review the 
cases and take all necessary measures to 
protect alleged child soldiers from capital 
punishment in accordance with national and 
applicable international law. The UN also 
recommends that JEM should halt its practice 
of recruiting and using children and of 
placing them at risk.

<p>The climate of conflict resulting in insecurity 
and a breakdown of law and order exacerbates 
sexual violence against children and women. 
Monitoring and reporting of rape and sexual 
violence against children in Darfur, however, 
remains a challenge as victims, their families 
and communities are often reluctant to report 
cases due to fear of retribution or 
stigmatization. Rape cases that were 
documented by Child Protection and Human 
Rights Officers are often allegedly committed 
by men in uniforms and attributed to military, 
police personnel, factions of armed groups 
and militia men.  As in the past reporting 
periods, victims and witnesses, however, 
often provide little information on the identity 
of the alleged perpetrators and the uniforms 
alone do not always provide the required 
proof of the links of the alleged perpetrators 
to the armed forces. . Other alleged 
perpetrators do not wear uniforms and are 
thus unidentifiable. The incessant allegations 
indicate that sexual violence against children 
continues to be a major problem in Darfur. 
While many cases of sexual violence go 
unreported, some are brought to the attention 
of authorities. In one case reported to the 
police, a 15 year old girl was raped at 
gunpoint on 2 December 2010 near an IDP 
camp in Northern Darfur by a soldier from 
SLA Minnawi, while two other soldiers 
restrained her.  The victim was brought to El 
Fasher Maternity hospital the following day, 
where she received treatment and post rape 
assistance. One of the alleged perpetrators 
was later arrested and the case referred to the 
Family and Child Protection Unit. At the time 
of reporting, investigation was ongoing. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The lack of capacity of the Government of 
Sudan Police to investigate cases in areas 
under the control or influence of armed 
groups constitutes a significant challenge in 
addressing sexual violence. Limited expertise, 
equipment and the absence of female police 
officers in some police stations also hamper 
efforts to assist victims. While some victims 
receive basic post-rape-care, psychosocial 
support and/or counseling services are still 
not provided or not available in most areas 
and or hospitals. Most victims of sexual </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>36 
</b></p>
<p>violence encountered during field missions 
show signs of trauma and are in dire need of 
counseling services. The practice of charging 
fees, no matter how small (1 SDG, equivalent 
to USD $0.44) in some hospitals prevents 
many victims from seeking primary medical 
assistance.  
</p>
<p><b>Response of the Government of the Sudan

<p><b>A new child Act was adopted in 2009. The 
Act provides for the establishment of

access to justice, the absence of safeguards against 
arbitrary arrest and detention by NISS personnel,

<p>problems with lifting of immunities for police and 
military officers, or other official personne 
</p>
<p>On 24 January 2011, HRS was informed by a relative 
of a 3-year-old victim that on 1 November 2010, the 
victim was allegedly raped by a 22-year-old GoS 
police officer, living near the victim&#8217;s house. The 
case was reported to the GoS police on 1 November 
and confirmed by the Zalingei Civil Hospital. The 
perpetrator was reportedly arrested and detained for 
about twenty days by the GoS police and transferred 
to the Zalingei Court. However, HRS was informed 
on 26 January that the Zalingei General Court 
dismissed the rape charge against the perpetrator on 
the grounds that his immunity as a police officer had 
not been uplifted by the Prosecutor. The Court 
advised the complainant to go to the Court of Appeal. 
HRS is following up the case with the Prosecutor and 
the Court.  
</p>
<p>On 31 May 2011, Zalingei General Court convicted a 
22 year old GoS police to 5 years imprisonment for 
raping a minor, only after an appeal by the Prosecutor 
and the victim&#8217;s family. He had been earlier acquitted 
because his immunity was not lifted.

<p>The National Security Act (2010) 
</p>
<p>Article 51 of the Act grants the right to 
communicate with family members or a 
lawyer. However, the exercise of these 
safeguards is conditional upon not prejudicing 
the investigation. The NISS may therefore 
still hold detainees without contact to the 
outside world where it sees fit. This is 
contrary to international standards that 
provide access to a lawyer of one&#8217;s choice at 
the earliest stages of investigation, which 
constitutes an important safeguard against 
torture and unfair trials. Detainees do not 
have access to a judge or the right to file a 
habeas corpus petition within the period of 45 
days or four and a half months respectively, 
depriving them of any judicial protection. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On positive note, the Child Act of 2010 has 
seemingly abolished the death penalty for 
children. However, the death penalty for 
adults still remains in force for numerous 
offences, including those that cannot be 
considered to be the most serious. Sudan&#8217;s 
courts have imposed the death penalty in 
several instances where the defendants 
alleged that they had been tortured into 
making confessions or claimed to be under 
age but not referred for proper medical 
examination for their ages to be determined.
