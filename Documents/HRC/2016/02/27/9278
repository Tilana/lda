<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent held its seventh session 
from 14 to 18 January 2007 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. The Director of Operations, Programmes and Research Division opened the session. The 
Working Group elected Peter Lesa Kasanda as its Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report reflects the general course of the debate. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p>4. At its seventh session, the Working Group held eight public meetings and one private 
meeting. It was attended by the following members: Peter Lesa Kasanda 
(Chairperson-Rapporteur), Joe Frans, Georges Nicolas Jabbour, and Irina Moroianu-Zl&#259;tescu; 
observers from 41 Member States and 1 observer from a non-Member State, 6 non-governmental 
organizations and 1 intergovernmental organization (see annexes I and II for the list of 
participants and the agenda).<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SUMMARY OF DELIBERATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Director of Operations delivered the opening address. 
</p>
<p>6. The Director of Operations declared that, since the World Conference on Racism in 
Durban in 2001, progress has been made but important challenges still persisted. She pointed out 
that people of African descent were often the least favoured when it came to access to education, 
housing and employment. In 2009, the Durban Review Conference would be held, an 
opportunity to measure how far progress has been made in fulfilling the laudable commitments 
established in Durban in 2001. People of African descent around the world in the diaspora, as 
well as in Africa, could benefit in their daily lives from the recommendations that the Working 
Group made to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>7. She pointed out that the lack of disaggregated data disadvantages the people of African 
descent, as neither a clear understanding of the state of affairs nor a viable and comprehensive 
solution can be arrived at without accurate disaggregate data. She reminded the room that racial 
profiling was a serious problem that affected people of African descent. The Director of 
Operations expressed her certainty that the resulting document would be a significant tool to 
advance the fight against racism suffered by people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>8. The Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the Director of Operations and the experts for 
electing him as the Chairperson. He stated that the scourges that did so much harm must be 
tackled head-on and that week was an opportunity to redouble efforts. He welcomed the 
invitation of the Preparatory Committee made to the human rights mechanisms, such as the 
Working Group of Experts, to assist by undertaking and submitting recommendations through

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Office of the High Commissioner. The Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the panellists for 
their presence and future contributions that he knew would enrich the final discussion and the 
final contribution to the Preparatory Committee. 
</p>
<p>9. The provisional agenda was adopted. 
</p>
<p>10. The Chairperson introduced agenda item 5 by calling to the attention of the Working 
Group the need to encourage discussion and arrive at concrete recommendations to the 
Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>11. A statement was made on behalf of the African group to encourage a rich and extensive 
discussion in order to prevent gaps and ensure the session of the Working Group was brought to 
a positive end. A desire was also expressed that the Working Group, panellists and State 
observers should unite to ensure that the Working Group effectively fulfilled its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Analysis of conclusions and recommendations made 
by the Working Group at its previous sessions 
</b></p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (i):  Administration of justice 
</b>12. Mr. Frans, member of the Working Group on People of African Descent, presented his 
paper on the administration of justice. He started his presentation with a brief report of the 
meeting of the African Union in Paris with people of African descent living in Europe. The 
objective of that meeting was to create sustainable partnerships between people of African 
descent around the world and the African continent through a realizable programme of action. In 
his paper, he highlighted the discrepancies in access to justice for peoples of African descent in 
comparison with other racial groups within a given society. During his presentation he further 
highlighted the fact that people of African descent were among the most vulnerable and 
discriminated groups, and for that reason needed specific legal mechanisms protecting their right 
not only with regard to adequate and fair trials, but also in all other areas of the justice system. 
Mr. Frans also mentioned the need to establish and collate best practices from several regions 
which would be used in effectively combating the scourge of racism. 
</p>
<p>13. There was general endorsement of the ideas and concepts of Mr. Frans&#8217; presentation. 
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Kasanda, Chairperson of the Working Group on People of African Descent, opened 
the floor to debate on the theme of the administration of justice. 
</p><p>15. Several comments were made by members of the floor highlighting not only the lack of 
access to justice in its administration but also the lack of representation by peoples of African 
descent in justice systems, judicial appointments, magistrates&#8217; courts and all the way to the high 
courts of many States. 
</p>
<p>16. The need for disaggregated information on the presence of people of African descent in the 
justice system was identified as important. 
</p><p>17. An issue was raised concerning the economic situation of people of African descent in 
relation to the administration of justice and how a lack of adequate funding had an impact on 
their right to afford good representation. That situation led to limited or inadequate defence </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>which, in turn, could lead to imprisonment which subsequently had an impact on the community 
of people of African descent as there were fewer able workers to contribute to the local 
economy. A call was made for a study to be made on discrimination in the justice system, first 
suggested by Leila Zerrougui. It was suggested that following up on Ms. Zerrougui&#8217;s suggestion 
was long overdue. 
</p>
<p>18. Comments were also made regarding the fact that the majority of violence and victims of 
improper administration of justice were youths of African descent; several commentators 
stressed the need to determine why that was the case. 
</p>
<p>19. A further comment was made regarding the necessity for a racial equality index to be 
developed in order to determine such things as racial abuse in the administration of justice. A 
suggestion was made that the United Nations Development Programme should establish a racial 
equality index as part of its human development index. 
</p>
<p>20. A person from the floor inquired whether the Working Group had found any forms of best 
practices mentioned by Mr. Frans. Furthermore, it was noted that, in its first and second sessions, 
the Working Group had pointed out the need for more studies and a compilation of data 
regarding jury selection and police violence. Although mention had been made of the need for 
such a study, nowhere did it indicate who exactly would compile that study. It was thought that 
such a study would be of great use to the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>21. Mr. Frans thanked the room for its contributions and stressed their importance to the 
Preparatory Committee and the Durban review process. As the jury was one of the most 
important factors concerning the administration of justice, he added that it was imperative for 
defendants to be judged by a jury of people that reflected the racial dynamics of the country in 
question. 
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Frans then stated that it was difficult to properly assess the number of people with 
inadequate access to justice, particularly in larger countries. This was especially so in the case of 
people from specific segments of society. 
</p>
<p>23. He stated that best practices that work in one region should be transferred to others, 
including national plans of action. 
</p>
<p>24. Mr. Kasanda underlined the problem of impunity in the police force. There was still a need 
for guidelines, recommendations and sanctions regarding the need to recruit officers of all races 
to reflect racial diversity and to ensure that human rights principles were included in training law 
enforcement officers. Without the necessary political will, those recommendations would have 
great difficulty in being implemented. 
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Frans, commenting on the issues of best practices, mentioned as an example the first 
study within the framework of the Council of Europe. He stated that that study examined 
constitutional frameworks in different countries. He also indicated that some countries were 
more active than others. In Belgium, for example, the responsible ministry was quite actively 
working on disaggregated data. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>26. Regarding the racial equality index, Mr. Frans stated that one idea that needed to be part of 
it should be whether States had ratified the relevant treaties and conventions with or without 
reservations. This was practical information that should be included in the index. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (ii):  Media 
</b>27. Mr. Frans, expert of the Working Group on People of African Descent, began his 
presentation on the media by stressing the fact that the role of communication and media in the 
process of development should not be underestimated. Most western media treated the cultures 
of industrialized nations as superior and the cultures of the developing nations as inferior. The 
media had enormous influence in shaping public perception of situations around the world. The 
images of Africa in Western media were, by and large, images of misrepresentation. Media had a 
responsibility and an obligation to combat racism. Thus, a code of conduct for the media was 
needed. 
</p>
<p>28. Ms. Irina Moroianu-Zl&#259;tescu, member of the Working Group on People of African 
descent, expressed her belief that the media had not only an important role to provide 
information but also a certain responsibility. People always spoke of rights but not enough of 
responsibilities. The role of the education and the training of the mass media were meant to 
prevent discrimination. 
</p>
<p>29. A comment was made regarding the importance of the interconnection between media 
and the administration of justice. An instance was provided in which the media were 
irresponsible in their broadcasting; instead of relieving an already tense racial situation, they 
heightened it by explicitly showing attack dogs mauling black Mozambique immigrants at the 
South Africa/Mozambique border. The commentator further stressed the importance of the 
media in general - not just the imbedded media - in being sensible with regard to the type of 
imagery and content they chose to show. 
</p>
<p>30. An intervention was made regarding the actual possibility of creating a code of conduct for 
journalists and, if possible, what would be the time frame for implementing such a code of 
conduct and who would implement it. 
</p>
<p>31. Other commentators stressed that, though a code of conduct might have several question 
marks regarding its implementation, it was imperative to begin work as one was long overdue. 
The commentator stressed that there should be measures which recommend that the rights and 
the reputation of persons should be protected. The commentator cited in particular a document 
adopted at a 2007 Ministerial Conference on People of African Descent which asked that a code 
of conduct be set up. The observer in that instance recalled Tony Blair&#8217;s reaction concerning the 
well-known cartoons in the Danish newspapers, and stated that, although Mr. Blair had said 
that although the cartoons were not illegal acts according to British law, there had to be some 
self-restraint so as to avoid using freedom of expression as an excuse for insults.  
</p>
<p>32. There was general agreement that the nature of images presented by the media had been a 
very important issue within the United Nations. It was stressed that that issue should be looked at 
in a progressive manner and attempts should be made to balance freedom of expression with 
attempts to reduce incitement of race and religious hatred. The particular importance of 
regulating against hate media was stressed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>33. One of the first steps mentioned in addressing the issue should be the start of negotiations 
with the International Federation of Journalists for the creation of a code of conduct to be 
followed by the media. 
</p>
<p>34. There was also mention of the negative portrayal of black women in the media, which 
contributed to their being victims of violence. There was further mention of youths of African 
descent being portrayed as criminals by the media in Latin America, and it was suggested that 
there should be an alternative to portraying adolescents only as rappers and potential sports 
players. There is no portrayal of them as having the potential to be professionals.  
</p>
<p>35. One member of the panel stated that ownership of the media was concentrated in fewer and 
fewer hands; that could be one of the major causes for the negative portrayal of people of 
African descent. The Durban review process could be an opportunity to open a frank dialogue 
with the media regarding how people of African descent were portrayed by them. 
</p>
<p>36.  Regarding alternative media, such as the Internet, it was stated that they were very 
important as most youths had access to alternative media and actively communicate using them. 
The Working Group and OHCHR were challenged to take advantage of alternative media 
outlets, such as YouTube, during the Durban review process, to encourage young people to 
participate in its activities over the Internet and other alternative media channels.   
</p>
<p>37. This was followed by mention of the absence of quantity and quality of reporting on 
people of African descent; the issues that are particularly important to people of African descent 
were being ignored, and there was a surplus of reporting that showed people of African descent 
in a bad light. The Durban Review Conference would be an excellent opportunity to end the 
invisibility of the Durban process. There was substantive coverage of the Durban Conference 
in 2001, but the tragedy of 9/11 had the effect of wiping the Durban agenda off the world&#8217;s 
conscience.  
</p>
<p>38. One observer stressed that it would be imperative to have a mixture of binding and 
voluntary measures to be taken and implemented by the media. There was a view of false 
reporting as a growing problem that threatened international peace and progress.  
</p>
<p>39. The international legal framework, it was stated, was conceived shortly after genocide in 
Europe, where there had been an abundance of incitement to racial and religious hatred. As a 
result of time and increased freedom of expression, people had forgotten that dark chapter of 
history. The threshold should be lowered to tackle incidences of incitement to racial and 
religious hatred. The media, it was further stated, was currently not subject to scrutiny, as there 
were no effective media watchdogs. There was a difference between freedom of expression and 
freedom of opinion; while the right to holding an opinion was absolute, that of expression was 
not, if it implied infringing on the enjoyment of others of their specific rights. 
</p><p>40. Mr. Frans, expert of the Working Group on People of African Descent, mentioned that 
the Western media dominated and financial and technical wealth determined what was reported 
and exported to the rest of the world. He mentioned that most studies had shown that the 
international news flow was still controlled by only a handful of newsagents. That, he believed, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>had made most news carriers follow the same news flow lines. He elaborated further by stating 
that there was a huge concentration of media and that was a problem, but it became even worse, 
because it served to propagate the images spread by the media of Africa as a dark and backward 
continent. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (iii):  Access to education 
</b>41. Ms. Irina Moroianu-Zl&#259;tescu, member of the Working Group on People of African 
Descent, made her presentation on access to education. She emphasized the link between the 
themes of the Working Session and international tools such as the UNESCO Convention against 
Discrimination in Education. It was certain that equal access to education and the decrease and 
eradication of the disadvantages accumulated by people of African descent throughout history 
because of racism and discrimination was a prerequisite for equality in the exercise of other 
human rights, be they economic, social and cultural, or civil and political, including access to all 
levels of decision-making. That was the reason why the recommendations on education were an 
inseparable part of the whole set of conclusions and recommendations adopted by the Working 
Group during its mandate. 
</p>
<p>42. Ms. Alma Jenkins, one of the invited panellists for the Working Group, made a 
presentation on intercultural education in Latin America and the Caribbean. Ms. Jenkins 
conducted a brief analysis of the impact of education in race relations in Latin American 
countries. For Ms. Jenkins, there was no way of talking about the right to education without a 
reflection upon the issue of funding, which needed to be not only increased but also equitable. 
</p>
<p>43. A comment was made that educational inequalities in South America were also seen 
in the United States of America. A commentator argued that the educational system in the 
United States has been directed in such a way so that black children, when they left school, 
were not equipped to have skilled jobs. 
</p><p>44. There was also comment on the inconsistency in terms of dealing with the two 
international covenants and that bridges had not yet been built between the two. 
</p>
<p>45. Further comments were made that, in some instances, the problem was not so much access 
to education as the quality of it. These comments highlighted that fact that a majority of school 
curricula failed to teach important issues to children of African descent, such as the history of 
their culture and the transatlantic slave trade. As education ultimately led to better employment, 
commentators believed that the problems of racism and access to education were intimately 
linked to those of racism and employment. 
</p>
<p>46. Ms. Jenkins stressed that youth of African descent had to be empowered. Attention had to 
be paid to young males, as there was growing evidence of empowered and active females of 
African descent without male counterparts. 
</p>
<p>47. She also mentioned that programmes designed to assist in the education of children of 
African descent were generally at the primary school level and diminished as the age of the child 
increased. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (iv):  Racism and employment 
</b>48. Mr. Patrick Taran, panellist for the Working Group on People of African Descent, made 
his presentation on racism and employment. Mr. Taran provided a detailed analysis on the 
necessity of work. A job, with decent conditions, was central to everyone&#8217;s participation in 
society, to their independence, self-reliance, identity and dignity. He stated that unemployment 
was a generator of social exclusion, personal destabilization, deconstruction of identity and 
dignity. Racism was seen essentially as a construct elaborated to justify exploitation, slavery and 
socio-economic stratification. The differentiated characterization of groups according to physical 
and presumed intellectual and social characteristics served to organize and justify different 
treatment in the world of work. Race and employment remained intimately intertwined in 
today&#8217;s globalized capitalist economic order. The realm of employment was a major arena for 
action and for the empowerment of communities, notably for people of African descent. 
</p>
<p>49. There was commentary on the need to accumulate relevant statistics in order to effectively 
gauge the real advances that the international system had made in combating racism and 
unemployment.  
</p>
<p>50. Comment was made regarding the situation of people of African descent with regard to the 
informal employment sector. Several members stressed the fact that most of International Labour 
Organization provisions failed to take into account the need to provide adequate support and 
assurance of good working conditions and working entitlements for people in the informal 
working sector, where the majority were people of African descent. 
</p><p>51. Domestic workers in South America were highlighted as a specific section of the informal 
sector that enjoyed few of the benefits normally attributed to people in the informal sector, even 
though it was a very large employer not only of people of African descent but also a large 
number of other races in South America. 
</p>
<p>52. In conjoining the twin themes of access to education and racism and employment, an 
observation was made that most of those affected in both instances were already living in 
poverty and thus did not themselves have the tools to redress that poverty. Solutions to that 
situation had to be created, otherwise those problems would continue to persist. It was mentioned 
that advances had been made, but that appropriate enforcement was lacking. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (v):  Racism and health 
</b>53. Dr. Christina Torres, regional adviser of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), 
delivered her presentation on racism and health. Her paper reiterated the requirements of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action with regard to health and its relevance to people 
of African descent. In highlighting all the articles relevant to people of African descent, she 
stressed that there was a need to collect systematic and disaggregated data regarding the health 
situation of people of African descent. She highlighted the advancement of projects in 
Latin America that had been implemented post-Durban to assist in combating discrimination in 
areas of health, including the project by the Special Secretary for the Promotion of Racial 
Equality in Brazil. She also stressed her organization&#8217;s creation of a new gender and ethnicity 
unit, requested in paragraph 154 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, to 
promote and develop activities for the identification of the impact of discrimination on health </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and to mainstream gender and ethnic discrimination as social determinants in health. She also 
mentioned the intensive work being undertaken by several Latin American communities to 
ensure that health facilities were available to peoples of African descent. 
</p>
<p>54. Several members of the floor acknowledged Ms. Torres&#8217; presentation on racism and urged 
PAHO to include and implement relevant paragraphs of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action in its work and to address the issue of the death of young black youths not merely as 
homicide but as a serious issue of public health. 
</p>
<p>55. Ms. Torres responded to all issues concerning her presentation on racism and health and 
reiterated the fact that combating racism was a legal obligation of the State. However, she 
stressed the limited human and financial resources of organizations, such as the one for which 
she worked. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (vi):  Racism and housing 
</b>56. Mr. Kasanda, Chairperson-Rapporteur, introduced the topic by saying that, during its 
fourth session, the Working Group had discussed the theme of racism and housing. That theme 
negatively characterized the situation of people of African descent. The condition of poverty was 
usually associated with inadequate housing. The enjoyment of many other rights was often 
eloquently indicated by the enjoyment of adequate housing. It was important that States keep 
reliable and disaggregated data to monitor living conditions. There was a need to ensure descent 
housing and to establish independent bodies that had the authority to hear and redress complaints 
of victims, and which could regulate fair rating prices and housing markets. 
</p>
<p>57. There was further commentary from the floor on the issue of housing; a few participants 
spoke of the lack of Government measures to protect the right to adequate housing of people of 
African descent. One commentator highlighted the situation of several underprivileged black and 
Latin American communities and the large-scale displacement of black people as a result of 
Hurricane Katrina in the United States. 
</p>
<p>58. Mr. Frans provided a general comment regarding mistreatment of illegal immigrants who 
endured conditions of modern-day slavery. He also commented on segregation in housing and 
economic disparity. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (vii): Participation of people of African descent in political, economic, social 
and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic 
development of their countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) General 
</b>59. Mr. Kasanda, Chairperson of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, 
presented a paper on the participation of people of African descent in political, economic, social 
and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic development of their 
countries. The Chairperson stressed that the participation by people of African descent in all 
aspects of public life was a matter of human rights. He stressed that allowing people of African 
descent to participate in politics and social and cultural activities was not to be viewed as a 
favour or a gesture of magnanimity by the Government or governing elite. He explained further </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that people of African descent and other minorities had a right to participate in the formulation of 
laws by which all must live. He further stressed that States had to design policies to target their 
poor by reversing conditions that led to their exclusion from participating in public life and also 
adopt affirmative policies and strategies for inclusion. In conclusion, he stressed the necessity of 
establishing a voluntary fund to enable non-governmental organizations to attend the annual 
meetings of the Working Group and deliver their important contributions. 
</p>
<p>60. Mr. Salih Booker, panellist for the Working Group on People of African Descent, 
presented his paper on participation of people of African descent in political, economic, social 
and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and economic development of their 
countries. He stated that globalization was a process that started with the transatlantic slave trade 
and colonialism has resulted in a global apartheid. A person&#8217;s opportunity to realize their basic 
human rights was largely determined by race, gender and geography. Global governance was 
dominated by people of European descent. He added that Africans had only gained the right to 
participate fully in their own governance in the past five decades, and that people of African 
descent in the Americas were still struggling to achieve equal participation in the national life of 
the countries where they lived. 
</p>
<p>61. He emphasized the fact that Africa was invisible, people of African descent were invisible, 
the historic accomplishments of the World Conference against Racism had been made invisible, 
and that the Working Group was at risk of being made invisible as was the Durban review 
process. Such invisibility was a manifestation of the conscious and unconscious modern racism 
that all had to continue to fight to overcome. He stated that the Durban review process offered a 
unique opportunity to reclaim the historic accomplishments of the World Conference against 
Racism, as embodied in the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and which 
represented an historic international consensus on how best to combat racism in our time. It was 
an opportunity to make visible that which had remained invisible since 2001 and to hold States 
accountable for their actions on what they committed themselves to at that time.   
</p>
<p>62. Several observers mentioned that they found Mr. Booker&#8217;s presentation insightful. What 
was most striking about the presentation was the emphasis placed on the principle that civil and 
political rights were useless without economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>63. Mention was made in the room of the issue of reparations. Comments were made in 
support of the view that racism was about victims and, inevitably, remedies for victims such as 
reparations were needed. There were recommendations that the Working Group should deal with 
trying to maximize remedies for victims. There were other dissenting voices that believed that 
the issue of reparations would divide the work and participants of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>64. There was also much support for the ideas highlighted by Ambassador Kasanda regarding 
appropriate funding for non-governmental organizations and other civil society groups to be able 
to actively participate in the work of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>65. A comment was made that racism was a disease affecting not only the victims but the 
perpetrators as well; racism had many deep and practical implications. The advancement of 
people of African descent was ultimately linked with the development of people living in the 
African continent. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>66. The President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Doru Romulus Costea, paid a 
visit to the Working Group and mentioned his satisfaction at having been invited to address the 
Working Group for the first time. He stressed that his presence was meant to emphasize that the 
Council considered that human rights issues were not confined to the Council. He believed that 
the Council had a duty to remain seized of the meetings of other bodies to ensure that the work 
of the Council was enriched by their outcomes. He highlighted the importance of the issues 
being addressed by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>67. The President further expressed his pleasure at the fact that several non-governmental 
organizations had been able to participate in that important session. Furthermore, he mentioned 
the need to share information that would enable proper coordination of the various follow-up 
mechanisms to Durban. In so doing, he recognized the efforts of the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>68. The President of the Council also stressed the complicated process under way related to the 
review of mandates. He believed that much would be learned from the exercise. 
</p>
<p>69. The President of the Council concluded by reminding the room that that year was the 
sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that all had to prove that 
United Nations mechanisms work better and more efficiently. 
</p>
<p>70. There was general acknowledgement and thanks for the presence of the President of the 
Council at the Working Group&#8217;s session. Several panellists conveyed to the President their view 
that the Working Group had become an important reference point for people of Latin America 
and it was of utmost relevance to them as they looked to the Durban review process. With a host 
of emerging challenges for people of African descent, it was mentioned that it was important that 
that forum received more support for the participation of non-governmental organizations so that 
the voice of the victims was soundly represented in discussions. 
</p>
<p>71. Other comments reinforced the mandate of the Working Group; other panellists thanked 
the President of the Council and also stressed that Durban represented, for millions of people, 
one of the most important achievements by the United Nations in recent times, as it tackled such 
issues as slavery, colonialism and the problems faced by people of African descent around the 
world. The Durban Programme of Action had made concrete advancements and the process had 
established key mechanisms such as the Working Group of Experts on People of African 
Descent, the single most important mechanism, which had to be strengthened to enhance its 
work. 
</p>
<p>72. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group, Ambassador Kasanda, expressed his 
satisfaction that the Council intended to review the Working Group&#8217;s mandate.  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Millennium Development Goals 
</b>73. Marcelo Paixao, panellist for the Working Group on People of African Descent, made his 
presentation on the Brazilian experience in fighting racism and promoting racial equality. He 
stated that Brazilian public policy regarding racial equality faced problems of implementation 
because of a lack of support by important sectors of civil society, particularly among the white 
middle class, and some difficulties of comprehension present in many sectors of State 
bureaucracy. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. He declared that there still existed an old racial ideology with regard to social relations, 
which valued friendship among peoples of every racial origin, but froze the social position of 
individuals with different physical traits in terms of facial features and skin colour. Racial 
prejudice and discrimination in Brazil was not manifested in the same manner as it did in 
North America or South Africa. He underlined the fact that, instead of being open, violence 
manifested itself subtly, embedded in a normalization of racial asymmetry, which manifested in 
differences in opportunities and exposure to adverse social conditions. The most important 
actions of the Brazilian State in the field of racial equality were in the realm of education. At the 
primary and secondary education levels, there was a slight reduction in racial inequality, with an 
increase in the number of children attending classes.  
</p>
<p>75. A comment was made that the Millennium Development Goals had to be achieved for 
people of African descent as well as for Africans. This comment stressed that the African Union 
had acknowledged the worrying situation of people of African descent and stressed that it was 
time that people of African descent were recognized as having equal status and that that, in turn, 
would reflect positively on the status of Africans. 
</p>
<p>76. Mention was also made of post-Durban progress worldwide, with examples of several 
European Union countries actively working towards achieving the Millennium Goals for people 
of African descent. Furthermore, it was stated that resources needed to be made available to 
organizations of people of African descent as there was a need for more participation by victims 
of racism in the Durban review process. 
</p>
<p>77. The importance of the availability of disaggregated data to the achievement of the 
Millennium Development Goals was also mentioned, with a focus on data and goals specific to 
peoples of African descent; for example, the rate of mortality of people of African descent in 
comparison with that of other racial groups. Different parameters could be set to measure the 
racial-specific problems of people of African descent. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (viii):  Empowerment of women of African descent 
</b>78. Ambassador Kasanda, the Chairperson-Rapporteur, made introductory remarks on the 
empowerment of women of African descent, stressing the fact that women of African descent 
faced additional burdens and difficulties in their lives. They suffered from racism but also from 
gender discrimination. For an Afro-descendant woman, disempowerment meant systematic 
discrimination at every level of her life. At birth, parents often preferred boys to girls, which led 
to the abortion of girl children. More girls dropped out of school than boys. As adolescents, girls 
suffered abuse, exploitation and violence, or they suffered genital mutilation because of beliefs 
and customs entrenched in society. They also faced early marriage and premature parenthood.  
</p>
<p>79. He further stressed that education freed people from ignorance. That was why investment 
had to be made in the education of women. Education enhanced the range of life choices 
available to women. Under international law, for example, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, States parties had an obligation to ensure that 
women realized their human right to participate in the political arena and their right to be fully 
involved in decision-making on the basis of equality with men. Gender equality had to be made a 
reality. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>80. Ms. Maria Ines Barbosa, panellist for the Working Group on People of African Descent, 
delivered her presentation on the empowerment of women of African descent in the region of 
Latin America and in the Caribbean. She related their empowerment to the trajectory of the 
movement of black women within the wider feminist and black movements. The fight against 
racism and sexism was part of the process of resistance by women of African descent. She 
mentioned that combating racism against women required governmental programmes and 
actions that addressed the disparities caused by the intersection of sexism and racism. She 
mentioned that, from Brazilian reports on race and sexism, it could be determined that race and 
colour did make a difference. Studies showed that gender and race/colour inequalities were also 
reproduced in the learning process and had an impact on the rates of age-grade disparity of 
students in primary and secondary education. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (a) (ix):  Racial profiling 
</b>81. Ambassador Kasanda, in presenting his report on racial profiling, began by stressing that 
racial profiling was a gross violation of many human rights norms. He described it as 
discrimination based on stereotypes of targeted individuals, religious groups and minority 
communities. He highlighted the several contexts in which racial profiling was evident, and 
further stressed its negative effects, such as those on the individual being stereotyped and the 
impact it had on children and their perception of the community. The practice also led to a 
community&#8217;s mistrust of the police and a diminished sense of citizenship by affected 
communities. 
</p>
<p>82. Ms. Margaret Parsons, panellist for the Working Group on People of African Descent, 
presented her report on racial profiling. She considered the definition of racial profiling, as 
reflected in international instruments and as used by national bodies. She reviewed the 
deliberations of the Working Group in previous sessions, when it had discussed racial profiling, 
and noted that, across the globe, there was evidence of shared trends that reflected racial 
disparities and harsh or disparate treatment of African descendants in police stops, searches and 
arrests, law enforcement investigation techniques, prosecutorial discretion, and sentencing. 
Institutional racism in law enforcement, the criminal justice system and penal administration was 
a civil rights crisis facing African descendants worldwide. Racial inequality in that area was 
manifested indiscriminately, affecting people of African descent in similar ways irrespective of 
country of origin, political structure, social status or economic advantage. 
</p>
<p>83. The presentations on racial profiling elicited several comments, with observations that 
racial profiling was a very important issue to be addressed by the Preparatory Committee. 
</p>
<p>84. Ms. Parsons was asked if she agreed with the definition given in paragraph 72 of the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action with regard to racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>85. Ms. Parsons proposed a fuller definition of racial profiling, as used by the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission, that incorporated banking and other social aspects where racial profiling 
was present and not just in reference to law enforcement. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (b): How best to ensure the recommendations of the Working Group are 
implemented 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Chairperson stated that each previous session had produced several recommendations 
but that they had not been fully implemented. The Chairperson then opened the floor to ideas of 
how best to ensure the recommendations of the Working Group were properly implemented. 
</p>
<p>87. A member of a non-governmental organization offered the opinion that the problem was 
one of double standards and that the racism that existed in the world also existed inside the 
United Nations. He stressed that there was even resistance to holding a world conference on 
racism. He believed that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was a compromise 
that contained no clear language on the subject of reparations. 
</p><p>88. Reference was made to resistance to the Durban process by specific groups. The 
commentator thought that some sectors believed that acknowledgement and implementation of 
the Working Groups recommendations would only lead to the creation of political and economic 
upheaval, which certain countries wanted to avoid. 
</p>
<p>89. As well as the Working Group&#8217;s, strong support was given to the recommendations of the 
Special Rapporteur, Mr. Doudou Di&#232;ne. It was also stated that there was a lack of information 
regarding States&#8217; implementation of the recommendations of the Working Group and that such 
information would be of great value in the Durban Review Conference.  
</p>
<p>90. The importance of participation by civil society groups, such as non-governmental 
organizations, was again stressed. 
</p>
<p>91. Another issue discussed was the inability of the Working Group to conduct country visits 
to meet Governments and non-governmental organizations, which would give the Working 
Group first-hand experience of the situation on the ground. 
</p>
<p>92. Another issue mentioned was that of States having appropriate mechanisms to deal with 
the issue of racism. The lack of similar bodies within all States that could actively take the work 
of the Working Group on board was highlighted. Thus, a suggestion was made to review existing 
national mechanisms in order to better support the work of the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>93. Another issue raised was that of the budgetary time frames and the length of time it took to 
have a policy decision, such as the implementation of a decision by the Working Group, 
reflected in programmes.  
</p>
<p>94. There was also commentary stating that the Working Group should set out priorities and 
should forward the most pressing issues to States, which in turn could pass them on to the 
Human Rights Council. Lessons should be learned from experience in other areas, such as 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>95. It was highlighted that there could and should be room for strategic synergy between the 
bodies relevant to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and other United Nations 
bodies, using the United Nations staff college as an important resource in that endeavour. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>96. Another proposal was to find prominent individuals who could act as champions to 
promote the work of the Working Group, not only in States with a significant number of people 
of African descendant, but also globally, as proposed by Professor Jabbour. 
</p>
<p>97. A short number of very sound legal and technical recommendations was another method 
suggested to aid in facilitating the implementation of the Working Group&#8217;s recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (c): Discussion of the work plan adopted earlier by the Working Group 
</b>Deleted from programme of work. 
</p>
<p><b>Item 5 (d): Improvements, major challenges and new manifestations of racism and 
intolerance since the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban 2001 
</b></p>
<p>98. Dr. Georges Jabbour presented a paper on improvements, major challenges and new 
manifestations of racism, racial discrimination and intolerance since the World Conference 
against Racism. He spoke of the fact that Durban had left a tangible impact on the way people 
looked at racism, stressing that it was self-evident that there was now a larger body of national 
and international documents that dealt with racism. He also highlighted the rise of 
Senator Barack Obama to the status of a real presidential contender as evidence of improvement. 
However, he stressed that, regardless of some improvements, there was still a lot left to do. 
Dr. Jabbour also spoke of the new threat of religious hatred and Islamophobia, which he stressed 
was evident in today&#8217;s world as well as in the situation of Muslim prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. 
</p>
<p>99. He stated that action still needed to be taken on the national, regional and international 
levels. He stressed that, in order to acquire momentum prior to the Conference, it was perhaps 
useful for the Office of the High Commissioner to request all States and regional organizations to 
submit their overdue plans of action and for the Office to disseminate them. Justice in the wider 
sense of equality should be the motto of the work on racism as preparations were being made for 
the review conference, where justice in strict judicial terms should prevail over diplomacy. 
Dr. Jabbour also stressed the importance of reparations and cited his own document entitled 
&#8220;Some personal thoughts on reparation and people of African descent&#8221; as an example of how the 
issue of reparations could be addressed. 
</p>
<p>100. There was wide agreement with Dr. Jabbour; several observers agreed with his suggestions 
regarding the raising of awareness of combating racism and reparations. 
</p>
<p>101. An observer who chose to elaborate on Dr. Jabbour&#8217;s analysis of Islamophobia emphasized 
the importance of encouraging an historical reconciliation between Islam and the West. Concerns 
were raised regarding whether efforts to combat Islamophobia should be focused on the 
grassroots of the population or only on the elite.  
</p>
<p>102. There was also an observation that Dr. Jabbour&#8217;s reference to presidential candidate 
Barack Obama as a sign that there was improvement in the situation of people of African descent 
were overoptimistic. It was stated that one should not confuse personal achievement, in 
Mr. Obama&#8217;s case, with improvement of the masses.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Contribution of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent  
to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> After reviewing the recommendations made by it in previous sessions, the Working 
Group, as part of its contribution to the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review 
Conference, made the recommendations set out below. 
</b></p>
<p><b>National plans of action 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Working Group calls upon those States that have not yet elaborated national 
plans of action to combat racism to do so, preferably before the Durban Review 
Conference. States that have elaborated national plans of action are called upon to 
implement them fully and to report upon such implementation at the Durban Review 
Conference. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Administration of justice 
</b>105.<b> The Working Group urges States to identify factors that have resulted in the 
over-representation in arrests, sentencing and incarceration of people of African descent, 
particularly young men, and to take immediate and appropriate measures to eliminate 
those factors and to adopt crime-prevention strategies and programmes that include 
alternatives to incarceration. 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Working Group recommends that States take measures to ensure that the 
disproportionately low levels of representation of people of African descent in the judiciary 
and other areas of the justice system be addressed.  
Collection of data 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Working Group recommends that States implement mechanisms whereby 
disaggregated information may be effectively collected on health, education, access to 
housing, employment, treatment in the criminal justice system and political participation 
and representation as regards people of African descent, and that that information be the 
basis for the creation and monitoring of policies and practices that address any 
discrimination found.  
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should 
provide guidelines on the collection of disaggregated information to those States that 
request them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Racism and media 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The Working Group recommends that, in association with the International 
Federation of Journalists, a code of conduct be drawn up that, while taking into account 
such fundamental issues as the right to freedom of expression, combats racial 
discrimination against people of African descent by elaborating standards that must be 
adhered to so as to eliminate the projection and perpetuation, through the media and new </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>technologies, of negative images and stereotypes of Africa and people of African descent. 
Such a code of conduct should also include provisions that address and combat incitement 
to racial hatred. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The Working Group recommends that the 8-volume UNESCO General History of 
Africa series be popularized and included by States in their educational curricula.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Racism and employment 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> The Working Group invites the International Labour Organization to make a 
contribution to the Durban Review Conference on growing xenophobic trends and how to 
combat them, as well as on the elaboration of international standards for protection of 
domestic workers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>National monitoring bodies 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The Working Group recommends that States and international and regional 
organizations establish independent bodies, where they do not already exist, to receive 
complaints by people of African descent of discrimination in accessing housing, education, 
health, employment and other fundamental rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Racism and health 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> The Working Group encourages the World Health Organization to continue its 
efforts to mainstream racial/ethnicity equality with ministries of health, and to strengthen 
its internal efforts to ensure that all its working teams and managers adopt an ethnic/racial 
equality perspective. 
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> The Working Group recommends that States guarantee universal and effective access 
to medications, particularly those required for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and other pandemics.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Best practices for combating racism and promoting racial equality 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> The Working Group recommends that the Human Rights Council request OHCHR 
to produce a series of best practices in areas such as access to housing, education, health, 
employment and institutional and legal frameworks pertaining to people of African 
descent, as well as combating stereotyping against this group in the media. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Racial profiling 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> The Working Group reiterates its call to Governments to abolish and prohibit any 
discrimination within their jurisdiction and to criminalize racial profiling, envisaging 
sanctions for those who violate the law and ensuring effective remedies for the victims.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Racial equality index 
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> The Working Group reiterates the importance of the recommendation made by the 
Independent eminent experts on the follow-up to Durban to develop a racial equality index 
as a tool to better assess discrimination that affects people of African descent and other 
vulnerable groups and to guide the adoption of policies to remedy their situation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> With reference to paragraphs 164, 165 and 166 of the Durban Programme of Action, 
the Working Group strongly recommends that the issue of reparations for people of 
African descent be considered at the Durban Review Conference. 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The Working Group recommends that the United Nations create a United Nations 
fellowship programme for people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> The Working Group reiterates its recommendation that a fund be created to facilitate 
the participation of civil society organizations that represent people of African descent and 
non-governmental organizations in all meetings and activities of the Working Group. </b></p>
