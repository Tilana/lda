<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Malta was held at the 16th meeting on 
30 October 2013. The delegation of Malta was headed by Ms. Helena Dalli, Minister for 
Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs and Civil Liberties. At its 19th meeting held on 1 
November 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Malta. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Malta: Kuwait, Peru and the Republic of 
Moldova. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Malta: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/MLT/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/MLT/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/17/MLT/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Liechtenstein, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and the Northern Ireland was transmitted to Malta through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation underlined the commitment of the new Government to safeguarding 
and furthering civil rights and equality. Malta continued to reaffirm the human rights 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other landmark documents, 
and to strive for the equal and inalienable rights of all despite numerous challenges on a 
global scale as well as the harsh reality of immigration and financial challenges at the 
national level. Respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual had been 
in fact enshrined in the first article of the Constitution of Malta, placing them at the very 
core of Maltese society, governance and international commitment. Malta remained 
committed to UPR and considered it a strong mechanism addressing all human rights and 
being equally applied to all Member States without distinction or discrimination.  
</p>
<p>6. The delegation stated that the national report, which was based on the 
recommendations emanating from the 2009 review, had been drafted after broad 
consultation with government entities and civil society. The dialogue with civil society had 
been critical to the preparation of the review having in mind the importance of civil society 
organizations, especially those working at grass-roots level. Civil society representatives 
were given an opportunity to express their concerns and outline their positions on a number 
of contentious issues. The national report featured new and ongoing initiatives.  </p>


<p>7. Malta continued its efforts to put the rights of the child at the top of its human rights 
agenda, and initiated policies and adopted legislation that extended the rights of the child. 
The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s intention to continue its efforts in protecting 
and promoting the rights of children. 
</p>
<p>8. On the occasion of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, the 
Government signed a declaration calling for a comprehensive policy approach &#8212; at 
European Union level and across the European Union &#8212; on lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and intersex (LGBTI) issues aiming at improving human rights and 
mainstreaming equality for LGBTI persons.  
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that the new Government was fully committed to the 
protection of the rights of LGBTI persons. A few weeks after being elected, the 
Government had reached an out-of-court (European Court of Human Rights) settlement 
with a transgender person who had previously been prevented from marrying by Maltese 
law. Subsequently, the Civil Code had been amended to allow persons who underwent a 
legally recognized gender change to be recognized in the new gender acquired, in those 
remaining areas where it was hitherto not acknowledged. With regard to same-sex 
relationships, the Government presented a bill in Parliament aimed at the legal recognition 
of same-sex couples and, once enacted, same-sex couples would be able to register their 
union and be granted equal marriage rights. The law would also provide for the recognition 
of civil marriages contracted by same-sex partners outside of Malta.  
</p>
<p>10. The drafting of the Civil Union Act was one of the tasks given to the newly founded 
Consultative Council on LGBTI rights, which was assigned to advise the Government and 
was made up of NGOs representing the LGBTI community.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers in 
collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) had been finalizing guidelines for the prevention, identification, intervention and 
follow-up of victims and perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>12. An amendment to the Criminal Code had been drafted in order to ensure that 
corporal punishment of any form on minors was considered a criminal offence. The 
amendment would expose the parent to criminal sanction in all cases of corporal 
punishment, irrespective whether it was minor or grave. The added &#8220;sanction&#8221; of 
deprivation of parental authority would also apply in the case of corporal punishment 
exceeding the bounds of reasonable chastisement.  
</p>
<p>13. The same Bill included amendments to the Criminal Code to provide for an increase 
in the age of criminal responsibility of minors from 9 to 14 years. Minors under the age of 
16 would also be exempt from criminal responsibility if the minors acted without 
mischievous discretion. 
</p>
<p>14. Malta experienced a significant irregular migratory influx since 2002. The numbers 
remained consistently high over the past years. The situation posed considerable challenges 
for the country&#8217;s limited resources. The delegation stated that significant progress had been 
documented and yet Malta still faced difficulties. Therefore, the Government had 
repeatedly stressed a need for assistance from European Union member States, particularly 
via intra-European Union relocation. Assistance was received from some of those member 
States, as well as from the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>15. The overwhelming majority of irregular migrants arriving in Malta applied for 
asylum, which clearly demonstrated that the asylum system was accessible. The delegation 
referred to the UNHCR statistics of 2012 indicating that Malta received the largest number 
of asylum applications among the 44 industrialized countries, with 4.9 applications per 
1,000 inhabitants. According to the UNHCR report, Malta received the largest number of </p>


<p>asylum applications per 1,000 inhabitants for 2008&#8211;2012. The delegation stated that the 
asylum recognition rate was high, at around 50 per cent or more, and it had reached 90 per 
cent in 2012.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that asylum seekers were given all the necessary information 
about the asylum procedures, including information on their rights and obligations during 
the entire process, and were assisted by interpreters. Detainees were informed about the 
right to appeal their removal and detention order, and about the right to apply for asylum.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government ensured that refurbishment of closed and open centres was carried 
out regularly. Vulnerable persons, such as unaccompanied minors, families and single 
parents with minor children, were not subject to the detention requirement. Minors received 
the same rights as Maltese minors, including the right to attend State schools.  
</p>
<p>18. Malta continued to fully respect its international legal obligations regarding the 
rescue of persons in distress at sea, regardless of the provenance and legal status of the 
persons requiring rescue. The delegation noted that a total of over 13,000 persons had been 
rescued by the Maltese authorities over the past decade. The number of chambers in the 
Immigration Appeals Board and the Refugee Appeals Board had been increased so that 
decisions were reached more expeditiously. In that respect, the delegation concluded that 
the developments outlined in the areas of search and rescue, irregular migration and asylum 
illustrated that Malta approached those sensitive issues with a strong human rights focus.  
</p>
<p>19. The delegation pointed to a network of specialized entities covering a wide range of 
human rights. The Office of the Refugee Commissioner, which had been set up by the 
Refugees Act in 2000, was responsible for receiving, processing and determining asylum 
applications. The Office had offered individual assistance in filling in registration forms 
and provided information sessions to potential asylum seekers to inform them about their 
rights and obligations in relation to applying for asylum. Since 2009, the Office had 
upgraded its operations through the provision of additional staff and better-equipped 
premises in order to process asylum applications in an efficient manner. 
</p>
<p>20. The National Commission for Persons with Disabilities had served as the watchdog 
on government initiatives on the rights of disabled persons with the capacity to suggest 
changes to legislation. It was mandated to investigate complaints and carry out needs 
assessment of persons with disabilities, their families and voluntary entities working in this 
field in order to feed into policy formulation.  
</p>
<p>21. The Commissioner for Children had been empowered to promote compliance with 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and other international instruments that 
further the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>22. The National Commission for the Promotion of Equality (NCPE) had worked to 
safeguard and promote equal treatment on the grounds of sex/gender and family 
responsibilities, sexual orientation, age, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief and gender 
identity in employment, banks and financial institutions, as well as education and 
vocational training. It also worked to ensure equality based on racial or ethnic origin and 
gender in the provision of goods and services and their supply. It carried out training on 
equality and non-discrimination issues, investigated complaints and provided independent 
assistance to persons facing discrimination. Its role also extended to monitoring the 
implementation of national policies with respect to the promotion of equality for men and 
women through gender-mainstreaming. The delegation stated that the Government had 
been working to extend the remit of NCPE to a human rights institution in accordance with 
the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>23. The Parliamentary Ombudsman, an Independent Officer of the Parliament, was 
mandated to investigate complaints about any decision or action, or a lack of action by </p>


<p>government departments and other public authorities. The Ombudsman could commence 
investigations on his own initiative. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation indicated the Government&#8217;s commitment to the promotion of sexual 
and reproductive health. That included the protection of the right of women to have control 
over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, the timing and 
number of children, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. In that respect, the 
Government was also committed to ensuring access to information on effective methods of 
family planning. The launch of the National Sexual Health Policy in 2010 was followed by 
the introduction of the National Sexual Health Strategy, which was formulated through 
widespread consultation with representatives of society. 
</p>
<p>25. The delegation reiterated the Government&#8217;s belief in the need to protect the right to 
life, including that of the unborn child. It expressed the view that, as human life begins at 
conception, the termination of pregnancy through procedures of induced abortion at any 
stage of gestation, was an infringement of this right. Malta, therefore, could not recognize 
abortion or any other form of termination of pregnancy as a legitimate measure of family 
planning. Where the life of a mother was at risk, a medical intervention to save her life, 
even if that could result in the death of the child, was not precluded. 
</p>
<p>26. The delegation expressed appreciation for the sterling work carried out by OHCHR 
in general, and for the High Commissioner in particular, for their significant contribution as 
well as the support extended to the UPR mechanism in terms of both capacity-building and 
assistance to States. 
</p>

of unaccompanied minors. It applauded progress made in fighting discrimination on 
grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Civil Unions Bill, which would

criminalization of abortion in all cases. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Nicaragua noted progress regarding refugees and asylum, pursuant to 
recommendations accepted during the first UPR of Malta. It acknowledged the complex 
and challenging migratory situation in the Mediterranean requiring constant attention.

improving the asylum system. It recalled efforts to move from punishment to reform in 
correctional facilities, but noted that reports had expressed concern about conditions at the 
Corradino Facility. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Oman congratulated Malta on its national report demonstrating efforts to protect and 
promote human rights in line with international standards. It welcomed the signature and 
ratification of international human rights instruments, adoption and implementation of 
domestic legislation and programmes and the establishment of national human rights 
bodies. It commended efforts to promote the rights of the child and persons with 
disabilities. Oman made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>74. Cuba recognized efforts to implement recommendations accepted during the first 
UPR, in particular in promoting equality and protecting persons with a disability. It noted 
that Malta had many human rights challenges ahead, as noted in the national report. Cuba 
made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>75. Portugal welcomed measures aimed at gender equality and non-discrimination 
against women, through NCPE and the zero-tolerance approach to domestic violence and 
violence against women, and encouraged continuation of that work. It commended 
enhanced protection of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and in that context referred 
to the particular situation of children. Portugal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. The Republic of Moldova commended implementation of previous accepted UPR 
recommendations, including the adoption of the National Action Plan on combating 
trafficking in human beings and the establishment of the Human Trafficking Monitoring </p>


<p>Committee. While noting certain existing inequalities, it recognized actions to enhance 
women&#8217;s participation in the labour market and strengthen NCPE. It encouraged adopting 
the National Children Policy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Sierra Leone commended progress made since the first UPR cycle, including the 
appointment of a minister for civil liberties, the establishment of national institutions to 
protect vulnerable groups, and the signature and ratification of international instruments 
including CRPD and Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence 
against women and domestic violence. It applauded efforts to combat racism and 
discrimination and address the right to development. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>78. Slovenia applauded the commitment to the UPR process and its efforts to improve 
the human rights situation since the previous UPR. It noted that Malta had ratified OP-
CRC-SC. Slovenia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>79. Spain commended the commitment to human rights at the national and international 
levels, including within the European Union framework, as reflected in the ratification of 
international instruments. It applauded efforts and policies to ensure greater participation of 
women in society, but noted steps should be taken to better protect and control gender-
based discrimination. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. Sweden noted information about the policy of long-term detention of asylum seekers 
and threats to send migrants back without granting the opportunity to seek asylum. Despite 
some improvements on the matter, the European Court of Human Rights had recently ruled 
on human rights violations of asylum seekers. Sweden asked whether there was a need to 
review the asylum policy, and what the most urgent issues were. Sweden made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>81. In response to a number of comments on the establishment of a national human 
rights institution, the delegation reiterated that the Government would be extending the 
mandate of NCPE to transform it into a national human rights institution to function in 
accordance with the Paris Principles. Malta would be in a position to report on progress in 
that regard during its next review. 
</p>
<p>82. As for the detention of migrants, the delegation confirmed that the detention 
requirement did not apply across the board, as vulnerable persons, including 
unaccompanied minors, parents with children, families, disabled persons and others had not 
been subject to detention. Medical checks had been systematically carried out for every 
immigrant upon arrival. Vulnerable migrants were provided with alternative 
accommodation and any special attention that they might need, including access to health 
care. Minors were entitled to the same rights as Maltese minors, including the right to 
attend public schools. 
</p>
<p>83. In response to comments on hate speech, the delegation stated that the Government 
condemned hate speech. All offences in the Criminal Code had an aggravation of 
punishment if made with racial or xenophobic motivation. 
</p>
<p>84. Responding to comments in relation to anti-trafficking measures, the delegation 
stated that Malta had strengthened its legislation to combat human trafficking and that it 
had started to implement its second Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in Human 
Beings for 2013&#8211;2014. 
</p>
<p>85. The Immigration Act provided for a possibility of challenging decisions on 
detention of migrants. Furthermore, the Government had taken steps to amend its 
legislation to further strengthen the legal right to appeal decisions on detention. Measures 
had also been taken to ensure that the Immigration Appeals Board and the Refugee Appeals 
Board reached their decisions more expeditiously. </p>


<p>86. The delegation reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the principle 
of non-refoulement and recalled that an asylum seeker could not be returned as long as the 
asylum application was still pending, be it at first instance or on appeal. 
</p>
<p>87. Regarding the detention of asylum seekers, the delegation stated that the Maltese 
asylum policy and practice had progressed considerably since its last UPR and that Malta 
had largely complied with the recommendations that were put forward on the issue. The 
Government considered that detention was a necessity in the context of Malta, particularly 
having in mind that all irregular migrants reached Malta undocumented, thereby already 
fulfilling one of the reasons why detention might be pursued in line with the recast 
Reception Conditions Directive, which would come into force in 2015. With that in mind, 
Malta would be retaining the detention policy. 
</p>
<p>88. Extensive refurbishment projects had been undertaken to ensure appropriate 
conditions in detention centres, including the Safi and Lyster Detention Centres. Efforts had 
been also made to provide access to educational, cultural and sports activities to migrants in 
detention centres.  
</p>
<p>89. The delegation noted that the integration of migrants remained one of the main 
challenges. Integration-oriented projects had been undertaken by the Agency for the 
Welfare of Asylum Seekers, focusing in particular on access to employment and language 
skills. Notwithstanding these efforts, long-term integration for all those in need of 
international protection had been limited by the country&#8217;s geo-social realities and, thus, 
additional assistance to Malta was requested to meet the current needs. While assistance 
had been received from a number of States in the past, Malta was still in need of help to 
alleviate pressures being faced. 
</p>
<p>90. In response to questions on criminalization of abortion, the delegation stated that 
Malta had made a declaration under article 16 of CEDAW and, thus, it was not bound by an 
obligation to legalize abortion. However, in cases where the life of a mother was at risk, a 
medical intervention to save her life, even if that could result in the death of the child, was 
not precluded. The delegation highlighted that the right to life, enshrined in the 
Constitution, was an inherent right of every human being, including the unborn child as 
human life begins at conception. Therefore, Malta considered the termination of pregnancy 
through procedures of induced abortion an infringement of the right to life and, thus, 
abortion or any other form of termination of pregnancy could not be considered as a 
legitimate measure of family planning. 
</p>
<p>91. The delegation reiterated the commitment of Malta to the promotion of sexual and 
reproductive health and to the protection of the right of women to have control over and 
decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality and the timing and 
number of children free of coercion, discrimination and violence.  
</p>
<p>92. Health education was an ongoing initiative. The Government had set up an 
Education-Health Committee, which discussed and coordinated school health activities; 
reviewed existing health programmes and initiatives in schools; and advised and put 
forward proposals for the sexual and reproductive health content of the National 
Curriculum Framework for schools.  
</p>
<p>93. A number of sexual and reproductive health-care services were freely available 
within the national public health-care system, including family planning. The Ministry for 
Health provided a clinic offering a confidential service of diagnosis and treatment of 
sexually transmitted infections, and counselling and testing for HIV. 
</p>
<p>94. In response to a question on lengthy court proceedings, the delegation stated that the 
new Government had put the problem to the fore of its agenda and that it had set up the 
Justice Reform Commission to draft a comprehensive set of proposals aimed at reforming </p>


<p>the justice sector, particularly minimizing the length of court hearings and devising a more 
expeditious criminal justice system. The Commission was expected to submit its final 
report in November 2013, putting forward proposals on possible reforms for the 
Government&#8217;s consideration. Malta envisaged that the implementation of the justice reform 
would entail the amendment of existing legislation, which would be embarked upon in 
</p><p>2014. 
</p>
<p>95. The delegation stated that efforts had been made to ensure that Maltese public and 
private services were accessible to European Union and third-country nationals on the same 
terms as for Maltese nationals, avoiding discriminatory practice. In that respect, Malta 
constantly monitored its legislation to avoid any discrimination between its nationals and 
European Union or third-country nationals. Any person who felt aggrieved by any legal 
enactment could also access the domestic courts to declare that a particular legislation was 
discriminatory. The courts, vested with constitutional jurisdiction, had the power to decide 
whether the law was in accordance with the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>96. From a health-care perspective, emergency medical care had always been provided 
to all persons visiting Malta irrespective of their country of origin. Since the accession of 
Malta to the European Union, accessibility to health services by European Union citizens 
was in line with European Union legislation. The enactment of the Health Act in October 
2013 had provided a specific provision to ensure that there were no discriminatory 
practices.  
</p>
<p>97. The delegation reported that Malta had been working with the Execution 
Department of the European Court of Human Rights in order to submit its action report 
relative to the cases where a violation was found. With specific reference to the cases 
involving the finding of a violation to the right to property and to peaceful enjoyment of 
possessions, practical and general measures were implemented, which drastically reduced 
the number of premises subject to a requisition order. 
</p><p>98. In response to the question on same-sex couples, the delegation reported that the 
legislative initiatives had been launched to provide for the possibility of a civil union 
between same-sex couples. 
</p>
<p>99. Noting a comment on domestic violence, the delegation stated that a specific law 
against domestic violence had been in place since 2006 and that various agencies had 
provided assistance to the victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>100. As to gender equality, NCPE had been working on various initiatives with the aim 
of increasing the number of women in decision-making positions; and supporting and 
advising policymakers on gender balance in decision-making through, inter alia, conducting 
research studies and putting forward specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>101. In conclusion, the delegation expressed its appreciation for the input of the countries 
that had participated in the interactive dialogue. 
</p>
