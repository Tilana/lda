<p>GE.14-25280 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is the first submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the fifteenth thematic report 
</p>
<p>submitted under this mandate since its establishment in 2000. It is submitted pursuant to 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 25/18 and General Assembly resolution 66/164. 
</p>
<p>2. The work of the Special Rapporteur is also underpinned by thematic resolutions, 
</p>
<p>including General Assembly resolution 68/181 and Council resolutions 22/6 and 13/13. 
</p>
<p>3. After providing an overview of his activities during the reporting period, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur submits his strategic workplan and the vision that will drive the implementation 
</p>
<p>of his mandate. He sets out the way in which he intends to carry out his mandate. This 
</p>
<p>constitutes a road map for the action that he means to take in future. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur draws heavily on the working methods developed by his 
</p>
<p>predecessors, in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-
</p>
<p>holders of the Human Rights Council and the working methods described in the practical 
</p>
<p>guide for the special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, adopted in 
</p>
<p>June 2008 at the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has made use of communications and press statements to 
</p>
<p>engage in dialogue with Member States on issues relating to certain human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and legislative developments that might negatively affect the environment in which 
</p>
<p>defenders operate. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur believes that communications are an essential tool for the 
</p>
<p>work of the mandate; they address urgent cases that require the immediate attention of 
</p>
<p>States, allowing him to raise concern about situations and patterns, and can thereby be 
</p>
<p>instrumental in preventing violations against defenders. He firmly believes that 
</p>
<p>communications are the main form of protection that the mandate holder can provide for 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>7. Between 1 December 2013 and 30 November 2014, the Special Rapporteur sent 231 
</p>
<p>communications, of which 128 were urgent appeals and 103 were letters of allegation to 84 
</p>
<p>States. 
</p>
<p>8. All these communications were formulated jointly with other mandate holders. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur fully supports the idea of launching joint appeals; they have the 
</p>
<p>advantage of increasing and reinforcing the impact and power of appeals, making it 
</p>
<p>possible to address cases and situations in a more comprehensive manner and emphasize 
</p>
<p>the indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights. He intends to 
</p>
<p>consider the possibility of launching joint activities with regional human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the greater frequency of joint appeals 
</p>
<p>has the risk of sometimes greatly increasing response times, given that the agreement of 
</p>
<p>each mandate holder has to be obtained before action can be taken. He intends to consider 
</p>
<p>the question more closely and, having weighed up the advantages and disadvantages, may </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p>well revert to sending a greater number of communications relating only to his own 
</p>
<p>mandate. 
</p>
<p>10. The breakdown by region shows that 80 communications were sent to countries in 
</p>
<p>the Asia-Pacific region (35 per cent); 47 to the countries of Latin America and the 
</p>
<p>Caribbean (20 per cent); 37 to the Middle East and North African region (16 per cent); 39 
</p>
<p>to countries in Europe, North America and Central Asia (17 per cent); and 26 to countries 
</p>
<p>in Africa (11 per cent). 
</p>
<p>11. In these communications, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the situation of more 
</p>
<p>than 530 individuals, of whom 119 were women. He sent 32 communications on cases of 
</p>
<p>reprisals against groups or individuals for having engaged with the United Nations, its 
</p>
<p>mechanisms or representatives in the field of human rights, or with international human 
</p>
<p>rights bodies. 
</p>
<p>12. At the time of writing, 110 responses have been received, indicating a slightly higher 
</p>
<p>response rate at 47 per cent, but approximately the same as the previous year. Responses by 
</p>
<p>Governments are, as before, often general or evasive. This situation is particularly worrying 
</p>
<p>in view of the serious nature of the allegations received and the urgency of some of the 
</p>
<p>cases and situations. The Special Rapporteur therefore intends to step up his efforts to 
</p>
<p>follow up communications, which too often remain unanswered or are inadequately 
</p>
<p>answered by some governments. Over the reporting period, he has followed up more than 
</p>
<p>one third of the communications or cases sent during his tenure. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur has sent 28 communications concerning developments in 
</p>
<p>national legislation that could have an impact on the environment in which human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders conduct their activities. He intends to step up communications to governments to 
</p>
<p>offer advisory services to those that so wish. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur will continue to submit an annual progress report, which 
</p>
<p>will, as it has since 2012, contain observations on communications. The report will include 
</p>
<p>information on the communications sent during the previous reporting cycle and the replies 
</p>
<p>received from States, as well as observations by States in relation to cases considered by his 
</p>
<p>predecessors, which require follow-up or in which States have made comments on specific 
</p>
<p>contexts or patterns. The Special Rapporteur intends to use this tool to carry out a more 
</p>
<p>systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of communications sent and responses 
</p>
<p>received, so that he can provide States with this information and join them in drawing the 
</p>
<p>right conclusions.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur also intends to use communications as the empirical basis 
</p>
<p>for his thematic reports. Together with country visits, communications keep the mandate 
</p>
<p>close to the reality on the ground and can contribute to improving the situation of thousands 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders worldwide.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the serious difficulties that arise in the use of 
</p>
<p>communications, mainly owing to the daunting volume of cases received and the lack of 
</p>
<p>resources available to address properly all cases that would merit attention under the 
</p>
<p>mandate. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur has chosen to use his voice to focus the attention of some 
</p>
<p>States and the international community. During the period under consideration, he has 
</p>
<p>issued more than 20 public statements on the situation of human rights defenders in 16 
</p>
<p>countries. These address a variety of issues, such as the general situation in a country, 
</p>
<p>including legislative changes that may negatively affect the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders; individual cases relating to defenders, including reprisals against those that have 
</p>
<p>attempted to engage with the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the 
</p>
<p>field of human rights; and questions relating to certain groups of defenders working in a </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>specific country, such as individuals who promote the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</p>
<p>transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>18. Country visits provide excellent opportunities for the Special Rapporteur to learn 
</p>
<p>about the situation of human rights defenders on the ground, their challenges, the risks they 
</p>
<p>face, their successes and the strategies that they use. Visits are a useful tool to engage 
</p>
<p>constructively with States at all levels, to discuss the main issues affecting the environment 
</p>
<p>in which human rights defenders work and to raise awareness of the importance of their 
</p>
<p>work. 
</p>
<p>19. Since assuming his post on 2 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur has paid an official 
</p>
<p>visit to Burundi, from 14 to 25 November 2014.1 He would like to thank the Burundian 
</p>
<p>Government for having agreed to this visit and facilitating his stay. A separate report on the 
</p>
<p>visit will be submitted in the form of an addendum to his report to the Council in March 
</p>
<p>2016. 
</p>
<p>20. As of the end of November 2014, the Special Rapporteur or his predecessors have 
</p>
<p>the following outstanding visit requests: Bahrain (2012), Belarus (2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 
</p>
<p>2011), Bhutan (2001, 2002), Cambodia (2012), Cameroon (2014), Chad (2002, 2003, 
</p>
<p>2004), China (2008, 2010), Dominican Republic (2012), Egypt (2003, 2008, 2010, 2012), 
</p>
<p>Equatorial Guinea (2002), Ethiopia (2014), Fiji (2010, 2012), Indonesia (2012), Jamaica 
</p>
<p>(2012), Kenya (2003, 2004), Kyrgyzstan (2012), Malawi (2012), Malaysia (2002, 2010), 
</p>
<p>Maldives (2006), Mexico (2011), Mozambique (2003, 2004), Namibia (2011), Nepal 
</p>
<p>(2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012), Oman (2012), Pakistan (2003, 2007, 2008, 2010), 
</p>
<p>Philippines (2008, 2010, 2012), Russian Federation (2004, 2011), Saudi Arabia (2012), 
</p>
<p>Senegal (2012), Singapore (2002, 2004), Sri Lanka (2008, 2010), Syrian Arab Republic 
</p>
<p>(2008, 2010), Thailand (2012), Turkmenistan (2003, 2004), United Arab Emirates (2012), 
</p>
<p>Uzbekistan (2001, 2004, 2007), Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) (2007, 2008, 2010), 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam (2012) and Zimbabwe (2002, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011). 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur regrets that several of these requests are long-standing. He 
</p>
<p>intends to repeat his requests for visits to these countries in 2015 and hopes that the States 
</p>
<p>in question will give due attention and respond positively. He also calls on governments 
</p>
<p>that have not yet issued open invitations to mandate holders to do so and requests that 
</p>
<p>States that have not yet responded to his request for a visit should do so as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>That would clearly reflect their commitment to cooperating with United Nations 
</p>
<p>mechanisms; they would thus provide evidence of the good example that should be set by 
</p>
<p>all members of the Council. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the workload that such missions impose on the 
</p>
<p>authorities of countries visited and he wishes to thank governments that have issued an 
</p>
<p>invitation or agreed to a request for a visit. He notes that visits should be of sufficient 
</p>
<p>length to enable him to travel within the country, outside the capital, particularly in 
</p>
<p>countries with extensive territories, so that he can make a better assessment of the situation 
</p>
<p>and also meet isolated human rights defenders who cannot travel. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur intends to pay follow-up visits to countries already visited 
</p>
<p>by his predecessors. He means to continue the good practice followed by his predecessor 
</p>

</p>
<p>and conduct joint missions with the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders of the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. Joint visits help raise the profile of 
</p>
<p>visit, facilitate follow-up by regional mechanisms and relevant stakeholders and create 
</p>
<p>synergies between international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>24. In addition to official country visits, the Special Rapporteur will accept invitations 
</p>
<p>sent to him by State institutions, universities or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to 
</p>
<p>participate in conferences, events and workshops, where he can present his views on the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights defenders and the role of his mandate. Such activities provide 
</p>
<p>invaluable opportunities to raise awareness about the role of human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>engage with different stakeholders on the issue. Where it is relevant and useful, and with 
</p>
<p>the agreement of the States concerned, he hopes to explore the possibility of using visits 
</p>
<p>arranged on the occasion of seminars or other meetings to meet the country authorities and 
</p>
<p>re-examine with them and other stakeholders the follow-up to any recommendations that 
</p>
<p>may have been made. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communication of information and thematic studies 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the course of the first consultations that he held, the Special Rapporteur noted that 
</p>
<p>the reports on communications sent to or received from governments were not easy to 
</p>
<p>understand. He intends to consider the possibility of changing their format or wording in 
</p>
<p>order to enable all stakeholders, including the governments concerned, to use such reports 
</p>
<p>for follow-up purposes.  
</p>
<p>26. In addition to communications sent to or received from governments and the country 
</p>
<p>visits, the Special Rapporteur will seek to engage in activities aimed at consolidating the 
</p>
<p>mass of information accumulated by his predecessors and will consider new activities that 
</p>
<p>will provide the opportunity to analyse and understand more clearly the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 
</p>
<p>Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Declaration on Human Rights Defenders&#8221;), as well as numerous aspects of the work of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and the difficulties that they have to overcome. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur considers that the 2006 report by one of his predecessors 
</p>
<p>relating to progress made and the main obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights Defenders is an important analytical tool and he therefore intends to 
</p>
<p>bring it up to date. This updating will be based on information from governments, national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, specialized institutions of the United Nations system and civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, among others. It will be an important undertaking, which will 
</p>
<p>culminate in the formulation of targeted recommendations, specific to each country, making 
</p>
<p>it possible to strengthen the protection of human rights defenders in more than 120 States. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur will publish a compilation of best practices as an annex to this 
</p>
<p>report.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur intends to make action against the culture of impunity a 
</p>
<p>central feature of his activities. He will undertake research into the matter and will show in 
</p>
<p>one of his future reports that the de facto impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of reprisals 
</p>
<p>against human rights defenders is one of the reasons that the incidence of impunity is on the 
</p>
<p>increase.  
</p>
<p>29. A number of complaints by human rights defenders about alleged violations of their 
</p>
<p>rights are not investigated or are shelved. A State&#8217;s failure to investigate violations may be 
</p>
<p>seen as condoning the behaviour of the perpetrators of attacks and may nurture an 
</p>
<p>environment where further attacks are perceived as being tolerated. The previous Special </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur repeatedly reiterated that ending impunity was an essential condition for 
</p>
<p>ensuring the protection and safety of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>30. States should ensure the prompt and independent investigation of all violations 
</p>
<p>against defenders and the prosecution of alleged perpetrators, regardless of their status. 
</p>
<p>They should also ensure that victims of violations have access to just and effective 
</p>
<p>remedies, namely judicial and administrative or quasi-judicial mechanisms, and appropriate 
</p>
<p>compensation. Investigation and prosecution should be underpinned by an effective and 
</p>
<p>independent judiciary.  
</p>
<p>31. Unfortunately, in many instances, weaknesses in the judicial system and flaws in the 
</p>
<p>legal framework have deprived human rights defenders of adequate tools for seeking and 
</p>
<p>obtaining justice. Strengthening the judiciary and making sure that it can operate 
</p>
<p>independently and effectively should therefore be a priority for States.  
</p>
<p>32. States should also implement the interim measures of protection granted to 
</p>
<p>defenders by international and regional human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Cooperation with international, regional and national partners 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur sets great store by cooperation with all United Nations 
</p>
<p>bodies and other intergovernmental human rights organizations. This section contains an 
</p>
<p>overview of the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur between 2 June 2014, when 
</p>
<p>he took up his duties, and 13 November 2014.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur sent a series of appeals and communications to governments 
</p>
<p>on the situation of human rights defenders, as mentioned above.  
</p>
<p>35. On 10 and 11 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur took part in a meeting in Bern 
</p>
<p>organized by the Swiss presidency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>Europe (OSCE) for the launch of the OSCE guidelines on human rights defenders. On that 
</p>
<p>occasion, he commended the initiative taken by OSCE to develop this guide for human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders in the region.  
</p>
<p>36. On 13 June 2014, he held a series of consultations with human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>present in Geneva during the twenty-sixth session of the Council and in Brussels, at a 
</p>
<p>meeting organized by the European Union on the European Initiative for Democracy and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>37. The same day, he participated in a parallel event in Geneva entitled &#8220;From threats to 
</p>
<p>opportunities: Business and human rights defenders&#8221;, organized by International Service for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Legal Resources Centre of South Africa.  
</p>
<p>38. On 17 June 2014, he took part in a meeting organized in Brussels by the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of Ireland on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the European Union 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and held consultations with representatives of the 
</p>
<p>European Union. He took the opportunity to discuss regional consultations and the 
</p>
<p>assessment of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the European Commission. 
</p>
<p>39. On 26 August 2014, he took part in a day-long meeting organized by the French 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs on human rights defenders, attended by all the French 
</p>
<p>ambassadors, on the implementation of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Defenders.  
</p>
<p>40. On 15 September 2014, he took part in a panel discussion on the European Union 
</p>
<p>Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, held during the Council session. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p>41. From 29 September to 3 October 2014, he participated in the annual meeting of 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures.  
</p>
<p>42. On 24 October 2014, he held a meeting with the President and Commissioners of the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and its Special Rapporteurs on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Defenders and Freedom of Expression to discuss with them possible avenues of 
</p>
<p>cooperation.  
</p>
<p>43. On 10 November 2014, he attended a lecture organized by the German Institute for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and the organization Brot f&#252;r die Welt on the role of human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and business. 
</p>
<p>44. He met the permanent representatives of various missions in Geneva to discuss 
</p>
<p>matters relating to the exercise of his mandate. Together with his team, and other special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders, he held discussions on possible synergies and cooperation in 
</p>
<p>the future. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Strategic workplan 
</b></p>
<p>45. This section sets out the way in which the Special Rapporteur envisages 
</p>
<p>implementing his mandate. It constitutes a road map for the activities that await him over 
</p>
<p>the coming years.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Detailed analysis of trends and problems 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes that, like his predecessors, he will be able to carry out 
</p>
<p>his basic task of protecting human rights defenders more effectively if he keeps up to date 
</p>
<p>with friends and constants in this area. 
</p>
<p>47. In accordance with Council resolution 16/5, under which the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>decided to study trends, developments and challenges in relation to the exercise of the right 
</p>
<p>of anyone, acting individually or in association with others, to promote and protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms, the Special Rapporteur began his time in office by 
</p>
<p>holding a series of regional consultations, at which he met about 40 human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>at a time, region by region, and undertook a detailed consideration with them of national 
</p>
<p>and regional trends, the threats facing specific groups, the reprisals to which they are 
</p>
<p>subject and the methods of protection developed over the past few years, in order to assess 
</p>
<p>their relevance and to develop them either on a case-by-case basis or in a more systematic 
</p>
<p>way. The first consultation was held in Tunis in October 2014, followed by a consultation 
</p>
<p>in Tbilisi, Georgia, in November 2014 and another in Manila, Philippines, in December 
</p>
<p>2014. Consultations will be held in the Americas and Africa in the first half of 2015.  
</p>
<p>48. At these consultations, a systematic presentation is made of the mandate, its 
</p>
<p>objectives, its working methods, the options open to human rights defenders and the 
</p>
<p>possibilities provided by the mandate to protect them. 
</p>
<p>49. Such consultations provide an opportunity to bring together human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>from a specific region working on various themes and topics and to share with them 
</p>
<p>information on the human rights situation. In addition to the sharing of experiences and 
</p>
<p>good practices, these consultations provide a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of protection mechanisms from the point of view of human rights defenders and to establish 
</p>
<p>what they expect from the mandate. </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>50. Where relevant, discussions are held on how human rights defenders perceive the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of the regional mechanisms of the African Commission on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and of the European 
</p>
<p>Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders and the guidelines issued by a number of 
</p>
<p>other countries.  
</p>
<p>51. Part of the discussion focuses on national legislation. This helps the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur understand the best ways of providing States with technical cooperation and 
</p>
<p>enabling them to develop specific national legislation to ensure better protection for the 
</p>
<p>work of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>52. Such regional consultations will provide material for the country visits that the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is currently preparing. The outcome of these regional consultations will 
</p>
<p>inform the next report that the Special Rapporteur will submit to the General Assembly in 
</p>
<p>2015, which should promote reflection among Member States on the future direction of the 
</p>
<p>mandate. The report will contain a series of recommendations intended for all the 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, aiming at ensuring a faster, more personal and more effective response to the 
</p>
<p>protection-related needs of human rights defenders throughout the world. 
</p>
<p>53. In addition to consultations with human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>will, with a view to making a more detailed analysis, continue to schedule meetings with 
</p>
<p>State representatives when they are in Geneva or in other countries to participate in 
</p>
<p>discussions, round tables or lectures. The aim of such meetings is, first, to hear their 
</p>
<p>comments and points of view on how trends are developing, the effectiveness of protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and the impact of national laws on the protection of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>Such meetings will also make it possible to discuss with State representatives, as indicated 
</p>
<p>by Council resolution 25/18, the fact that in some instances, national security and counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>have been misused to target human rights defenders or have hindered their work and 
</p>
<p>endangered their safety in a manner contrary to international law. There will also be room 
</p>
<p>to discuss the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders to conduct their work. This is one of the themes on which the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>will be working in the near future.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Identification of the threats to which human rights defenders are most 
</b></p>
<p><b>exposed, with a view to providing for more effective protection  
</b></p>
<p>54. During his first consultations in Geneva and Brussels and the bilateral discussions 
</p>
<p>that he held with representatives of regional networks of human rights defenders, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was struck by the repeated statements drawing his attention to the 
</p>
<p>groups that were most exposed: those working on economic, social and cultural rights and 
</p>
<p>minority rights; environmental defenders; defenders of LGBTI rights; women defenders 
</p>
<p>and those who work for women&#8217;s rights; defenders who work in the area of business and 
</p>
<p>human rights; those who work in an area exposed to internal conflict or a national disaster; 
</p>
<p>defenders living in isolated regions; and those working on past abuses, such as the families 
</p>
<p>of victims of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>55. This is a central feature of the kind of communications received by the mandate 
</p>
<p>holders on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
</p>
<p>on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association and on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders and also by other mandate holders, such as the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances or the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur has noted with great interest that, over the past few years, 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders have been active in ensuring that the protection promised by the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights is extended to new threats to human dignity. As a 
</p>
<p>result of their work to combat gender-related violence against women, they argue that rights 
</p>
<p>should be protected also within the household and the community. They contend that 
</p>
<p>multinational corporations should be held morally and legally liable for their actions and 
</p>
<p>omissions that deprive men and women of their fundamental rights. They are working to 
</p>
<p>ensure that universal access to primary education and antiretroviral treatment becomes a 
</p>
<p>fundamental right and is not treated as a service that is dependent on charitable action or an 
</p>
<p>aspect of economic development.  
</p>
<p>57. Human rights defenders are often exposed to the same threats and attacks, but some 
</p>
<p>are more exposed or more threatened, or are subjected to particular attacks, in the form of 
</p>
<p>smear campaigns, intimidation, stigmatization, threats to their families, defamation, 
</p>
<p>accusations, ridicule or red tape. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur intends to consider extending the protection mandate 
</p>
<p>entrusted to him as widely as possible and to go to great lengths in exercising his mandate, 
</p>
<p>where necessary, in order to keep the Council and the General Assembly informed. Like his 
</p>
<p>predecessors, he will seek to develop new and even more sophisticated methods to help 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Promotion of closer cooperation with all the parties concerned 
</b></p>
<p>59. There are many parties involved in the promotion of the Declaration on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Defenders and their protection: States, above all, and then the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, NGOs, regional human rights courts and the media. 
</p>
<p>60. States have primary responsibility for protecting human rights defenders and the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur intends to make technical cooperation with governments a central 
</p>
<p>feature of his activities, where this is possible and desirable. Such activities may take place 
</p>
<p>in Geneva, with the permanent missions, but the Special Rapporteur notes that he is 
</p>
<p>available to travel to capitals for meetings with representatives of governments that are 
</p>
<p>willing to cooperate with him. 
</p>
<p>61. The United Nations system has a vital role to play in contributing, to a greater or 
</p>
<p>lesser extent, to the protection of human rights defenders who are exposed to risk. This 
</p>
<p>applies particularly to peacekeeping missions, where they have a specifically human rights 
</p>
<p>mandate, such as the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINOSA), the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office in Burundi and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONASCO). The Special Rapporteur intends to make 
</p>
<p>contact with heads of peacekeeping missions and the Department of Peacekeeping 
</p>
<p>Operations in New York to present his mandate and set out possible areas of cooperation to 
</p>
<p>ensure better protection for human rights defenders facing conflict, internal disturbances or 
</p>
<p>post-conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>62. Relations with United Nations country teams on the ground, with specialized 
</p>
<p>institutions and with bodies of the United Nations system could be strengthened in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure that, acting in accordance with their individual mandates, they can contribute more 
</p>
<p>effectively to the protection of human rights defenders. At the first regional consultation, 
</p>
<p>troubling evidence was put forward on the absence of responses, or inadequate responses, 
</p>
<p>from some United Nations staff members concerning the protection-related needs of human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders. In his next report on regional consultations, the Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>provide the Council with more detail and put forward possible courses of action. </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>63. Regional organizations can and must play a role in the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors initiated and developed good relations 
</p>
<p>with the African and inter-American mechanisms. The Special Rapporteur participated with 
</p>
<p>interest in the inter-mechanism consultation, held in Paris, where the parties explored 
</p>
<p>avenues for closer cooperation, which will need to be assessed before their scope is 
</p>
<p>extended. Such cooperation could take a number of different forms: joint public appeals, 
</p>
<p>joint missions or the publication in the media of joint opinion columns. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur considers that the principle of subsidiarity should apply to 
</p>
<p>the protection of human rights defenders. It is the responsibility of States, above all, to 
</p>
<p>protect defenders by such means as the adoption of legislative or regulatory measures 
</p>
<p>aimed at their protection. The Special Rapporteur intends to redouble his efforts to 
</p>
<p>convince governments to introduce specific national measures, as Brazil, Colombia, Cote 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire and Mexico have done. He intends to hold consultations and publish a study on 
</p>
<p>this topic, with a view to showing the effectiveness of national mechanisms to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights defenders and the measures that should be taken to improve 
</p>
<p>their efficiency. 
</p>
<p>65. If States fail to take action, therefore, regional mechanisms should, where they exist 
</p>
<p>and where possible, be in a position to take action to ensure the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders. Unfortunately, by contrast with Africa and the Americas, there is no specific 
</p>
<p>mechanism in Europe or Asia. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur has initiated extremely promising contacts with the 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe and the European Union Special 
</p>
<p>Representative for Human Rights, who both requested him to maintain coordination in 
</p>
<p>Europe with their respective mandates. The same applies to OSCE, which, with the 
</p>
<p>publication of its guidelines on human rights defenders, has provided its member States 
</p>
<p>with a useful tool. 
</p>
<p>67. The previous Special Rapporteur highlighted the specific role that national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions could play in the promotion and protection of human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>(see document A/HRC/22/47). The Special Rapporteur intends to develop closer ties with 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions both individually and collectively through the International 
</p>
<p>Coordinating Committee, regional networks or national institutions to ensure publicity for 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p>68. National human rights institutions accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status should play a primary 
</p>
<p>role in protection and should take responsibility for following up recommendations 
</p>
<p>addressed to their government by the United Nations and other intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. The Special Rapporteur counts on their active participation in the preparation 
</p>
<p>and follow-up of visits that he will undertake in their countries, including the short follow-
</p>
<p>up visits mentioned earlier in this report. 
</p>
<p>69. While acting in accordance with the working rules of special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders and upholding the independence required of each of them, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>intends to continue and develop his excellent relations with international, regional and 
</p>
<p>national NGOs working for the protection of human rights defenders, particularly NGOs 
</p>
<p>that are specifically involved in the protection or relocation of defenders.  
</p>
<p>70. These organizations do remarkable work in protecting and training human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders on the ground, but such training must be extended and should not be given only 
</p>
<p>to defenders who live in the capitals or other large cities. The first regional consultations 
</p>
<p>highlighted a pressing need for training, for which the Special Rapporteur counts on the 
</p>
<p>relevant NGOs. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur intends to develop cooperation with regional courts, which, 
</p>
<p>thanks to interim measures, among others, successfully provide protection for human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, particularly those threatened with refoulement or return to countries at risk. He 
</p>
<p>has already been in contact with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe about this. There is significant evidence to show the effectiveness of 
</p>
<p>such measures when they are adopted by States. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur intends to draw on lessons learned from his cooperation 
</p>
<p>with regional courts to establish the effectiveness of his activities as a third party in 
</p>
<p>individual cases or in amici curiae briefs with the aim of providing regional courts with 
</p>
<p>more information. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur does not rule out the idea of appearing before national 
</p>
<p>courts as a third party in individual cases or in amici curiae briefs with the appointed 
</p>
<p>counsel, where appropriate. 
</p>
<p>74. Lastly, with regard to cooperation with other stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>would like to recall the vital role played by the media and the social media in promoting the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and the effective protection of defenders. 
</p>
<p>Numerous cases of journalists who have reported on or written articles about human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, and also cases of whistle-blowers and bloggers, have come to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, who considers them to be human rights defenders, in that they meet the 
</p>
<p>criteria set out in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. He means to extend and 
</p>
<p>strengthen his cooperation with the media as part of the implementation of his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Wider dissemination of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders 
</b></p>
<p>75. Sixteen years after its adoption by the General Assembly, the Declaration on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Defenders has been very widely disseminated and promoted by the various 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. Significant efforts have been made to translate it into an ever-growing number 
</p>
<p>of national and local languages. Despite this, it is still too little known by those responsible 
</p>
<p>for its implementation, namely governments, or by those who could benefit from it, namely 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>76. Among the activities that he will pursue, therefore, the Special Rapporteur will pay 
</p>
<p>special attention to the promotional aspects of the Declaration and will encourage States, 
</p>
<p>international organizations and other parties to make an additional effort to make steady 
</p>
<p>progress in translating it into more national and local languages. He will continue to lobby 
</p>
<p>permanent missions and other stakeholders to remind them that, in paragraph 10 of its 
</p>
<p>resolution 62/152, the General Assembly encourages States to translate the Declaration into 
</p>
<p>their national languages and to take measures to improve its dissemination.  
</p>
<p>77. At every meeting, the Special Rapporteur will ask the authorities of the countries 
</p>
<p>that he visits about measures taken to promote awareness-raising and training activities 
</p>
<p>relating to the Declaration in order to enable officials, agencies, authorities and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary to implement the provisions of the Declaration and thus promote better 
</p>
<p>understanding and respect for individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in 
</p>
<p>promoting and defending human rights. 
</p>
<p>78. In view of the threats and risks to which human rights defenders living in isolated 
</p>
<p>areas are exposed, the Special Rapporteur intends to make a particular effort to make sure 
</p>
<p>that the Declaration reaches them so that they can benefit from the protection it provides. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur welcomes all the initiatives taken by States or 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental organizations, including the European Union, OSCE, Norway, 
</p>
<p>Switzerland and the United States to draw up guidelines for their diplomatic missions on </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>the protection of human rights defenders. Such initiatives are more than welcome, because 
</p>
<p>they testify to a real will, over and above formal commitments, to promote a national or 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental policy in support of human rights defenders. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>calls on all States to follow this good practice and to designate within each of their 
</p>
<p>diplomatic missions a focal point who is known to human rights defenders and who can 
</p>
<p>translate such guidelines into reality. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Closer cooperation with other mandate holders 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur has been struck by the number of cases that relate not only 
</p>
<p>to his own mandate but also to freedom of association or freedom of expression. Restricting 
</p>
<p>freedom of assembly and association is often one of the first measures used by States to 
</p>
<p>suppress human rights defenders and prevent them from promoting and protecting rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms. The recent reports submitted to the Council by the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association2 and the numerous complaints 
</p>
<p>received show that this trend is still on the increase, as the Council also noted in the 
</p>
<p>preamble to its resolution 25/18. The Special Rapporteur intends to strengthen cooperation 
</p>
<p>with other mandate holders and suggest new forms of collaboration. 
</p>
<p>81. Undue restrictions on freedom of expression or opinion are often imposed by States 
</p>
<p>to prevent human rights defenders expressing themselves or engaging in activities to protect 
</p>
<p>and promote fundamental rights and freedoms. That is one of the topics covered in the 
</p>
<p>reports of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression.3 
</p>
<p>82. While preserving the independence of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur intends 
</p>
<p>to extend his partnership with the mandate holders that have the mandates closest to his 
</p>
<p>own, in the interests of ensuring better protection for human rights defenders and drawing 
</p>
<p>the attention of the international community to the methods used by States to suppress or 
</p>
<p>hinder the activities of human rights defenders. He will suggest forms of joint or concerted 
</p>
<p>action with these two other mandate holders, which may eventually lead to joint activities 
</p>
<p>or country visits. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur hopes to develop a series of joint activities, as appropriate, 
</p>
<p>with other thematic mandate holders also dealing with cases of threats, attacks or violations 
</p>
<p>of the rights of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur intends, where relevant, to act more closely with country 
</p>
<p>mandate holders to increase the effectiveness of the protection provided to human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders in the countries for which they are responsible and will explore with them the 
</p>
<p>possibility of extending the good practices of some mandate holders who include a specific 
</p>
<p>section on the situation of human rights defenders in their reports.

<p><b>14</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p><b> F. Improved follow-up of communications, urgent appeals and country 
</b></p>
<p><b>visits 
</b></p>
<p>85. The database of communications sent to States and their replies shows to what 
</p>
<p>extent a large number of governments4 do not reply adequately to communications, urgent 
</p>
<p>appeals or letters of allegation, however well documented. Their replies do not always 
</p>
<p>cover the situation or the case concerned but simply set out the situation, often in very 
</p>
<p>general terms, without really addressing the seriousness of the cases in question. 
</p>
<p>86. At his first consultations with human rights defenders, it became clear how pressing 
</p>
<p>the issue of the follow-up of cases actually is. Few of the human rights defenders know 
</p>
<p>whether a file that they have sent to a mandate holder has been received and what use has 
</p>
<p>been made of the communication. While preserving the necessary confidentiality of 
</p>
<p>information received and the use made of it, the Special Rapporteur considers that, at the 
</p>
<p>very least, a formal acknowledgement of receipt should be made to any person, 
</p>
<p>organization or network that has sent a communication or referred a case for action by the 
</p>
<p>mandate holder, in accordance with the code of conduct and confidentiality that the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur observes with governments. 
</p>
<p>87. The current procedure is to send an automatic acknowledgement of receipt in 
</p>
<p>response to a communication, without, however, stating what use will be made of that 
</p>
<p>communication. The Special Rapporteur considers that this is not sufficient and he intends 
</p>
<p>to look into how the communications system can be improved so as to make it more 
</p>
<p>relevant and enable a faster and more appropriate response to be sent. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur believes that the pace of interventions should not be speeded 
</p>
<p>up, otherwise it might be forgotten that the Special Rapporteur and his team have acted in 
</p>
<p>hundreds of cases in the past, each one relating to an individual story that requires a specific 
</p>
<p>response; silence is the worst possible response. 
</p>
<p>89. Follow-up is important because, by drawing attention to cases that have had a 
</p>
<p>positive outcome, it shows the good practices that can be reproduced or duplicated in order 
</p>
<p>to increase the chances of obtaining positive results in a larger number of cases. Where 
</p>
<p>possible, the Special Rapporteur will include positive stories in his reports in order to show 
</p>
<p>the relevance or effectiveness of a good practice. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur intends to make the question of follow-up one of the major 
</p>
<p>features of his activities and will regularly provide the Council and the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>with detailed information on any failure to respond by regularly reporting on the follow-up 
</p>
<p>to communications. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur intends to conduct and publish a study specifically relating 
</p>
<p>to the follow-up to communications and on the impact that a failure by States to respond 
</p>
<p>has on the situation of human rights defenders. He will regularly remind States that fail in 
</p>
<p>this way of the number of cases to which they have not responded. 
</p>
<p>92. To a greater or lesser degree, all the stakeholders have a special responsibility to 
</p>
<p>follow up communications and cases, but particularly governments, because they are 
</p>
<p>responsible for preventing human rights violations, threats and attacks against human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and for taking action against impunity by prosecuting those responsible for 
</p>
<p>human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>93. The previous mandate holder showed the useful role that national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions can play in the follow-up to recommendations and the treatment of individual 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</b></p>
<p>cases (see document A/HRC/22/47). The Special Rapporteur intends to make accredited 
</p>
<p>national institutions privileged partners in following up recommendations in general but 
</p>
<p>also in specific cases, as required. 
</p>
<p>94. Follow-up to country visits will also be an important element of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s activities. He intends, where possible, to increase the number of short visits 
</p>
<p>that he makes in order to ask State authorities about follow-up to recommendations and 
</p>
<p>urgent appeals.  
</p>
<p>95. The procedure will be that discussion panels will be set up with the stakeholders of 
</p>
<p>the country concerned to address the situation in that country and identify the best way of 
</p>
<p>ensuring more effective follow-up to recommendations. When such a discussion panel is 
</p>
<p>arranged, the country authorities will be officially informed through their permanent 
</p>
<p>mission and the Special Rapporteur will request the government to hold bilateral 
</p>
<p>discussions, which will make it possible to gain a better understanding of the status of 
</p>
<p>implementation of recommendations.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur will take the opportunity to offer technical assistance, based 
</p>
<p>on best observed practices, in order to provide the government with the appropriate tools to 
</p>
<p>implement recommendations more effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Wider dissemination of good practices  
</b></p>
<p>97. The effective protection of human rights defenders and the follow-up of specific 
</p>
<p>cases will be one of the main features of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities, whether 
</p>
<p>through communications or urgent appeals, country visits or short follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p>98. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur is well aware of the link between 
</p>
<p>protection activities and promotion activities. He has been struck, during regional 
</p>
<p>consultations, by the extraordinary vitality of human rights defenders, specialized NGOs 
</p>
<p>and networks of defenders, who, over the 16 years since the adoption of the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Defenders, have been able to develop and improve the mechanisms of 
</p>
<p>protection, international solidarity and rapid reaction in the face of threats and attacks by, 
</p>
<p>for example, using state-of-the-art technologies and social networks.  
</p>
<p>99. Some States and groups of countries have developed their own tools, guidelines, 
</p>
<p>national legislation and visa or relocation mechanisms to prevent violations of the rights of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders more effectively and to protect those who need protection.  
</p>
<p>100. Seminars, round tables, forums and other forms of consultation have been organized 
</p>
<p>on every continent to train human rights defenders, to teach them protection techniques and 
</p>
<p>to protect their means of communication against surveillance risks. Such meetings provide 
</p>
<p>an opportunity for exchanges of good practice and the Special Rapporteur will, where 
</p>
<p>possible, respond positively to invitations made to him to participate in such meetings.  
</p>
<p>101. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur intends to join others in drafting a guide to good 
</p>
<p>practices and to put every effort into the dissemination of good practices, which, when they 
</p>
<p>are widely disseminated, so as to reach even the most isolated human rights defenders, can 
</p>
<p>have a multiplier effect in protecting and promoting the right to defend human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Greater visibility for the issue of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>102. During the first regional consultations, the human rights defenders expressed the 
</p>
<p>importance of visibility for their situation and their role. They said they wished to see 
</p>
<p>greater prominence given to positive stories about their work, their successes, the problems </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.14-25280 
</p>
<p>they face, the means of protection, national good practices, the effectiveness of protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and thematic analyses and any other elements required to develop their 
</p>
<p>activities.  
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur is conscious of his responsibility to speak out loud and clear 
</p>
<p>in support of the rights of human rights defenders against those who challenge them and to 
</p>
<p>remind everyone that those who promote and defend human rights are ipso facto defenders, 
</p>
<p>even if they are not members of an organization.  
</p>
<p>104. While acting in accordance with the working rules of special procedures mandate 
</p>
<p>holders, the Special Rapporteur intends to make the visibility of his mandate and the work 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders a high priority, using all the means at his disposal. He intends to 
</p>
<p>step up his communication activities with a view to raising awareness in the mass media, 
</p>
<p>the social media and elsewhere of the importance of human rights defenders and their work.  
</p>
<p>105. He has started to publish a regular opinion column in various media and will do the 
</p>
<p>same in the national and international press, either on his own or jointly with other mandate 
</p>
<p>holders or regional mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>106. He wishes to use the same communication techniques to enhance his interaction 
</p>
<p>with human rights defenders and to consider how best they can communicate more directly 
</p>
<p>with him.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Action against reprisals 
</b></p>
<p>107. At his meetings with human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur has constantly 
</p>
<p>heard reports of reprisals against those who have spoken to the United Nations, made 
</p>
<p>statements, sent documents or messages, or cooperated with it. Reprisals or the threat of 
</p>
<p>reprisals can take very sophisticated forms and States themselves have become aware of the 
</p>
<p>power of reprisals to muzzle human rights defenders or prevent them from speaking out. 
</p>
<p>108. According to statements that he heard at his first consultations in Geneva and at 
</p>
<p>regional consultations, such attacks may take a variety of forms: personal threats or threats 
</p>
<p>against members of defenders&#8217; families, smear campaigns, death threats, physical attacks, 
</p>
<p>kidnapping, judicial harassment, murder and other forms of police harassment or 
</p>
<p>intimidation. 
</p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur has been struck by the number and the gravity of the threats 
</p>
<p>directed at human rights defenders who make direct contact with regional or international 
</p>
<p>organizations devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights in order to inform 
</p>
<p>them of a situation or to report human rights abuses or violations. 
</p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteur has noted with concern the report of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>on cooperation with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights (A/HRC/27/38), which is an annual report on reprisals against individuals or 
</p>
<p>groups of individuals who have cooperated with the United Nations in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the special procedures. This document is important for its symbolic value, 
</p>
<p>even though it discusses only a small number of cases.  
</p>
<p>111. The question of reprisals was addressed a number of times at the annual meeting of 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders. Special rapporteurs gave first-hand accounts of 
</p>
<p>reprisals against human rights defenders with whom they had worked during their visits or 
</p>
<p>who had been dissuaded by the police from meeting them. The Special Rapporteur raised 
</p>
<p>this question with the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the meeting and he wishes 
</p>
<p>here to express publicly his recognition of the fact that the High Commissioner has referred 
</p>
<p>directly in his public statements in a number of countries to cases of human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>who have been threatened.  </p>


<p>GE.14-25280 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>112. At the same meeting, the question of reprisals was raised by the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>in a dialogue with the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, whom he informed 
</p>
<p>of the failure by some resident coordinators to show their commitment to human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders or to support requests for protection from some witnesses. The special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders emphasized the role of resident coordinators in this connection, including 
</p>
<p>the need that, as senior representatives of the United Nations on the ground, they should 
</p>
<p>support special procedures mandate holders dealing with cases of reprisals against persons 
</p>
<p>with whom they had been in contact and should conduct the necessary follow-up when the 
</p>
<p>mandate holders have left the country.5 
</p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur recalls the joint statement made on 15 March 2012 by the 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs on human rights defenders of the United Nations, the African Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on 
</p>
<p>reprisals against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate with the United Nations, the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Commission 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights. He welcomes the determined attitude adopted by the President of the 
</p>
<p>Council in calling on all States to combat such reprisals. 
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur recalls that, in their joint statement on the occasion of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Day 2013, the special procedures mandate holders expressed their profound 
</p>
<p>concern regarding reprisals against persons who cooperated with them. Calling for a firm 
</p>
<p>response to such reprisals, they said that they supported the designation of a United Nations 
</p>
<p>focal point on the issue and looked forward to such a designation as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of the joint statement by 
</p>
<p>Botswana and a group of 47 States in March 2014 at the twenty-fifth session of the Council, 
</p>
<p>which refer to the call by the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights for organizational coherence and a systematic approach by the United Nations to 
</p>
<p>protect civil society actors and organizations better.  
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur is very mindful of this issue and wishes to help raise the 
</p>
<p>awareness of the international community, particularly as regards the role that the United 
</p>
<p>Nations should play in dealing with the issue and getting States to face up to their 
</p>
<p>responsibility.  
</p>
<p>117. He wishes to note the need to move to greater oversight and action to ensure respect 
</p>
<p>for the standard-setting agreements and rules of procedure of the United Nations, the 
</p>
<p>African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Inter-American Commission 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights, which explicitly prohibit reprisals by State and non-State players.  
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur intends to engage in specific work in the area of reprisals, 
</p>
<p>on the basis that any person who cooperates with the United Nations or international 
</p>
<p>organizations, or who reports abuse or human rights violations, may be considered a 
</p>
<p>defender, in view of his or her activities to protect rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Special Rapporteur confirms his intention to devote a large part of his time 
</b></p>
<p><b>and energy to carrying out his work, with a view to serving the cause in which he 
</b></p>
<p><b>believes.

</p>
<p>120. <b>While observing the working rules applying to special procedures mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders, the Special Rapporteur intends to interpret his mandate as widely as possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to make it as effective as possible, basing his approach on the results obtained 
</b></p>
<p><b>by his predecessor and on the knowledge acquired and the working methods used. He 
</b></p>
<p><b>means to explore new avenues and innovative working techniques, where that seems 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, and to inform the Council of his activities on a regular basis. 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>This first report to the Council constitutes a road map for the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur to establish a way forward for the activities that he has begun to 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertake. The first regional consultations have given him a clear vision of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>manner in which he will carry out the task entrusted to him by the Council. 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the extension of his mandate and will bear in 
</b></p>
<p><b>mind the preamble and recommendations of resolution 25/18, which he sees as 
</b></p>
<p><b>constituting the focus of his work in the future. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>He intends to publish, at the end of his first three years in the mandate, an 
</b></p>
<p><b>assessment of the implementation of his vision and his priorities, together with 
</b></p>
<p><b>information on the difficulties and obstacles encountered, and to share this assessment

<p><b>national framework properly supported by the appropriate legislative and regulatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>texts, taking into account regional and national specificities, and remove the obstacles 
</b></p>
<p><b>that some national laws may place in the path of legitimate activities to promote and

</b></p>
<p><b>them with more effective protection; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Combat impunity for threats and violations aimed at human rights
