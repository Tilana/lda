<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventh session from 8 
to 19 February 2010.  The review of Kazakhstan was held at the 9th meeting, on 12 
February 2010. The delegation of Kazakhstan was headed the Deputy Prime Minster, 
Yerbol Orynbayev. At its 13th meeting, held on 16 February 2010, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kazakhstan: Bangladesh, Cuba and 
Mauritius. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Kazakhstan:

paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.<footnote name="6">3. As noted by the delegation, the Human Rights Ombudsman had functions that were 
in keeping with the majority of the Paris Principles, including, inter alia, requesting 
information from Government bodies and officials, visiting State agencies and places of 
detention and initiating fact-finding with regard to human rights violations. Receiving 
complaints against the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office concerning human rights violations was not 
prohibited. The Government planned to initiate draft legislation before Parliament to 
strengthen the institution.

Prime Minister expressed the assurance that the Government would not rest until all 
vestiges of torture had been fully and totally eliminated. Kazakhstan had adopted an action 
plan to eradicate torture. The country has drafted a law providing for the establishment of 
an independent national mechanism for the prevention of torture and, in December 2009, 
adopted a law providing for a generally more humane penal system and for greater privacy 
and security for convicts. Parliament is considering another draft bill that clarifies the 
grounds and the procedure for arrest and detention, and public surveillance will be 
permitted at pre-trial detention facilities in order to monitor detention conditions and the 
treatment of detainees.

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the 9th meeting, on 12 February 2010, the Deputy Prime Minister noted, during 
his presentation of the national report, that the universal periodic review provides an 
effective interactive platform for exchanging views and sharing experiences in the area of 
human rights protection.  
</p>
<p>7. Since the early days of its independence, Kazakhstan has recognized the centrality of 
its people and of human rights and freedoms. It has made steady progress in the transition 
from a country with a command economy controlled by a totalitarian political system to a 
modern State with an open market economy and a liberal political system. Structural 
reforms, including the privatization of State property, land and housing, ensured robust 
economic growth over the past 10 years, which in turn contributed to a fourfold decline in 
the number of people with incomes below the poverty line, from 50 to 12 per cent.  
</p>
<p>8. Economic growth, poverty reduction and policy reforms have increased the well-
being of citizens in many respects, including the enjoyment of the right to affordable 
housing, increased life expectancy, 100 per cent enrolment in secondary schools, a modern 
pension system and social assistance for families living below the poverty line.  Kazakhstan </p>


<p>allocates more than 50 per cent of its annual State budget to education, health and social 
welfare. Social and political changes have been enshrined in the Constitution, adopted 
through a nationwide referendum, which recognizes and guarantees human rights and 
freedoms.  
</p>
<p>9. Kazakhstan has 10 political parties and has enhanced civil society as represented by 
non-governmental organizations. There are more than 15,000 registered non-governmental 
organizations, and Kazakhstan annually commissions them to provide social services worth 
more than $13 million. There are more than 8,000 registered media outlets, representing a 
wide range of views, and more than 85 per cent of them are non-State entities.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation noted that inter-ethnic and interfaith harmony is considered to be one 
of Kazakhstan&#8217;s greatest achievements, and that representatives of more than 140 ethnic 
groups and 45 religious denominations coexist peacefully in the country. The development 
of Kazakhstan&#8217;s model of multi-ethnic society has been promoted through the 
establishment of the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan. Newspapers and magazines are 
published in 11 languages, radio programmes are broadcast in 8 languages and television 
programmes are broadcast in 7 languages.  
</p>
<p>11. All people have the right to a fair and transparent judicial system. Kazakhstan has 
had a jury trial system for criminal cases since 2007, and it has established specialized 
courts such as administrative, economic, military and juvenile courts to improve the 
efficiency of judicial proceedings. Juvenile courts carry out their functions in Almaty and 
Astana, and they will soon be established in all regions. As a result of the recent changes 
made to legislation, only a court can authorize an arrest.  
</p>
<p>12. Kazakhstan has become party to most multilateral and international human rights 
treaties. Kazakhstan has imposed an indefinite moratorium on the use of the death penalty, 
and it is moving towards its full abolition. Kazakhstan has established an Office of the 
Human Rights Ombudsman, which has extensive powers, as a central element of its 
institutional protection system. A Commission on Human Rights, under the President, 
works to support the head of State as a guarantor of rights and freedoms. With a view to the 
further enhancement of human rights protection mechanisms, the National Human Rights 
Action Plan for 2009-2012 is in the process of being implemented.  
</p>

<p>15. Women constitute only 14 per cent of Parliament and only 10.<footnote name="3">8. Bahrain welcomed the adoption of the National Human Rights Action Plan and the 
conceptual framework for legal policies for the coming decade. Bahrain commended 
Kazakhstan for promoting the right to education by ensuring compulsory and free primary </footnote> per cent of the total 
number of Government officials in decision-making positions.  Kazakhstan is committed to 
attaining the objective of at least 30 per cent representation by women in all elected and 
appointed positions by 2016. The Government&#8217;s microcredit programmes have been aimed 
specifically at women.  Women currently constitute 40 per cent of all owners of small and 
medium-size businesses.  
</p>
<p>16. Kazakhstan adopted the Law on the Prevention of Domestic Violence in December 
2009, and there are 20 anti-crisis centres throughout the country.  Kazakhstan has taken 
intensive educational measures to combat hidden discrimination against women. In 2009, 
those measures reduced the number of domestic crimes by 8 per cent in comparison with 
2008. 
</p>
<p>17. As Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, Kazakhstan will place human rights issues at the top of its priorities. The 
delegation noted that the President had expressed his full commitment to the goal of 
achieving international status and stature for Kazakhstan, not just in economic terms, but 
also in social terms.  Kazakhstan has launched its new development plan for 2020, which 
places human development at the centre of its efforts. 
</p>
<p>18. In conclusion, the Deputy Prime Minster expressed appreciation for the constructive 
discussion during the interactive dialogue, as well as the assurance that the Government 
would  accord due consideration to all recommendations made by States.  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the independence of the judiciary and prosecutorial power, the 
delegation noted that judges of the Supreme Court were elected by the Senate, that they 
enjoyed legal immunity and that the Constitution identified the principle of the financing of 
the judiciary. Steps were being taken to limit prosecutorial authority, and thus arrests 
related to criminal investigations had been authorized by the courts since August 2008.  
</p>
<p>20. Concerning the registration of the &#8220;Alga&#8221; party, the delegation noted that it had been 
suspended because the application had been signed by 111 people under the age of 18, 206 
non-citizens, 11 deceased persons and 12 non-residents. In February 2009, Kazakhstan 
adopted amendments to the law on political parties, extending the time limit for the 
submission of applications and reducing the number of members required for registration.  
</p>
<p>21. With respect to the registration of religious organizations, the delegation explained 
that a religious community should consist of at least 10 adult citizens and should present 
statutory documents for registration, and that the Civil Code prohibited refusal of 
registration on grounds not specified in the law. In 2005, Kazakhstan further simplified the 
registration of small religious groups.  
</p>
<p>22. Regarding the protection of children with HIV/AIDS against stigmatization, it was 
noted that Kazakhstan, in cooperation with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, had 
established small networks involving health workers and psychologists to conduct training 
for families, teachers and nurses. The Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control 
organized training courses for the parents of HIV-infected children in order to enhance their 
knowledge and skills with regard to the issue. A total of $400,000 was allocated for those 
initiatives in 2009.  
</p>

<p>orphanages and foster families. Those measures helped to reduce the number of children 
without parental care from 16,008 in 2008 to 15,116 in 2009. Kazakhstan provides 
language training for refugee children.  
</p>
<p>24. Kazakhstan has established social centres for the prevention of child labour and 
exploitation in the Almaty and southern Kazakhstan regions. At the national level, a special 
department for the implementation of children&#8217;s legislation has been established within the 
Office of the Prosecutor General, and specialized prosecutors work at the regional level. 
Juvenile police departments are functioning in Astana and Almaty, and a network of 
specialized barristers for juvenile cases has been established in five cities. 
</p>
<p>25. With respect to libel, the delegation stated that Kazakhstan did not agree that there 
was a need to decriminalize libel at this stage, because legal means such as the Criminal 
Code were the most efficient mechanism for preventing libel, as well as for punishing 
violations of individuals&#8217; right to dignity, which was guaranteed by the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>26. While the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly, certain limitations are 
imposed when the objective of a gathering is recognized to be the incitement of racial, 
social or religious hatred or intolerance or an attempt to overthrow the constitutional order, 
or when a meeting might threaten public order and security.  In practice, nearly 380 
assemblies were organized in 2009, and 230 of them were held without notifying the 
authorities. In 2009, administrative liability was applied against only 88 participants in 
gatherings. The delegation noted that unjustified refusals to permit assembly still take 
place. The National Human Rights Action Plan for 2009-2012 calls for the adoption of a 
new law to replace the requirement for prior authorization by authorities with notification in 
order to organize a gathering. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>27. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 54 delegations. Additional 
statements by 18 delegations, which could not be delivered during the dialogue owing to

provision of special social services. Venezuela made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>37. Yemen welcomed the constitutional amendments promoting the role of Parliament 
and political parties as well as local authorities. Yemen also commended Kazakhstan&#8217;s

audio and video equipment during interviews. The 2009 Law on the Internet was not aimed 
at regulating the Internet, but prohibited information inciting violence, political, national or 
religious extremism, as well as pornography. During the seven months of its 
implementation, no court case against a website had been launched and no administrative 
closure of an Internet site had been documented.
