<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food conducted a country visit to Nicaragua 
from 6 to 12 September 2009. The visit, which was carried out at the invitation of the 
Government, aimed to assess obstacles to the realization of the right to food in Nicaragua 
and to identify recommendations that could contribute to removing such obstacles in the 
future. 
</p>
<p>2. During his visit to Nicaragua, the Special Rapporteur met with a wide range of 
dignitaries from all branches of Government. Interlocutors included representatives from 
various parts of the executive, notably the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, Cattle Ranching and Forestry (MAGFOR), the 
Nicaraguan State Enterprise for Staple Foods (ENABAS), Ministry of Health, Ministry of 
Education (MINED), Ministry of the Family and the Ministry of Development, Industry 
and Commerce (MIFIC). In addition, the Special Rapporteur had meetings with members 
of the National Assembly and the Forum of Presidents of Legislative Branches in Central 
America and the Caribbean (FOPREL), as well as with representatives from the Supreme 
Court of Justice, the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Superior Council of 
Private Enterprise (COSEP), and a wide range of civil society representatives, such as those 
from the Agriculture and Forestry Round Table, the Interest Group on Food Sovereignty, 
Security and Nutrition (GISSAN), the Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights (CENIDH), 
and organizations representing indigenous peoples and afro descendants. The Special 
Rapporteur also had exchanges with members of the international community in Nicaragua, 
including various donor Governments and the United Nations Country Team. 
</p>
<p>3. As part of the visit the Special Rapporteur also conducted several field trips. These 
included rural areas around Managua, as well as the provinces of Esteli and Matagalpa. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the authorities for the 
quality of their cooperation, and for the frankness of the discussions he was able to have 
during his visit. In particular, the Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs for the excellent organization of the visit. Throughout his visit, the Special 
Rapporteur also benefited from the support of the United Nations Country Team, including 
in particular the Office of the Resident Coordinator and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). He would like to record his appreciation to 
these institutions. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report provides an account of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings and 
recommendations emanating from the visit. Following an overview of relevant international 
standards used by the Special Rapporteur as a framework for analysis, the report briefly 
describes the situation of hunger and malnutrition in Nicaragua, followed by an assessment 
of a number of key issues from a right to food perspective. The report concludes with a set 
of recommendations geared towards further action for the full realization of the right to 
food in Nicaragua. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to food as a framework for analysis 
</b></p>
<p>6. The assessment conducted by the Special Rapporteur during the visit was grounded 
in the human right to adequate food as recognized in several international human rights 
instruments, including inter alia the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11103 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to adequate food imposes three levels of obligations on States.1 The 
obligation to <i>respect</i> existing access to adequate food requires States parties not to take any 
measures that result in preventing such access. The obligation to <i>protect </i>requires measures 
by the State to ensure that enterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their 
access to adequate food. The obligation to <i>fulfil (facilitate)</i> means that States must 
proactively engage in activities intended to strengthen people&#8217;s access to and utilization of 
resources and means to ensure their livelihood, including food security. Finally, whenever 
an individual or group is unable to enjoy the right to adequate food by the means at their 
disposal, States have the obligation to <i>fulfil (provide)</i> that right directly. 
8. In addition to these obligations, the general principle of non-discrimination requires 
that special attention is paid to particularly vulnerable groups, which suffer from hunger 
and malnutrition as a result of marginalization and exploitation. In addition, States are 
obliged to use the maximum of their available resources, to achieve the progressive 
realization of the right to food. This report is guided by these obligations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of hunger and malnutrition in the country 
</b>9. Nicaragua with its 5.6 million inhabitants is a low-income country, characterized by 
chronic poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. According to a poverty assessment 
published by the World Bank on the basis of data covering the period between 1998 and 
2005, 46 per cent of Nicaraguans lived in poverty in 2005, with a peak of 68 per cent in 
rural areas and a lower figure of 29 per cent of urban dwellers living in poverty.2 While 
overall poverty levels remained fairly stable between 1998 and 2005, extreme poverty 
dropped from 17 to 15 per cent, the gap between the consumption level of the poor and the 
poverty line (i.e. the poverty gap) went down from 4.8 to 3.4 per cent, and inequality as 
measured by the Gini coefficient declined from 0.45 to 0.40. 
</p>
<p>10. In line with this relatively positive downward trend, the same World Bank poverty 
assessment also concluded that &#8220;stunting declined steadily and significantly&#8221; between 1998 
and 2005.3 Decreasing from 27.4 per cent in 1998, this nevertheless meant that more than 
one in five children still suffered from growth retardation in Nicaragua, with a particularly 
high prevalence of stunting in the rural areas. The highest levels of stunting were found in 
the Central region, with a prevalence of stunting of 19.1 per cent in the urban areas and 
32.2 per cent in the rural areas. In the Atlantic Region, the total prevalence of stunting was 
24.5 per cent. In the urban areas of Managua, the incidence of stunting was 17.5 per cent.4 
The assessment concluded that it would &#8220;take Nicaragua 22 years to eliminate stunting as a 
public nutrition problem&#8221;.5 
</p>
<p>11. These figures suggest a strong link between stunting and poverty as the Central 
region and other areas most affected by stunting are home to many of the poorest 
municipalities. At the same time malnutrition was still unacceptably high among non-poor 
households, where, on average, 14.6 per cent of children showed delays in growth. 
Maternal education was another important determinant of stunting, as children of mothers 
with no education at all were 1.5 times more likely to be stunted than children whose 
mothers had primary or secondary education. Ethnicity also showed a slight association

</p>
<p>with stunting, as children of indigenous families were approximately 20 per cent more 
likely to be stunted than non-indigenous children. 
</p>
<p>12. At the time of the visit, these figures still appeared valid. In this regard, FAO has 
reported that economic access to food has diminished in Nicaragua in the context of the 
2006&#8211;2008 food crisis and the ongoing economic crisis. Higher prices registered in 2008 
included those for rice with a 29 per cent increase in real terms compared to 2007, while the 
impact of the global food crisis on the price of maize and tortilla was limited. Lower 
incomes also affected access to food with 19,000 layoffs reported in the maquila sector in 
early 2009 and reduced employment opportunities in construction, agriculture, mining and 
export-oriented factories. Remittances are also expected to go down from 13 per cent of 
GPD in 2008 to 12 per cent in 2009.6  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The obligation to respect the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur was generally impressed by the level of commitment of the 
Government to the realization of the right to food. A large number of measures have been 
taken since the current administration took office in order to improve the situation of the 
poorest segments of the population, and to combat in particular child nutrition and extreme 
poverty amongst the indigenous population. A non-exhaustive overview of these measures 
will be presented and discussed below under the obligation to fulfil the right to food. 
</p>
<p>14. Before turning to these measures, however, this section will first review relevant 
issues falling under the obligation to respect the right to food. As part of this obligation, 
Nicaragua must abstain from taking any measure that could result in depriving people of 
access to their existing means of producing food. In particular, this means that people 
should not be evicted from the land they depend on for their livelihoods, unless certain 
conditions are complied with; and trade agreements entered into by the State should not 
affect the existing enjoyment of the right to adequate food.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that forced evictions of peasant communities in 
different parts of the country continue to take place. In most cases, such evictions are 
executed with the use of State or private security violence. Examples of such cases have 
been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur during the visit. 
</p>
<p>16. While the Special Rapporteur could not verify all the allegations received in this 
regard, the cases he was informed about often result from multiple titles being granted on 
the same piece of land, and are indicative of increasing conflict over land as a result of 
agrarian reform in the 1980s and redistribution of land following the 1990 Peace 
Agreements. Evictions resulting from this situation that have been brought to the attention 
of the Special Rapporteur were located in Managua but also in other parts of the country, 
for instance, in the departments of Matagalpa and Chinandega. Protection against such 
evictions should be improved, as detailed in the recommendations presented at the end of 
this report.

</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11103 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The impact of trade agreements 
</b></p>
<p>17. In 2005, Nicaragua&#8217;s National Assembly approved the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). The agreement entails 
gradual tariff reductions for American imports and increases of quotas of entry for 
Nicaraguan export products. It entered into force in 2006. 
</p>
<p>18. Information on the impact of the agreement on issues of relevance to the enjoyment 
of the right to adequate food in Nicaragua is relatively scarce and generally limited to 
international organizations, civil society and scholarly sources. Ex-ante assessments 
generally predicted a very limited impact on the Nicaraguan economy as tariff levels were 
already fairly low prior to the agreement.7 While an increase in exports was foreseen, this 
was not expected to translate into significantly higher levels of domestic production and 
employment, while changes in income distribution and poverty were likewise considered 
marginal.8 Other analyses stressed the vulnerability of domestic basic grain producers to 
competition from cheaper agricultural imports from the United States of America. Given 
the relatively high tariffs in place for basic grains before DR-CAFTA and the low export 
orientation of this sector, the additional inflow of United States agricultural products 
expected following the entry into force of the agreement raised concerns as to the potential 
downward effect of these cheaper grains on prices and hence farmer income.9  
</p>
<p>19. At the time of the visit, these assessments reflected the overall trends registered after 
the entry into force of DR-CAFTA. Total exports to the United States have steadily 
increased from US$ 1.2 billion in 2005 to US$ 1.7 billion in 2008, an overall increase of 40 
per cent.10 The trade balance remains positive,11 as the level of imports from the United 
States stood at US$ 1.1 billion in 2008. However, imports from the United States have 
increased at a faster rate than Nicaraguan exports, rising from US$ 625 million in 2005, an 
increase of approximately 76 per cent over the three years.12 
</p>
<p>20. DR-CAFTA does not appear to have had any positive impact on employment. The 
job losses in the <i>maquila</i> sector referred to above are attributable to a range of factors, 
including the impact of the global economic crisis. They nevertheless confirm a negative 
trend already reported by civil society organizations in 2007, with jobs created as a result of 
the opening of new <i>maquilas</i> offset by the closure of other factories, resulting in a net loss 
of jobs.13

<p>21. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, market access for a broad range of small and 
medium producers, in particular in the agricultural sector, will remain limited without 
adequate technical assistance, access to credit and infrastructure. This also includes support 
in obtaining relevant licenses and passing inspections in order to be able to export. Such 
support is all the more important given the rate of growth of imports from the United States 
and the potential risk of domestic producers being priced out by these cheaper products. 
The Special Rapporteur was told during the visit, for instance, that rice producers have been 
faced with dumping of imported rice.  
</p>
<p>22. Against this background, the Special Rapporteur noted that there still is no 
government mechanism in place to evaluate the current and future impacts of DR-CAFTA 
on the enjoyment of the right to food. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government 
to conduct such an impact assessment on a regular basis, in particular in light of the 
recently adopted Law No. 693 on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty (<i>Ley de 
Soberan&#237;a y Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional</i>), published on 16 July 2009, which 
specifically calls for the creation of an inclusive and just market that favours national self-
sufficiency and respect for cultural diversity in relation to food. Such an assessment should 
also be conducted in relation to the proposed association agreement between Central 
America and the European Union (EU), which is currently under negotiation. 
23. In the framework of the negotiation of an association agreement between the EU and 
Central America, the Government of Nicaragua proposed the creation of a common 
economic and financial credit fund for Central America, with the purpose of rebalancing 
the asymmetries between the EU and Central America and of ensuring that the Central 
American countries can effectively reap the benefits from new trade opportunities. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the creation by the parties of a biregional working group to 
study the creation of a finance mechanism.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The obligation to protect the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>24. The obligation to protect the right to food requires Nicaragua to ensure appropriate 
protection against violations of labour rights and other abuses by private businesses, 
including transnational corporations. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur notes that the minimum wage is set at a low level of 75 
c&#243;rdobas per day. While this minimum is generally complied with, the level is below the 
price of the basic food basket, which is estimated at 398 c&#243;rdobas daily. The gap between 
the minimum wage and the requirements of the basic food basket is greater in the 
agricultural sector. The average monthly salary in agriculture, forestry and fisheries was 
2,063 c&#243;rdobas in January 2009, as compared to 8,829 c&#243;rdobas in the mining sector, 4,225 
c&#243;rdobas in the manufacturing sector, or 6,791 c&#243;rdobas in the trade sector.14 While 
acknowledging that this calculation of the agricultural wage does not comprise certain 
additional goods and services provided by the employer, including food and basic housing, 
such a salary only covers 16.05 per cent of the basic food basket. This is clearly inadequate. 
In accordance with the 2008 Law on the Minimum Wage (<i>Ley de salario m&#237;nimo</i>), the 
minimum wage should be raised gradually, and be revised on a regular basis in order to 
reflect the evolution of the price index for basis commodities. 
</p>
<p>26. In the area of labour rights, the capacity to enforce the Labour Code appears limited. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that there are only 105 labour inspectors to cover the

<p>formal sector, in which 520,000 workers are registered. The informal sector, which is 
estimated to absorb 63 per cent of the total number of workers, falls outside of any control 
system. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to adopt 
measures to encourage companies to get formal status, and to increase the number of labour 
inspectors.  
</p>
<p>27. Child labour still occurs in rural areas. The Special Rapporteur takes note of a law 
passed in 2007 prohibiting employment of children below the age of 16. In addition, 
relevant government initiatives in this area include the programme <i>Mi Primer Empleo</i>, 
which offers training and professional education for children between the ages of 12 and 
16. 
</p>
<p>28. As for the right to unionize, the Government has promoted the registration of new 
trade unions and more than 100 have registered in the past year. While some collective 
agreements exist in the area of sugar, peanuts and coffee, concerns remain with regard to 
payment of wages and social security benefits. The establishment of a national tripartite 
council to encourage dialogue between Government, employers, and workers&#8217; unions in 
September 2008, as supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO), is a 
welcome development in this regard. The Special Rapporteur will also follow with interest 
the discussions surrounding the proposal for a law on subcontracting of labour (<i>Projecto de 
ley reguladora de tercerizaci&#243;n y subcontractaci&#243;n</i>). This is particularly relevant in the 
agricultural sector, since the outsourcing of recruitment could weaken the compliance of 
employers with requirements regarding working hours or the payment of benefits. 
</p>
<p>29. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met with workers affected by the use of the 
pesticide Nemagon in the region of Chinandega. Until 1986, these workers were exposed to 
pesticides which, in most countries, were already prohibited at the time, and which are now 
prohibited under the 2001 Special Law for the Processing of Legal Actions Filed by People 
Affected by the Use of Pesticides Made from DBCP.15 The use of pesticides reportedly 
caused severe damage to the health of the workers concerned, and led to the contamination 
of soils and water in the area concerned. The companies responsible have since dissolved 
the joint venture (Standard Fruit Company) which employed the workers concerned. 
Lawsuits have been filed both in Nicaragua and in the United States against the companies 
concerned. The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite court decisions in favour of the 
plaintiffs, these companies have not paid any compensation to the victims.16 This case 
illustrates the need to ensure strict control of foreign companies operating within the 
country, consistent with the obligation of the State to protect human rights under its 
jurisdiction, since if violations do take place, post hoc remedies will be particularly difficult 
for the victims to have access to, given the need to ensure the collaboration of foreign 
jurisdictions to have any decisions enforced.

<p><b> VI. The obligation to fulfil the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>30. The obligation to fulfil the right to food includes the facilitation of efforts to 
strengthen people&#8217;s access to and utilization of resources and means to ensure their 
livelihood. Nicaragua has designed a framework law on the right to food and adopted a 
national strategy for the realization of the right to food. Fulfilment of the right to food also

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-11103 
</p>
<p>involves the effective implementation of a rural development plan and agrarian reform, and 
the establishment of recourse mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Framework law 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Law on Food and Nutrition 
Security and Sovereignty. Consistent with article 63 of the Constitution, the law clarifies 
the obligation of the Government to guarantee the right to adequate food and is an 
important step towards the realization of the right to food. 
</p>
<p>32. One of the main features of the new law is the creation of a national system for food 
and nutritional security and sovereignty (SINASSAN) to ensure coordination across 
different ministries and between national, regional, departmental and municipal levels of 
government. The proposed system, to be composed of public and private institutions, as 
well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and peasant organizations, will consist of 
a National Commission on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty (CONASSAN), 
chaired by the President and responsible for coordination and decision-making at the 
national level; an executive secretariat (SESSAN) to support the work of the national 
commission; a technical committee (COTESSAN) to elaborate strategies for approval by 
CONASSAN to coordinate, monitor and evaluate implementation; regional commissions in 
the Autonomous Regions of the Northern and Southern Atlantic (CORESSAN); 
departmental commissions (CODESSAN); and municipal commissions (COMUSSAN). 
</p><p>33. The adoption of a framework law, such as the Law on Food and Nutrition Security 
and Sovereignty, should ensure that the programmes which are established in order to 
promote food and nutrition security become more sustainable and permanent, and that the 
accountability of the Government is improved. Crucially, it should contribute to existing 
programmes being more transparent and participatory, as well as better coordinated, if they 
are placed under the framework of this law. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is 
encouraged by the fact that the law is the result of a long and extensive consultation 
process, and is supported by both civil society organizations and the private sector. It is his 
hope that CONASSAN, which will include one representative from civil society, will allow 
for effective participation and have real political weight. The Special Rapporteur also 
welcomes the reinforcement of inter-ministerial coordination, as opposed to the previous 
fragmented institutional framework governing policies addressing food insecurity. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that the law provides for the design, implementation 
and evaluation of a unified information system on food and nutrition security. This should 
help to address fragmentation in the area of food insecurity and vulnerability diagnosis, 
given the multitude of indicators used until now in the context of various mapping 
exercises, such as the poverty mapping conducted by the National Development 
Information Institute (<i>Instituto Nacional de Informaci&#243;n de Desarrollo</i>, INIDE), the school 
mapping carried out by MINED, and others by the Ministry of Health, MAGFOR and 
MIFIC. The Special Rapporteur recommends that a unified system of indicators, targets and 
benchmarks be developed to monitor compliance with the State obligation to progressively 
realize the right to food. 
</p>
<p>35. The Law on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty stipulates that adequate 
financial resources have to be allocated for the implementation of the national system in the 
State budget. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to heed this requirement, as 
public sector expenditure has until now been insufficient to properly address poverty and 
ensure food security for the population. Moreover, the State budget is reliant on external </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11103 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>sources, in the form of official development assistance and loans, which accounted for 22 
per cent of expenditure in 2009.17 The Special Rapporteur notes that fiscal reform is being 
considered in the National Assembly in order to increase government revenue, mainly by 
instituting an income tax on productive activities and income from capital. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Strategic plan 
</b></p>
<p>36. In May 2009, the Government announced the Policy for Food and Nutritional 
Security and Sovereignty (<i>Pol&#237;tica Sectorial de Seguridad y Soberan&#237;a Alimentaria y 
Nutricional</i>). The objective of this policy, which is part of the National Human 
Development Plan (2008&#8211;2012), is to provide adequate services to small, medium and large 
producers, at all stages of the agrofood chain, in order to stimulate the production of food 
and increase productivity, while guaranteeing sustainable use of natural resources and 
prioritizing basic food stuffs. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this comprehensive strategy to fight hunger and 
malnutrition. The policy incorporates the different dimensions of food security: availability 
of food, through reinforcement of the national productive capacity; access to food, through 
social and economic inclusion, provision of food at low prices and food aid; utilization of 
food, through the development of capacities to acquire, prepare and distribute food in the 
family; and food quality and safety. Within the framework of the policy, small and medium 
producers, and women in particular, are seen as key actors in making the rural sector more 
dynamic. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Social, rural development and other relevant programmes 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Policy for Food and Nutritional Security and Sovereignty is implemented 
through a wide range of social programmes. In the view of the Special Rapporteur such 
programmes should be progressively implemented within the framework of the new Law 
on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty and redefined following a deliberation 
within CONASSAN. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. <i>Hambre Cero</i> 
</b></p>
<p>39. Between 2002 and 2006, Nicaragua implemented a conditional cash transfer 
programme (<i>Red de protecci&#243;n social</i>), which directed funds to female heads of household 
linked to children&#8217;s school attendance, medical check-ups at local health centres and 
mothers&#8217; participation in educational sessions. An evaluation of the first phase of the 
programme showed positive results, significantly increasing school enrolment and other 
education indicators, and reducing stunting by 5 percentage points in treatment 
communities. The programme was nevertheless discontinued by the current administration 
and there has been no other sustained cash transfer programme in the country since. 
</p>
<p>40. Instead, Nicaragua&#8217;s current flagship programme to address hunger and malnutrition 
is the Zero Hunger Programme (<i>Hambre Cero</i>), which was launched in 2007,18<b> </b>providing a 
so-called productive voucher (<i>bono productivo</i>) to rural women heading households with at 
least one <i>manzana </i>of land (approximately 0.7 ha). The programme is funded by the Inter-
American Development Bank, which is disbursing US$ 20 million over a period of 5 years,

</p>
<p>with an amortization period of 40 years. It is also supported by the International Fund for 
Agricultural Development through its Technical Assistance Fund. 
</p>
<p>41. The voucher is worth between US$ 1,500 and 2,000 and grants a cow, a pregnant 
sow, chickens, building materials, fruit and forest plants, seeds and inputs. Animals are 
given as capital instead of cash, so as to address the perceived lack of animal protein in 
food consumption. The programme specifically targets women, as they are seen as better 
able to manage resources and because they have traditionally maintained agricultural 
production, while men invested in other activities. 
</p>
<p>42. The voucher is conditional upon a commitment from the beneficiaries not to sell the 
animals provided. Beneficiaries are also required to contribute 20 per cent of the value of 
the voucher to a revolving fund and to join with others in the creation of small cooperatives. 
The objective is to reach 75,000 households in the country by 2012, providing food for the 
direct beneficiaries of the programme and producing a surplus to sell in local communities 
and municipalities. The programme is also expected to have a positive impact on the 
capacity of rural people to negotiate wages in the agricultural sector, whilst the purchase of 
animals by the Government also benefits medium and large producers, hence reinforcing 
the private sector. In addition, raising animals holds the potential of meat production for 
export. The long-term objective is to diversify production and to increase the export of 
meat, milk and beans to other parts of the Central and Latin American region. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited a number of communities in different regions of the 
country, including Timal, Matagalpa and Estel&#237;, where he witnessed first hand the impact of 
the programme. This programme moves away from a purely charity-based approach 
towards incentivizing innovation and entrepreneurship. Supply constraints were 
considerable during the first year of implementation with only 2,000 pigs available for sale 
and 30,000 needed. Following successive evaluations, the programme has been revised and 
improved: for example, a new component of the programme, the so-called small garden 
voucher (<i>bono econom&#237;a de patio</i>), has been launched for people who have only a small 
garden. The gradual approach of <i>Hambre Cero</i> to improving the availability of and access 
to food at the family level and at the same time promoting the creation of cooperatives to 
facilitate market access is appropriate. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that the 
provision of extension services and accompanying measures would be important to 
complement the provisions of the voucher. The distribution of productive vouchers should 
therefore go hand in hand with strengthening the capacity of the MAGFOR technical 
personnel. In addition, the transparency and accountability of the programme could be 
improved, as detailed further below. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other social and rural development programmes 
</b></p>
<p>44. Other important initiatives include the microcredit <i>Usura Cero</i> programme. As part 
of this programme, women in urban areas have access to loans at preferential interest rates 
to create and run a business. The provision of such loans is conditional upon the formation 
of solidarity groups, in which each member acts as a guarantor to the others. In total, 
86,826 women, forming 13,021 solidarity groups, have been granted such microcredits 
since the programme was launched in August 2007, according to information provided by 
MIFIC. 
</p>
<p>45. A number of programmes have been launched in schools. These include the School 
Feeding Programme (<i>Programa Integral de Nutrici&#243;n Escolar</i>, PINE), implemented by the 
Ministry of Education, which targets kindergartens and primary schools in food insecure </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11103 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>regions,19 the programme for the provision of a glass of milk to school children,20 and the 
development of vegetable gardens or orchards in approximately a quarter of the schools in 
the country. 
</p>
<p>46. The National Plan for the Eradication of Chronic Child Malnutrition (<i>Plan Nacional 
&#8220;Hacia la erradicaci&#243;n de la desnutrici&#243;n cr&#243;nica infantil&#8221;</i>, HEDCI) for the period 2008&#8211;
2015 integrates interventions by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Family, 
Adolescence and Childhood, and MAGFOR. Relevant programmes under this heading 
include the Community Health Programme (<i>Programa Comunitario de Salud</i>, 
PROCOSAN), the National Micronutrients Programme (<i>Programa Nacional de 
Micronutrientes</i>) and the National Breastfeeding Programme (<i>Programa Nacional de 
Lactancia Materna</i>). The Ministry of Health also works to address the adverse impact of 
bad eating habits, resulting in increased chronic diseases among young people, in particular 
by regulating advertisements targeting children, and by promoting breastfeeding. The 
adoption of regulations implementing the 1981 law on breastfeeding would be an important 
further step in this direction. 
</p>
<p>47. In the area of rural development, the Sectoral Programme for Inclusive and 
Productive Rural Development (<i>Programa Sectorial de Desarollo Rural Productivo 
Incluyente, PRORURAL Incluyente</i>) stands out. PRORURAL was initially formulated by 
the previous Government to cover the period between 2005 and 2009 and later redesigned 
by the present administration. Based on the new PRORURAL Incluyente, three national 
programmes have been elaborated, which deal with food, agro-industry and forestry. The 
National Food Programme (<i>Programa Nacional de Alimentos</i>, PNA) seeks to increase the 
production of basic grains, dairy and meat. The National Programme for Rural Agro-
Industry (<i>Programa Nacional de Agroindustria Rural</i>, PNAIR) seeks to develop new rural 
enterprises and agrofood chains, through the provision of training, post-harvest activities, 
and investment in food processing. The National Forestry Programme (<i>Programa Nacional 
Forestal</i>, PNF) seeks to combat deforestation, increase employment in the forestry sector 
and develop forestry exports.21<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Seed programmes 
</b></p>
<p>48. Efforts to increase national production in basic grains rely on the distribution of 
certified seeds and fertilizers, generally in the form of partially reimbursable loans. The 
seeds are developed by the Nicaraguan Institute for Agricultural Technology (<i>Instituto 
Nicarag&#252;ense de Tecnolog&#237;a Agropecuaria,</i> INTA) and distributed through the Agro-food 
Seeds Programme (<i>Programa agroalimentaria de semillas</i>), which constitutes an extension 
of the Pound for Pound Programme (<i>Programa Libra por Libra</i>) put in place by the 
previous Government. In addition, the Certified Seeds Programme (<i>Programa de semilla 
certificada</i>) includes the distribution of certified seeds (in the form of a loan with a low 
interest rate) to small and medium producers of basic foods, together with herbicides and 
fertilizers. 
</p>
<p>49. While appreciating the important efforts made in this area, the Special Rapporteur 
takes note of concerns that the fertilizers and seed packages distributed under the various 
programmes create dependency, without there being a clear exit strategy. In addition, since 
certain local varieties of seeds may be better suited to specific agro-ecological 
environments, the Government could consider buying the seeds that are distributed through

<p>public programmes from native seed banks at the community level, which have been 
created by peasant organizations, notably within the <i>Campesino a campesino</i> Programme. 
Municipal governments could usefully promote the creation of such seed banks, while a 
national strategy for the production of native seeds, including a list of available native 
seeds, could also be designed. The approval of new laws on biosafety (<i>Ley de 
Bioseguridad</i>) and biodiversity (<i>Ley de Biodiversidad</i>), which are currently under 
discussion, would also be a significant step forwards in ensuring environmental protection 
and the conservation of genetic resources. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Food reserves 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the strengthening of the storage capacities of the 
Nicaraguan State Enterprise for Staple Foods (<i>Empresa Nicarag&#252;ense de Alimentos 
B&#225;sicos</i>, ENABAS). ENABAS is a State-owned company, which buys basic grains at 
remunerative prices from producers and sells these grains at prices that are affordable for 
the poorest segments of the population. ENABAS played an important stabilizing role in 
the 1980s, before being dismantled in the 1990s. Since 2006, the company has slowly been 
reactivated and old storage facilities have been repaired and improved. 
</p>
<p>51. In all countries, the volatility of prices for agricultural commodities is a disincentive 
to produce, and net food-buying households, including small producers who lack storage 
facilities, are severely affected by price changes between the harvest season and the lean 
season. Therefore, the role of a company such as ENABAS, insofar as its interventions on 
the market could improve the prices paid to the producers and reduce the prices paid by 
consumers, is in principle welcome. For example, in 2008, ENABAS sold rice at 20 per 
cent below market prices, beans at 15 per cent below market prices and oil at 12 per cent 
below market prices through the Food for the People Programme (<i>Alimentos para el 
Pueblo</i>). The objective was to sell 2.1 million quintals of basic products. 
52. The food purchased by ENABAS is also included in so-called &#8220;institutional 
packages&#8221; distributed among State employees and workers employed in free trade zones. In 
2008, more than 10,000 such packages were provided and there are plans to scale this up in 
the future. 
</p>
<p>53. In 2009, the objective of ENABAS was to collect and store 1.872 million quintals of 
basic grains and to establish contracts with 100 producer organizations, with a particular 
focus on small- and medium-sized producers, from whom at least 40 per cent of the total 
amount of basic grains was to be purchased.22<b> </b>The basic grains are sold in some 3,800 
selling points (<i>expendios</i>) established throughout the territory, a number that should 
increase in the future to reach 5,000. ENABAS also provides agro-industrial services, such 
as cleaning, drying, storage and fumigation, to private companies for payment. The 
objective for 2009 was to develop the capacity to process 4 million quintals of grain. The 
Special Rapporteur would encourage the further development of such services. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur notes with great interest the important results already 
achieved by ENABAS since its re-establishment in 2006. He is, nevertheless, concerned 
that its market interventions may lack effectiveness in the absence of additional liquidity 
and storage capacity. Also, the lack of coordination at the regional level, in the framework 
of the Integration System of Central America (SICA), is a limiting factor. For such 
interventions to be fully effective, they should be part of a regional common agricultural 
policy. The Special Rapporteur would encourage an initiative by FOPREL in this regard,

<p>which could be combined with the mutualization of food reserves established at national 
level in the different countries concerned, in order to ensure a more coordinated approach to 
emergency situations. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur also calls upon the Government to assess the poverty-
reducing impact of the sales of grain through the current system of selling points. In the 
view of the Special Rapporteur, the effectiveness of ENABAS as a mechanism for 
increased food security could be maximized if combined with an effort to reach out to the 
poorest households. The impact of the distribution of basic grains at subsidized prices could 
be improved if a voucher system were put in place, prioritizing the poorest households in 
accessing such benefits. A clear definition of the beneficiaries, based on an objective 
assessment of needs, combined with the provision of adequate information, would also 
constitute a check against the risk of the diversion of resources for politically motivated or 
other reasons, or the reselling of subsidized foods on the black market.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Overall assessment 
</b></p>
<p>56. The programmes developed to achieve food security and food sovereignty in the 
country, particularly those placed under the <i>Hambre Cero</i> strategy, have attracted criticism 
from some interlocutors. The most important source of concern is that the identification of 
the beneficiaries takes place at the local level, with an important role assigned to the 
Councils for Citizen Power (<i>Consejos de poder ciudanano</i>). This creates a risk of political 
clientelism and of potential beneficiaries being excluded as a result of their political 
affiliation. The Special Rapporteur insists on the need to ensure the integration of human 
rights principles of non-discrimination, transparency, participation and accountability in the 
design and implementation of relevant support schemes such as <i>Hambre Cero</i>, as detailed 
in the recommendations below. 
</p>
<p>57. The voucher schemes and other components of the <i>Hambre Cero</i> strategy for the 
most part comply with these principles. It is needs-based, insofar as the mapping of needs 
across the country is based on the 2001 National Agricultural Census (<i>Censo nacional 
agropecuario</i>), and insofar as the targeting of the poorest households, as identified at 
community level, has improved since the inception of the programme. It is participatory 
insofar as it is implemented at community level and requires beneficiaries to form networks 
of 50 households at a minimum in order to be eligible. There have been broad information 
campaigns and presentations in communities about the programme. 
</p>
<p>58. Yet, the concerns about political clientelism are real, and the principles of 
decentralization and participation that characterize the programme increase that risk. It is 
therefore important that the conditions which beneficiaries must comply with are clearly 
defined in legislation. Complaints mechanisms should also be established, allowing 
households who are unjustly denied benefits to have the decision reviewed. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to improve transparency in the implementation of 
the <i>Hambre Cero</i> programmes, in order to increase the level of trust in their implementation 
and in order to make them as inclusive as possible. This would strengthen a strategy that 
deserves to be made sustainable over time and scaled up.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Agrarian reform 
</b></p>
<p>59. Access to land remains an important issue in Nicaragua, with conflicts over land 
multiplying as a result of its past history. An agrarian reform was carried out in the 1980s, 
after the adoption in 1981 of a Law on Agrarian Reform (<i>Ley de Reforma Agraria</i>) which 
targeted large estates and idle land for distribution to peasants, cooperatives, producers 
&#8220;guaranteeing its efficient use&#8221; and so-called &#8220;agrarian reform enterprises&#8221;. Priority was 
given in this reform to the combatants of the &#8220;War of Liberation&#8221;. The main flaw of this </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-11103 
</p>
<p>reform was the lack of systematic titling, which the Government tried to address by passing 
Law No. 88 on the Protection of Agrarian Property (<i>Ley de Protecci&#243;n a la Propiedad 
Agraria</i>) in 1990. 
60. Agrarian reform was later enshrined in chapter II of the 1987 Constitution, where it 
is described as a &#8220;fundamental instrument for the democratization of property and the fair 
distribution of land&#8221;. The Constitution further stipulates the elimination of idle land, 
guarantees for the property of efficient producers, the promotion of agricultural 
cooperatives and the participation of producers, including peasants and small and medium 
producers, in agrarian policymaking. 
</p>
<p>61. Following the Peace Agreements of 1990, plots of land were distributed to some 
140,000 former members of the regular army or of the armed opposition groups who were 
demobilized. In addition, legislation was adopted to recognize and legitimize property 
rights acquired during the land reform of the 1980s, to establish compensation procedures 
and to redistribute land held by the State. Among the laws adopted were the <i>Ley de 
Estabilidad de la Propiedad</i> and the <i>Ley sobre Propiedad Reformada Urbana y Agraria</i>. 
Various government agencies have since been in charge of assigning property titles. In 
1991, under President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the Law on the Nicaraguan Institute of 
Agrarian Reform (<i>Ley Org&#225;nica del Instituto Nicarag&#252;ense de Reforma Agraria</i>) was 
passed, creating a government agency in charge of directing and implementing agrarian 
reform and rural development policies, which would also undertake a revision of the 1981 
Law on Agrarian Reform. 
</p>
<p>62. In 2003, the Land Administration Project (<i>Proyecto de Ordenamiento de la 
Propiedad</i>, PRODEP) was launched with the stated purpose of fostering agrarian reform by 
regularizing land rights and supporting peri-urban land titling. With financing from the 
World Bank, PRODEP is an inter-institutional effort executed mainly by the <i>Intendencia de 
la Propiedad</i>, an agency within the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit; the Supreme 
Court of Justice through its Public Registry of Real Estate and the Directorate for 
Alternative Conflict Resolution (DIRAC); the Ministry of the Environment and Natural 
Resources; MAGFOR; the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER); municipal 
authorities; and NGOs. Under PRODEP, 1,500 km2 have recently been registered, with a 
total of 22 per cent of the territory now recorded and 40,000 titles granted across the 
country. PRODEP, in principle, is scheduled to cease its activities on 30 April 2010. 
</p>
<p>63. Despite this considerable progress, various concerns remain. For example, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that it is not uncommon for titles to the same plot of land 
to be granted to a range of different people. Furthermore, in the absence of adequate access 
to credit, landless agricultural labourers find it difficult to acquire land of their own, and as 
they lease the land they cultivate for terms which can be as short as one harvest cycle, this 
discourages investment in the land and is a disincentive for responsible management of the 
soil, including the planting of nitrogen-fixing trees. In addition, the result of past processes 
is that women have been discriminated against in access to land, since land redistribution 
has disproportionately benefited men. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur therefore makes three recommendations that should go 
beyond existing Presidential Decree No. 70-2006 establishing a general framework for land 
policies.23 First, the implementation of the titling programme should be accelerated in order 
to limit the risk of more conflicts over land in the future. In the process of implementation, 
priority should be given in access to land to those who use the land as a productive 
resource, and the process should not lead to any eviction that does not comply with the

 <i>Official Gazette</i>, 8 November 2006. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5

<p>GE.10-11103 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>principles laid out in general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights on the right to adequate housing (art. 11 (1) of the Covenant): forced 
evictions , and with the Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions 
and Displacement presented in 2007 by the previous Special Rapporteur on the right to 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living.24 
</p>
<p>65. Second, in order to avoid the risk of a market-led land reform leading to more 
concentration of land in the hands of large landowners with a capacity to price smallholders 
out of the market, it is vital that titling goes hand in hand with improvements to the 
production capacities of smallholders, something to which improved access to credit could 
significantly contribute. The establishment of a bank to support production (<i>Banco de 
Fomento de la Producci&#243;n</i>, PRODUZCAMOS) is therefore welcome. This bank will 
strengthen and broaden the range of financial services to the rural sector already provided 
by the Rural Development Fund, and should be adequately equipped to provide loans to 
farmers. 
</p>
<p>66. Third, access to land of women should be strengthened. Around 22 per cent of the 
Nicaraguan population consists of rural women. Although the economic and productive 
activity of rural women represents an important pillar of the country&#8217;s economy, they face 
serious limitations when it comes to accessing resources such as land, water, credit, health, 
education, and extension services. In addition, 65 per cent of rural women do not own the 
land that they till.25 The initiative for creating a special fund for the acquisition of land by 
productive rural women, promoted by a member of the National Assembly, Alba Palacios, 
is welcome and deserves wide discussion.26 
</p>
<p><b> E. Recourse mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>67. Nicaragua&#8217;s legislation provides a foundation for the justiciability of the right to 
food. In the Constitution, article 46 explicitly stipulates the respect for and the promotion 
and protection of human rights, as set forth in key international and regional human rights 
instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
More specifically, article 63 establishes the right of Nicaraguans to be protected against 
hunger, and the responsibility of the State to ensure the availability and fair distribution of 
food. 
</p>
<p>68. The recently adopted Law on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty further 
strengthens the legal protection of the right to food. Article 35 of the law contemplates an 
administrative appeal available to those who believe their rights have been infringed. 
Furthermore, the law calls upon the Office of the Ombudsman (<i>Procuradur&#237;a para la 
Defensa de los Derechos Humanos</i>) to designate a special ombudsman to monitor the 
functioning of the national system for food and nutritional sovereignty and to include 
information on the progressive realization of the right to food in an annual report to the 
National Assembly. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the increased role for the 
Ombudsman in monitoring the status of realization of the right to food. Adequate resources 
will be important to ensure the effective implementation of this new role. In this regard, the 
Special Rapporteur expresses concern at information received during the visit that the 
special ombudsman for indigenous peoples, having been appointed, has until now not 
received any resources with which to function, thus limiting the responsiveness of the 
Office of the Ombudsman to the plight of indigenous peoples.

<p><b> F. Food aid 
</b></p>
<p>69. The World Food Programme (WFP) has been present in Nicaragua since 1971 and 
for the 2008&#8211;2010 period has the yearly target of distributing 21,045 metric tons of food aid 
reaching 225,000 beneficiaries. The WFP Nicaragua country programme has three 
components: (a) support for improving the nutrition and health of children and pregnant and 
lactating women; (b) supporting access to education; and (c) enhancing livelihood activities 
to improve household food security. The second component entails primarily food support 
for preschools and primary schools. It accounts for 78 per cent of the expected country-
wide beneficiaries and 84 per cent of total direct operational costs borne by the WFP in its 
country programme. 
</p>
<p>70. The country programme is implemented in partnership with the Government, other 
United Nations agencies, international donors and civil society. Additionally, WFP 
guidelines seek to maximize local food procurement, with the target of purchasing 50 per 
cent of maize and pulses locally, as well as supporting farmers&#8217; cooperatives and small 
traders.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Disaster preparedness and management 
</b></p>
<p>71. Nicaragua is exposed to natural disasters that seriously affect food security, 
including hurricanes, flooding, landslides, earthquakes and volcanic activity. Natural 
disasters are particularly destabilizing for the Autonomous Regions of the North and South 
Atlantic as they suffer from high food insecurity. 
</p>
<p>72. The National System for Disaster Prevention, Mitigation and Relief (SINAPRED) is 
the structure coordinating government action to reduce disaster risks and to protect the 
population and its property. SINAPRED works through committees at the national, 
regional, departmental, municipal and local levels, while it is also linked institutionally to 
the Coordination Centre for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America 
(CEPREDENAC). Through CEPREDENAC, Nicaragua is currently implementing the 
Regional Programme for the Reduction of Vulnerability and Environmental Degradation 
(PREVDA), funded by the European Union. 
</p><p>73. SINAPRED also administers the National Disaster Fund, with resources from the 
public budget and external contributions, both national and international. Additionally, the 
Law on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty provides for the creation of a National 
Emergency Fund for Food and Nutritional Sovereignty and Security (FONASSAN) to deal 
with emergency food situations caused by natural disasters, and economic or social crises. 
The fund is financed through the general budget, with the possibility of receiving external 
donations, and administered by the Ministry of Finance. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>74. Indigenous peoples and people of African descent constitute some of the main 
vulnerable groups in Nicaragua, which require special attention in accordance with the 
principle of non-discrimination. The issue of land is of particular importance to these 
categories, as they depend on land for their livelihoods, whilst land is also a core 
component of their cultural identity. Law No. 445 (<i>Ley de R&#233;gimen de Propriedad 
Comunal de los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas y Comunidades &#201;tnicas de la Costa Atl&#225;ntica de 
Nicaragua</i>), adopted in 2003, provided for the demarcation of nine indigenous territories, 
covering in total approximately 10,000 square kilometers. While the demarcation of 13 
additional territories is foreseen, the legislative framework should be improved in order for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-11103 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>such demarcation to benefit not only the Atlantic regions, but also the Pacific, north and 
central regions. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur believes that the process of adoption of the act relating to 
the indigenous peoples of the Pacific, central and northern regions of Nicaragua should be 
accelerated.27 This is all the more important given information received by the Special 
Rapporteur from representatives of indigenous peoples that their forms of self-government 
are not necessarily recognized by local mayors, and that their territorial integrity is not 
always respected. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that indigenous communities are 
particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as a result of a variety of extreme 
weather events and changes in rainfall and temperature. Rapid alert systems should be put 
in place, and support should be given to the indigenous communities to enable them to 
develop modes of agricultural production that are more resilient to weather-related events. 
</p>
<p>77. Finally, the Special Rapporteur regrets that, in general, indicators relating to socio-
economic development or food security are not disaggregated by ethnicity, so that assessing 
the situation of indigenous peoples or people of African descent in Nicaragua and devising 
appropriate policies to improve that situation is made more difficult. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. The role of the international community 
</b></p>
<p>78. The international community has an important role to play in supporting the efforts 
of Nicaragua in improving food security, particularly in agricultural and rural development. 
The Special Rapporteur was struck by the quality of the coordination among donors, in 
particular with the support of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, as well as by the 
quality of the dialogue between the donor community and the Government at sectoral level, 
through the organization of round tables in thematic areas linked to the Millennium 
Development Goals. Yet a series of events, including both the perceived politicization and 
lack of transparency in the implementation of social programmes, and doubts about the 
fairness of the municipal elections held in November 2008, have affected the trust between 
the Nicaraguan Government and the international donor community. 
</p>
<p>79. In turn, its dependency on foreign aid makes the Nicaraguan Government 
particularly suspicious of any perceived attempts at undermining the ownership of its 
national human development strategy, and it sees the imposition of conditionalities in any 
form as an instrumentalization of aid. The result is that the global round table between the 
Government and the international donor community has not been convened since March 
</p><p>2008. This is regrettable, and runs against the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness and of the Accra Agenda of Action.  
</p>
<p>80. Each side should take the steps needed to rebuild trust. The global round table 
should constitute a forum in which the Government could answer the concerns of the donor 
community, and work towards identifying with them how decentralization and the adoption 
of a participatory approach in government programmes could be reconciled with the 
legitimate concerns expressed by donors about transparency. This should be done with full 
respect for the principle of ownership, and donors should make the best efforts to ensure 
that their contribution is aligned with the national priorities as defined in the National 
Human Development Plan 2009, and to improve the predictability of the aid they provide 
and, hence, the ability of government agencies to plan development.

<p><b>20</b> GE.10-11103 
</p>
<p>81. The international community should accept that it has a responsibility not only to 
provide support to the efforts underway in Nicaragua to improve food security, but also to 
promote a form of development that is more inclusive and sustainable. This means, for 
example, not imposing conditions in trade agreements that further reduce the resources of 
the State, and may result in unfair competition for local producers; and not encouraging or 
supporting the development of agrofuels, which is currently occurring in conditions that are 
not sustainable. When assigning funds for rural development and the fight against food 
insecurity, care should be taken to ensure that the aid provided is channelled towards 
sustainable methods of agricultural production and is targeted towards the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur believes that the coordinated implementation of government 
policies aimed at improving food security under the framework of the 2009 Law on Food 
and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty, thus improving transparency, and the provision of 
remedies for households that are denied access to certain support schemes for which they 
qualify under the criteria set forth in legislation, would constitute an important step towards 
rebuilding trust on both sides.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its commitment to the 
realization of the right to food, which is demonstrated by the large number of 
measures taken to improve the situation of the poorest segments of the population, 
and in particular to combat child nutrition and extreme poverty amongst the 
indigenous population. On the basis of his mission and the information received both 
prior to the visit and as a result of his visit, he makes the following specific 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Protection against forced evictions should be improved, and the victims 
should have remedies against any eviction incompatible with the rule of law or 
international standards. Nicaragua should take measures which &#8220;provide the greatest 
possible security of tenure to occupiers of houses and land; conform to the 
[International] Covenant [on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]; and are designed 
to control strictly the circumstances under which evictions may be carried out&#8221;.28 
Prior to carrying out any evictions, all feasible alternatives should be explored in 
consultation with the affected persons, with a view to avoiding, or at least minimizing, 
the need to use force; legal remedies or procedures should be provided to those who 
are affected by eviction orders; and all the individuals concerned have a right to 
adequate compensation for any property, both personal and real, which is affected.29 
Any eviction not complying with these conditions should be considered a violation of 
the right to housing and, where it leads to depriving families from their means of 
producing food, it also is a violation of the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The Government should assess the impact of trade agreements on a 
regular basis, in particular in light of the recently adopted Law on Food and Nutrition 
Security and Sovereignty, in order to ensure that trade liberalization will not fragilize 
the most marginal farmers. Such an assessment should also be conducted in relation 
to the proposed association agreement between Central America and the European 
Union;

</b></p>
<p><b> (c) In order to ensure access to adequate food for waged workers, Nicaragua 
should increase the level of the minimum wage, in order to reflect the evolution of the 
price index for basic commodities. It should improve the capacity of the labour 
inspectorates to monitor compliance with the Labour Code and it should regulate 
subcontracting, in order to ensure that it will not result in fragilizing the rights of 
workers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Law on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty should be fully 
implemented, and the information system on food and nutrition security it provides 
for strengthened by the adoption of a unified system of indicators, targets and 
benchmarks to monitor compliance with the State obligation to progressively realize 
the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The effectiveness of the Nicaraguan State Enterprise for Staple Foods 
(ENABAS) in ensuring adequate and stable incomes to farmers and affordable staple 
foods to consumers would be improved by strengthening further its capacity, as the 
Government is already doing, and by seeking to reach out to the poorest households. 
In addition, the ability of ENABAS to limit the volatility of prices on the market 
would be improved by mutualizing its management of food stocks with those of the 
other countries of the region; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The programmes placed under the <i>Hambre Cero</i> strategy could be 
further improved by integrating the human rights principles of non-discrimination, 
transparency, participation and accountability. This implies not only developing 
mechanisms through which the beneficiaries can take part in the design, 
implementation and evaluation of the programme, as the system of food and nutrition 
security and sovereignty</b> <b>should allow, but also: (a) basing interventions on a reliable 
identification of needs; (b) identifying clearly the beneficiaries in legislation, to ensure 
that any individual or household left out may claim benefits under the schemes 
through appropriate complaints mechanisms; and (c) improving the provision of 
information to beneficiaries about their rights under the programmes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) In order to ensure security of tenure and improve access to land, the 
implementation of the titling programme should be accelerated in order to limit the 
risk of more conflicts over land in the future. Such titling should go hand in hand with 
improving the productive capacities of smallholders, in particular by providing them 
with access to credit on appropriate conditions. Women&#8217;s access to land should be 
prioritized, in accordance with article 14 paragraph 2 (g) of the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> The Office of the Ombudsman should be provided with the resources needed to 
effectively monitor the functioning of the national system for food and nutritional 
sovereignty and the progressive realization of the right to food, as provided in the Law 
on Food and Nutrition Security and Sovereignty. The special ombudsman for 
indigenous peoples should also be given the support required to adequately fulfil 
his/her functions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Nicaragua should accelerate the process of adoption of the act relating to 
the indigenous peoples of the Pacific, central and northern regions. It should also 
ratify ILO Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries, which recognizes the special relationship of these peoples with 
the lands or territories which they occupy or otherwise use, and in particular the 
collective aspects of this relationship (art. 13). Pending that ratification, as a minimum 
it should act in conformity with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories 
and resources, with due respect for the customs, traditions and land tenure systems of </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/33/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> GE.10-11103 
</p>
<p><b>the indigenous peoples concerned. It should also put in place a rapid alert system in 
order to protect indigenous peoples from the impacts of weather-related events, and 
support them in building the resilience of their food systems against climate change; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) No more than any other State can Nicaragua achieve the full realization 
of the right to food by its own means only. International assistance and cooperation 
are required. The Government should convene a new global round table with the 
donor community, and work with them towards identifying how decentralization and 
the adoption of a participatory approach in government programmes could be 
reconciled with the legitimate concerns expressed by the donor community about 
transparency. </b>
