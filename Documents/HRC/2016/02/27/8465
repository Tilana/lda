<p>5. Myanmar has little opportunity to present how it implements human rights from

human rights and the whole of Chapter VIII deals with fundamental rights and principles,

breach of human rights enshrined in this chapter are given through five Writs which can be 
found in the same Chapter.

implemented on 31 January 2011. The new Government will be formed during this session

expression, ethnic minorities&#8217; and detainees&#8217; rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. The delegation of Myanmar stated that, during their visits, Special Rapporteurs were 
allowed to go to the places they wanted to visit and meet the persons they requested to see. 
</p>
<p>87. The Myanmar Human Rights Body is still in its initial stages and its goal is to 
emerge eventually as National Human Rights Commission in line with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>88. Since 2006, the Government had issued a public notice in the press for complaints 
against human rights violations to the ministries concerned.  From January to August 2010, 
the Ministry of Home Affairs received 503 submissions and action had been taken on 199 
complaints, 203 complaints were under investigation and 101 complaints had been found to 
be false. 
</p>
<p>89. The delegation stated that the Government had strengthened its legislation and 
enhanced enforcement action. Some of the measures taken include the establishment of the 
Myanmar National Committee for Women&#8217;s Affairs in 1996; becoming a State Party to the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol in 2004 
and promulgation of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law in 2005. 
</p>
<p>90. Due to the economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar, over 160 garment factories 
had closed, 162 foreign companies had withdrawn and over 70,000 workers, mainly 
women, became jobless. Sanctions have become a major push factor in the trafficking 
arena. 
</p>
<p>91. Regarding the issue of child soldiers, the delegation stated that under the Myanmar 
Defense Services Act and War Office Council Instructions, the minimum age requirement 
to enlist in the armed forces is eighteen. Forced conscription in any form is strictly 
prohibited. A Child Soldier Prevention Committee was established in 2004, with the task of 
preventing recruitment of underage children.  
</p>
<p>92. Punitive actions are taken against military personnel who violate the military 
recruitment laws and regulations. A total of 440 underage recruits have been returned to 
their parents or guardians since 2002.  For the process of demobilization, rehabilitation and 
reintegration and on awareness-raising, the Government is working in close cooperation 
with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), INGOs and non-governmental 
organizations. In drafting a plan of action, the Government cooperates with the United 
Nations Country Team. 
</p>
<p>93. According to Special Rapporteur Mr. Quintana: &#8220;International partners have 
acknowledged the Government&#8217;s increased commitment to addressing the issue of 
recruitment of child soldiers.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>94. Rape is regarded by Myanmar people and Government as the most dastardly crime. 
Perpetrators are brought to justice and prosecuted and, on conviction, heavy sentences from 
7 to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment are imposed. The allegations of sexual violence against ethnic 
women and children are baseless and merely aimed at discrediting the Myanmar Armed 
Forces. 
</p>
<p>95. Internal insurgencies and terrorism have endangered national security and hampered 
the livelihood of the people. The Government has given priority to national reconsolidation 
through peaceful negotiations and eventually reached ceasefire agreements with 17 out of 
18 major ethnic armed groups and people are now enjoying unprecedented peace and 
development since regaining independence. It is important to note that the insurgent groups 
never represent any of the ethnic national races or people. </p>


<p>96. The insurgency is now confined to a few localities in the border areas. Counter-
insurgency activities are conducted only against those remnant insurgents. Military 
operations are carried out in accordance with the rules of engagement and strict instructions 
are also given to avoid civilian casualties. The Government is committed to investigate any 
allegations of human rights violations and takes action against any perpetrator in 
accordance with the law. 
</p>
<p>97. The delegation stated that the Constitution guarantees all citizens freedom of 
religion regardless of race, religion and sex.  Authorities routinely approve requests for 
religious gatherings and celebrations. Religious teachings are also permitted.   
</p>
<p>98. There is no closure of religious building in the country. Moreover, authorities allow 
renovation and construction of religious buildings.  
</p>
<p>99. The Land Acquisition Act protects Myanmar citizens from forced eviction or 
confiscation of land.  To sustain the livelihood and development of the local community in 
project site areas, the Government provides land for resettlement. The social infrastructures 
are developed by means of State budget allocations and project partners&#8217; contributions. 
</p>
<p>100. The delegation stated that the Government is committed to enhance the well-being 
and livelihood of its ethnic nationalities. Training of ethnic youth to be teachers, 
establishing the Ministry of Progress of Border Areas and National Races and Development 
Affairs and preservation of ethnic languages and literature are also undertaken by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>101. The allegation regarding the discrimination and harassment against the local 
population of Northern Rakhine State is contrary to the facts. Historically and culturally 
those people do not constitute any national race and are illegal immigrants residing along 
the border areas of Northern Rakhine State. Myanmar endeavours to solve this cross-border 
movement of people bilaterally and amicably with its neighbouring country and in 
cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR). Since 1992, over 230,000 returnees have been accepted by the Myanmar side 
under the voluntary repatriation programme.  The Government has issued about 700,000 
temporary registration cards to eligible people. The Government is also implementing 
development programmes in Northern Rakhine State. 
</p>
<p>102. The delegation stated that peace and stability, democracy and human rights are 
mutually interdependent. By rebuilding national unity with the return to the legal fold of 17 
former insurgent groups, the Government is able to bring about peace and stability to 
almost all corners of Myanmar.  With the new Constitution, concerning which the people of 
Myanmar have expressed their will through a referendum and successful holding of 
nationwide elections, a democratic era has been ushered in. This greatly enhances the 
enjoyment of human rights by the people of Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>103. The Delegation Leader&#8217;s conclusion is as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Some questions can only be answered when the new Government is formed 
by the Hluttaw. 
</p>
<p> (b) Myanmar laws are promulgated in accordance with the Basic Principles on 
the Independence of the Judiciary as laid down by the Seventh United Nations Congress on 
Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. An example is Judiciary Law section 2 and section 
19 of the Constitution. The judiciary is to hear both parties. The aggrieved party is always 
discontented. Thus, hearing only the aggrieved party amounts to a miscarriage of justice. 
Myanmar has an impartial and fair judiciary that hears both parties. An alleged crime 
should also be heard from both sides.  </p>


<p> (c) An independent investigation in international law requires the exhaustion of 
local remedies. The Ministry of Home Affairs exercises his function with the Minister for 
Home Affairs acting in his ministerial capacity. Complaints are submitted, dismissed or 
investigated as a continuous process. This has been commended by the Special Rapporteur 
in his report to the 65th General Assembly.  
</p>
<p> (d) Law review has been made by all ministries with a view to submission to the  
Hluttaw either to amend, repeal or promulgate new laws. They review whether existing 
laws are compatible with the Constitution and international norms. Redress is made through 
five writs in the Constitution. If a law is incompatible with the Constitution, the redress is 
made by the Constitutional Tribunal. 
</p>
<p> (e) ILO Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association has been ratified. A new 
domestic law compatible with this Convention is presently under drafting by the Labour 
Ministry with the cooperation of ILO. There is also cooperation between Myanmar and ILO 
on Convention No. 29 on Forced Labour. Myanmar has made dormant certain offending 
provisions on some laws. Through the Supplementary Understanding with ILO, Myanmar 
has created a complaint mechanism. The Supplementary Understanding has been extended 
three times.  
</p>
<p> (f) Ratification of the remaining core Human Rights Treaties is under study and 
consideration. After it has been studied, it will go through Hluttaw in accordance with 
parliamentary practice. Myanmar has the political will to observe human rights.  
</p>
<p> (g) There is no impunity in Myanmar. No one is above the law. The legal maxim 
<i>nemo est supra leges</i> is the accepted principle. Citizens, military and police personnel are 
not above the law and action will be taken against them when the law is breached. 
Trafficking is the outcome of sanctions in many cases. Foreign companies have withdrawn 
their investment, factories were closed down and 70,000 workers, mainly women, became 
jobless.  
</p>
<p> (h) Due to the positive developments including successful holding of elections, 
the ASEAN Ministers&#8217; Retreat on 16 January 2011 called for the lifting of sanctions on 
Myanmar. 
</p>
<p> (i) Myanmar has reached a new milestone, opened a new chapter and turned a 
new page with positive developments. Cannot the international community respond with 
encouragement, support and understanding?
