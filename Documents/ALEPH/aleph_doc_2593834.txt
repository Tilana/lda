EXPLANATORY STATEMENT
This Explanatory Statement accompanies and forms

in a placement to sophisticated and professional 
investors.
These shares were issued on 27 October 2015 on the

The funds raised by the placement were used to

commencement of that 12 month period.
The issue of the shares detailed in Resolution 1 did not 
exceed the 15% limit referred to above.
ASX Listing Rule 7.4 provides that where a company 
ratifies an issue of securities, the issue will be treated 
as having been made with approval for the purpose of 
ASX Listing Rule 7.1, thereby refreshing the company’s 
15% capacity and enabling it to issue further securities 
up to that limit.

of the allotment and issue of 100,000,000 shares 
to sophisticated and professional investors for the 
purpose of satisfying the requirements of ASX Listing 
Rule 7.4.

Resolution 3: Ratification of 70,000,000 shares 
previously issued
The Company has issued 70,000,000 fully paid 
ordinary shares at $0.0038 per fully paid ordinary 
share in a placement to sophisticated and professional 
investors.
These shares were issued on 13 April 2016 on the 
same terms and conditions as other existing ordinary 
shares in the Company.
The funds raised by the placement were used to 
progress the Spargoville and Narndee exploration 
programs and for working capital purposes.
Listing rule 7.1A permits eligible entities that have 
obtained shareholder approval by special resolution 
at an annual general meeting to issue an additional 
10% of the entity’s issued ordinary securities. The 
ability to issue securities under listing rule 7.1A is in 
addition to the Company’s ability to issue 15% of its 
issued capital without security holder approval in a 
12 month period, under Listing Rule 7.1. The Company 
obtained shareholder approval for the ability to issue 
an additional 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
shares at the last annual general meeting held on 
18 November 2015.
The issue of the shares detailed in Resolution 3 did not 
exceed the 10% limit referred to above.
ASX Listing Rule 7.4 provides that where a company 
ratifies an issue of securities, the issue will be treated 
as having been made with approval for the purpose of 
ASX Listing Rule 7.1, thereby refreshing the company’s 
15% capacity and enabling it to issue further securities 
up to that limit.

of the allotment and issue of 70,000,000 shares 
to sophisticated and professional investors for the 
purpose of satisfying the requirements of ASX Listing

be issued to Tychean Resources Limited
ASX Listing Rule 7.1 provides that, except in limited

required for any issue of securities if the securities 
will, when aggregated with the securities issued 
by the company during the previous 12 months, 
exceed 15% of the number of shares on issue at the 
commencement of that 12 month period.
In August 2015 the Company entered into a Sale 
and Farm-in Agreement with Tychean Resources to 
purchase 90% equity in the Spargoville tenements held 
by Tychean Resources in Western Australia. In February 
2016 the Company negotiated with Tychean Resources 
to acquire the remaining 10% of Tychean Resources’ 
interest in the Spargoville tenements and remove any 
gold royalty on future production. The consideration to 
acquire the remaining 10% and remove any gold royalty 
on future production was 25,000,000 fully paid ordinary 
shares in Maximus.
Resolution 4 proposes approval for the issue of shares 
set out below, for the purposes of satisfying Listing 
Rule 7.1.
In accordance with Listing Rule 7.3, the following 
information is provided in relation to Resolution 4.

Company’s existing ordinary shares on issue; and
ASX Listing Rule 14.9 requires the approval be given by 
an ordinary resolution of the Company.
•  allotment of the shares will occur no later than
3 months after this meeting.
The Directors recommend shareholders vote in favour 
of ratifying the placement made in April 2016.
The Directors (except Messrs Kennedy and Vickery, 
who abstain) recommend shareholders vote in favour 
of approval of the issue of 25,000,000 ordinary shares 
to Tychean Resources.

vote on the shareholder’s behalf. If the shareholder is 
entitled to cast two or more votes at the meeting, the

If a shareholder appoints two proxies, each proxy 
must be appointed to represent a specified proportion

specification, each proxy will need to exercise half the 
votes.
A proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company.
To appoint a proxy, a proxy form must be signed by 
the shareholder or the shareholder’s attorney duly 
authorised in writing. If the shareholder is a corporation, 
the proxy form must be signed in accordance with 
section 127 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). To

attorney, the authority under which it is signed or a

as the proxy. Where the Chairman is appointed as 
proxy by a shareholder entitled to cast a vote on a 
particular resolution and the proxy form specifies how 
the Chairman is to vote on the resolution, (that is, a
