<p> <i>Gravely concerned</i> by threats, harassment, violence, including gender-based 
violence, and attacks faced by many human rights defenders, reflected, inter alia, in the 
reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and other 
human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned also</i> that, in some instances, national security and counter-
terrorism legislation and other measures have been misused to target human rights 
defenders or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to 
international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the immediate need to put an end to and take concrete steps to prevent 
threats, harassment, violence, including gender-based violence, and attacks by States and 
non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms for all, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders (A/HRC/13/22) on the security and protection of 
human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> States to promote a safe and enabling environment in which human 
rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also urges</i> States to publicly acknowledge the important role of human rights 
defenders and the legitimacy of their work as an essential component of ensuring their 
protection; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Encourages </i>States to create and strengthen mechanisms for consultation and 
dialogue with human rights defenders, including through establishing a focal point for 
human rights defenders within the public administration where it does not exist, with the 
aim of, inter alia, identifying specific needs for protection, including those of women 
human rights defenders, and ensuring the participation of human rights defenders in the 
development and implementation of targeted protection measures; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> States to take timely and effective action to prevent and protect against 
attacks on and threats to persons engaged in promoting and defending human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and their relatives, including through the possibility of developing, 
in consultation with human rights defenders, an early warning system to facilitate broader 
awareness of imminent risks and to enable effective responses; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States not to discriminate against human rights defenders on any 
grounds, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, and to desist, in this context, from any 
discriminatory measures against them, including intimidation, profiling, confiscation of 
assets, suspension of activities and exclusion from national consultative processes;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fully support the role of human rights defenders in 
situations of armed conflict and to protect them in such situations; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the role of national human rights institutions as human rights 
defenders and protectors, and encourages States to strengthen the mandate and capacity of 
national human rights institutions, as necessary, to enable them to fulfil this role effectively 
and in accordance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure both coordination within national and local levels 
and that those involved in the protection of human rights defenders and their relatives are 
trained in human rights and the protection-related needs of human rights defenders at risk, 
including those promoting the rights of members of marginalized groups; </p>


<p>GE.10-12389 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p> 10. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to allocate sufficient resources for the effective 
implementation of necessary protection measures, including specific training for persons 
involved in their implementation; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges</i> States to investigate, in a prompt, effective, independent and 
accountable manner, complaints and allegations regarding threats or human rights 
violations perpetrated against human rights defenders or their relatives and to initiate, when 
appropriate, proceedings against the perpetrators so as to ensure that impunity for such acts 
is eliminated; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Encourages</i> relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, including at the 
country level, within their respective mandates and in cooperation with the country 
concerned, to support the development of appropriate strategies and responses for 
protecting human rights defenders.
