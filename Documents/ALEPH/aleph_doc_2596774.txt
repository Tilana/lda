Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company to be outstanding after giving effect to the sale of the
Shares are referred to herein as the “Stock.”  The 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock will be

The terms of the 8.0% Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock will be set forth in a certificate of designation
(the “Certificate of Designation”) to be filed by the Company with the Secretary of State of Delaware as an amendment
to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the
Shares, as follows:
1.                                      Registration Statement.  The Company has prepared and filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the
“Securities Act”), a registration statement
on Form S-3 (File No. 333-211568), including a prospectus, relating to the Shares.  Such registration statement, as
amended at the time it became effective, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or
430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness (“Rule 430
Information”), is referred to herein as the “Registration Statement”; and as used herein, the term “Preliminary
Prospectus” means the prospectus dated July 26, 2016 included in such registration statement that omits Rule 430
Information and the preliminary prospectus supplement filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act on August 18, 2016, and the term “Prospectus” means the prospectus in the form first used (or made
available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of
sales of the Shares. Any reference in this Underwriting Agreement (this “Agreement”) to the Registration Statement,
any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by
reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration
Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be and any reference to
“amend”, “amendment” or “supplement” with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the
“Exchange Act”) that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. The registration statement filed on
August 19, 2016 pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act is herein called the “Rule 462(b) Registration
Statement” and the term “Registration Statement” shall include the Rule 462(b) Registration Statement. Capitalized
terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.
At or prior to the time when sales of the Shares were first made (the “Applicable Time”), the Company had prepared
the following information (collectively with the pricing information set forth on Annex B, the “Pricing Disclosure
Package”):  a Preliminary Prospectus dated August 18, 2016 and each “free-writing prospectus” (as defined pursuant
to Rule 405 under the Securities Act), if any, listed on Annex B hereto.
2.                                      Purchase of the Shares by the Underwriters.
(a)                                 The Company agrees to issue and sell the Underwritten Shares to the several
Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and each Underwriter, on the basis of the
representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company the respective
number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter’s name in Schedule 1 hereto
at a price per share (the “Purchase Price”) of $48.00.
In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Option Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this
Agreement, and the Underwriters, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, shall have the option to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the
Company the Option Shares at the Purchase Price less an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions
declared by the Company and payable on the Underwritten Shares but not payable on the Option Shares.
If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be
the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased
as the number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto (or such
number increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares being
purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters,
2
subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares as the Representatives in their sole
discretion shall make.
The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase Option Shares at any time in whole, or from time to time in
part, on or before the thirtieth day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice from the Representatives to
the Company.  Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to which the option is being
exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same
date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date or later than
the tenth full business day (as hereinafter defined) after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are
postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof).  Any such notice shall be given at least two
business days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.
(b)                                 The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering
of the Shares as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the
Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Shares on the terms set forth in the
Prospectus.  The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell
Shares to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter and that any such affiliate may offer and sell
Shares purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.
(c)                                  Payment for the Shares shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the account specified by the Company to the Representatives in the case of the
Underwritten Shares, at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 98 San Jacinto Blvd., Suite 1500,
Austin, Texas 78701 at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on August 26, 2016, or at such other time
or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the
Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing or, in the case of the Option
Shares, on the date and at the time and place specified by the Representatives in the written
notice of the Underwriters’ election to purchase such Option Shares.  The time and date of such
payment for the Underwritten Shares is referred to herein as the “Closing Date,” and the time and
date for such payment for the Option Shares, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to
as the “Additional Closing Date.”
Payment for the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be,
shall be made against delivery to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the
Shares to be purchased on such date in definitive form registered in such names and in such denominations as the
Representatives shall request in writing not later than two full business days prior to the Closing Date or the Additional
Closing Date, as the case may be, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of such Shares duly
paid by the Company.  Delivery of the Shares shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company
unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.
(d)                                 The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely
in the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the
offering of Shares contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the
offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other
person.  Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the
Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment,  accounting or regulatory matters
in any jurisdiction.  The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters
and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to
the Company with respect thereto.  Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the
transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such
3
transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

the Company will furnish to the Representatives and counsel for the Underwriters a copy of the
proposed Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, amendment or supplement for review and will not
prepare, use, authorize, approve, refer to or file any such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or file

(x) the Closing Date and (y) the expiration of the Prospectus Delivery Period; (iv) of the issuance
by the Commission of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or

result of which the Prospectus, the Pricing Disclosure Package or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue statement of a material

for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order suspending the effectiveness

suspending any such qualification of the Shares and, if any such order is issued, will use its best efforts to obtain as
soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.
(e)                                  Pricing Disclosure Package.  If at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any event
shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Pricing Disclosure Package as then

Pricing Disclosure Package will comply with law

reasonably request and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for
distribution of the Shares; provided that the Company shall not be required to (i) qualify as a
foreign corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in any such jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be required to so qualify, (ii) file any general consent to service of process in
any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so
subject.

necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that the only such information furnished by

paragraphs of this Section 7, such person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the
person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing;
provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that
it may have under the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been
materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and
provided, further, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than the preceding paragraphs of
this Section 7.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified
Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the
consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the
Indemnified Person in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel
related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnified Person (other than reasonable costs of investigation) unless (i) the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary;
(ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interest
24
between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding
or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall
be paid or reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and
officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by such Underwriter and any such
separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control
persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable
for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be
a final judgment for the plaintiff providing for an indemnifiable loss hereunder, the Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment to
the extent provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have
requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as
contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by the Indemnifying
Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in
accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which
any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a
failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
(d)                                 Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above
is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities required to be indemnified thereby, then each Indemnifying Person under such
paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company and JEH LLC, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of
the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also
the relative fault of the Company and JEH LLC, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the
other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative
benefits received by the Company and JEH LLC, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the
other, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before
deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Shares and the total
underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in
each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering
price of the Shares.  The relative fault of the Company and JEH LLC, on the one hand, and the
Underwriters on the other, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company and JEH LLC or by the
Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e)                                  Limitation on Liability.  The Company, JEH LLC and the Underwriters agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to paragraph (d) above were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other
25
method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. 
The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or
other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the
offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant
to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
(f)                                   Non-Exclusive Remedies.  The remedies provided for in this Section 7
paragraphs (a) through (d) are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may
otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.
8.                                      Effectiveness of Agreement.  This Agreement shall become effective upon the
execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
9.                                      Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of
the Representatives, by notice to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the
Additional Closing Date (i) trading of the Conversion Shares generally shall have been
suspended or materially limited on or by any of the Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the
Nasdaq Stock Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
or the Chicago Board of Trade; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the
Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a
general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or
New York State authorities or a material disruption in securities settlement or clearance services
in the United States shall have occurred; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within
or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse
and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the
Shares on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus.
10.                               Defaulting Underwriter.
(a)                                 If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any
Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the Shares that it has agreed to purchase
hereunder on such date, the non-defaulting Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the
purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the terms contained in
this Agreement.  If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the non-defaulting
Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled
to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-
defaulting Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms.  If other persons become
obligated or agree to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the non-defaulting
Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as
the case may be, for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion
of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company
26
agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that
effects any such changes.  As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” includes, for all purposes of this
Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this
Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.
(b)                                 If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as
provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on
the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed one-
eleventh of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company
shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares
that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter’s pro
rata share (based on the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase on such
date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements
have not been made.
(c)                                  If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company as
provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on
the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, exceeds one-eleventh of
the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not
exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect to any
Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on the Additional
Closing Date shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.  Any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of
the Company, except that the Company will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as
set forth in Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not
terminate and shall remain in effect.
(d)                                 Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it
may have to the Company or any non-defaulting Underwriter for damages caused by its default.
11.                               Payment of Expenses.
(a)                                 Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Company and JEH LLC, jointly and severally,
will pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of their
obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization,
issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Shares and any taxes payable in that connection;
(ii) the costs incident to the preparation, printing and filing under the Securities Act of the
Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any
Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (including all exhibits, amendments and
supplements thereto) and the distribution thereof, and the filing of the Certificate of Designation
with the Secretary of State of Delaware; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing this
Agreement; (iv) the fees and expenses of the Company’s counsel and independent accountants;
(v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification of the
Shares under the state or foreign securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the
Representatives may reasonably designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a
Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Underwriters); (vi) the cost of preparing stock certificates; (vii) the costs and charges of any
transfer agent and any registrar; (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in connection
with any filing with, and clearance of the offering by, FINRA (including the related reasonable
fees and expenses of Underwriters’ counsel in an amount not to exceed $15,000); (ix) all
expenses and application fees incurred in connection with the approval of the Shares for
clearance, settlement and book-entry transfer
27
through DTC; (x) all costs and expenses of the officers and employees of the Company and JEH LLC and any other
expenses of the Company and JEH LLC relating to any investor “road show” presentations in connection with the
offering and sale of the Shares, including, without limitation, any travel expenses of the officers and employees of the
Company and JEH LLC and any other expenses of the Company and JEH LLC; and (xi) all expenses and application
fees related to the listing of the Conversion Shares, including any Conversion Shares issued and paid as a dividend
on the Shares, on the Exchange. It is understood, however, that except as provided in this Section and Sections 7
and 10 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel and
any advertising expenses connected with any offers they make.
(b)                                 If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9(ii), (ii) the Company for
any reason fails to tender the Shares for delivery to the Underwriters or (iii) the Underwriters
decline to purchase the Shares due to the Company or JEH LLC’s failure to fulfill the conditions
set forth in Section 6 hereof, the Company and JEH LLC, jointly and severally, agree to
reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in connection with this
Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.
12.                               Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the officers
and directors and any controlling persons referred to in Section 7 hereof.  Nothing in this
Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.  No
purchaser of Shares from any Underwriter shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason
of such purchase.
13.                               Survival.  The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations,
warranties and agreements of the Company, JEH LLC and the Underwriters contained in this
Agreement or made by or on behalf of the Company, JEH LLC or the Underwriters pursuant to
this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the delivery of and
payment for the Shares and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of
this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Company, JEH LLC or the
Underwriters.
14.                               Certain Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where
otherwise expressly provided, the term “affiliate” has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act; (b) the term “business day” means any day other than a day on which banks are
permitted or required to be closed in New York City; and (c) the term “subsidiary” has the
meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; and (d) the term “significant subsidiary”
has the meaning set forth in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act.
15.                               Miscellaneous.
(a)                                 Authority of the Representatives.  Any action by the Underwriters hereunder may
be taken by the Representatives on behalf of the Underwriters, and any such action taken by the
Representatives shall be binding upon the Underwriters.
(b)                                 Notices.  All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been duly given if mailed or transmitted and confirmed by any standard
form of telecommunication.  Notices to the Underwriters shall be given to the Representatives to

under or related to this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements made and to be performed in such state.
(e)                                  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in counterparts (which may

be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
(f)                                   Amendments or Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement, nor any consent or approval to any departure therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the parties hereto.

Annex A
Form of Opinion of Counsel for Jones Energy, Inc.
(a)                                 The Registration Statement has been declared effective under the Securities Act;
each of the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act in the manner and within the time period required by
Rule 424(b); and to the knowledge of such counsel no order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose or pursuant to
Section 8A of the Securities Act against the Company or in connection with the offering is
pending or threatened by the Commission.
(b)                                 The Company, JEH LLC and each of the subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 2 of
the Underwriting Agreement (the “Subsidiaries”) are validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, are duly qualified to do business and are
in good standing in each jurisdiction set forth opposite the name of such entity on Schedule 2 of
the Underwriting Agreement, and have all power and authority necessary to own or hold their
respective properties and to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged, as described in
the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(c)                                  The Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of
JEH LLC adopted on August [·], 2016 has been validly adopted and in full force and effect at all
times from August [·], 2016 through and including the date hereof

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
(e)                                  The Shares being delivered at the applicable Closing Date have been duly and
validly authorized and when issued and delivered against payment therefor as provided in the
Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
(f)                                   Except as described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure
Package and the Prospectus, there are no options, warrants, preemptive rights, rights of first
refusal or other similar rights to subscribe for or to purchase, any equity securities of the
Company, in each case pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended to date, the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended
to date, or any other any agreement or other instrument filed or incorporated by reference as an
exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Commission after the date of such Annual
Report or any applicable Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission after the date of
such Annual Report (the “Filed Agreements”).
(g)                                  As of the date hereof and without giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by the Underwriting Agreement, the Company owns 50.4% of the issued and outstanding JEH
LLC Units (or such additional amount to reflect the exercise of the Underwriters’ option to
purchase Option Shares pursuant to Section 2 of the Underwriting Agreement); the JEH LLC
Units have been duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and non-assessable (except
as such nonassessability may be affected by Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the Delaware LLC
Act, as applicable, and limited to the extent set forth in JEH LLC’s organizational documents).
A-1
(h)                                 Each of the Company and JEH LLC has all requisite corporate or limited liability
company power and authority to execute and deliver the Underwriting Agreement and to perform
its obligations thereunder; and all corporate or limited liability company action required to be
taken for the due and proper authorization, execution and delivery by the Company and JEH LLC
of the Underwriting Agreement and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
thereby has been validly taken.
(i)                                     The Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Company and JEH LLC.
(j)                                    None of (i) the execution, delivery and performance by the Company and JEH
LLC of the Underwriting Agreement, (ii) the issuance and sale by the Company of the Shares
being delivered on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, or
(iii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement
(A) constitutes or will constitute a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, any Filed Agreements, (B) constitutes or will constitute a violation of
the provisions of the bylaws, limited liability company agreement or other organizational
documents of the Company, JEH LLC or any of the Subsidiaries or (C) result in the violation of
the Delaware LP Act, the Delaware LLC Act, the Delaware General Corporation Law, the laws of
the State of Texas or the federal laws of the United States of America applicable to the Company,
JEH LLC or any of the Subsidiaries, except, for such conflict, breach, violation, default or lien that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have, in the case of
clauses (A) and (C) above, a Material Adverse Effect; a material adverse effect on the
performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Shares or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement; and
except with respect to clause (C), for federal or state securities laws or anti-fraud laws.
(k)                                 No consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification
(“consent”) of or with any Delaware, Texas or federal court, arbitrator, governmental agency or
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company, JEH LLC and each of the Subsidiaries
under the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Delaware LLC Act, the laws of the State of
Texas or federal law, is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
and JEH LLC of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale by the Company of the
Shares being delivered on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be,
or the consummation by the Company and JEH LLC of the transactions contemplated by the
Underwriting Agreement, except (i) for registration of the Shares under the Securities Act and
consents required under the Exchange Act, applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws, and
the rules of the FINRA in connection with the purchase and distribution of the Shares by the
Underwriters (as to which such counsel need not express an opinion), (ii) for such consents that
have been obtained or made, (iii) for any such consents the absence or omission of which would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the
performance of the Underwriting Agreement, the issuance and sale of the Shares or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement or (iv) as
described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.
(l)                                     The statements in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus under the headings “Material U.S. federal income and estate tax
considerations for non-U.S. holders,” “Description of capital stock,” and in the Registration
Statement in item 14, insofar as they describe the terms of the Shares, provisions of federal
statutes, rules or regulations or the DGCL or any contracts and other legal instruments, are
accurate in all material respects.
(m)                             After giving effect to the application of the proceeds from the offering and sale of
the Shares as described in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the
Prospectus,
A-2
neither the Company nor JEH LLC will be required to register as an “investment company” or an entity “controlled” by
an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.
In rendering such opinion, such counsel may (i) rely in respect of matters of fact upon certificates of officers and

its opinion is limited to matters governed by federal law, the Texas Limited Liability Company Act, the Delaware
General Corporation Law and the Delaware LLC Act, (iv) with respect to the opinions expressed as to the good
standing or due qualification or registration as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as the case may be,
of the Company, JEH LLC and each of their respective subsidiaries, state that such opinions are based upon
certificates of good standing provided by the Secretary of State of the state of formation and certificates of foreign
qualification or registration provided by the Secretary of State of the states listed on an annex to be attached to such
counsel’s opinion (each of which shall be dated as of a date not more than fourteen days prior to the Closing Date or
the Additional Closing Date, as applicable, and shall be provided to counsel to the Underwriters), (v) state that they
express no opinion with respect to (A) any permits to own or operate any real or personal property or (B) state or local
taxes or tax statutes to which any of the members of JEH LLC may be subject; and (vi) with respect to the opinions
expressed in paragraphs (e) and (f) relating to the existence of any lien for which a financing statement under the

prepared by CT Lien Solutions, a Wolters Kluwer Company, purporting to describe all financing statements on file as
of the dates thereof in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, naming the Company or JEH LLC
as debtor.
In addition, such counsel shall make statements to the following effect:
Such counsel has reviewed the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus and has
participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of each of the Company and JEH LLC,
representatives of its independent registered public accounting firm, representatives of the independent reserve
engineers of the Company and JEH LLC and with the Underwriters’ representatives and their counsel, at which the
contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package, the Prospectus and related matters were
discussed.  The purpose of such counsel’s professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters
set forth in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, and such counsel has not
undertaken to verify independently any of the factual matters in such documents.  Moreover, many of the
determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package
and the Prospectus involve matters of a non-legal nature.  Accordingly, such counsel is not passing upon, and does
not assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained or included in
the Registration Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (except to the extent stated in
paragraph (m) above).  Subject to the foregoing and on the basis of the information such counsel gained in the course
of performing the services referred to above, such counsel advises the Underwriters that:
(a)                                 the Registration Statement, as of the latest effective date, the Preliminary
Prospectus, as of the Applicable Time, and the Prospectus, as of its date and as of the applicable
Closing Date, in each case including any documents filed under the Exchange Act and
incorporated by reference therein. appear on their face to be appropriately responsive in all
material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder; and
(b)                                 nothing came to such counsel’s attention that caused it to believe that:
A-3
(1)                                the Registration Statement, as of the latest effective date, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
(2)                                the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of the Applicable Time, included an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
or
(3)                                the Prospectus, as of its date or as of the applicable Closing Date, included or
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading;
it being understood that in each case such counsel has not been asked to, and does not, express any belief with
respect to (a) the financial statements and schedules or other financial or accounting information contained or
included therein or omitted therefrom, (b) the summary reserve report of independent reserve engineer and reserve
information contained or included therein or omitted therefrom, or (c) representations and warranties and other
statements of fact contained in the exhibits to the Registration Statement.
The opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. described above shall be rendered to the Underwriters at the request of the
Company and shall so state therein.
