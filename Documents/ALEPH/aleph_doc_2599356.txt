PART II
                             RULE 12b-25(b) AND (c)
If the subject report could not be filed without unreasonable effort or expense
and the Registrant seeks relief pursuant to Rule 12b-25, the following should be
completed. (Check box if appropriate.)
[X]
(a)      The reasons described in reasonable detail in Part III of this
                  form could not be eliminated without unreasonable effort or
                  expense;
(b)      The subject annual report, semi-annual report, transition
                  report on Form 10-K, 10-KSB, 20-F or Form N-SAR, or portion
                  thereof will be filed on or before the 15th calendar day
                  following the prescribed due date; or the subject quarterly
                  report or transition report on Form 10-Q, 10-QSB, or portion
                  thereof will be filed on or before the fifth calendar day
                  following the prescribed due date; and
(c)      The accountant's statement or other exhibit required by Rule
                  12(b)-25 has been attached if applicable.
PART III
                                    NARRATIVE
State below in reasonable detail the reasons why Form 10-K, 10-KSB, 11-K, 20-F,
10-Q, 10-QSB, N-SAR or the transition report portion thereof could not be filed
within the prescribed time period. (Attach extra sheets if needed.)
As discussed in previous filings, Management has devoted a significant
amount of time to negotiations for a prospective acquisition of a business
opportunity for the company, and has secured conditional commitments of funding
for such purpose. Management believed that an asset purchase agreement would be
finalized with the vendor company by the end of September 2002 and that this
would require extensive disclosure in the Form 10-KSB. However, delays in
finalizing the terms of the asset purchase agreement and the associated
agreements have required that the text of the Form 10-KSB be revised as the
expected agreement has not been completed.
PART IV
                                OTHER INFORMATION
(1)      name and telephone number of person to contact in regard to
                  this notification.
Robert C.J. van Mourik                          (720) 876 2373
                  --------------------------------------------------------------
(2)      Have all other periodic reports required under Section 13 or
                  15d of the Securities Exchange Act off 1934 or Section 30 of
                  the Investment Company
<PAGE>
Act of 1940 during he preceding twelve months or for such
                  shorter period that the Registrant was required to file such
                  report(s) been filed? If the answer is no, identify report(s).
                                                         [X] Yes [ ] No
(3)      Is it anticipated that any significant change in results of
                  operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal
                  year will be reflected by the earnings statements to be
                  included in the subject report or portion thereof?
                                                         [X] Yes [ ] No
If so: attach an explanation of the anticipated change, both
                  narratively and quantitatively, and, if appropriate, state the
                  reasons why a reasonable estimate of the results cannot be
                  made.
The loss for the year ended June 30, 2002 was $2,764,858
                  compared with $1,897,715 for the prior year ended June 30,
                  2001 and $1,798,786 for the year ended June 30, 2000. The
higher loss was due firstly to the increased expenditures
                  incurred by the company in pursuing its business acquisition
                  strategy and secondly, by the outcome of litigation resulting
                  in a judgment being awarded against the company.
