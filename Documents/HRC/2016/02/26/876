</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Vienna Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action, the International Covenants on Human Rights, and all other 
</p>
<p>relevant instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups 
</p>
<p>and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>all Human Rights Council resolutions relevant to creating and 
</p>
<p>maintaining civil society space, inter alia, resolutions 12/16 of 2 October 2009, on freedom 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression, 21/16 of 27 September 2012, on the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>peaceful assembly and of association, 22/6 of 21 March 2013, on protecting human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, 24/8 of 26 September 2013 on equal political participation, 24/21 of 27 
</p>
<p>September 2013 on civil society space: creating and maintaining, in law and in practice, a 
</p>
<p>safe and enabling environment, 24/24 of 27 September 2013, on cooperation with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights, 25/38 of 
</p>
<p>28 March 2014, on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful 
</p>

<p>protests, and 26/13 of 26 June 2014 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights on the Internet, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the important role of civil society at the local, national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels, and that civil society facilitates the achievement of the purposes and 
</p>
<p>principles of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that special emphasis should be given to measures to assist in the 
</p>
<p>strengthening of a pluralistic civil society, including through the strengthening of the rule of 
</p>
<p>law, social and economic development, the promotion of the right to freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>online and offline, including artistic expression and creativity, access to information, the 
</p>
<p>rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including the right and ability to 
</p>
<p>solicit, receive and utilize resources, and the administration of justice, and to the real and 
</p>
<p>effective participation of the people in the decision-making processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>the crucial importance of the active involvement of civil society, at all 
</p>
<p>levels, in processes of governance and in promoting good governance, including through 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability, at all levels, which is indispensable for building peaceful, 
</p>
<p>prosperous and democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that creating and maintaining a safe and enabling environment in 
</p>
<p>which civil society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity assists States in fulfilling 
</p>
<p>their existing international human rights obligations and commitments, without which 
</p>
<p>equality, accountability and the rule of law are severely weakened, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>that domestic legal and administrative provisions and their application 
</p>
<p>should facilitate, promote and protect an independent, diverse and pluralistic civil society, 
</p>
<p>and in this regard strongly rejecting all threats, attacks, reprisals and acts of intimidation 
</p>
<p>against civil society actors, and underscoring that States should investigate any such alleged 
</p>
<p>acts, ensure accountability and effective remedies, and take steps to prevent any further 
</p>
<p>such threats, attacks, reprisals or acts of intimidation, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring </i>that the legal framework within which civil society operates is that of 
</p>
<p>national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that, in some instances, domestic legal and administrative 
</p>
<p>provisions, such as national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and other measures, 
</p>
<p>such as provisions on funding to civil society, have sought to or have been misused to 
</p>
<p>hinder the work and endanger the safety of civil society in a manner contrary to 
</p>
<p>international law, and recognizing the urgent need to prevent and stop the use of such 
</p>
<p>provisions, and to review and, where necessary, amend any relevant provisions in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure compliance with international human rights law and, as appropriate, international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the recent enactment by some States of national legislation and policies 
</p>
<p>to facilitate, promote and protect civil society space consistent with international human 
</p>
<p>rights law, and looking forward to their effective implementation, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the holding on 11 March 2014 of the panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>importance of the promotion and protection of civil society space and the summary report 
</p>

</p>
<p>2. <i>Reminds </i>States of their obligation to respect and fully protect the civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights of all individuals, inter alia, the rights to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>freedom of expression and opinion and to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
</p>
<p>as well as offline, including for persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, 
</p>
<p>and that respect for all such rights, in relation to civil society, contributes to addressing and 
</p>
<p>resolving challenges and issues that are important to society, such as addressing financial 
</p>
<p>and economic crises, responding to public health crises, responding to humanitarian crises, 
</p>
<p>including in the context of armed conflict, promoting the rule of law and accountability, 
</p>
<p>achieving transitional justice goals, protecting the environment, realizing the right to 
</p>
<p>development, empowering persons belonging to minorities and vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p>combating racism and racial discrimination, supporting crime prevention, countering 
</p>
<p>corruption, promoting corporate social responsibility and accountability, combating human 
</p>
<p>trafficking, empowering women and youth, advancing social justice and consumer 
</p>
<p>protection, and the realization of all human rights;

</p>
<p>enabling environment in which civil society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance of civil society space for empowering persons 
</p>
<p>belonging to minorities and vulnerable groups, as well as persons espousing minority or 
</p>
<p>dissenting views or beliefs, and in that regard calls upon States to ensure that legislation, 
</p>
<p>policies and practices do not undermine the enjoyment of their human rights or the 
</p>
<p>activities of civil society in defending their rights; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also emphasizes </i>the important role of artistic expression and creativity in the 
</p>
<p>development of society and, accordingly, the importance of a safe and enabling 
</p>
<p>environment for civil society in that regard, in line with article 19 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Urges </i>States to acknowledge publicly the important and legitimate role of 
</p>
<p>civil society in the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States to engage with civil society to enable it to participate in the 
</p>
<p>public debate on decisions that would contribute to the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights and the rule of law, and of any other relevant decisions; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Stresses in particular </i>the valuable contribution of civil society in providing 
</p>
<p>input to States on the potential implications of legislation, when such legislation is being 
</p>
<p>developed, debated, implemented or reviewed; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges</i> States to ensure access to justice, accountability and end impunity for 
</p>
<p>human rights violations and abuses against civil society actors, including by putting in 
</p>
<p>place, and where necessary reviewing and amending, relevant laws, policies, institutions 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms to create and maintain a safe and enabling environment in which civil 
</p>
<p>society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that provisions on funding to civil society are in 
</p>
<p>compliance with their international human rights obligations and commitments and are not 
</p>
<p>misused to hinder the work or endanger the safety of civil society actors, and underlines the 
</p>
<p>importance of the right and ability to solicit, receive and utilize resources for its work; 
</p>

</p>
<p>the capacity of civil society to operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Emphasizes </i>the essential role of civil society in subregional, regional and 
</p>
<p>international organizations, including in support of the organizations&#8217; work, and in sharing

</p>
<p>relevant rules and modalities, and in this regard reaffirms the right of everyone, individually 
</p>
<p>and in association with others, to unhindered access to and communication with </p>


<p>subregional, regional and international bodies, in particular the United Nations, its 
</p>
<p>representatives and mechanisms; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Recognizes </i>the valuable contribution of national, subregional, regional and 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms and bodies, including the universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>and special procedures of the Human Rights Council, the treaty bodies and national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions, to the promotion and protection of civil society space, and encourages 
</p>
<p>these mechanisms in the framework of their existing mandates to continue to address 
</p>
<p>relevant aspects of civil society space; 
</p>
<p>14<i>. Welcomes </i>the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner

</p>
<p>15. <i>Requests </i>the High Commissioner to prepare a compilation of practical 
</p>
<p>recommendations for the creation and maintenance of a safe and enabling environment for
