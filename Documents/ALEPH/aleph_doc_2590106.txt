GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS
Analogous Reservoir: Analogous reservoirs, as used in resource assessments, have similar rock
and fluid properties, reservoir conditions (depth, temperature and pressure) and drive
mechanisms, but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of
interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and
estimation of recovery. When used to support proved reserves, analogous reservoir refers to a
reservoir that shares all of the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest: (i) the same
geological formation (but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of
interest); (ii) the same environment of deposition; (iii) similar geologic structure; and (iv) the same
drive mechanism.
API Gravity: A system of classifying oil based on its specific gravity, whereby the greater the
gravity, the lighter the oil.
Bbl: One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in reference to oil or other
liquid hydrocarbons.
Bbl/d: One Bbl per day.
Bcfe: One billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent.
BOEM: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
Btu: One British thermal unit, the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of a one-
pound mass of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
Development Project: A development project is the means by which petroleum resources are
brought to the status of economically producible. As examples, the development of a single
reservoir or field, an incremental development in a producing field or the integrated development
of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a
development project.
Dry Hole or Dry Well: A well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient
quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production would exceed production
expenses and taxes.
Economically Producible: The term economically producible, as it relates to a resource, means a
resource which generates revenue that exceeds, or is reasonably expected to exceed, the costs
of the operation. For this determination, the value of the products that generate revenue are
determined at the terminal point of oil and natural gas producing activities.
Exploitation: A development or other project which may target proven or unproven reserves (such
as probable or possible reserves), but which generally has a lower risk than that associated with
exploration projects.
Field: An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs, all grouped on or related to
the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. The field name
refers to the surface area, although it may refer to both the surface and the underground
productive formations.
Gross Acres or Gross Wells: The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which we have a
working interest.
ICE: Inter-Continental Exchange.
MBbl: One thousand Bbls.
MBoe: One thousand barrels of oil equivalent. One Boe is calculated by converting natural gas to
oil equivalent barrels at a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil.
MBoe/d: One thousand Boe per day.
MBtu: One thousand Btu.
Mcf: One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
Mcf/d: One Mcf per day.
MMBtu: One million British thermal units.
1
MMcf: One million cubic feet of natural gas.
MMcfe: One million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent.
Net Production: Production that is owned by us less royalties and production due to others.
NGLs: The combination of ethane, propane, butane and natural gasolines that when removed
from natural gas become liquid under various levels of higher pressure and lower temperature.
NYMEX: New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil: Oil and condensate.
Operator: The individual or company responsible for the exploration and/or production of an oil or
natural gas well or lease.
OPIS: Oil Price Information Service.
Probabilistic Estimate: The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic
when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter (from the
geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their
associated probabilities of occurrences.
Proved Developed Reserves: Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved Reserves: Those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible,
from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the
right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless
of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to
extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain that
it will commence the project, within a reasonable time. The area of the reservoir considered as
proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and
(ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be
continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of
available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved
quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons, as seen in a well
penetration, unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology
establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty. Where direct observation from well
penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated
natural gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the
reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish
the higher contact with reasonable certainty. Reserves which can be produced economically
through application of improved recovery techniques (including fluid injection) are included in the
proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with
properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed
program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology
establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program
was based; and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and
entities, including governmental entities. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs
at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price used is the
average price during the twelve-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by
the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for
each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding
escalations based upon future conditions.
Realized Price: The cash market price less all expected quality, transportation and demand
adjustments.
Recompletion: The completion for production of an existing wellbore in another formation from
that which the well has been previously completed.
Reliable Technology: Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including
computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide
reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or
in an analogous formation.
2
Reserves: Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related
substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of
development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a
reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the
production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market and
all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves should not be assigned to
adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are
penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to
areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e.,
absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test results). Such areas may contain
prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
Reservoir: A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of
producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is
individual and separate from other reserves.
Resources: Resources are quantities of oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally
occurring accumulations. A portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and
another portion may be considered unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and
undiscovered accumulations.
Standardized Measure: The present value of estimated future net revenue to be generated from
the production of proved reserves, determined in accordance with the rules, regulations or
standards established by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) (using prices and costs in effect as of the
date of estimation), less future development, production and income tax expenses, and
discounted at 10% per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue. Because we are a limited
partnership, we are generally not subject to federal or state income taxes and thus make no
provision for federal or state income taxes in the calculation of our standardized measure.
Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions.
Wellbore: The hole drilled by the bit that is equipped for oil or natural gas production on a
completed well. Also called well or borehole.
Working Interest: An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest
the right to drill for and produce oil and natural gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner
to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
Workover: Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
WTI: West Texas Intermediate.

Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation
General
Memorial Production Partners LP (the “Partnership”) is a publicly traded Delaware limited
partnership, the common units of which are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (“NASDAQ”)
under the symbol “MEMP.” Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,”
or “the Partnership” are intended to mean the business and operations of Memorial Production
Partners LP and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and
production of oil and natural gas properties. Our management evaluates performance based on
one reportable business segment as the economic environments are not different within the
operation of our oil and natural gas properties. Our assets consist primarily of producing oil and
natural gas properties and are located in Texas, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming and offshore
Southern California. Most of our oil and natural gas properties are located in large, mature oil and
natural gas reservoirs. The Partnership’s properties consist primarily of operated and non-
operated working interests in producing and undeveloped leasehold acreage and working
interests in identified producing wells.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references to: (i) “our general partner” or “MEMP GP” refer
to Memorial Production Partners GP LLC, our general partner and wholly-owned subsidiary; (ii)
“Memorial Resource” refer collectively to Memorial Resource Development Corp. and its
subsidiaries; (iii) “the Funds” refer collectively to Natural Gas Partners VIII, L.P., Natural Gas
Partners IX, L.P. and NGP IX Offshore Holdings, L.P.; (iv) “OLLC” refer to Memorial Production
Operating LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary through which we operate our properties; (v)
“Finance Corp.” refer to Memorial Production Finance Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary,
whose activities are limited to co-issuing our debt securities and engaging in other activities
incidental thereto; and (vi) “NGP” refer to Natural Gas Partners.
On April 27, 2016, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Partnership agreed to
acquire, among other things, all of the equity interests in our general partner, MEMP GP, from
Memorial Resource (the “MEMP GP Acquisition”) for cash consideration of approximately $0.8
million. MEMP GP held an approximate 0.1% general partner interest and 50% of the incentive
distribution rights ("IDRs") in us.  In connection with the MEMP GP Acquisition, on April 27, 2016,
we also entered into an agreement with a NGP affiliate pursuant to which we agreed to acquire
the other 50% of the IDRs. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction and no
gain or loss was recognized as a result of the acquisition.
In connection with the closing of the transactions on June 1, 2016, our partnership agreement
was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) convert the 0.1% general partner interest in
the Partnership held by MEMP GP into a non-economic general partner interest, (ii) cancel the
IDRs, and (iii) provide that the limited partners of the Partnership will elect the members of MEMP
GP’s board of directors beginning with the annual meeting in 2017.  In addition, we terminated
the omnibus agreement under which Memorial Resource provided management, administrative
and operations personnel to us and our general partner, and we entered into a transition services
agreement with Memorial Resource to manage certain post-closing separation costs and
activities. See Note 11 and Note 12 for additional information regarding the MEMP GP
Acquisition and the transition services agreement.
Previous Owners
References to “the previous owners” for accounting and financial reporting purposes refer to
certain oil and gas properties primarily located in East Texas and West Louisiana that the
Partnership acquired on February 23, 2015 from certain operating subsidiaries of Memorial
Resource in exchange for cash and certain of our oil and natural gas properties primarily located
in North Louisiana for periods after common control commenced through the date of
acquisition.  We refer to this transaction as the “Property Swap.”  The acquired East Texas oil
and natural gas properties were owned by Classic Hydrocarbons Holdings, L.P. or its
subsidiaries.  The Property Swap was accounted for as a transaction between entities under
common control, similar to a pooling of interests, whereby the net assets acquired were recorded
at historical cost and certain financial and other information were retrospectively revised to give
effect to the Property Swap as if the Partnership owned the assets for periods after common
control commenced through the acquisition date.
Basis of Presentation
Our consolidated results of operations are presented together with the combined results of
operations pertaining to the previous owners.  The combined financial statements of the previous
owners were derived from their historical accounting records and reflect their historical financial
position, results of operations and cash flows.  The inclusion of MEMP GP in our consolidated
financial statements was effective June 1, 2016 due to the MEMP GP Acquisition.  See Note 11
for more information.  Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current presentation.

MEMORIAL PRODUCTION PARTNERS LP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of results expected for the full year. In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated and combined financial statements include all adjustments of a normal
recurring nature necessary for fair presentation. Although we believe the disclosures in these
financial statements are adequate and make the information presented not misleading, certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in preparation of our
consolidated and combined financial statements.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated and combined
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, oil and natural gas reserves; depreciation,
depletion, and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties; future cash flows from oil
and natural gas properties; impairment of long-lived assets; fair value of derivatives; fair value of
equity compensation; fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations and asset retirement obligations.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
New Accounting Pronouncements
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  In March 2016, the FASB issued
an accounting standards update to reduce complexity involving several aspects of the
accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows. Entities will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax
deficiencies in equity. Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as
income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  In addition, the new guidance eliminates
the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before entities can recognize them and
requires entities to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash
flows rather than as a financing activity. Furthermore, the new guidance will increase the amount
an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to
liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer’s statutory income tax withholding
obligation. The new guidance requires an entity to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when
shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing
activity on the statement of cash flows. In addition, entities will now have to elect whether to
account for forfeitures on share-based payments by: (i) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they
occur or (ii) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate
when it is likely to change, as is currently required.
The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must
be adopted in the same period. For the amendments that change the recognition and
measurement of share-based payment awards, the new guidance requires transition under a
modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment made to retained earnings
as of the beginning of the fiscal period in which the guidance is adopted.  Prospective application
is required for the accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies. Entities should apply
the new guidance retrospectively for all periods presented related to the classification of
employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet
the minimum statutory withholding requirements. Entities may apply the presentation changes for
excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows either prospectively or retrospectively.  The
Partnership is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Leases.  In February 2016, the FASB issued a revision to lease accounting guidance. The FASB
retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either direct financing or operating
leases. The classification will be based on criteria that are similar to the current lease accounting
treatment. The revised guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease
liability for all leasing transactions regardless of classification. For leases with a term of 12
months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of
underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this
election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. The amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The revised guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for
certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The Partnership is currently evaluating
the standard and the impact on the consolidated financial statements and related footnote
disclosures.
Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions.  In
April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that specifies that for purposes of
calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a
transferred business before the date of a dropdown transaction should be allocated entirely to the
general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited
partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements)
would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the
rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for
purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method are also required.  The
guidance was effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. Since the
Partnership has historically allocated the earnings (losses) of transferred businesses that
occurred in periods before the date of the dropdown transaction entirely to affiliates of the general
partner (i.e., the previous owners) and did not adjust previously reported earnings per unit of the
limited partners, the impact of adopting this guidance was not material to the Partnership’s
financial statements and related disclosures.
Other accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting
bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Partnership’s financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.

operating expenses associated with oil and gas properties acquired, (ii) depletion expense
applied to the adjusted basis of the properties acquired, (iii) accretion expense associated with
asset retirement obligations recorded and (iv) interest expense on additional borrowings
necessary to finance the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not

On June 14, 2016, we closed a transaction to divest assets located in the Permian Basin
(“Permian Divestiture”) for a total purchase price of approximately $37.2 million, which included
$36.4 million in cash and $0.8 million in accounts receivable, subject to post-closing
adjustments. We recognized a gain of $7.6 million on the sale of properties related to the
Permian Divestiture in “(gain) loss on sale of properties” in the accompanying statement of
operations.  The proceeds from this transaction were used to reduce borrowings under our
revolving credit facility.  This disposition does not qualify as a discontinued operation.  There
were no significant divestitures for the six months ended June 30, 2015.

Note 4. Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a specified measurement date.
Fair value estimates are based on either (i) actual market data or (ii) assumptions that other
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including estimates of risk. A three-
tier hierarchy has been established that classifies fair value amounts recognized or disclosed in
the financial statements. The hierarchy considers fair value amounts based on observable inputs
(Levels 1 and 2) to be more reliable and predictable than those based primarily on unobservable
inputs (Level 3). All of the derivative instruments reflected on the accompanying balance sheets
were considered Level 2.
The carrying values of accounts receivables, accounts payables (including accrued liabilities),
restricted investments and amounts outstanding under long-term debt agreements with variable
rates included in the accompanying balance sheets approximated fair value at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. The fair value estimates are based upon observable market data and
are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. These assets and liabilities are not
presented in the following tables. See Note 7 for the estimated fair value of our outstanding fixed-
rate debt.

MEMORIAL PRODUCTION PARTNERS LP
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The fair market values of the derivative financial instruments reflected on the balance sheets as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were based on estimated forward commodity prices
and forward interest rate yield curves. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect
the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value
hierarchy levels.
The following table presents the gross derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for each of the fair value

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as reflected on the
balance sheets. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values:
·The fair value of asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) is based on discounted cash flow
projections using numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding factors such as
the existence of a legal obligation for an ARO; amounts and timing of settlements; the credit-
adjusted risk-free rate; and inflation rates. See Note 6 for a summary of changes in AROs.
 ·If sufficient market data is not available, the determination of the fair values of proved and
unproved properties acquired in transactions accounted for as business combinations are
prepared by utilizing estimates of discounted cash flow projections. The factors to determine fair
value include, but are not limited to, estimates of: (i) economic reserves; (ii) future operating and
development costs; (iii) future commodity prices; and (iv) a market-based weighted average cost
of capital.
 ·Proved oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events and
circumstances indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such
properties. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of
proved reserves, estimates of probable reserves, future commodity prices, the timing of future
production and capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the risk reflective of
the lives remaining for the respective oil and natural gas properties.

·During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized approximately $8.3 million of
impairments related to certain properties located in East Texas.  The estimated future cash
flows expected from these properties were compared to their carrying values and determined to
be unrecoverable primarily as a result of declining commodity prices.  The carrying value of the
East Texas properties after the impairment was approximately $11.0 million. During the six
months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $251.3 million of impairments primarily related to
certain properties located in East Texas, Wyoming and Colorado. The estimated future cash
flows expected from these properties were compared to their carrying values and determined to
be unrecoverable in part due to a downward revision of estimated proved reserves based on
declining commodity prices and increased operating costs. 
 ·During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized approximately $4.0
million in losses related to the Rockies Divestiture. The held for sale assets were recorded at
the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. See Note 3 for additional
information regarding the Rockies Divestiture.
Note 5. Risk Management and Derivative Instruments
Derivative instruments are utilized to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate
fluctuations and achieve a more predictable cash flow in connection with natural gas and oil
sales from production and borrowing related activities. These instruments limit exposure to
declines in prices or increases in interest rates, but also limit the benefits that would be realized if
prices increase or interest rates decrease.
Certain inherent business risks are associated with commodity and interest derivative contracts,
including market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the risk that the price of natural gas or oil will
change, either favorably or unfavorably, in response to changing market conditions. Credit risk is
the risk of loss from nonperformance by the counterparty to a contract. It is our policy to enter into
derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, only with creditworthy counterparties, which
generally are financial institutions, deemed by management as competent and competitive
market makers. Some of the lenders, or certain of their affiliates, under our credit agreement are
counterparties to our derivative contracts. While collateral is generally not required to be posted
by counterparties, credit risk associated with derivative instruments is minimized by limiting
exposure to any single counterparty and entering into derivative instruments only with
creditworthy counterparties that are generally large financial institutions. Additionally, master
netting agreements are used to mitigate risk of loss due to default with counterparties on
derivative instruments. We have also entered into International Swaps and Derivatives
Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”) with each of our counterparties. The terms
of the ISDA Agreements provide us and each of our counterparties with rights of set-off upon the
occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or our counterparty to a derivative, whereby the
party not in default may set-off all liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all net derivative
asset receivables from the defaulting party. As a result, had all counterparties failed completely to
perform according to the terms of the existing contracts, we would have the right to offset $272.7
million against amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at June 30, 2016, reducing
our maximum credit exposure to approximately $197.3 million, of which approximately $64.3
million was with one counterparty. See Note 7 for additional information regarding our revolving
credit facility.
Commodity Derivatives
We may use a combination of commodity derivatives (e.g., floating-for-fixed swaps, put options,
costless collars and basis swaps) to manage exposure to commodity price volatility. We
recognize all derivative instruments at fair value; however, certain of our put option derivative
instruments have a deferred premium, which reduces the asset. For the deferred premium puts,
the Partnership agrees to pay a premium to the counterparty at the time of settlement. At
settlement, if the applicable index price is below the strike price of the put, the Partnership
receives the difference between the strike price and the applicable index price multiplied by the
contract volumes less the premium. If the applicable index price settles at or above the strike
price of the put, the Partnership pays only the premium at settlement.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we terminated certain “in-the-money” crude oil
and NGL derivatives settling in 2016 and certain crude oil basis swaps settling in 2016 and 2017.
We received cash settlements of approximately $39.3 million from the termination of these crude
oil and NGL derivatives.
In February 2015, we restructured a portion of our commodity derivative portfolio by effectively
terminating “in-the-money” crude oil derivatives settling in 2015 through 2017 and entering into
NGL derivatives with the same tenor.  Cash settlement receipts of approximately $27.1 million
from the termination of these crude oil derivatives were applied as premiums for the new NGL
derivatives.

to 2.25% per annum (based on borrowing base usage) on alternate base rate loans and from
2.25% to 3.25% per annum (based on borrowing base usage) on Eurodollar or LIBOR loans
and sets the committee fee for the unused portion of the borrowing base to 0.50% per annum
regardless of the borrowing base usage;
 ·reduce the borrowing base thereunder from $1,175 million to $925 million;
 ·require the Partnership to maintain a ratio of Consolidated First Lien Net Secured Debt (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) to Consolidated EBITDAX (as defined in the Credit

 ·permit the issuance by the Partnership of secured second lien notes solely in exchange for the
Partnership’s outstanding senior unsecured notes pursuant to one or more senior debt
exchanges; provided that, among other things: (i) such debt shall be (A) in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $600 million (plus any principal representing payment of interest
in kind) and (B) such debt is subject to an intercreditor agreement at all times; and (ii) such debt
shall not (A) have any scheduled principal amortization or have a scheduled maturity date or a
date of mandatory redemption in full prior to 180 days after March 19, 2018, or (B) not contain
any covenants or events of default that are more onerous or restrictive than those set forth in the
Credit Agreement other than covenants or events of default that are contained in the
Partnership’s existing senior unsecured notes and (C) the Consolidated Net Interest Expense
(as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the 12-month period following the exchange, after
giving pro forma effect to the exchange, shall be no greater than the Consolidated Net Interest
Expense for such period had the exchange not occurred;
 ·permit the payment by the Partnership of cash distributions to its equity holders out of available
cash in accordance with its partnership agreement so long as, among other things, the pro
forma Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) shall be not less than the greater of $75
million or (x) 10% of the borrowing base then in effect with respect to any such distributions
made prior to June 1, 2016 or (y) 15% of the borrowing base then in effect with respect to any
such distributions made on or after June 1, 2016; provided that the aggregate amount of all such
payments made in any fiscal quarter for which the ratio of the Partnership’s total debt at the time
of such payment to its Consolidated EBITDAX for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day
of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of determination for which financial
statements are available is greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 will not exceed $4.15 million
during such fiscal quarter;
 ·permit the repurchase of the Partnership’s (i) outstanding senior unsecured notes, or if any,
second lien debt with proceeds from Swap Liquidations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or
the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties and (ii) outstanding senior unsecured
notes with the proceeds from the release of cash securing certain governmental obligations
located in the Beta Field offshore Southern California, provided that, among other things, (A) the
pro forma Availability is not less than the greater of $75 million or (x) 10% of the borrowing base
then in effect through May 31, 2016 or (y) 15% of the borrowing base then in effect on or after
June 1, 2016, (B) the Partnership’s pro forma ratio of Consolidated First Lien Net Secured Debt
to Consolidated EBITDAX is not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, and (C) the amount of proceeds from
all Swap Liquidations and sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties used to
repurchase outstanding senior unsecured notes or secured second lien notes does not exceed
$40 million in the aggregate, or in the case of the release of cash securing such obligations, the
amount of proceeds used to repurchase outstanding senior unsecured notes does not exceed
$60 million in the aggregate;
 ·require that the oil and gas properties of the Partnership mortgaged as collateral security for the
loans under the Credit Agreement represent not less than 90% of the total value of the oil and
gas properties of the Partnership evaluated in the most recently completed reserve report; and
 ·require the Partnership, in the event that at the close of any business day the aggregate amount
of any unrestricted cash or cash equivalents exceeds $25 million in the aggregate, to prepay the
loans under the Credit Agreement and cash collateralize any letter of credit exposure with such
excess.

(1)Restricted common units are generally net-settled by unitholders to cover the required
withholding tax upon vesting. Unitholders surrendered units with value equivalent to the
employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment
taxes. Total payments remitted for the employees’ tax obligations to the appropriate taxing
authorities were approximately $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. These
net-settlements had the effect of unit repurchases by the Partnership as they reduced the
number of units that would have otherwise been outstanding as a result of the vesting and did
not represent an expense to the Partnership.
Restricted common units are a component of common units as presented on our unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 for additional information regarding
restricted common units that were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
“At the Market” Equity Program
On May 25, 2016, the Partnership entered into an equity distribution agreement for the sale of up
to $60 million of common units under an at the market program (the “ATM Program”). Sales of
common units, if any, will be made under the ATM Program by means of ordinary brokers’
transactions, through the facilities of the NASDAQ Global Market at market prices, or as
otherwise agreed between the Partnership and a sales agent. The Partnership expects to use the
net proceeds from any sale of common units for general partnership purposes, which may
include repaying or refinancing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness and funding working
capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership sold 822,313 common
units under the ATM program, generating net proceeds of approximately $1.6 million (net of
approximately $0.1 million in commissions). At June 30, 2016, approximately $58.3 million of
common units remained available for issuance under the ATM Program.
2015 Repurchases of Common Units
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we repurchased $43.9 million in common units,
which represented a repurchase and retirement of 2,951,612 common units under the December
2014 repurchase program. The December 2014 repurchase program expired in December
2015.
Allocations of Net Income (Loss)
Prior to the MEMP GP Acquisition, net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership was allocated
between our general partner and the common unitholders in proportion to their pro rata
ownership after giving effect to priority earnings allocations in an amount equal to incentive cash
distributions allocated to our general partner and the Funds. Net income (loss) attributable to
acquisitions accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control in a manner
similar to the pooling of interest method prior to their acquisition date is allocated to the previous
owners since they were affiliates of our general partner. Subsequent to the MEMP GP
Acquisition, net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership is allocated entirely to the common
unit holders.

(2)The aggregate grant date fair value of restricted common unit awards issued in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million based on a grant date market price of $2.41

The unrecognized compensation cost associated with restricted common unit awards was $6.3
million at June 30, 2016. We expect to recognize the unrecognized compensation cost for these
awards over a weighted-average period of 1.54 years. Since the restricted common units are
participating securities, distributions received by the restricted common unitholders are generally
included in distributions to partners as presented on our unaudited condensed statements of
consolidated and combined cash flows.
LTIP Modification
On June 1, 2016, in connection with the MEMP GP Acquisition as discussed in Note 1, the board
of directors of our general partner approved the acceleration of the vesting schedule of unvested
awards under the LTIP for the employees that remained with Memorial Resource. The grant-date
fair value compensation cost of approximately $0.1 million was reversed and the modified-date
grant fair value compensation cost of $0.5 million was recognized.
On March 9, 2016, certain employees were impacted by an involuntary termination which, upon
the approval of the board of directors of our general partner, accelerated the vesting schedule of
unvested awards under the LTIP that otherwise would have been forfeited upon a voluntary
termination. The acceleration of the LTIP vesting schedule represents an improbable-to-probable
modification. The grant-date fair value compensation cost of approximately $0.5 million was
reversed and the modified-date grant fair value compensation cost of approximately $0.3 million
was recognized.
Phantom Units

Phantom units issued to non-employee directors in January will vest on the first anniversary of
the date of grant. Phantom units issued to certain employees in June will vest in substantially
equal one-third increments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The
awards included distribution equivalent rights (“DERs”) pursuant to which the recipient will
receive a cash payment with respect to each phantom unit equal to any cash distributions that we
pay to a holder of a common unit. DERs are treated as additional compensation expense. Upon
vesting, the phantom units shall be settled through an amount of cash in a single lump sum
payment equal to the product of (y) the closing price of our common units on the vesting date and
(z) the number of such vested phantom units. In lieu of a cash payment, the board of directors of
our general partner, in its discretion, may elect for the recipient to receive either a number of
common units equal to the number of such vested phantom units or a combination of cash and
common units.

Common Control Acquisitions
MEMP GP Acquisition. On June 1, 2016, as discussed in Note 1, the Partnership acquired all of
the equity interests in our general partner, MEMP GP, from Memorial Resource for cash
consideration of approximately $0.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity
transaction and no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the acquisition. In connection with
the closing of the transaction, our partnership agreement was amended and restated to, among
other things, (i) convert MEMP GP’s 0.1% general partnership interest into a non-economic
general partner interest, (ii) cancel the IDRs of the Partnership, and (iii) provide that the limited
partners of the Partnership will elect the members of MEMP GP’s board of directors beginning
with an annual meeting in 2017. On June 1, 2016, the Partnership also acquired the remaining
50% of the IDRs of the Partnership owned by an NGP affiliate.

Classic Gas Gathering and Water Disposal Agreements
A discussion of these agreements is included in our 2015 Form 10-K. The amended gas
gathering agreement was terminated in November 2015 in connection with a third party’s
acquisition of Classic Pipeline and Gathering LLC’s (“Classic Pipeline”) Joaquin gathering
system. Additionally, Classic Pipeline assigned its salt water system to OLLC in November 2015.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, we incurred gathering and saltwater disposal
fees of approximately $1.1 million and $2.0 million under these agreements.
Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies
Transition Services Agreement
On June 1, 2016 we closed the MEMP GP Acquisition.  Upon closing of the MEMP GP
Acquisition, we and Memorial Resource became unaffiliated entities.  We terminated our
omnibus agreement and entered into a transition services agreement with Memorial Resource to
manage post-closing separation costs and activities. We recorded $0.5 million of general and
administrative expenses related to the transition services agreement with Memorial Resource for
the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Litigation & Environmental
As part of our normal business activities, we may be named as defendants in litigation and legal
proceedings, including those arising from regulatory and environmental matters. Although we are
insured against various risks to the extent we believe it is prudent, there is no assurance that the
nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate, in every case, to indemnify us against
liabilities arising from future legal proceedings. We are not aware of any litigation, pending or
threatened, that we believe is reasonably likely to have a significant adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
At June 30, 2016, we had no environmental reserves recorded. As of December 31, 2015, we
had approximately $0.2 million of environmental reserves recorded on our balance sheet.

In the event the account balance is less than the contractual amount, we must make additional
payments. Interest income earned and deposited in the trust account mitigates the likelihood that
additional payments will have to be made by us. As of June 30, 2016, the remaining obligation
was approximately $4.0 million. In 2015, the BOEM issued a preliminary report that indicated the
estimated costs of decommissioning may further increase, and we expect the amount to be
finalized during 2016 after negotiations are completed.

statements and accompanying notes in “Item 1. Financial Statements” contained herein and our
2015 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016 and any supplements thereto. The
following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates,
beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events,
risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. Our actual results could differ materially
from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in the front of this report.
Overview
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in April 2011 to own, acquire and exploit oil and
natural gas properties in North America. The Partnership is wholly-owned by its limited partners.
Our general partner, which owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, is responsible for
managing all of the Partnership’s operations and activities.
We operate in one reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and
production of oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are conducted through OLLC,
our wholly-owned subsidiary, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our assets consist primarily of
producing oil and natural gas properties and are principally located in Texas, Louisiana,
Colorado, Wyoming and offshore Southern California. Most of our oil and natural gas properties
are located in large, mature oil and natural gas reservoirs with well-known geologic
characteristics and long-lived, predictable production profiles and modest capital requirements.
As of December 31, 2015:
·Our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 1,268 Bcfe, of which approximately
43% were oil and 63% were classified as proved developed reserves;
 ·We produced from 3,357 gross (1,960 net) producing wells across our properties, with an
average working interest of 58% and the Partnership or Memorial Resource was the operator of
record of the properties containing 95% of our total estimated proved reserves; and
 ·Our average net production for the three months ended December 31, 2015 was 257.3 MMcfe/d,
implying a reserve-to-production ratio of approximately 14 years.
Recent Developments
MEMP GP Acquisition
In June 2016, the Partnership acquired all of the equity interests in MEMP GP from Memorial
Resource for cash consideration of approximately $0.8 million. See Note 1 and Note 11 of the
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included
under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
Permian Divestiture
In June 2016, we closed a transaction to divest assets located in the Permian Basin (“Permian
Divestiture”) for a total purchase price of approximately $37.2 million, subject to post-closing
adjustments. The proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
See Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
Rockies Divestiture
In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest certain of our non-core assets in
Colorado and Wyoming (“Rockies Divestiture”). We closed the Rockies Divestiture in July 2016
for total proceeds of approximately $18.1 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. The
proceeds from this transaction were used to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
See Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
29
Repurchase of 2021 Senior Notes
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $52.2 million of the 7.625% senior notes due 2021 (“2021
Senior Notes”) at a weighted average price of 48.99% of the face value of the 2021 Senior Notes.
See Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
Repurchase of 2022 Senior Notes
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $32.0 million of the 6.875% senior notes due 2022 (“2022
Senior Notes”) at a weighted average price of 46.50% of the face value of the 2022 Senior Notes.
See Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
Amendment to Credit Facility and Borrowing Base Redetermination
Effective April 14, 2016 the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility was reduced to
approximately $925 million in connection with the semi-annual borrowing redetermination by the
lenders. In addition, we and our lenders reached an agreement on amending certain terms of our
revolving credit facility. For information regarding the amendment, see Note 7 of the Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I,
Item 1.
Business Environment and Operational Focus
Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows, which would allow us to deliver
sustainable quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and, over time, to potentially increase
those quarterly cash distributions. We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess
the performance of our oil and natural gas operations, including: (i) production volumes;
(ii) realized prices on the sale of our production; (iii) cash settlements on our commodity
derivatives; (iv) lease operating expenses; (v) general and administrative expenses; and
(vi) Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).
Principal Components of Cost Structure
·Lease operating expenses. These are the day to day costs incurred to maintain production of
our natural gas, NGLs and oil. Such costs include utilities, direct labor, water injection and
disposal, the cost of CO2 injection, materials and supplies, compression, repairs and workover
expenses. Cost levels for these expenses can vary based on supply and demand for oilfield
services and activities performed during a specific period.
 ·Gathering, processing and transportation. These are costs incurred to deliver production of our
natural gas, NGLs and oil to the market. Cost levels of these expenses can vary based on the
volume of natural gas, NGLs and oil production.
 ·Taxes other than income. These consist of severance, ad valorem and franchise taxes.
Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas, NGLs and oil based on a percentage of
market prices and at fixed per unit rates established by state or local taxing authorities. We take
full advantage of all credits and exemptions in the various taxing jurisdictions where we operate.
Ad valorem taxes are generally tied to the valuation of the oil and natural gas properties.
Franchise taxes are privilege taxes levied by states that are imposed on companies, including
limited liability companies and partnerships, which gives the businesses the right to be
chartered or operate within that state.
 ·Exploration expense. These are geological and geophysical costs and include seismic costs,
costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes, delay rentals and unsuccessful leasing efforts.
 ·Impairment of proved properties. Proved properties are impaired whenever the carrying value of
the properties exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
 ·Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization, or DD&A,
includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, exploit and
develop oil and natural gas properties. As a “successful efforts” company, all costs associated
with acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts are capitalized,
and these costs are depleted using the units of production method.
 ·General and administrative expense. These costs include overhead, including payroll and
benefits for employees, costs of maintaining headquarters, costs of managing production and
development operations, compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive-
based plans, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance expenses.
30
Memorial Resource provided management, administrative and operating services to the
Partnership and our general partner pursuant to our omnibus agreement. Upon completion of the
MEMP GP Acquisition, the omnibus agreement was terminated and the Partnership entered into
a transition services agreement with Memorial Resource to manage certain post-closing
separation costs and activities. See Note 11 and Note 12 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for additional
information.
·Interest expense. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and senior note issuances. As a result, we incur
substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and financing
decisions. We expect to continue to incur significant interest expense.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our 2015 Form 10-
K. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, oil and natural gas reserves; depreciation,
depletion and amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties; future cash flows from oil and
natural gas properties; impairment of long-lived assets; fair value of derivatives; fair value of
equity compensation; fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations and asset retirement obligations. These estimates, in our opinion, are subjective in
nature, require the exercise of professional judgment and involve complex analysis.
When used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, such estimates are based
on our current knowledge and understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may
be revised as a result of actions we take in the future. Changes in these estimates will occur as a
result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events. Subsequent changes in these
estimates may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
A net loss of $147.6 million was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to a net loss of $113.9 million recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
·Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues for 2016 totaled $67.8 million, a decrease of $29.4 million
compared with 2015. Production decreased 1.5 Bcfe (approximately 7%) primarily from
decreased drilling activities and a planned plant turnaround at our Bairoil properties. The
average realized sales price decreased $1.09 per Mcfe primarily due to lower period-to-period
commodity prices. Crude oil volumes comprised approximately 27% of total volumes for 2016
and 2015, respectively. The unfavorable volume and pricing variance contributed to an
approximate $6.4 million and $23.0 million decrease in revenues, respectively.
 ·Lease operating expenses were $29.4 million and $44.9 million during 2016 and 2015,
respectively. On a per Mcfe basis, lease operating expenses were $1.39 for 2016 compared to
$1.99 for 2015.  Reductions in lease operating expenses were a result of our continued
reductions in service provider costs, workover activities, field workforce reductions and the
Permian Divestiture.
 ·Taxes other than income during 2016 totaled $3.5 million, a decrease of $2.6 million compared
with 2015 primarily due to lower realized commodity prices. On a per Mcfe basis, taxes other
than income decreased to $0.17 for 2016 compared to $0.27 for 2015 due to lower realized
commodity prices.
 ·DD&A expense during 2016 was $44.4 million compared to $46.3 million during 2015, a $1.9
million decrease. Decreased production volumes caused DD&A expense to decrease by
approximately $3.1 million and the change in the DD&A rate between periods caused DD&A
expense to increase by approximately $1.2 million. The $0.06 increase in DD&A rate is
primarily due to the 2015 Beta Acquisition.
 ·We recognized a gain on sale of properties of $3.5 million comprised of a gain of $7.6 million
related to the Permian Divestiture and a loss of approximately $4.0 million related to the
Rockies Divestiture. No gains or losses were recognized during 2015.
 ·General and administrative expenses during 2016 were $15.2 million and included $2.7 million
of non-cash unit-based compensation expense and approximately $0.9 million of acquisition
and divestiture related expenses.  General and administrative expenses during 2015 totaled
$14.4 million and included approximately $2.6 million of non-cash unit-based compensation
expense and approximately $0.3 million of acquisition and divestiture related expenses.  For
additional information, see Part I, Note 11 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements under Item 1.
 ·Net losses on commodity derivative instruments of $124.6 million were recognized during 2016,
consisting of $67.6 million of cash settlement receipts on expired positions and $39.3 million in
cash settlements received on terminated derivatives. These gains were offset by a $231.5
million decrease in the fair value of open positions. Net losses on commodity derivative
instruments of $61.4 million were recognized during 2015, consisting of $54.4 million of cash
settlement receipts on expired positions. These gains were offset by a $115.8 million decrease
in the fair value of open positions.
Given the volatility of commodity prices, it is not possible to predict future reported mark-to-market
net gains or losses and the actual net gains or losses that will ultimately be realized upon
settlement of the hedge positions in future years. If commodity prices at settlement are lower than
the prices of the hedge positions, the hedges are expected to mitigate the otherwise negative
effect on earnings of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices. However, if commodity prices at
settlement are higher than the prices of the hedge positions, the hedges are expected to dampen
the otherwise positive effect on earnings of higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices and will, in this
context, be viewed as having resulted in an opportunity cost.
·Net interest expense is comprised of interest on our revolving credit facility, interest on our
senior notes, amortization of debt issue costs, accretion of net discount associated with our
senior notes and gains and losses on interest rate swaps. Interest expense, net totaled $32.1
million during 2016, including losses on interest rate swaps of approximately $1.8 million,
amortization of deferred financing fees of approximately $1.3 million, and accretion of net
discount associated with our senior notes of $0.6 million. Interest expense, net totaled $27.9
million during 2015, including losses on interest rate swaps of approximately $0.6 million,
amortization of deferred financing fees of approximately $1.3 million and accretion of net
discounts associated with our senior notes of $0.6 million. The $4.2 million increase in interest
expense is primarily due to losses on interest rate swaps and an increase in average
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility during 2016 compared to 2015.
Average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $768.1 million during
2016 compared to $627.0 million during 2015. We had an average of $1.2 billion aggregate
principal amount of our senior notes issued and outstanding during both 2016 and 2015.
33
·We recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $41.7 million during 2016
related to the repurchase of the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes. There were no
repurchases of senior notes during 2015.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
A net loss of $185.6 million was recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to a net loss of $276.5 million recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
·Oil, natural gas and NGL revenues for 2016 totaled $128.4 million, a decrease of $60.8 million
compared with 2015. Production decreased approximately 2.0 Bcfe (approximately 5%),
primarily from decreased drilling activities, flooding in East Texas and a temporary production
curtailment and planned plant turnaround at our Bairoil properties. The average realized sales
price decreased $1.21 per Mcfe primarily due to lower period-to-period commodity prices. Crude
oil volumes comprised approximately 28% of total volumes for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to approximately 27% of total volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The unfavorable volume and pricing variance contributed to an approximate $8.4 million and
$52.4 million decrease in revenues, respectively.
 ·Lease operating expenses were $65.1 million and $85.4 million during 2016 and 2015,
respectively. On a per Mcfe basis, lease operating expenses were $1.51 for 2016 compared to
$1.89 for 2015. Reductions in lease operating expenses were a result of our continued
reductions in service provider costs, workover activities, field workforce reductions and the
Permian Divestiture.
 ·Taxes other than income were $7.5 million, a decrease of $5.2 million compared with 2015
primarily due to a decrease in commodity prices. On a per Mcfe basis, taxes other than income
decreased to $0.17 for 2016 compared to $0.28 for 2015 due to a decrease in commodity prices.
 ·DD&A expense during 2016 was $88.8 million compared to $97.6 million during 2015, an $8.8
million decrease primarily due to decreased production volumes and impairments recognized
on certain properties over the course of 2015, partially offset by incremental DD&A as a result of
the 2015 Beta Acquisition. Decreased production volumes caused DD&A expense to decrease
by an approximate $4.4 million and the change in the DD&A rate between periods caused
DD&A expense to decrease by approximately $4.4 million.
 ·During 2016, we recognized $8.3 million related to impairments on certain properties in East
Texas. We recognized $251.3 million of impairments during 2015 primarily related to certain
properties in East Texas, Wyoming and Colorado. The estimated future cash flows expected
from these properties were compared to their carrying values and determined to be
unrecoverable due to declining commodity prices.
 ·We recognized a gain on sale of properties of $3.6 million comprised of a gain of $7.6 million
related to the Permian Divestiture and a loss of approximately $4.0 million related to the
Rockies Divestiture. No gains or losses were recognized during 2015.  
 ·General and administrative expenses during 2016 were $28.8 million and included $5.3 million
of non-cash unit-based compensation expense and $1.0 million of acquisition and divestiture
related expenses. General and administrative expenses during 2015 totaled $28.9 million and
included approximately $4.9 million of non-cash unit-based compensation expense and $1.6
million of acquisition and divestiture related expenses.
 ·Net losses on commodity derivative instruments of $72.8 million were recognized during 2016,
consisting of $147.9 million of cash settlement receipts on expired positions and $39.3 million in
cash settlements received on terminated derivatives. These gains were offset by a $260.0
million decrease in the fair value of open positions. Net gains on commodity derivative
instruments of $84.1 million were recognized during 2015, consisting of $114.4 million of cash
settlement receipts on expired positions and a $27.1 million in cash settlements received on
terminated derivatives. These gains were partially offset by a $57.4 million decrease in the fair
value of open positions.
 ·Net interest expense is comprised of interest on our revolving credit facility, interest on our
senior notes, amortization of debt issue costs, accretion of net discount associated with our
senior notes and gains and losses on interest rate swaps. Interest expense, net totaled $64.7
million during the six months ended June 30, 2016, including losses on interest rate swaps of
approximately $5.5 million, amortization of deferred financing fees of approximately $2.6 million,
and accretion of net discount associated with our senior notes of $1.2 million. Interest expense,
net totaled $57.2 million during 2015, including losses on interest rate swaps of approximately
$3.1 million, amortization of deferred financing fees of approximately $3.1 million and accretion
of net discounts associated with our senior notes of $1.2 million. The $7.5 million increase in
interest expense is primarily due to the increase in average outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility during 2016 compared to 2015 as well as increased period-to-period
losses incurred on interest rate swaps of approximately $2.4 million during 2016 compared to
2015.
34
Average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $791.4 million during
2016 compared to $567.9 million during 2015. We had an average of $1.2 billion aggregate
principal amount of our senior notes issued and outstanding during both 2016 and 2015.
·We recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $41.7 million during 2016
related to the repurchase of the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes. During 2015, we
recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.4 million related to the
repurchase of the 2022 Senior Notes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview. Our ability to finance our operations, including funding capital expenditures and
acquisitions, to meet our indebtedness obligations, to refinance our indebtedness or to meet our
collateral requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our primary
sources of liquidity and capital resources have historically been cash flows generated by
operating activities, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and equity and debt capital
markets. During the remainder of 2016, we expect our funding sources to be cash flows
generated from operating activities, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit
facility, access to debt and equity capital markets, and/or divestitures of non-core assets. Our
debt service requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing
arrangements.
If cash flows from operations does not meet our expectations, we may reduce our expected level
of capital expenditures, reduce distributions to unitholders, and/or fund a portion of our capital
expenditures using borrowings under our revolving credit facility, issuances of debt and equity
securities or from other sources, such as asset divestitures. Needed capital may not be available
on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional
indebtedness could be limited by many factors, including the covenants in our revolving credit
facility or our indentures. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms,
we may be unable to finance the capital expenditures necessary to maintain our production or
proved reserves.
We expect to continue to focus on our liquidity and financial flexibility. For example, the proceeds
from the recently closed Permian Divestiture and Rockies Divestiture were used to reduce
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 3 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1. In addition to
asset divestitures, we may engage in other transactions to de-lever the Partnership, such as
terminating or restructuring commodity derivatives, debt exchanges, debt repurchases,
refinancing arrangements, or other recapitalization transactions.
Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $183.5 million of available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, which is net of $2.1 million in letters of
credit. We had no cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016. The next semi-annual
borrowing base redetermination is expected in the fall of 2016 and that redetermination will likely
result in the further reduction of our borrowing base. If the borrowing base under our revolving
credit facility is thereafter reduced further because of lower commodity prices and we are
otherwise unable to maintain our liquidity position, we may be required to repay any
indebtedness outstanding in excess of the borrowing base and we may no longer have the
financial flexibility to manage our business. In connection with any redetermination in the current
environment, we may also be required to amend our revolving credit facility, which amendment
could include additional restrictions and covenants that would further restrict our business and
financing activities, limit our flexibility and management’s discretion in operating our business,
and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. For additional information
regarding our credit facility, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and
Combined Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1.
Capital Markets.  We may also have the ability to issue additional equity and debt as needed
through public or private offerings of such securities. We have filed a universal shelf registration
statement with the SEC to register the offer and sale of our equity or debt securities to assist us in
meeting our future working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service and distributions to
our partners.  However, since we no longer qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer, we will
need to file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to convert it to a non-
automatic shelf registration statement that we are eligible to use. Such post-effective amendment
is subject to review by the SEC and must be declared effective by the SEC, which could delay
our ability to raise debt or equity capital under the registration statement and may adversely affect
our ability to access financing and the capital markets in a timely fashion. In May 2016, we also
implemented our at the market program (the “ATM Program”), which allows us to issue our
common units at prices and terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors.  At
June 30, 2016, approximately $58.3 million remained available for issuance under the ATM
Program.
35
Hedging. Commodity hedging has been and remains an important part of our strategy to reduce
cash flow volatility. Our hedging activities are intended to support oil, NGL, and natural gas
prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We intend
to enter into commodity derivative contracts at times and on terms desired to maintain a portfolio
of commodity derivative contracts covering approximately 65% to 85% of our estimated
production from total proved reserves over a three-to-six year period at any given point of time.
We may, however, from time to time hedge more or less than this approximate range.
Additionally, we may take advantage of opportunities to modify our commodity derivative portfolio
to change the percentage of our hedged production volumes when circumstances suggest that it
is prudent to do so. The current market conditions may also impact our ability to enter into future
commodity derivative contracts. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we terminated
certain “in-the-money” crude oil and NGL derivatives settling in 2016 and certain crude oil basis
swaps settling in 2016 and 2017. We received cash settlements of approximately $39.3 million
from the termination of these crude oil and NGL derivatives. For additional information regarding
the volumes of our production covered by commodity derivative contracts and the average prices
at which production is hedged as of June 30, 2016, see “Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk — Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk.”
We evaluate counterparty risks related to our commodity derivative contracts and trade credit.
Some of the lenders, or certain of their affiliates, under our revolving credit facility are
counterparties to our derivative contracts. Should any of these financial counterparties not
perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our hedges under lower commodity prices. We
sell our oil and natural gas to a variety of purchasers. Non-performance by a customer could also
result in losses.
Partnership Agreement. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available
cash (as defined in our partnership agreement) each quarter to our unitholders. In making cash
distributions, our general partner attempts to avoid large variations in the amount we distribute
from quarter to quarter. To facilitate this, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to
establish cash reserves to be used to pay distributions for any one or more of the next four
quarters. In addition, our partnership agreement allows our general partner to borrow funds to
make distributions to our unitholders, for example, in circumstances where we believe that the
distribution level is sustainable over the long-term, but short-term factors have caused available
cash from operations to be insufficient to sustain our level of distributions.  In addition, covenants
in our revolving credit facility may restrict our distributions.  We intend to make an approximate
$2.5 million distribution with respect to the second quarter on August 12, 2016.  See Note 8 of the
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included
under Part I, Item 1 for additional information.
Capital Expenditures.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our total capital expenditures
were approximately $34.9 million, which were primarily related to drilling, recompletions and
capital workovers.
Government Trust Account.  In 2015, the BSEE issued a preliminary report that indicated the
estimated cost of decommissioning the offshore production facilities associated with the Beta
properties may increase. We are working with BOEM and certain prior third party owners to
replace a portion of the funds maintained in the trust account pursuant to the government
obligation with one or more surety bonds, which we believe would free up additional cash
currently held in the trust account.  At June 30, 2016, there was approximately $148.0 million in
the trust account.
Working Capital.  We expect to fund our working capital needs primarily with operating cash
flows. We also plan to reinvest a sufficient amount of our operating cash flow to fund our
maintenance capital expenditures. Our growth capital expenditures, which include any
acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, are expected to be primarily
funded with external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility
and/or proceeds from the issuance of additional equity and debt securities. Our debt service
requirements are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and/or refinancing
arrangements. We expect to fund cash distributions to partners primarily with operating cash
flows or borrowings under our revolving credit facility. It is our belief that we will continue to have
adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our primary cash requirements.
As of June 30, 2016, we had a working capital balance of $107.8 million primarily due to a net
asset balance of $138.4 million of current derivative instruments partially offset by the timing of
accruals, which included accrued capital expenditures of approximately $6.4 million, accrued
lease operating expense of approximately $13.5 million and accrued interest payable of
approximately $21.9 million.
Revolving Credit Facility
OLLC is a party to a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility that matures in March 2018 and is
guaranteed by us and all of our current and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial
subsidiaries). As of June 30, 2016, we had $739.4 million of outstanding borrowings and $2.1
million of outstanding letters of credit.  The borrowing base is subject to redetermination on at
least a semi-annual basis based on an engineering report with respect to our estimated oil,
natural gas and NGL reserves, which will take into account the prevailing oil, natural gas and
NGL prices at such time, as adjusted for the impact of commodity derivative contracts.
Unanimous approval by the lenders is required for any increase to the borrowing base. As of
June 30, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants
under our revolving credit facility.
36
For additional information regarding our revolving credit facility amendments and redetermined
borrowing base, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined
Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1.
2021 Senior Notes
As of June 30, 2016, there was approximately $647.8 million aggregate principal amount of the
2021 Senior Notes outstanding. The 2021 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
(subject to customary release provisions) on a joint and several basis by all of our subsidiaries
(other than Finance Corp., which is co-issuer of the 2021 Senior Notes, and certain immaterial
subsidiaries). The 2021 Senior Notes will mature on May 1, 2021 with interest accruing at
7.625% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each
year. The 2021 Senior Notes were issued under and are governed by a base indenture and
supplements thereto. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $52.2 million of the 2021 Senior Notes at a weighted average
price of 48.99% of the face value of the 2021 Senior Notes. See Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for
additional information.
2022 Senior Notes
As of June 30, 2016, there was approximately $465.0 million aggregate principal amount of the
2022 Senior Notes outstanding. The 2022 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed
(subject to customary release provisions) on a joint and several basis by all of our subsidiaries
(other than Finance Corp., which is co-issuer of the 2022 Senior Notes, and certain immaterial
subsidiaries). The 2022 Senior Notes will mature on August 1, 2022 with interest accruing at
6.875% per annum and payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each
year. The 2022 Senior Notes were issued under and are governed by a base indenture and
supplements thereto.  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $32.0 million of the 2022 Senior Notes at a weighted average
price of 46.50% of the face value of the 2022 Senior Notes. See Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for
additional information.
Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities
The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities
for the periods indicated. The cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 has
been derived from both our consolidated financial statements and the previous owners’
combined financial statements. The combined financial statements of the previous owner reflect
the common control acquisition from Memorial Resource in February 2015. For information
regarding the individual components of our cash flow amounts, see the Unaudited Condensed
Statements of Consolidated and Combined Cash Flows included under Part I, Item 1 of this
quarterly report.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Operating Activities. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production
volumes and operating costs. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $44.3
million. Production decreased 2.0 Bcfe (approximately 5%) and average realized sales price
decreased $1.21 per Mcfe.  During 2016, lease operating expenses were $65.1 million, a
decrease of $20.3 million compared to 2015.  Taxes other than income decreased to $7.5 million
in 2016 from $12.7 million during 2015. We had a $11.6 million increase due to the timing of
working capital. We had a $12.2 million period-to-period increase in cash settlements received
on terminated commodity derivatives and we paid $27.1 million of premiums for commodity
derivatives in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities also included a $34.5 million
period-to-period increase in cash settlements received on expired commodity derivative
instruments. The period-to-period increase in cash settlements received on expired commodity
derivatives partially offset decreased revenues as previously discussed under “—Results of
Operations.”
Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 was $10.1 million, of which
$36.6 million was used for additions to oil and natural gas properties and $7.3 million was used
for additions to other property and equipment. These amounts were partially offset by $37.9
million in deposits and proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties primarily related
to the Permian Divestiture. Net cash used in investing activities during 2015 was $127.7 million,
of which $6.1 million was used to acquire oil and natural gas properties from third parties and
$128.3 million was used for additions to oil and natural gas properties. We also received a post-
closing settlement receipt of $9.6 million related to an acquisition of Wyoming properties during
2015. Various restricted investment accounts fund certain long-term contractual and regulatory
asset retirement obligations and collateralize certain regulatory bonds associated with our
offshore Southern California oil and natural gas properties. Additions to restricted investments
were $4.2 million during 2016 compared to $2.7 million during 2015.
Financing Activities. Distributions to partners during 2016 were $10.8 million compared to $92.6
million during 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the declared distribution rate.
During 2015, we paid $78.4 million to Memorial Resource in connection with a common control
acquisition transaction.
The Partnership had net repayments of $96.6 million under its revolving credit facility during
2016. The Partnership had net borrowings of $230.0 million under its revolving credit facility
during 2015 that were primarily used to fund a common control acquisition transaction and to
fund its drilling program. For additional information regarding the common control acquisition,
see Note 11 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1.
We repurchased $42.6 million in common units during 2015, which represented a repurchase
and retirement of 2,862,782 common units under the December 2014 repurchase program. This
repurchase program expired in December 2015. See Note 8 of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1 for
additional information regarding our 2015 repurchases.
During 2016, we repurchased an aggregate principal amount of approximately $84.2 million of
the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes for $40.5 million. During 2015, we repurchased a
principal amount of approximately $3.0 million of the 2022 Senior Notes for $2.6 million.
Adjusted EBITDA
We include in this report the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA and provide our
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash flows from operating activities, our
most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss):
Plus:
·Interest expense;
 ·Income tax expense;
 ·Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”);
 ·Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets (including oil and natural gas properties);
 ·Accretion of asset retirement obligations (“AROs”);
 ·Loss on commodity derivative instruments;
 ·Cash settlements received on expired commodity derivative instruments;
 ·Losses on sale of assets;
 ·Unit-based compensation expenses;
38
·Exploration costs;
·Exploration costs;  
 ·Acquisition and divestiture related expenses;
 ·Bad debt expense; and
 ·Other non-routine items that we deem appropriate.
Less:
·Interest income;
 ·Gain on extinguishment of debt
 ·Income tax benefit;
 ·Gain on commodity derivative instruments;
 ·Cash settlements paid on expired commodity derivative instruments;
 ·Gains on sale of assets and other, net; and
 ·Other non-routine items that we deem appropriate.
Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by
external users of our financial statements, such as investors, research analysts and rating
agencies, to assess:
·our operating performance as compared to that of other companies and partnerships in our
industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;
 ·the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our
indebtedness and make distributions on our units; and
 ·the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate actual cash flow available to pay
distributions to our unitholders, develop existing reserves or acquire additional oil and natural
gas properties.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash
flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity
presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA
in the same manner.

flows from operating activities, our most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each
of the periods indicated.

During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no significant changes since those
reported in our 2015 Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016 except for
indebtedness. Total indebtedness was approximately $1.8 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to
$2.0 billion at December 31, 2015. See Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part I, Item 1.
Off–Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2016, we had no off–balance sheet arrangements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that will affect us, see Note 2 of the Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part
I, Item 1.
ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
In the normal course of our business operations, we are exposed to certain risks, including
changes in interest rates and commodity prices. We may enter into derivative instruments to
manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative agreements for speculative
purposes. We do not designate these or plan to designate future derivative instruments as
hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of these instruments
are recognized currently in earnings. We believe that our exposures to market risk have not
changed materially since those reported under Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk,” included in our 2015 Form 10-K.
Commodity Price Risk
Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing that we receive for our oil, natural gas, and NGL
production. To reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices on our revenues, or to
protect the economics of property acquisitions, we periodically enter into derivative contracts with
respect to a portion of our projected production through various transactions that fix the future
prices received. It has been our practice to generally enter into costless collars and fixed price
swaps only with lenders under our credit agreement. During the three months ended June 30,
2016, we terminated certain “in-the-money” crude oil and NGL derivatives settling in 2016 and
certain crude oil basis swaps settling in 2016 and 2017. We received cash settlements of
approximately $39.3 million from the termination of these crude oil and NGL derivatives.
For additional information regarding the volumes of our production covered by commodity
derivative contracts and the average prices at which production is hedged as of June 30, 2016,
see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial
Statements included under Part I, Item 1.
Interest Rate Risk
Our risk management policy provides for the use of interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure to
market rate fluctuations by converting variable interest rates to fixed interest rates. Conditions
sometimes arise where actual borrowings are less than notional amounts hedged which has and
could result in over-hedged amounts from an economic perspective. From time to time we enter
into offsetting positions to avoid being economically over-hedged. See Note 5 of the Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included under Part I,
Item 1 of this quarterly report for interest rate swap arrangements that were outstanding at June
30, 2016.
The fair value of our senior notes are sensitive to changes in interest rates. We estimate the fair
value of the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes using quoted market prices. The carrying
value (net of debt issuance costs and any discount or premium) is compared to the estimated fair
value in the table below (in thousands):
June 30, 2016
 
 
 Carrying   Estimated  
 
Description
 Amount
  Fair Value 
2021 Senior Notes, fixed-rate, due May 1, 2021  $631,748  $349,805  
2022 Senior Notes, fixed-rate due August 1, 2022   453,498    230,158
41
Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk
We are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables
with several significant customers. In addition, our derivative contracts may expose us to credit
risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Some of the lenders, or certain of their
affiliates, under our credit agreement are counterparties to our derivative contracts. While
collateral is generally not required to be posted by counterparties, credit risk associated with
derivative instruments is minimized by limiting exposure to any single counterparty and entering
into derivative instruments only with counterparties that are large financial institutions.
Additionally, master netting agreements are used to mitigate risk of loss due to default with
counterparties on derivative instruments. These agreements allow us to offset our asset position
with our liability position in the event of default by the counterparty. We have also entered into the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”) with
each of our counterparties. The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide us and each of our
counterparties with rights of set-off upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or
our counterparty to a derivative, whereby the party not in default may set-off all liabilities owed to
the defaulting party against all net derivative asset receivables from the defaulting party. At June
30, 2016, after taking into effect netting arrangements, we had counterparty exposure of $197.3
million related to our derivative instruments. As a result, had all counterparties failed completely
to perform according to the terms of the existing contracts, we would have the right to offset
$272.7 million against amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at June 30, 2016.
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our
general partner, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) and under the Exchange Act) as of the
end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in
reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of our
general partner, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of our general partner have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of June 30, 2016.
Change in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as
Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2, respectively, to this quarterly report.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
For information regarding legal proceedings, see Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 12,
“Commitments and Contingencies – Litigation & Environmental,” of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this quarterly report, which is

ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS.
Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and
our other SEC filings could have a material impact on our business, financial position or results
of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently
believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. There have been no material
changes with respect to the risk factors since those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016 and our Current
Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 25, 2016.
