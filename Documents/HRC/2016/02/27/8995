<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers 
comprises four main parts. In chapter II, the report describes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities 
between May 2008 and March 2009, including country visits conducted during this period. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur has devoted this last thematic report to an analysis of parameters 
necessary to effectively guarantee the independence of judges (chap. III). He analyses both 
individual and institutional elements, which he deems able to reinforce or hamper the 
independent administration of justice. He refers to a wealth of international and regional 
standards relevant to the independence of the judiciary and the extensive work of the treaty 
bodies and decisions from regional organizations as well as previous work of the mandate. 
</p>
<p> Lastly, the report indicates the main recent developments in the area of international justice 
(chap. IV) by looking at developments in the different cases before the International Criminal 
Court. The Special Rapporteur also refers to recent judgments of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and 
examines progress made by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia. Furthermore, 
the report refers to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and the institution of proceedings by 
Belgium before the International Court of Justice concerning the case of the former President of 
Chad, Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are presented in chapter V 
and focus on measures to be taken by Member States to strengthen the independence of judges, 
in both its individual and institutional dimensions. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since taking up his duties in August 2003, the Special Rapporteur has addressed one or 
more main topics in each annual report. This report, the sixth by the current Special Rapporteur 
and the fifteenth since the mandate was established in 1994, examines parameters necessary to 
effectively guarantee the independence of judges. The Special Rapporteur analyses both 
individual and institutional aspects, which he deems able to reinforce or hamper the independent 
administration of justice. 
</p><p>2. In analysing this complex topic, the Special Rapporteur refers to international and regional 
standards relevant to the independence of the judiciary, among them article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), article 6 of the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, article 8 of the 
American Convention on Human Rights, article 26 of the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and article 12 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights, as well as the Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a 
Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, Recommendation No. R (94) 12 of the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe, the Statute of the Ibero-American Judge and the Beijing 
Statement of Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary in the LAWASIA (Law Association 
for Asia and the Pacific) region. Furthermore, he bases his analysis on a wealth of the work of 
the treaty bodies and decisions from regional organizations as well as on previous work of the 
mandate, including letters to Governments on alleged human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International meetings 
</b></p>
<p>3. In June 2008, the Special Rapporteur took part in the eight session of the Human Rights 
Council, where he presented his annual report (A/HRC/8/4), a report on exchanges with 
Governments concerning specific complaints (A/HRC/8/4/Add.1) and a report on his mission to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/8/4/Add.2). In the same month, he also 
participated in the fifteenth annual meeting of special procedures of the Human Rights Council.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. In September 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the seminar &#8220;Justice and democracy&#8221; 
which was organized by the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice and held in Cartagena, 
Colombia. At this occasion, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of high-level authorities. 
</p>
<p>5. In October 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the sixty-third session of the 
General Assembly in New York, where he presented his report (A/63/271), which examined the 
role of judges in protecting human rights during states of emergency. 
</p><p>6. On 17 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the annual meeting of the 
International Bar Association, dedicated to the Rule of Law, and made a presentation on the 
independence of the judiciary in the context of democracy. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>7. In December 2008, the Special Rapporteur attended the international conference on 
&#8220;Exclusion, a challenge to democracy&#8221; in Paris, organized by ATD Fourth World, where he 
made a presentation on &#8220;Access to justice and vulnerable groups&#8221;. On this occasion, he also met 
with the Paris Bar Association and contributed to its journal <i>Le Barreau autour du Monde</i> 
dedicated to the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the 
same month, he presided the panel debate on &#8220;New mechanisms to protect human rights&#8221; at the 
International Conference on the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, organized by the international section of the Lelio Basso Foundation in Rome. He also 
met with the organization &#8220;Magistrats europ&#233;ens pour la d&#233;mocratie et la loi&#8221; and the Italian 
Judges Association. 
</p>
<p>8. On 21 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur contributed to the seminar on the Prevention 
of Genocide, held in Geneva, and made a presentation focusing on ways and means to support 
national efforts in the prevention of genocide. 
</p>
<p>9. On 26 and 27 March 2009, the Special Rapporteur will participate as a resource person in a 
Cambodian national conference on the role of independent institutions, to be held in 
Phnom Penh. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>10. At the invitation of the Government of the Russian Federation, the Special Rapporteur 
visited the country from 19 to 29 May 2008. In January 2009, the Special Rapporteur visited 
Guatemala, also at the invitation of the Government (see A/HRC/11/41/Add.2 and Add.3, 
respectively). He wishes to thank both Governments for their cooperation regarding these visits. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the mandate holder will be able to visit Cambodia, 
Colombia, Fiji, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines in the 
near future; a positive reply from some of these States is still expected. On the other hand, he is 
grateful to those Governments that have already confirmed an invitation and hopes that a suitable 
time for these visits will be arranged shortly. He also recalls that some visit requests are pending 
for several other States, some of them for over 10 years such as those to Cuba, Egypt and 
Tunisia. In November 2008, the Special Rapporteur made a request to visit Iraq. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>12. A summary of communications sent to various Governments and the responses received, 
along with statistics for the reporting period (A/HRC/11/41/Add.1) has been published for the 
eleventh session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur was part of the group of seven independent experts invited by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolutions 7/20 and S-8/1 to submit a report with recommendations 
on how best to assist technically the Democratic Republic of the Congo in addressing the 
situation of human rights, with a view to obtaining tangible improvements on the ground, taking 
also into account the needs formulated by the Government of the country, and to also urgently 
examine the current situation in the East of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The report 
(A/HRC/10/59) was presented to the tenth session of the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  GUARANTEES OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE 
</b></p>
<p>14. Since very early in the existence of the mandate, the principle of the independence of 
judges and lawyers has been defined as international custom and general principle of law 
recognized by the international community, respectively, in the sense of article 38 (1) (b) and (c) 
of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, it has also been a treaty-based 
obligation, as shown by the requirement of &#8220;independence of a tribunal&#8221; established in article 14, 
paragraph 1, of the ICCPR, which, as stated by the Human Rights Committee in its general 
comment No. 32,<b>1</b> is an absolute right that is not subject to any exception. 
15. In addition, more than 20 years ago, a report to the then Sub-Commission on Prevention of 
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities highlighted that &#8220;The principles of impartiality<b>2</b> and 
independence are the hallmarks of the rationale and the legitimacy of the judicial function in 
every State. &#8230; Their absence leads to a denial of justice and makes the credibility of the judicial 
process dubious.&#8221;<b>3</b> As expressed in the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, &#8220;Judicial 
independence is a prerequisite to the rule of law and a fundamental guarantee of a fair trial.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. With a view to the paramount importance of this subject, the Special Rapporteur, in this 
last report to the Human Rights Council in his present function, attempts at defining parameters 
to effectively guarantee the independence of judges. Without intending to exhaustively present 
all elements having an impact on the independence of judges, he analyses individual and 
institutional aspects, which he deems can reinforce or hamper the independent administration of 
justice. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Institutional independence:  elements having an impact on the 
independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>17. In this chapter, the Special Rapporteur will analyse features having an impact on the 
independence of the judiciary as an institution. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Independence of the judicial function from other branches of 
power as prerequisite 
</b></p>
<p>18. It is the principle of the separation of powers, together with the rule of law, that opens the 
way to an administration of justice that provides guarantees of independence, impartiality and 
</p>
<p>

</p>

para. 5.2. 
<b>2
</b>  While the independence of the judiciary is referred to as the absence of improper interferences 
</p>
<p>into judicial affairs, impartiality normally denotes absence of prejudice or bias, see 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights, <i>Apitz Barbera et al. v. Venezuela</i>, 5/9/2008, para. 55, 
and European Court of Human Rights, <i>Piersack v. Belgium</i>, 1/10/1982, para. 30.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>transparency.<b>4</b> In this connection, it should be noted that the Human Rights Committee, in its 
general comment No. 32, emphasized that a situation where the functions and competencies of 
the judiciary and the executive are not clearly distinguishable, or where the latter is able to 
control or direct the former, is incompatible with the notion of an independent tribunal.<b>5</b> 
Therefore, the Committee pointed to this concern in several of its concluding recommendations 
and called for a clear demarcation between the respective competences of the different branches 
of power.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>19. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur, during several missions to countries in transition, 
questioned the paramount role of the office of the prosecutor and the amount of influence the 
prosecutor exerts over the pretrial and trial stages of judicial proceedings.<b>7</b> In this connection, he 
highlights the importance of the independence of the office of the prosecutor, in particular where 
it is responsible for the investigation and ex officio prosecution. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Guarantee at the constitutional level 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Basic Principles provide for the independence of the judiciary to be &#8220;guaranteed by the 
State and enshrined in the Constitution or the law of the country&#8221;. Similar provisions are to be 
found in the regional standards.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur considers it paramount that the independence of the judiciary be 
legally guaranteed at the highest possible level. Thus, in several country mission reports, he drew 
attention to the fact that the independence of the judiciary is enshrined in the Constitution.<b>9</b> In 
States, where this was not yet the case, he recommended that this principle be spelled out in the 
Constitution.<b>10</b> In other countries, where no written constitution exists, it should be considered a 
fundamental principle of law. 
</p>
<p>22. This principle, even if guaranteed in the Constitution, must also be given effect at the 
legislative level. Thus, domestic legislation needs to be brought in compliance with this 
principle. The Human Rights Committee expressed its concern at constitutional and legislative

 <p> 
</p>
<p>provisions that seriously endanger the independence of the judiciary pointing to the 
accountability of a court to the legislature.<b>11</b> In other instances, the Human Rights Committee 
pronounced its concern at the practice of the judiciary seeking the opinion of a Standing 
Committee of the legislature on the interpretation of laws, turning a Parliamentary Committee 
into the instance responsible for setting criteria and instructions which are binding on the 
judiciary.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Selection and appointment 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary prescribe that judges be selected 
on the basis of integrity and ability and that any method of judicial selection should include 
safeguards against judicial appointments for improper motives.<b>13</b> This key principle is also 
established by a number of regional standards.<b>14</b> Furthermore, the Principles and Guidelines on 
the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa highlight the importance of transparency 
and accountability in the selection and appointment procedures.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the variety of existing systems for the selection and 
appointment of judges worldwide. One can broadly distinguish political appointments (selection 
by the legislative or executive branches of power), appointments by popular elections, 
corporative appointments (by bodies composed of judges only), selection by judicial councils 
with plural representation, or a variety of mixed systems where the nominating body is of one 
type (e.g. judicial council) and the one in charge of appointments is of a different nature 
(e.g. a political appointing body). He wishes to highlight below aspects of selection and 
appointment procedures that crucially strengthen judicial independence. 
25. The Special Rapporteur notes the existence of manifold constitutional provisions and 
domestic legislation providing for the election of judges by the legislature. He would like to raise 
the general concern that the involvement of the legislature in judicial appointments risks their 
politicization.<b>16</b> On many occasions and in light of situations studied by the Special Rapporteur, 
it is difficult to ascertain the benefit this procedure brings, particularly to the selection of 
lower-level judges. But even for higher-level courts for which the selection of nominees is

Serbia; Committee against Torture, CAT/C/SRB/CO/1, para. 9; also CCPR/C/79/Add.50, 
para. 288. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>usually justified on grounds of the court&#8217;s need to give particular consideration to matters of 
general interest or welfare, in most cases political appointments are not appropriate means to 
reach those objectives. In particular, in times of transition from an authoritarian to a democratic 
system, it is crucial that the population gain confidence in a court system administering justice in 
an independent and impartial manner, free from political considerations. 
</p>
<p>26. Likewise, in many other countries, the executive branch of power has a decisive say in the 
selection and appointment of judges. The Committee against Torture<b>17</b> and the Human Rights 
Committee<b>18</b> expressed several times their concern in this regard, as did also the Special 
Rapporteur in several country mission reports,<b>19</b> given the risk this structure implies for the 
protection of the rights of individuals before the State. 
</p>
<p>27. Several regional standards, along with the Human Rights Committee in several concluding 
observations, recommend the establishment of an independent authority in charge with the 
selection of judges.<b>20</b> That was also recommended by the Special Rapporteur in several country 
visit reports.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The composition of this body matters greatly to judicial independence as it is required to 
act in an objective, fair and independent manner when selecting judges. While a genuinely plural 
composition of this body is recommended with legislators, lawyers, academicians and other 
interested parties being represented in a balanced way, in many cases it is important that judges 
constitute the majority of the body so as to avoid any political or other external interference. In 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, if the body is composed primarily of political representatives 
there is always a risk that these &#8220;independent bodies&#8221; might become merely formal or legal 
rubber-stamping organs behind which the Government exerts its influence indirectly. 
</p>
<p>29. In order to ensure that such a body is apt to select judges in an objective, fair and 
independent manner, the judiciary and other parties directly linked with the justice system must 
have a substantial say with respect to selecting and appointing the members of such a body.<b>22</b> 
According to some regional standards, members of the independent body should be selected by 
the judiciary.<b>23</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. In addition to the composition of the selecting body, it is also important to determine the 
extent of powers given to this organ, as this element has a great impact on the degree of 
independence of judges, not only from political power, but also from the selecting body itself. 
The competency of this body could range from conducting competitive examinations and 
interviews in order to appoint those who score highest to directly possessing the power to 
appoint nominees at its discretion. In order to secure the independence of judges and the 
selection of the most suitable candidates, the Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of the 
establishment and application of objective criteria in the selection of judges. The principle of 
objective criteria was also highlighted by the Human Rights Committee<b>24</b> and by the Committee 
against Torture.<b>25</b> These objective criteria should relate particularly to qualifications, integrity, 
ability and efficiency.<b>26</b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that selection of judges must be 
based on merit alone,<b>27</b> a key principle also enshrined in Recommendation No. R (94) 12<b>28</b> and 
the Statute of the Ibero-American Judge.<b>29</b> The Special Rapporteur underscores that competitive 
examinations<b>30</b> conducted at least partly in a written and anonymous manner can serve as an 
important tool in the selection process. 
</p>
<p>31. As a complement to a selection and nomination process that uses objective criteria to select 
judges, other procedures may be implemented to enhance the public certainty on the nominee&#8217;s 
integrity. Such could be the holding of public hearings where citizens, non-governmental 
organizations or other interested parties, are able to express their concern or support for 
particular candidates. 
</p>
<p>32. In this connection the Special Rapporteur refers to the appointment of the judges of the 
Supreme Court of Ecuador in 2005, which were made in accordance with his 
recommendations,<b>31</b> in particular those referring to objective criteria to select candidates with a 
view to their independence, competencies and integrity. This ensured the transparency of the 
selection and appointment processes. Furthermore, for the first time in Ecuador&#8217;s history, public

<p>hearings were held at which backgrounds of the nominees could be openly scrutinized. This 
experience was qualified by the United Nations as a major example of good practices.<b>32</b> 
33. Where an organ of the executive or legislative branch is the one formally appointing 
judges<b>33</b> following their selection by an independent body, recommendations from such a body 
should only be rejected in exceptional cases and on the basis of well established criteria that have 
been made public in advance. For such cases, there should be a specific procedure by which the 
executive body is required to substantiate in a written manner for which reasons it has not 
followed the recommendation of the above-mentioned independent body for the appointment of 
a proposed candidate. Furthermore, such written substantiation should be made accessible to the 
public. Such a procedure would help enhance transparency and accountability of selection and 
appointment. 
</p>
<p>34. When conducting country visits, the Special Rapporteur regularly examined the 
representation of women and of ethnic minorities in the judiciary.<b>34</b> In some countries, he 
concluded that this representation is very low or non-existent.<b>35</b> The Special Rapporteur 
underlined the importance to adopt and implement temporary special measures to achieve greater 
representation for both women and ethnic minorities until fair balance has been achieved.<b>36</b>

<p>of terrorism related cases.<b>39</b> In this respect, the Special Rapporteur refers to the joint report on 
the situation of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay, in which violations to the principle of the lawful 
judge and the right to fair trial were found.<b>40</b> The Special Rapporteur further points to the Draft 
Principles on the Administration of Justice by Military Tribunals which set out the principle that 
military courts should have no jurisdiction to try civilians. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Judicial budget 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Basic Principles and some regional standards state that it is the duty of each Member 
State to provide adequate resources to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions.<b>41</b> 
Furthermore, the Beijing Statement stipulates explicitly that executive powers affecting judges in 
their resources must not be used so as to threaten or bring pressure upon a particular judge or 
judges.<b>42</b> The Special Rapporteur, following several country visits, recommended that the 
respective Member States revisit the budget allocated to the judiciary with a view to 
progressively increasing it. He advocated that a fixed percentage of the GDP be established.<b>43</b> In 
one of his reports, he indicated a base line of 2 to 6 per cent of the national budget to be allocated 
to the judiciary.<b>44</b> In this connection, the Special Rapporteur points to Principle 42 of the Beijing 
Statement, which stipulates that, under important domestic economic constraints, the needs of 
the judiciary and the court system be accorded a high level of priority in the allocation of 
resources. The Special Rapporteur would like to point to good practices by some Member States 
that dispose either of a constitutional provision guaranteeing a fixed minimum percentage of the 
annual national budget to be allocated to the judiciary or who have otherwise achieved a decision 
in this regard.<b>45</b>  
</p>
<p>38. With regard to ensuring the independence of the judiciary, two different issues deserve 
analysis in relation to the judicial budget. First, the question is how to ensure that the allocation 
of funds to the courts be taken with the strictest respect for judicial independence. A second 
question arises with respect to the administration of funds allocated to the judiciary.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>39. With respect to the former, the Special Rapporteur consistently insisted that the judiciary 
needs to be effectively involved in the drafting of its budget.<b>46</b> He notes that there exist different 
traditions and practices in this connection. In some Member States, the judiciary proposes its 
draft budget directly to the executive body in charge of finances; in other cases the budgetary 
allocations are submitted indirectly through the executive body in charge of judicial affairs. In 
other States, the courts make their proposals directly. The Special Rapporteur highlights that, 
where it exists, the independent body responsible for the judiciary<b>47</b> should be vested with the 
role of receiving proposals from the courts, preparing a consolidated draft for the judicial budget 
and presenting it to the legislature. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur commends those Member States which have established a further 
safeguard for the active involvement of the judiciary: the right of the judiciary to participate in 
the deliberations of the budget in the legislature. 
</p>
<p>41. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to safeguards established to 
ensure that the amount of the budget resources allocated to fund the courts in the current fiscal 
year or subject to be allocated for the next financial year may be reduced solely with the consent 
of the judiciary or a body representing it.<b>48</b> He underlines that a reduction of the courts&#8217; budget 
significantly hampers the administration of justice. As a result, unjustified long delays occur in 
the appointment of judges and some Member States resort to the appointment of provisional 
judges.<b>49</b> 
42. The second issue, as mentioned above, is the management and administration of the budget 
allocated to the courts. The Special Rapporteur notes that in some Member States this task is 
entrusted to the judiciary or an independent authority responsible for the judiciary, while in 
others it is undertaken by a governmental body. Mixed systems also exist, in which budgets of 
higher or highest level courts are administered by themselves and the budget for the remaining 
courts by a special department of the executive.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that, in his opinion, entrusting the 
administration of funds directly to the judiciary or an independent body responsible for the 
judiciary is much more likely to reinforce the independence of the judiciary,<b>51</b> particularly in 
times of transition and/or tensions between the judicial and executive branches. Hence, he has

<p>issued recommendations in this regard to some Member States.<b>52</b> However, the judiciary or the 
above-mentioned independent body remain, as all other public authorities, accountable to 
independent and external oversight. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Freedom of association and expression 
</b></p>
<p>44. According to principle 9 of the Basic Principles, judges are free to form and join 
associations of judges or other organizations. The aim of such associations is to represent the 
judges&#8217; interests and to protect their judicial independence as this can be done more effectively 
in a corporate way.<b>53</b> One regional standard refers specifically to the objective of professional 
organizations to promote professional training<b>54</b> to strengthen the quality of decision-making. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes the importance of the participation of judges in debates 
concerning their functions and status as well as general legal debates. As such, judges need to 
preserve the dignity of their office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary, as 
stipulated in the Basic Principles<b>55</b> and the Bangalore Principles.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Assignment of court cases 
</b></p>
<p>46. The method for assigning cases within the judiciary is paramount for guaranteeing the 
independent decision-making of judges. The Basic Principles stipulate that such assignment 
within the court is an internal matter of judicial administration. This means that there must be no 
interference from the outside. 
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, there needs to be a mechanism of allocation that also protects judges from 
interference from within the judiciary. During several country visits, the Special Rapporteur 
pointed to practices of allocation of court cases hampering the independence of judges. For 
example, assignment of court cases at the discretion of the court chairperson may lead to a 
system where more sensitive cases are allocated to specific judges to the exclusion of others.<b>57</b> 
The Beijing Statement stipulates that ultimate control over the assignment of cases must belong 
to the chief judicial officer of the relevant court.<b>58</b> Also, in some Member States, court 
chairpersons, in specific cases, retain the power to assign cases to or withdraw them from

<p>specific judges which, in practice, can lead to serious abuse.<b>59</b> Therefore, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends to Member States to establish a mechanism to allocate court cases in an objective 
manner. One possibility could be drawing of lots or a system for automatic distribution 
according to alphabetic order.<b>60</b> A second one could be done through pre-determined court 
management plans which should incorporate objective criteria<b>61</b> according to which cases are to 
be allocated. These plans need to be as detailed as to prevent manipulation in the allocations of 
cases. 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Independence within the judiciary 
</b>48. The Special Rapporteur notes that the independence of judges needs to be protected both 
from outside and internal interference. For both, adequate structures within the judiciary are 
decisive. In this context, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to the procedures applied for the 
appointment or election of court chairpersons. 
</p>
<p>49. Judges need to work in an environment which is conducive to independent 
decision-making. To avoid having internal judicial hierarchy run counter to the independence of 
judges, the Special Rapporteur encourages Member States to consider introducing a system 
whereby court chairpersons are elected by the judges of their respective court. 
</p><p>50. Furthermore, appropriate structures and conditions need to be put in place in order to avoid 
situations in which the overturn of judgements by higher judicial bodies includes a sanction to 
the lower-level judges that made those rulings, which would result in a lessening of the 
independence of an individual judge within the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>9.  Investigations into allegations of improper interference 
</b></p>
<p>51. An important indicator for the independence of the judiciary is that inquiries are conducted 
into improper interferences into judicial affairs. In this context, it is important to note that the 
Human Rights Committee recommended to several Member States that independent and 
impartial investigations into all allegations of interference be conducted thoroughly and promptly 
and that perpetrators be prosecuted and punished.<b>62</b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that such 
investigations are a key means to prevent the reoccurrence of further interference and to detect 
systemic problems hampering the independence of the judiciary.

</p>
<p><b>B. Independence of judges:  elements having  
an impact on the status of judges 
</b></p>
<p>52. In this section, the Special Rapporteur analyses elements having an impact on the 
individual independence of judges. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment 
No. 32, stated that the requirement of independence refers, in addition to the procedure and 
qualifications for the appointment of judges, to the guarantees relating to their security of tenure 
until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, where such exist, the 
conditions governing promotion, transfer, suspension and cessation of their functions, and the 
actual independence of the judiciary from political interference by the executive branch and 
legislature.<b>63</b>  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Tenure and irremovability 
</b></p>
<p>53. Principle 12 of the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, principle I.3 of 
the Recommendation N. R (94) 12 and principle A 4 (l) of the Principles and Guidelines on the 
Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa require guaranteed tenures of judges until 
mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, where such exist. 
</p>
<p>54. The Human Rights Committee has repeatedly expressed concern at the lack of security of 
tenure.<b>64</b> Particularly, it raised concern about short terms of office<b>65</b> and requirements for regular 
review of judges&#8217; appointments by the executive.<b>66</b> The Special Rapporteur concluded that a 
short term for judges weakens the judiciary, affects their independence and their professional 
development.<b>67</b> 
</p>
<p>55. When reforming judicial systems, specific attention should be given to the issue of judges&#8217; 
tenure of office. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur recommended to some Member 
States, which were in situations of transition from an authoritarian to a democratic system, that 
reforms be directed at gradually extending tenures of judges so as to progressively introduce life 
tenures.<b>68</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also notes that probationary periods for judges are used by some 
Member States. Specific safeguards need to be established in order to prevent that such short 
initial appointments turn into a risk for the independence of the judiciary.<b>69</b> In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, a short, non-extendable, probationary period may be employed, provided that 
life appointment or fixed tenure is automatically granted afterwards, except for probationary 
judges who were dismissed as a consequence of disciplinary measures or the decision of an 
independent body following a specialized procedure that determined that a certain individual is 
not capable of fulfilling the role of a judge.<b>70</b> In any case, the Special Rapporteur is concerned 
that the requirement of re-appointment following a probationary period runs counter to the 
principle of the independence of judges.<b>71</b> 
57. Independently of whether the mandate of the judge is for life or for a limited period of 
time, it is crucial that tenure be guaranteed through the irremovability of the judge for the period 
he/she has been appointed. The irremovability of judges is one of the main pillars guaranteeing 
the independence of the judiciary. Only in exceptional circumstances may the principle of 
irremovability be transgressed. One of these exceptions is the application of disciplinary 
measures, including suspension and removal. As the Special Rapporteur noted in one of his 
country mission reports, the law must give detailed guidance on the infractions by judges 
triggering disciplinary measures, including the gravity of the infraction which determines the 
kind of disciplinary measure to be applied in the case at hand.<b>72</b> This requirement is also 
reflected on Recommendation N. R (94) 12, principle VI (2). 
</p>
<p>58. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur recalls that disciplinary measures to be adopted 
must be in proportionality to the gravity of the infraction committed by the judge. Therefore, he 
calls for the adoption of a well-defined scheme of available disciplinary measures.<b>73</b> In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur underscores that judges must not be removed from office 
because of errors in judicial decisions or because their decision has been overturned on appeal or 
review by a higher judicial body. This has also been confirmed by the Human Rights Committee 
on several occasions.<b>74</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>59. According to the Basic Principles, judges shall be subject to suspension or removal only 
for reasons of incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties. The 
Human Rights Committee, in paragraph 20 of its general comment No. 32, specified that judges 
may be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence.<b>75</b> 
</p>
<p>60. On many occasions, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that, in a number of 
Member States, the legislature or executive branches play an important, if not decisive, role in 
disciplining judges. The Human Rights Committee has also raised its concern about 
parliamentary control over disciplinary procedures of judges<b>76</b> and about the dismissal of judges 
by the executive, e.g. before the expiry of the term for which they have been appointed, without 
specific legal and procedural safeguards.<b>77</b> The Special Rapporteur has expressed his concern 
with regard to the Judicial Commission of the Supreme Court of Venezuela which can remove 
judges at its discretion without neither a justified cause nor disciplinary proceedings 
guaranteeing the fairness of the dismissal.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p>61. In this context, it is vital to note that the Human Rights Committee highlighted the 
importance of the existence of an independent body or mechanism with the responsibility of 
disciplining judges.<b>79</b> It further highlighted that the procedure before such a body must be in 
compliance with the due process and fair trial guarantees.<b>80</b> This requirement applies also if the 
removal is decided by political bodies, e.g. the legislative branch. Most importantly and 
regardless of the type of disciplinary body, an independent review of the decision of the

</p>
<p>disciplinary body is paramount.<b>81</b> In cases of dismissal by political bodies, it is even more 
important that their decision be subject to judicial review. This requirement is also reflected in 
international and regional standards.<b>82</b> 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur considers that temporary or provisional judges, which exist in a 
few Member States, must have the same guarantees as those with a life or fixed-term tenure, 
given that they perform judicial tasks. He highlighted that the discretional dismissal of temporary 
judges puts the independence of the judiciary at stake.<b>83</b> Therefore, temporary judges can only be 
dismissed by disciplinary procedures that respect fair trial guarantees and are conducted by an 
independent body. 
</p>
<p>63. In order to enhance transparency, it is recommended that decisions related to disciplinary 
measures be made public.<b>84</b> 
</p>
<p>64. As a second exception, one may refer to situations of transition from an authoritarian to a 
democratic system, in which the objective of limitations to the principle of irremovability would 
be to end impunity and to prevent the reoccurrence of serious human rights violations. The 
Special Rapporteur has analysed these issues in more detail in previous reports.<b>85</b> In the current 
context, he wishes to reiterate that while judicial renewal may be approached in different ways, 
in all cases compliance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary must be 
ensured. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur highlights that an individualized analysis 
(&#8220;review&#8221;) together with the possibility to appeal the decision with a view to obtaining an 
independent review in compliance with the Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary<b>86</b> is the preferable approach for judicial renewal.<b>87</b> Thus, in such cases, it would be

</p>
<p>crucial to inquire objectively on a case-by-case basis whether a judge was appointed unlawfully 
or whether he/she derives judicial power from an act of allegiance so as to determine to relieve 
the person from his/her functions.<b>88</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Immunity 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Basic Principles stipulate that judges should enjoy personal immunity from civil suits 
for monetary damages for improper acts or omissions in the exercise of their judicial functions. 
According to the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in 
Africa, judicial officers shall also not be criminally liable for such acts or omissions. The Human 
Rights Committee emphasized that judges should not be held criminally liable for handing down 
&#8220;unjust judgments&#8221; or committing legal errors in their decisions.<b>89</b> 
66. In order to protect judges from unwarranted prosecution, the Special Rapporteur considers 
it essential that judges also be granted some degree of criminal immunity.<b>90</b> The principle is far 
from being implemented universally and he noted the absence of legislation on judicial immunity 
during a recent country visit recommending the adoption of specific norms.<b>91</b> 
</p>
<p>67. On the other hand, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that it is paramount to ensure the 
accountability of judges so that immunity may not be abused. In this connection, in several 
country mission reports, he has made reference to procedures for lifting judicial immunity.<b>92</b> The 
Special Rapporteur underscores that such procedures must be legislated in great detail and 
should aim at reinforcing the independence of the judiciary. He therefore considers that if such a 
decision solely depends on the discretion of a body of the executive branch, this may expose 
judges to political pressure and jeopardize their independence. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Promotion 
</b></p>
<p>68. Principle 13 of the Basic Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary stipulates that the 
promotion of judges should be based on objective factors, in particular ability, integrity and 
experience. Similar provisions are contained in the regional standards.<b>93</b> 
</p>

<p>69. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 32, recommended that States 
establish clear procedures and objective criteria for the promotion of judges.<b>94</b> In this context, the 
Committee noted with satisfaction the establishment of a career structure for the judiciary.<b>95</b> 
70. Furthermore, the Human Rights Committee raised the question of the body<b>96</b> and method 
by which judges are granted promotion. It emphasized that if such a decision depends on the 
discretion of the administrative authorities, this may expose judges to political pressure and 
jeopardize their independence and impartiality.<b>97</b> 
71. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that final decisions on promotions should be 
preferably taken by an independent body in charge of the selection of judges, composed of at 
least a majority of judges.<b>98</b> This would enhance the coherence of any decision taken in relation 
to the judicial career and thereby strengthen the independence of the judiciary. 
72. The Special Rapporteur underscores that, while adequate professional experience is an 
essential prerequisite for promotion, it should not be the only factor taken into account in such 
decisions. Promotion, like with initial selection and appointment, should be merit-based, having 
regard to qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiency. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Conditions of service 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Judicial salary 
</b>73. International and regional standards require that the remuneration of judges be guaranteed 
by law. Principle 11 of the Basic Principles and selected regional standards also require that the 
remuneration be adequate.<b>99</b> Yet, reality on the ground is far from being consistent with this 
principle.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>74. In this connection, it is worth recalling that the Special Rapporteur, in several of his 
country mission reports, noted the low level of judicial salaries, in some instances constituting 
remuneration well below the average national income or not even providing for a decent 
livelihood.<b>100</b> The Special Rapporteur also highlighted the problem that, despite the existence of 
pertinent legal provisions, salaries effectively paid to the judges are not adequate.<b>101</b> Another 
specific problem is the great difference in remuneration between different levels of judges, 
which causes problems to attract and keep judges in rural areas.<b>102</b> 
75. Both the Special Rapporteur and the Human Rights Committee have further raised in 
several instances the concern of significant delay in the payment of salaries.<b>103</b> The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that low salaries and salary arrears are a major factor contributing to the 
endemic corruption within several judicial systems. He therefore calls that judges be 
remunerated with due regard for the responsibilities and the nature of their office, as also 
recommended by the Human Rights Committee.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Human and material resources 
</b>76. The Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and regional standards require 
that Member States provide adequate resources to enable the judiciary to properly perform its 
functions. The Human Rights Committee deplored that the lack of human and material 
resources is an aspect which may undermine the independence of the judiciary.<b>105</b> 
Recommendation No. R (94) 12 gives specific examples for proper working conditions.<b>106</b> 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur, in his country mission reports, underlined the importance of 
adequate human and material resources to the proper functioning of justice. He noted that in 
some countries there is a negligible share of the budget allocated to the judicial authority, which 
causes a shortage of judges and courts, low salaries and unacceptable material conditions.<b>107</b> As a 
consequence, he actively recommended that a higher percentage of the national budget be 
allocated to improving human and material resources of the judicial system.<b>108</b> In some countries,

</p>
<p>he noted a significant discrepancy between courts in different regions, depending on the degree 
of willingness of the respective local authorities to support their functioning with material 
resources.<b>109</b> In this connection, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that while duly respecting 
the federal systems of some Member States, it remains the task of the central authorities to 
ensure that appropriate human and material resources are available to the courts so as to 
administer justice properly. 
<b>(c) Security 
</b>78. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the security of judges is a subject too often 
neglected in the face of multiple and multifaceted attacks against members of the judiciary in a 
number of countries. This is reflected in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s annual reports on country 
situations, which show the dimension of this concern.<b>110</b> The Human Rights Committee, in 
paragraph 19 of its general comment No. 32, stated that it is necessary to protect judges against 
conflicts of interest and intimidation. To this end, the security of judges should be adequately 
guaranteed by law, as it is also enshrined in the Basic Principles.<b>111</b> In accordance with the 
Beijing Statement, it is incumbent upon the executive authorities to ensure the security and 
physical protection of judges and their families at all times. Furthermore, the Statute of the 
Ibero-American Judge requires that the necessary measures be in accordance with the risks to 
which judges and their families are exposed.<b>112 </b>Recommendation No. R (94) 12 gives specific 
examples of security measures, such as providing for security guards on court premises or police 
protection for judges who may become or are victims of serious threats.<b>113</b> 
79. In numerous cases, the Special Rapporteur has denounced the inadequate efforts by State 
authorities to respond and provide protection to judges, even when reports had been submitted to 
the police or the judicial authorities.<b>114</b> In this connection, he underlines once again the 
importance of the adoption of preventive security measures for increased protection of judges, in 
particular to protect those judges examining cases of large-scale corruption and organized crime, 
terrorism and crimes against humanity.<b>115</b>

</p>
<p><b>(d) Training 
</b>80. According to the Basic Principles and various regional standards,<b>116 </b>appropriate training is 
one of the preconditions to be selected for judicial office. The Human Rights Committee 
recommended that particular attention should be given to the training of judges in order to enable 
them to render justice promptly and impartially.<b>117</b> 
81. Besides the importance of pre-service and initial training, the Special Rapporteur has 
focused his attention on continuing learning opportunities of judges.<b>118</b> In one of his country 
mission reports, he emphasized that lack of adequate training and professional knowledge also 
means that judges are more easily influenced.<b>119</b> 
82. In this context, he would like to emphasize that Recommendation No. R (94) 12 
specifically provides for training also during the judicial career, which should be free of charge 
and concern particularly recent legislation and case law.<b>120</b> The Statute of the Ibero-American 
Judge states that continuing training is generally voluntary, but can be mandatory in specific 
cases, such as taking up higher judicial duties or major legal reforms. Furthermore, it enshrines 
that continuing training is a right of the judge and an obligation of the judiciary. 
Recommendation No. R (94) 12 enshrines the duty of the judges to undergo any necessary 
training in order to carry out their duties in an efficient and proper manner. 
</p>
<p>83. On the occasion of several country missions, the Special Rapporteur noted with 
satisfaction the existence of an institution providing for continuing legal education<b>121</b> or 
recommended the establishment of such an institution to the those Member States which had not 
yet set up such body.<b>122</b> 
</p>
<p>84. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur also wishes to point to systems of judicial 
careers with periodic examinations, which exist in some Member States. Such examinations 
should be carried out by the independent body in charge with the selection of judges and serve 
the continuing quality of the administration of justice.

<p><b>IV.  MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Central African Republic</b>. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, the alleged President and 
Commander-in-chief of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) was transferred to 
The Hague on 3 July 2008, following his arrest by Belgian authorities on 24 May 2008 at the 
request of the ICC. He initially appeared before Pre-Trial Chamber III of the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) on 4 July 2008.  
</p>
<p>86. <b>Darfur, Sudan</b>.<b> </b> The Special Rapporteur regrets that, at the time of writing of this report, 
no developments have been reported by the Government regarding the execution of warrants for 
Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb on 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He 
urges the Government to follow up promptly on the Court&#8217;s request of October 2007. 
</p>
<p>87. On 4 March 2009, the Pre-Trial Chamber I issued a warrant for the arrest of Omar Hassan 
Ahmad Al Bashir, President of the Sudan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The 
crime of genocide is not included in the warrant issued for the arrest. Nevertheless, the judges 
stressed that if additional evidence is gathered by the Prosecution, the decision would not prevent 
the Prosecution from requesting an amendment to the warrant of arrest in order to include the 
crime of genocide. This is the first warrant of arrest ever issued for a sitting Head of State by the 
ICC. 
</p>
<p>88. <b>Democratic Republic of the Congo</b><i>. </i>On 18 November 2008, the ICC decided to proceed 
with the trial of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the founder and leader of the Union des patriotes 
congolais (Union of Congolese Patriots). Trial Chamber I recommenced the trial on 
26 January 2009. On 26 September 2008, the charges were confirmed for Mathieu Ngudjolo 
Chui, the alleged former leader of the National Integrationist Front (FNI) and Germain Katanga, 
the alleged commander of the Patriotic Resistance Force in Ituri (FRPI).  
</p>
<p><b>B.  International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
</b></p>
<p>89. On 26 February 2009, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
(ICTY) handed down its first judgement for crimes perpetrated by Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (FRY) and Serbian forces against Kosovo Albanians during the 1999 conflict in 
Kosovo. Former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola &#352;ainovi&#263;, Yugoslav Army (VJ) 
General Neboj&#353;a Pavkovi&#263; and Serbian Police General Sreten Luki&#263; were each sentenced to 
22 years&#8217; imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war. 
Yugoslav Army General, Vladimir Lazarevi&#263;, and Chief of the General Staff, Dragoljub Ojdani&#263;, 
were found guilty of aiding and abetting the commission of a number of charges of deportation 
and forcible transfer of the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo and each sentenced to 
15 years&#8217; imprisonment. Milan Milutinovi&#263;, the former President of Serbia, was acquitted of 
all charges. 
</p>
<p>90. Radovan Karad&#382;i&#263;, who was arrested on 21 July 2008 by the Serbian authorities, was 
subsequently transferred to the ICTY on 30 July 2008. Crimes for which he was indicted include 
genocide, complicity in genocide, extermination, murder and wilful killing. He initially appeared 
before the court on 31 July 2008.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda 
</b></p>
<p>91. On 18 December 2008, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda rendered its 
judgement concerning four senior officers of the Rwandan army in 1994. It sentenced 
Colonel Th&#233;oneste Bagosora, Director of Cabinet in the Rwandan Ministry of Defence, 
Major Aloys Ntabakuze, commander of the Para Commando Battalion, and 
Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, commander of the Operational Sector of Gisenyi, to life 
imprisonment for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes based on their role in 
crimes committed in Rwanda. The court acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, head of the military 
operations bureau (G-3) of the army general staff, of all charges against him and ordered 
his release. It also acquitted each of the accused of conspiring to commit genocide 
before 7 April 1994. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Other relevant developments 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia</b>.<b> </b>On 17 February 2009, the initial 
hearing in the first case of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) 
started with the trial of Kaing Guek Eav (&#8220;Duch&#8221;) who faces charges of crimes against humanity 
and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, in addition to the offences of homicide 
and torture under Cambodian criminal law. 
</p>
<p>93. <b>Special Tribunal for Lebanon</b>. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon started functioning 
on 1 March 2009. The Tribunal was established pursuant to Security Council 
resolution 1757 (2007) to prosecute persons responsible for the attack of 14 February 2005 
resulting in the death of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and in the death or 
injury of other persons and related cases. On 3 March 2009, the Security Council reiterated the 
importance of the full cooperation of Member States with the Office of the Prosecutor in order to 
enable effective investigations and prosecutions. The mixed or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; tribunal comprises 
seven foreign and four Lebanese judges. 
94. <b>International Court of Justice</b>. On 19 February 2009, Belgium instituted proceedings 
before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Senegal regarding Senegal&#8217;s obligation to 
prosecute the former President of Chad, Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;, or to extradite him to Belgium for the 
purposes of criminal proceedings. In its application, Belgium maintains that Senegal, where 
Mr. Habr&#233; has been living in exile since 1990, has taken no action on its repeated requests to see 
Mr. Habr&#233; prosecuted in Senegal, failing his extradition to Belgium, for acts including crimes of 
torture and crimes against humanity. Mr. Habr&#233; was indicted on 3 February 2000 in Senegal for 
complicity in crimes against humanity, acts of torture and barbarity and placed under house 
arrest. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The present report demonstrates the number and variety of factors that impact on 
the independence of judges, both in an individual and institutional dimension. It shows that 
procedures for the selection and appointment of judges as well as the term and security of 
their tenure are key factors to ensure the independence of judges. Among the factors </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>endangering the independence of the judiciary, the Special Rapporteur underscores with 
profound concern the growing tendency of several Member States to fail to comply with 
their obligation to appoint an adequate number of judges necessary for an effective 
functioning of the administration of justice and to appoint temporary or probationary 
judges. Moreover, the possibility of a judicial career, including procedures for promotion, 
and adequate working conditions are decisive factors for the status of judges. A 
constitutionally provided guarantee of the independence of the judiciary is paramount, 
along with respect to the principle of the &#8220;lawful&#8221; judge. Emphasis is to be given to the 
allocation of sufficient funding to the judiciary and a self-governed financial management. 
Independence from within the judiciary was noted as an important concern, together with 
the assignment of court cases. Finally, the right of judges to participate in general and legal 
debates, together with the guarantee to form and join associations and to defend their 
status and rights in a corporate way were given special attention. 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In order to assist Member States to strengthen the independence of judges, the 
Special Rapporteur makes the recommendations that follow. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>With respect to selection, appointment and promotion of judges, he recommends 
that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States consider establishing an independent body in charge of the 
selection of judges, which should have a plural and balanced composition, and 
avoid politicization by giving judges a substantial say. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States adopt legislation enshrining objective criteria to be applied in the 
selection of judges, ensuring that selection of judges be based on merit only. 
Member States consider the possibility of selecting judges by competitive exams 
conducted at least partly in a written and anonymous manner.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Selection and appointment procedures be transparent and public access to 
relevant records be ensured. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Clear procedures and objective criteria for the promotion of judges be established 
by law. Final decisions on promotions be preferably taken by the independent 
body in charge of the selection of judges. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>As regards tenure, irremovability, disciplinary measures and immunity, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States consider the progressive introduction of life tenures for judges. 
</b>&#8226; <b>Reviews of judges&#8217; appointments by the executive be abolished. 
</b>&#8226; <b>Specific safeguards be established to ensure that probationary appointments of 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges do not put the independence of the judiciary at stake. Probationary judges </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>be automatically granted life appointment or fixed tenure unless they were 
dismissed as a consequence of disciplinary measures or the decision of an 
independent body following a specialized procedure that determined that a certain 
individual is not capable of fulfilling the role of a judge. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States give paramount attention to upholding the key principle of 
irremovability. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States establish an independent body in charge of disciplining judges. 
</b>&#8226; <b>Member States adopt legislation giving detailed guidance on the infractions by 
</b></p>
<p><b>judges triggering disciplinary measures, including the gravity of the infraction 
which determines the kind of disciplinary measure. Disciplinary measures must be 
proportional to the gravity of the infraction. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Decisions related to disciplinary measures be made public. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adequate civil and criminal immunity for judges be guaranteed by the 
Constitution or equivalent, and that detailed procedures for lifting immunity be 
inscribed in law, reinforcing the independence of the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Regarding conditions of service, he recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Judges be remunerated adequately, with due regard for the responsibilities and 
the nature of their office and without delay. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Adequate human and material resources be allocated to ensure the proper 
functioning of justice. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Special attention be paid to ensuring the security of judges, in particular the 
adoption of preventive security measures for increased protection of judges 
handling cases of large-scale corruption, organized crime, terrorism, crimes 
against humanity, or any other cases exposing them to higher risk. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Besides pre-service and initial training, focused attention be paid to continuing 
legal education of sitting judges. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>With respect to institutional guarantees, the Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Competencies of the different branches of power be clearly distinguished and 
enshrined in the Constitution or equivalent. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The independence of the judiciary be enshrined in the Constitution or be 
considered as a fundamental principle of law. Both principles must adequately be 
translated into domestic law. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>As regards the judicial budget, he recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>A minimum fixed percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) be allocated to the 
judiciary by the Constitution or by law. Under important domestic economic 
constraints, the needs of the judiciary and the court system be accorded a high 
level of priority in the allocation of resources. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The judiciary be given active involvement in the preparation of its budget. 
</b>&#8226; <b>The administration of funds allocated to the court system be entrusted directly to

<p><b>the judiciary or an independent body responsible for the judiciary. 
</b>102. <b>To strengthen freedom of expression and association of judges, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Freedom of expression and association of judges be effectively guaranteed by law 
and practice. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The establishment of a Judges&#8217; Association be supported by Member States on 
account of its importance as a guarantor of an independent judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>To strengthen structures and procedures within the judiciary, he recommends that:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Member States create a mechanism to allocate court cases in an objective manner. 
</b>&#8226; <b>Adequate structures within the judiciary and the courts be established to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>improper interference from within the judiciary. 
</b>&#8226; <b>Allegations of improper interference be inquired by independent and impartial 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations in a thorough and prompt manner. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The present analysis and the above recommendations are based on the vast 
experience accumulated by the mandate since its creation in 1994. The Special Rapporteur 
is of the opinion that time has come to approve a comprehensive set of principles in order 
to ensure and further the independence of the judiciary. This tool may serve as a reference 
to all Member States and particularly those undergoing a period of political transition. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the mandate elaborate an updated 
study on individual and institutional parameters to ensure and strengthen the 
independence of prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers.
