<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/25.   Prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
</p>
<p>Genocide, as well as other relevant international instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering </i>that the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention 
</p>
<p>and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, adopted on 9 December 1948 and 
</p>
<p>succeeded by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the next 
</p>
<p>day, provides an important opportunity for the international community to draw the 
</p>
<p>attention of all States to the significance of the Convention and to invite them to 
</p>
<p>redouble their efforts for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the crime of genocide<b> </b>is recognized in the Convention as an 
</p>
<p>odious scourge which has inflicted great losses on humanity and that further 
</p>
<p>international cooperation is required to facilitate the timely prevention and 
</p>
<p>punishment of the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> about the occurrence in recent history of genocide, 
</p>
<p>recognized as such by the international community, on the basis of and as defined in 
</p>
<p>the 1948 Convention, and bearing in mind that massive, serious and systematic 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights and international humanitarian law might result in 
</p>
<p>genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into consideration </i>that States parties to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against 
</p>
<p>Humanity of 26 November 1968 have agreed that no statutory limitation shall apply to 
</p>
<p>such crimes, including the crime of genocide, irrespective of the date of their 
</p>
<p>commission, </p>

<p><i> Affirming</i> that impunity for such crimes encourages their occurrence and is a 
</p>
<p>fundamental obstacle to the furtherance of cooperation among peoples and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of international peace and security, and that fighting impunity for such 
</p>
<p>crimes is an important factor in their prevention, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the significant progress made by the international community 
</p>
<p>in the past 60 years, including within the United Nations system, in developing 
</p>
<p>relevant mechanisms and practices to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, 
</p>
<p>thereby contributing to the effective implementation of the Convention, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 96 (I) of 11 December 1946, in which 
</p>
<p>the Assembly declared genocide a crime under international law, and all subsequent 
</p>
<p>resolutions within the United Nations system that have contributed to the 
</p>
<p>establishment and development of the process of prevention and punishment of the 
</p>
<p>crime of genocide, including Assembly resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging with appreciation</i> that genocide is defined among the most 
</p>
<p>serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole in the Rome 
</p>
<p>Statute of the International Criminal Court, and anticipating that the functioning of the 
</p>
<p>Court with a high number of ratifications of the Statute and the functioning of other 
</p>
<p>relevant international criminal tribunals will help increase accountability for the crime 
</p>
<p>of genocide, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that the Council is mandated by the General Assembly to address 
</p>
<p>situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and 
</p>
<p>to make recommendations thereon, and that it should also promote the effective 
</p>
<p>coordination and mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the important contribution of the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>system to efforts towards preventing situations in which the crime of genocide could 
</p>
<p>be committed, </p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its full support for the mandate of the Special Adviser of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on the prevention of genocide, who acts, inter alia, as an early 
</p>
<p>warning mechanism to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide, </p>

<p><i> Taking note with appreciation </i>of the presentation of the reports of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General submitted to the Council on the implementation of the Five-Point 
</p>
<p>Action Plan and the activities of the Special Adviser (E/CN.4/2006/84 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/7/37), as well as of the convening of two interactive dialogues with the 
</p>

</p>
<p> 2.<i> Expresses its appreciation</i> to all States that have ratified or acceded to 
</p>
<p>the Convention, and in particular to the States that have done so in the years following 
</p>
<p>the adoption of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/62 of 20 April 2005; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the 
</p>
<p>Convention to consider doing so as a matter of high priority and, where necessary, to 
</p>
<p>enact national legislation in conformity with the provisions of the Convention; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Reiterates </i>the responsibility of each individual State to protect its 
</p>
<p>population from genocide, which entails the prevention of<b> </b>such a crime, including 
</p>
<p>incitement to it, through appropriate and necessary means; 
</p>
<p> 5.<b> </b><i>Stresses</i> the importance of enhanced international cooperation, 
</p>
<p>including through the United Nations system and through regional organizations, 
</p>
<p>aimed at fostering the principles enshrined in the Convention; </p>
<p> 6.<i> Calls upon</i> all States, in order to deter future occurrences of genocide, 
</p>
<p>to cooperate, including through the United Nations system, in strengthening 
</p>
<p>appropriate collaboration among existing mechanisms that contribute to early 
</p>
<p>detection and prevention of massive, serious and systematic violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights, which if not halted, could lead to genocide; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Recognizes</i> the important role of the Secretary-General in contributing 
</p>
<p>to prompt consideration of early warning or prevention cases, as mandated by 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolution 1366 (2001) of 30 August 2001, and the functions of the 
</p>
<p>Special Adviser, who, in accordance with his mandate, collects existing information, </p>

<p>in particular from within the United Nations system, liaises with the United Nations 
</p>
<p>system on activities for the prevention of genocide and works to enhance the capacity 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations to analyse and manage information relating to genocide or 
</p>
<p>related crimes; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Welcomes</i> the decisions of the Secretary-General and of the

</p>
<p>to strengthen his office; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> all Governments to cooperate fully with the Special Adviser 
</p>
<p>in the performance of his work, to furnish all relevant information requested and to

</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights and the relevant special procedures and treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies in addressing the challenge of collating information on massive, serious and 
</p>
<p>systematic violations of human rights, and thereby contributing to a better 
</p>
<p>understanding and early warning of complex situations that might lead to genocide; 
</p>
<p> 11.<i> Encourages</i> the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights to further enhance the systematic exchange of 
</p>
<p>information between their offices and between the Special Adviser and all relevant

</p>
<p>human rights of persons belonging to the national, ethnic, racial or religious groups as 
</p>
<p>outlined in article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
</p>
<p>Crime of Genocide; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Emphasizes </i>the importance, when addressing complex situations that 
</p>
<p>might lead to genocide as defined in the Convention, of a prompt and comprehensive 
</p>
<p>examination of a set of multiple factors, including legal factors, the existence of 
</p>
<p>groups at risk, the massive, serious and systematic violation of human rights, and the 
</p>
<p>resurgence of systematic discrimination, the prevalence of expressions of hate speech 
</p>
<p>targeting persons belonging to national, ethnic, racial or religious groups, especially if 
</p>
<p>they are uttered in the context of an actual or potential outbreak of violence; </p>
