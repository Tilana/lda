2.1 
Production from the Tui Area Oil Fields contributed to sales revenue recorded of A$10.6 million during the year. Revenue was lower than in 
the  previous  corresponding  year  due  to  a  lower  sales  quantity  of  173,168bbls  (2016)  nett  to  PPP  versus  253,587bbls  (2015)  nett  to  PPP 
resulting from 2015 inventory stores being sold compared to an larger inventory balance in 2016.  In addition, lower average sales price has 
been  achieved  in  2016  of  US$42  per  barrel  (2015  US$72).    Actual  average  production  rates  for  the  year  were  3,797bbls  per  day  (2016) 
compared to 4,034bbls per day (2015). 
 
2.2 & 2.3 
Loss for the half-year was A$19.4 million after a non cash impairment of A$11.14 million to the company’s oil and gas production asset as a 
result of declining oil prices reducing the assets value in use assessment.  In addition, exploration costs during the period of A$1.4 million were 
written-off.  During the period the Company received A$1.04 million exploration costs refund in relation to Oi well costs.  The amount has 
been recorded as other income since the balances in relation to Oi have been fully written-off during the financial year 2015.  Income and 
royalty taxes expense of A$1.3 million, the Company’s share of Tui operating costs of A$14.8 million and administration, finance and other 
costs of A$2.4 million were also incurred during the period.  Cash held at 30 June 2016 was A$25.3 million equivalent including A$0.3 million 
held in the accounts of various joint ventures. 
 
The  Consolidated  entity’s  operating  loss  after  tax  for  the  year  amounted  to  A$19.4  million  (2015:  loss  A$23.6  million).    The  lower  loss 
recorded compared to 2015 was primarily due to a lower impairment of A$4.4 million in this period compared to 2015, and less exploration 
expenditure being written off on a successful efforts method between the two periods of A$5.2 million.  Production costs were A$7.3 million 
lower as a result of lower amortisation charges as a result of impairment of the asset in 2015.  Administrative expenses were A$1.4 million 
less  than  2015  due  to  cost  cutting.    Volatility  of  foreign  exchange  rates  between  reporting  dates  resulted  in  movement  of  A$1.6  million 
compared to the 2015 year.  In addition, other income from exploration costs being refunded in relation to Oi of A$1.04 million was received 
during the period.  This was offset by less Income from Tui oil sales of A$11.2 million due to a lower sales quantity of 173,168bbls (2016) nett 
to PPP versus 253,587bbls (2015) nett to PPP resulting from 2015 inventory stores being sold compared to a larger inventory balance in 2016.  
In addition a lower average sales price was achieved in 2016 of US$42 per barrel (2015 US$72).  Actual gross average production rates for the 
year were 3,797bbls per day (2016) compared to 4,034bbls per day (2015).  A  higher tax expense of A$5.0 million occurred  between the 
periods as a result of the reversal of deferred tax in connection with the impairment of the company’s oil and gas production asset.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Summary of Financial Position 
Cash held at 30 June 2016 was A$25.3 million equivalent including A$0.3 million held in the accounts of various joint ventures.  During 
the  finanical  year  2016  costs  were  incurred  and  capitalised  for  pre-development  work  in  CRD  in  Block  07/03  of  A$2.3  million.    In 
addition,  PPP’s  share  of  Tui  inventory  at  30  June  2016  was  approximately  51,757  barrels  which  have  been  recorded  at  cost.    The 
Company had invested a net A$1.1 milion in available for sale investments at the end of the period 2016.  A non cash impairment of 
A$11.14  million  to  the  company’s  oil  and  gas  production  asset  as  a  result  of  declining  oil  prices  reduced  the  assets  value  in  use 
assessment.  Deferred tax balances in conncection with the company’s oil and gas production asset were also reversed. 
 
Summary of Financial Performance 
The Consolidated entity’s operating loss after tax for the year amounted to A$19.4 million (2015: loss A$23.6 million).  The lower loss 
recorded  compared  to  2015  was  primarily  due  to  a  lower  impairment  of  A$4.4  million  in  this  period  compared  to  2015,  and  less 
exploration expenditure being written off on a successful efforts method between the two periods of A$5.2 million.  Production costs 
were A$7.3 million lower as a result of lower amortisation charges as a result of impairment of the asset in 2015.  Administrative 
expenses were A$1.4 million less than 2015 due to cost cutting.  Volatility of foreign exchange rates between reporting dates resulted 
in movement of A$1.6 million compared to the 2015 year.  In addition, other income from exploration costs being refunded in relation 
to Oi of A$1.04 million was received during the period.  This was offset by less Income from Tui oil sales of A$11.2 million due to a 
lower sales quantity of 173,168bbls (2016) nett to PPP versus 253,587bbls (2015) nett to PPP resulting from 2015 inventory stores 
being sold compared to a larger inventory balance in 2016.  In addition a lower average sales price was achieved in 2016 of US$42 per 
barrel (2015 US$72).  Actual gross average production rates for the year were 3,797bbls per day (2016) compared to 4,034bbls per day 
(2015).  A higher tax expense of A$5.0 million occurred between the periods as a result of the reversal of deferred tax in connection 
with the impairment of the company’s oil and gas production asset. 
 
Review of Operations 
New Zealand PMP 38158  
Tui Area Oil Project 
The  Tui  Area  Oil  Fields  comprise  three  accumulations,  the  Tui,  Amokura  and  Pateke  Fields  which  are  processed  by  the  Umuroa,  a 
permanently moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (“FPSO”).  
 
Production  from  the  Tui  Area  Fields  for  the  financial  year  2015-16,  excluding  fuel  oil,  was  1.39  million  barrels  (PPP  share  208,430 
barrels gross of fuel oil), this was better than forecast predominantly due to better than expected performance from Pateke-4H, better 
net production from Pateke-3H and facility uptime approximately 2% higher than that forecasted.  Cumulative gross production to the 
end of June 2016 was 38.9 million barrels (gross of fuel oil).  
 
Remaining gross developed 2P reserves at the end of June 2016 are estimated at 4.4 million barrels, 0.66 million barrels net to PPP. 
This is based on ultimate total recoverable reserves from the Tui fields of 41 MMbls (2P) (previously reported in the September 2014 
Quarterly report*) plus an increase in 2P recoverable reserves of 2.4MMbls (previously reported on 6th January 2015*) to reflect an 
extension of the field life attributable to Pateke 4-H. These estimates of reserves exclude oil forecast to be burned as fuel on the FPSO 
(fuel oil) and include an assumption of a return to higher oil prices during the life of the field. This use of oil for fuel is required due to 
the inevitable reduction in the amount of associated gas available for fuel as oil production declines.
*Please refer to these releases for the Competent persons statement
4
The reserves attributable to Pateke-4H are an estimate based on upon pre-drill modelling undertaken by PPP and New Zealand Oil & 
Gas (previously advised to the market on 6th January 2015) and remain uncertain pending further production data which may be used 
to improve the estimate of ultimate recovery. 
 
The Contract for the Umuroa was renegotiated and extended by one year to 31 December 2017. 
 
Vietnam 
Block 07/03 
Following the successful further appraisal of CRD (Cá Rồng Đỏ) oil and gas discovery by the drilling of CRD-3X and sidetrack in financial 
year 2013-14, activities during the current year focused on assessing the commercial viability of the discovery and preparing a Field 
Development Plan (FDP).  
 
CRD Development 
The joint venture partners advised Petrovietnam (PVN) of a Declaration of Commerciality during the year and the Operator, Repsol 
(Talisman), concluded studies leading to the selection of a development concept, targeting first oil and gas production in the second 
half of 2019.   
 
The FDP is based on a 20-slot Tension Leg Wellhead Platform (TLWP) tied back to a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) 
Facility.  Oil will be exported from the FPSO via shuttle tanker and all Gas will be developed and exported for sale via a gas pipeline 
built and operated by Petrovietnam Gas (PVGas) with all gas transported through the NCSP-1 pipeline. 
 
The design plateau oil rate for the CRD Facilities is 30,000 barrels of oil per day and gas export from the CRD Field of 55 million cubic 
feet per day (mmcfd).  The FPSO will be capable of exporting at a maximum rate of 130 mmcfd to facilitate the development of other 
near-by discoveries. 
 
Undrilled near field prospects at Cobia, North East CRD, and West CRD provide possible upside oil and gas potential and in the case of 
success could be tied back to a CRD development. 
 
The Final Investment Decision (“FID”) by the joint venture partners remains subject to the completion of the FDP including finalising 
contractual terms for the TLWP, FPSO, and gas commercialisation. The JV is working towards FID and obtaining the final approval of 
the Vietnamese authorities to proceed with development by the end of 2016. 
 
Exploration  
The Joint Venture received approval to retain a 2,108km2 portion of Block 07/03, the Cobia Area, for an additional 5 year period. 
During the year a 2000km2 3D seismic survey was completed to assess possible upside oil and gas potential in undrilled field prospects 
North East and West of the CRD discovery which, in the case of success, could be tied back to a CRD development.  Review of the 
Seismic data has identified drillable prospects and the Joint Venture continues to assess when these could be drilled.

Block 121  
Following the unsuccessful drilling of the Whale prospect (121-CV-1X) and the inability to secure a farm-in partner to share the costs 
and risk of drilling an additional well in the licence the Block 121 Joint Venture parties agreed to withdraw from the block. The licence 
was surrendered on 24 December 2015 with all commitments either fulfilled or exceeded.  
 
Joint Petroleum Development Area (Timor-Leste and Australia) 
JPDA 06-103 
In  2013  Oilex  the  operator  of  JPDA06-103  on  behalf  of  the  JV  submitted  a  request  to  the  designated  authority,  the  Autoridade 
Nacional do Petróleo (“ANP”), to terminate the PSC by mutual agreement in accordance with its terms and without penalty or claim 
due to concerns associated with uncertainty of the PSC tenure. 
 
The ANP responded to the JV indicating that the request had been rejected and that the PSC would be terminated on 15 July 2015 and 
a monetary claim sought for payment of the estimated cost of exploration activities not carried out in 2013 and certain local content 
obligations set out in the PSC. The ANP has subsequently provided notice of termination effective 15 July 2015 with a demand for 
payment of approximately US$17m, net US$2.6m to PPP. The JV has disputed the financial claim and the parties continue to discuss 
the financial liability of the JV with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement for a lesser amount.

Annual Reserves Review 
 
Tui Area Field reserves are determined by the Operator, AWE, after review and agreement by the JV partners at PM38158 Technical 
Committee Meetings. A life of field reserves and production update is undertaken at least once per year as part of the financial year 
planning cycle. PPP monitors field performance by reference to a daily Tui production report and a monthly operations report; both 
provided by the Operator AWE. Tui production is reviewed at PPP Board meetings, and reserves updates are also reviewed with the 
PPP Board as and when they occur.  
 
Shareholder Note 
 
As this report confirms significant risk factors exist in the oil and gas business.  These factors, largely beyond the control of PPP or the 
Operator of the drilling operations can affect PPP’s underlying business resulting in significant increases in capital costs of drilling oil 
wells incurred because of delays due to weather conditions and operational problems during drilling programs.  Other influences on 
the companys business may be exposure to volitility in oil prices, and exchange rates should operational events change.  These 
changes could cause actual results to differ materially than those anticipated.

alignment of executive performance and shareholder interests; and 
ensures that remuneration reflects the respective roles and responsibilities and performance of its senior executive team.
• 
 
The Board approves the remuneration package of KMP.   
The proportion of fixed and performance based elements of the remuneration of executives is a reflection of individual roles, levels of 
seniority and degree of responsibility that  key personnel have in PPP and market factors. 
 
Fixed Remuneration 
Key management personnel are entitled to a fixed remuneration amount inclusive of the guaranteed superannuation contribution, set 
out later in the report.  This amount is not based upon performance and is determined by the Board and takes account of the role and 
responsibility of each KMP and relevant industry benchmark data.

DIRECTORS REPORT continued 
 
Performance Based Remuneration 
 
Short Term Incentive 
 
The CEO’s contract was terminated due to cost rationalisation on the 24th August 2015 and therefore there was no STI was awarded to 
the CEO in FY 2016.   
 
During  the  2015  year  the  non-executive  directors  considered  the  extent  to  which  the  CEO  contributed  to  the  Company's  overall 
financial, corporate and operating performance during the financial year under review.  In doing so, the Directors consider a range of 
factors, including but not limited to, whether the Company met its corporate budget for the review period, whether the Company met 
its business growth objectives during the review period, the continued successful management of the Company’s investments in New 
Zealand  &  Vietnam  during  the  review  period  and  the  number  of  potential  new  investment  opportunities  which  were  considered 
during the review period. Directors consider this method of assessment appropriate for the Company.  No STI was approved by the 
Board for the 2015 or the 2016 financial year. 
 
The assessment of performance of all executives is made by the board. 
 
General  discretionary  bonuses  based  on  the  performance  of  the  Company  and  of  individuals’  performance  may  also  be  paid  to 
executives  other  than  the  CEO  from  time  to  time.    However,  the  Company  does  not  usually  reward  employees  by  providing 
discretionary bonuses.  During the review period, no key management personnel received a discretionary bonus. 
 
Share Options 
 
On 28 June 2013 the Company issued the CEO 1,049,000 options over unissued ordinary shares in the Company at no cost to the CEO 
as settlement of 50 % of his 2013 STI and as an incentive to the CEO to increase the share price and create shareholder value.  The 
options vested immediately and are exercisable by the CEO at any time up to and including the expiry date.  The options expired on 27 
June 2016.  The exercise price of the options was 12 cents each.  These options did not entitle the CEO to participate in any share issue 
of  the  Company  or  any  other  body  corporate  unless  the  options  were  exercised  prior  to  such  share  issue  taking  place.    No 
performance hurdles were required to be met in respect of the options. 
 
The fair value of the options were calculated as at the grant date using a Black-Scholes model and the value was  allocated during the  
reporting  period  of  issue  as  the  options  vested  immediately  on  grant.    In  valuing  the  options,  market  conditions  were    taken  into 
account. 
 
As at the date of this report, there were no unissued ordinary shares under option.  
 
The following factors and assumptions were used in determining the fair value of the option on grant date:

The grant of these options was not a factor in determining any cash bonus component, in respect of the 2015 financial year of issue. 
 
No options were exercised during the financial year.

The principal activities of the consolidated entity during the course of the financial year included: 
 
• exploration and appraisal of oil and gas deposits; and 
• production and sale of oil. 
 
There were no significant changes in the nature of the activities of the consolidated entity during the year. 
 
6. 
 
The consolidated operating loss after tax for the year amounted to $19,382,000 (2015: loss $23,597,000).  Refer to pages 4 to 6 for 
further details of the Operating and Financial review. 
 
7. 
 
During the 2016-2017 financial year the Company will focus on the assessment of a foreshadowed development decision in relation to 
the CRD (Cá Rồng Đỏ) oil and gas discovery in Vientam, and expansion of PPP’s asset base will also be a prime consideration. 
 
8. 
 
Based upon the results of the monitoring programme over the past year at the Tui Oil Field, directors are not aware of any significant 
breaches. 
 
9. 
 
Other than as disclosed in this report there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this 
report  any  other  item,  transaction  or  event  of  a  material  and  unusual  nature  likely,  in  the  opinion  of  the  directors,  to  affect 
significantly the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the consolidated entity 
in subsequent financial years.  
 
10. 
 
Directors’ Interests 
The relevant interest of each director in the ordinary share capital of the Company and other related body corporate as notified by the 
directors to the Australian Stock Exchange in accordance with S205G(1) and 300 (11) of the Corporations Act 2001, at the date of this 
report is as follows: 
 
Mr P Sullivan 
Mr A W Tattersfield 
 
Mr D Morrison 
Mr G Worner 
 
 
11. 
 
The Company has agreed to indemnify the current directors and officers of the consolidated entity against all liabilities that may arise 
from  their  position  as  directors  or  officers,  except  where  the  liability  arises  out  of  conduct  involving  a  lack  of  good  faith.    The 
agreement stipulates that the Company will meet the full amount of any such liabilities, including costs and expenses. 
 
During or since the end of the financial year the Company paid a premium for an insurance policy to protect the directors and officers. 
This insurance policy prohibits the disclosure of the nature and extent of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium. 
 
Amounts disclosed for remuneration exclude insurance premiums paid by the consolidated entity in respect of directors’ and officers’ 
liability  insurance.    The  premium  paid  has  not  been  allocated  to  the  individuals  covered  by  the  insurance  policy  as,  based  on  all 
available information; the directors believe that no reasonable basis for such allocation exists.

Indemnification of auditors
DIRECTORS REPORT continued 
 
12. 
 
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms of its audit 
engagement agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit (for an unspecified amount). No payment has been made 
to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the financial year. 
 
13. 
 
During the year Ernst & Young, the Company’s auditor, has performed certain other services in addition to its statutory duties. The 
Board has considered the non-audit services provided during the year by the auditor and, is satisfied that the provision of those non-
audit services during the year by the auditor is compatible with, and did not compromise, the auditor independence requirements of 
the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:
Non-audit services
All  non-audit  services  were  subject  to  the  corporate  governance  procedures  adopted  by  the  Company  and  have  been 
reviewed by the Board to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and 
The non-audit services provided do not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 
110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor’s own work, acting 
in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing 
risks and rewards.

•
Ernst & Young received or are due to receive the following amounts for the provision of non-audit services:

In the opinion of the directors there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the consolidated entity that occurred during 
the financial year under review not otherwise disclosed in this report or the consolidated financial report. 
 
16. 
 
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Class Order 2016/191 dated 24th March 2016 and in accordance with that Class Order, 
amounts in the financial report and Directors’ report have been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated.

1. 
 
Pan Pacific Petroleum NL (the “Company”) is a No Liability company domiciled and incorporated in Australia.  The company is a for profit 
entity for the purposes of preparing financial statements. The address of the Company’s registered office is Level 3, 123 Walker Street, 
North Sydney, NSW, 2060.  The consolidated financial report of the year ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in joint operations.  The Group primarily is involved in 
petroleum exploration, appraisal and production (see note 12 and 13). 
 
2. 
 
(a)  
The financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards 
(AASBs)  (including  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations)  adopted  by  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  (AASB)  and  the 
Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial report of the Group also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS’s) and interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
 
The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 30th August 2016. 
 
(b)  
The financial report is prepared on a historical cost basis except for available assets for sale financial assets that have been measured at 
fair value. 
 
(c)  
These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Company’s functional currency. 
The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Class Order 2016/191 dated 24th March 2016 and in accordance with that Class Order, all 
financial information presented in Australian dollars has been rounded to the nearest thousand unless otherwise stated. 
 
(d)  
The preparation of a financial report in conformity with AASB’s requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  Actual results 
may differ from these estimates, judgements and assumptions.  
 
Estimates and associated assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future period affected.  
 
Information about critical estimates, judgements and assumptions in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes: 
 
Note 13 - recoverability of Oil and Gas assets –production and development 
 
The assumptions required to be made in order to assess the recoverability of Oil and Gas assets – development and production, include 
the future price of oil, future costs of production, an estimated discount rate, rehabilitation of restoration estimates and estimates of oil 
reserves.  Refer to note 13 for assumptions used. 
 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.  Impairment considerations are performed in accordance with note 3(g). 
 
Note 12 – recoverability of Exploration and evaluation assets 
 
The Group’s policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure is discussed in note 3(t). The application of this policy requires estimates 
and assumptions as to future events and circumstances, particularly in relation to the assessment of whether economic quantities of 
reserves have been found. Any  such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after  having 
capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, management concludes that the capitalised expenditure is unlikely to be recovered 
by future exploitation or sale, then the relevant capitalised amount will be written off in the Statement of comprehensive income.

Significant accounting policies
Note 23 - provision for restoration and rehabilitation obligations 
 
In  determining  the  fair  value  of  the  provision,  assumptions  and  estimates  are  made.    We  have  estimated  that  the  timing  of  the 
restoration  provision  will  occur  between  1  and  3  years  as  such  we  have  used  a  discount  rate  reflective  of  that  time  period.    The 
Company deems that the Government bond rate is an appropriate rate to use in this provision calculation. 
 
Note 10 - recoverability of deferred tax assets 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the losses can be utilised.  Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be 
recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of the future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. 
The  accounting  policies  set  out  below  have  been  applied  consistently  to  all  periods  presented  in  these  consolidated  financial 
statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities. 
 
Note 13 - Reserve estimates  
Estimates  of  recoverable  quantities  of  proven  and  probable  reserves  reported  include  assumptions  regarding  commodity  prices, 
exchange rates, discount rates, production and transportation costs for future cash flows. It also requires interpretation of geological 
and  geophysical  models  in  order  to  make  an  assessment  of  the  size,  shape,  depth  and  quality  of  reservoirs  and  their  anticipated 
recoveries. The economic, geological and technical factors used to estimate reserves may change from period to period. Changes in 
reported  reserves  can  impact  asset  carrying  values,  the  provision  for  restoration  and  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets,  due  to 
changes in expected future cash flows. Reserves are integral to the calculation of depreciation and amortisation charged to the income 
statement.

(a)  
 
(i) 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.  In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account.  The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statement from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.  
 
(ii) 
The Group’s interests in unincorporated joint operations are those entities over whose activities the Group has the right to a share of 
the assets and liabilities of the Joint arrangement.  The Groups interest in the unincorporated joint operations are brought to account by 
including its share of joint operation assets, liabilities and expenses and the groups revenue from the sale of its share of output on a line 
by line basis, from the date the joint operation commences to the date joint operation ceases. 
 
(iii) 
The  balances  and  effects  of  transactions,  between  controlled  entities  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  eliminated  in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
 
(b) 
 
(i) 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of each controlled entity at exchange rates at the 
dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance date are translated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate at that date.  Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at 
fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. 
 
(ii) 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Australian dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income 
and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  to  Australian  dollars  at  spot  rates  at  the  day  at  which  the  transaction  occurred.  
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments
(c) 
 
(i) 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and trade and other payables. 
 
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described 
below. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and deposits at call.  Cash also includes the Group’s share of cash held as participant 
of joint operations. 
 
Accounting for finance income and expense is discussed in note 3(l). 
 
(ii) 
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment 
losses. 
 
 (d) 
 
(i) 
Items of plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (see accounting 
policy 3(g)). 
 
Gains and losses on  disposal of an item of plant and equipment are determined  by comparing  the proceeds from disposal with  the 
carrying  amount  of  plant  and  equipment  and  are  recognised  net  within  “other  expenses”  or  “other  income”  in  statement  of 
comprehensive income. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation reserve are transferred to retained 
earnings. 
 
(ii)

Depreciation is recognised in statement of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of 
an item of plant and equipment.

Depreciation  methods,  useful  lives  and  residual  values  are  reviewed  annually  for  appropriateness.    When  changes  in  estimates  are 
made, adjustments are reflected prospectively in current and future periods only.
Subsequent expenditure
Leased assets
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it 
relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
 
(e) 
 
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon 
initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that 
asset. 
 
Other leases are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Statement of Financial Position.

Oil and consumables are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.  Oil inventory costs are allocated on an average basis and 
include  direct  production  expenses,  amortisation  and  other  fixed  and  variable  overhead  costs  based  on  normal  operating  capacity 
directly related to production activities. 
 
(g) 
 
Non-financial assets 
The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Group’s  non-financial  assets,  except  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  (see  note  3(t))  and  tax 
deferred assets (see note 3(m)), are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of an impairment. If 
any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
 
The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  post-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to that asset. 
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  when  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  exceeds  its  recoverable  amount.  Impairment  losses  are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows.  Generally, this results in the Group evaluating its oil and gas assets on a field-by-field 
basis. 
 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no 
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An 
impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
 
 (h) 
 
Wages, salaries, annual leave 
Liabilities  for  employee  benefits  for  wages,  salaries,  and  annual  leave  expected  to  be  settled  within  12  months  of  the  year-end 
represent present obligations resulting from employees’ services provided up to the reporting date and, are calculated as undiscounted 
amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay at reporting date including related on-costs.  
 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
 
Long service leave 
The provision for employee benefits to long  service leave represents the  present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be 
made resulting from employees’ services provided to reporting date.  
 
The provision is calculated using estimated future increases in wage and salary rates including related on-costs and expected settlement 
dates based on turnover history and is discounted using the Australian corporate bond rate (2015: Australian corporate bond rate) at 
balance date which most closely match the terms of maturity of the related liabilities.  The unwinding of the discount is treated as long 
service leave expense.  
 
Superannuation 
The Company contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans.  Contributions are recognised as an expense in the Statement 
of comprehensive income as they are due. 
 
Share-based payment transactions 
The  grant  date  fair  value  of  share  based  payment  awards  granted  to  employees  is  recognised  as  an  employee  expense,  with  a 
corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period.

(i) 
 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably, and is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability. 
 
Restoration and Rehabilitation 
The  restoration  and  rehabilitation  provision  is  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  expected  future  cash  flows  as  a  result  of  the 
estimated cost of legal and constructive obligations to restore operating locations in the period in which the obligation is incurred.  The 
nature of the restoration activities includes the removal of facilities, abandoning of wells and restoring the affected areas. 
 
The unwinding of the discount is recorded as an interest charge within finance costs. 
 
(j) 
 
Revenues are recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST). 
 
Sale of goods 
Sales comprise revenue earned from the provision of petroleum products.  Revenue is recognised when title transfers and the risks and 
rewards of ownership pass to the customer. 
 
(k) 
 
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease.  Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease 
expense and spread over the lease term. 
 
 (l) 
 
Finance income comprises interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses on a net basis.  Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
in the statement of comprehensive income, using the effective interest method.   
 
Finance expenses comprise unwinding of discount on restoration provisions (see accounting policy 3(i)).   
 
(m) 
 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. 
 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
 
Deferred  tax  is  recognised  providing  for  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  for  financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be 
applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date. 
 
A  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  future  taxable  profits  will  be  available  against  which  the 
temporary difference can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
 
Royalties 
Government  royalties  are  treated  as  taxation  arrangements  when  they  are  imposed  under  Government  authority  and  when  the 
calculation of the amount payable falls within the definition of “taxable profit” for the purposes of AASB 112 – Income taxes. Current 
and  deferred  tax  is  then  provided  on  the  same  basis  as  described  above.  Royalty  arrangements  that  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for 
treatment as a tax are recognised on an accruals basis.

Revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except where the amount of 
GST  incurred  is  not  recoverable  from  the  Australian  Taxation  Office  (ATO)  or  the  Inland  Revenue  Department  (IRD)  (NZ).    In  these 
circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. 
 
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO 
or IRD is included as a current asset or liability in the statement of financial position.  
 
Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and 
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO or IRD are classified as operating cash flows. 
 
(o) 
 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit 
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to 
an employee.

An  operating  segment  is  a  component  of  the  Group  that  engages  in  business  activities  from  which  it  may  earn  revenues  and  incur 
expenses,  including  revenues  and  expenses.    An  operating  segment’s  operating  results  are  reviewed  regularly  by  the  CEO  to  make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is 
available.  
 
Segment results that are reported to the CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a 
reasonable basis.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure costs capitalised represents an accumulation of costs incurred in relation to separate areas of 
interest for which rights of tenure are current and in respect of which:
Significant accounting policies (continued)
Exploration and evaluation asset
(i)
(ii)
Such  costs  are  expected  to  be  recouped  through  successful  development  and  exploitation  of  the  area  of  interest,  or 
alternatively, by its sale; or 
Exploration and/or evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment  and/or  evaluation  of  the  existence  or  otherwise  of  economically  recoverable  reserves  and  active  and 
significant operations in, or in relation to, the areas of interest are continuing.
Oil and gas assets
Exploration and evaluation expenditure are impaired in the Statement of comprehensive income under the successful efforts method of 
accounting, during the period  that exploration work demonstrates that an area of interest, or any part thereof, is no longer prospective  
for the economically recoverable reserves or when the decision to abandon an area of interest is made. An area of interest is defined by 
the Group, as being a permit area, where rights of tenure are current. 
 
Upon technical feasibility and commercial viability of an area of interest, Exploration and evaluation assets for the area of interest is 
transferred from exploration and evaluation assets to Oil and Gas assets – development. 
 
The recoverability of Exploration and evaluation assets is contingent upon successful development and commercial exploitation, sale of 
the  area  of  interest,  the  results  of  further  exploration,  agreements  entered  into  with  other  parties,  and  also  upon  meeting 
commitments under the terms of permits granted and joint operations agreements. 
 
 (u) 
 
Development 
Oil and gas assets development include construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as pipelines and the 
cost of development wells. 
 
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All 
other repairs and maintenance are expensed in the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period, in which they are 
incurred. 
 
No amortisation is provided, in respect of developing assets, until they are reclassified as oil and gas assets – production. 
 
Production 
Production assets capitalised represent the accumulation of all development expenditure incurred by the Group in relation to areas of 
interest  in  which  petroleum  production  has  commenced.  Expenditure  on  production  areas  of  interest  and  any  future  expenditure 
necessary to develop proven and probable reserves to meet current commitment under sales contracts, are amortised, as stated below 
using  the  production  output  method,  or  on  a  basis  consistent  with  the  recognition  of  revenue.  The  carrying  value  is  assessed  for 
impairment in accordance with 3(g). 
 
Amortisation 
Once  production  commences,  oil  and  gas  assets  are  amortised  over  the  life  of  the  proved  and  probable  reserves  on  a  units  of 
production basis. Thus, the economic life of such equipment is dependent on future production and remaining reserves, and therefore 
varies from project to project.   
 
(v) 
 
Borrowing costs relating to oil and gas assets under development up to the date of that substantially all activities necessary to prepare 
the oil and gas asset under development for intended use are complete, are capitalised as a cost of development. Where funds are 
borrowed specifically for qualifying projects the actual borrowing costs incurred are capitalised. Where the projects are funded through 
general borrowings the borrowing costs are capitalised based on the weighted average borrowing rate.

Ordinary shares 
Ordinary  shares  are  classified  as  equity.  Incremental  costs  directly  attributable  to  issue  of  ordinary  shares  and  share  options  are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effect. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as a liability in the period in 
which they are declared. 
 
(x) 
 
Available for sale (AFS) financial investments 
 
AFS financial investments include equity investments.  Equity investments classified as AFS are those that are neither classified as held 
for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
 
After initial measurement, AFS financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses recognised 
as  Other  Comprehensive  Income  (OCI)  and  credited  in  the  AFS  reserve  until  the  investment  is  de-recognised,  at  which  time  the 
cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other operating income or the investment is determined to be impaired, when the cumulative 
loss is reclassified from the AFS reserve to the statement of profit or loss in finance costs.  The Company has implemented trade date 
accounting for those AFS financial assets that are purchased or sold prior to balance date but settled after balance date. 
 
The Group evaluates whether the ability and intention to sell its AFS financial assets in the near term is still appropriate.  When, in rare 
circumstances,  the  Group  is  unable  to  trade  these  financial  assets  due  to  inactive  markets,  the  Group  may  elect  to  reclassify  these 
financial assets if management has the ability and intention to hold the assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity. 
 
(y) 
 
Available for sale (AFS) financial investments 
 
For AFS financial investments, the Group assess at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an investment  or a 
group of investments is impaired.  In the case of equity investments classified as AFS, objective evidence would include a significant or 
prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost.  “Significant” is evaluated against the original cost of the investment 
and “prolonged” against the period in which the fair value has been below its original cost.  When there is evidence of impairment, the 
cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that 
investment  previously  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  –  is  removed  from  OCI  and  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income.  Impairment losses on equity investments are not reversed through the statement of profit or loss; increases in 
their fair value after impairment are recognised directly in OCI.

Overview 
 
The Group have exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: 
• 
• 
• 
 
This  note  presents  information  about  the  Group’s  exposure  to  each  of  the  above  risks,  their  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for 
measuring and managing risk, and the management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout this financial 
report. 
 
Risk Management Framework 
The Board is responsible for the identification and management of financial and other business risks in accordance with the Company’s 
risk management policy, while the Board of directors has overall responsibility for approving the Company’s risk management strategy 
and framework, and monitoring its effectiveness.  There is no separate risk management committee. 
 
Risk  management  policies  are  established  to  identify  and  analyse  the  risks  faced  by  the  Group,  to  set  appropriate  risk  limits  and 
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes 
in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through their training and management standards and procedures, aim to 
develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. 
 
The forecast financial position of the Group is continually monitored and derivative financial instruments can be used to hedge exposure 
to fluctuations in commodity prices. 
 
The Board oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the 
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables, available for sale financial assets, derivative instruments and joint operations. 
 
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any provisions for losses, represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral or other security obtained.  At 30 June 2016 the 
Group had not recognised impairment losses for trade receivables (2015: nil). 
 
The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposure. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
The Group has elected to jointly market and sell its share of Tui Crude Oil production with the other Joint Operations parties.  Where the 
Joint operation parties elect to accept the marketing agent of Tui Crude Oil as their counter party in oil sales agreements and shipping 
contracts, credit risk is transferred from the purchaser of the Tui Crude oil to the marketing agent.  General terms and conditions with 
respect to Receivables are payable within 30 days. 
 
Guarantees 
Parent Company Guarantees are extended on a case by case basis.

Credit Risk (continued) 
 
On 25 September 2010, a guarantee was provided by the Parent Company on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary to each of Bharat 
PetroResources JPDA Ltd, GSPC (JPDA) Ltd and Global Energy Inc, to guarantee the subsidiary’s performance and payment obligations 
pursuant  to  the  Production  Sharing  Contract  06-103  dated  15  November  2006  between  the  Contractor  parties  and  the  Designated 
Authority and the corresponding Joint Operating Agreement dated 5 January 2007. 
 
On  16  October  2010,  a  guarantee  was  provided  by  the  Parent  Company  on  behalf  of  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  to  the  Timor  Sea 
Designated Authority to guarantee the subsidiaries obligations under the JPDA 06-103 Production Sharing Contract from 19 February 
2011. 
 
On  18  December  2010,  a  guarantee  was  provided  by  the  Parent  Company  on  behalf  of  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  to  ensure  the 
performance of the subsidiaries obligations pursuant to Block 07/03 Production Sharing Contract in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  
The Guarantee took effect from 7 August 2011. 
 
On 6 March 2012, a guarantee was provided by the Parent Company on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary - PPPV121 to ensure the 
performance of the subsidiaries obligations pursuant to Block 121 Production Sharing Contract in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The 
Guarantee took effect from 5 July 2012. 
 
On 5 March 2013, a guarantee was provided by the Parent Company on behalf of a wholly owned subsidiary to ensure the performance 
of the subsidiaries obligations pursuant to Block 121 Joint Operating Agreement.  The Guarantee took effect from 19 March 2013. 
 
No additional parent company guarantees were entered into during the 2015 or 2016 financial years. 
 
Joint operations 
Credit  risk  also  arises  from  the  financial  performance  of  the  joint  operation  participants  with  which  the  Group  is  involved.    If  a 
participant to a joint operation defaults and fails to contribute its share of joint operation obligations, the remaining joint operation 
participants are liable to meet the obligations of the defaulting participant.  In this event the interest in the tenement of the defaulting 
participant may be redistributed to the remaining participants. 
 
Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and companies within the Group will not be able to meet their financial obligations as they fall 
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation. 
 
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors.  The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining 
adequate  banking  and  borrowing  facilities  through  the  monitoring  of  future  rolling  cash  flow  forecasts,  including  those  from  Joint 
Operations.  These reflect management’s expectations of the settlement of financial assets and liabilities.  This excludes the potential 
impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.  This is covered by Group’s business 
interruption insurance.  Refer to note 25 for maturity analysis. 
 
Market risk 
 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
Currency risk 
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales. Sales are denominated in a currency that is the functional currency within a subsidiary 
within the Group, primarily the U.S. Dollar (USD) and Australian Dollar (AUD). There is currency risk exposure on the New Zealand dollar 
(NZD) costs of production and statutory obligations occurring in entity’s with a USD functional currency.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
 
 
4. 
 
The following measures are taken to reduce the Group’s foreign currency exposure: 
• 
•
Financial risk management (continued)
surplus funds are held in a mixture of both United States, New Zealand and Australian Dollars; 
where  possible  specific  commitments  and  exposures  are  hedged  naturally  by  using  United  States  Dollar  revenues  to  fund 
United States Dollar denominated expenditures; 
to meet other foreign currency obligations, the Group purchases foreign currency as the obligations accrue.
• 
 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to 
an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term requirements.  
 
The Group’s investments in subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are considered to be long-term in nature. 
 
Commodity prices 
The Group is exposed to movements in commodity prices, primarily movements in the oil price.  From time to time the Group enters 
into put options to provide downside protection against any substantial fall in oil prices.  From time to time the Group offsets the cost of 
put options by selling call options.  The call option contracts are cash settled where an obligation arises. 
 
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s exposure to market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s cash holdings (refer note 18). 
 
Please refer to note 25 for further information about Financial Instruments. 
 
Capital Management 
 
Capital  includes  issued  capital  attributable  to  the  equity  holders  of  the  Company  of  $47,223,000  -  581,842,846  shares  (2015: 
$47,450,000 - 588,612,110 shares).  Please refer to note 19 for further information. 
 
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. The Board of directors monitors the balance sheet, the statement of comprehensive income, cash flows 
and cash forecasts on a regular basis.  
 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
 
Neither the company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

5.  Operating Segments 
 
The  chief  operating  decision  maker  considers  the  business  from  both  a  product  and  a  geographic  perspective  and  on  this  basis  has 
identified four reportable segments. For each reportable segment, the chief operating decision maker reviews internal management 
reports on at least a monthly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the consolidated entity’s reportable 
segments:  
 
• 
• 
• 
•
Australia  - parent entity; 
New Zealand – exploration, production and sale of petroleum products in New Zealand 
Vietnam – exploration of petroleum products in Vietnam 
Joint Production Development Area (“JPDA”)– exploration of petroleum products in JPDA
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured  based on  segment  profit 
after income tax and exploration expenditure as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s CEO.  
The above criteria is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the 
results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. 
Comparative segment information has been represented in conformity with the requirement of AASB 8 Operating Segments.

These items are not recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the 
benefits. 
These losses are quarantined against future revenue in the respective tax jurisdictions in which they are incurred.  These losses are in USD. 
Losses for Block 121 are no longer recorded as Block 121 Vietnam was surrendered on 24th December 2015 with all commitments either fulfilled or

The A$6.5million impairment during the prior year was primarily due to unsuccessful exploration drilling in relation to the Oi well in PMP318158.   
During the year $1,352 was expensed in respect to exploration and evaluation assets with low likelihood of future development and commercial 
exploitation.  
 
The ultimate recoupment of costs carried forward for exploration of evaluation phases is dependent on the successful development and commercial 
exploitation or sale of respective areas.  Refer to accounting policy note 3(t) for recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets. 
 
Exploration expenditure carried forward at 30 June 2016 primarily relates to Block 07/03.

Impairment 
Testing for indicators of impairment of oil and gas assets is performed at each reporting date based on their value in use.  Value in use is based on the 
cash flow projections of each oil and gas asset which are considered a separate Cash Generating Unit (CGU). 
Following the recent decline in oil prices the Company has performed an impairment assessment of its producing asset in the New Zealand segment 
through a value in use model.  As a result the asset was fully impaired at 31 December 2015 and an impairment charge of A$11.1 million was recognised 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive Income.  At 30 June 2016 a reassessment was performed in determining the value in use for the CGU, 
the cashflows were discounted at a rate of 10% on a post-tax basis.  There was no change to the impairment.  The increase in reserves from Pateke-4H 
and the extension of the economic field life of the Tui Area Fields is dependent on oil price, and includes an assumption of a return to higher oil prices 
during the field life.   
The observable inputs for 30 June 2016 include:
•
• 
•
•
The Brent oil price (real) adjusted for a premium the range used is $US42.5/bbl to $US46.50/bbl and long term price of US$58/bbl over the 
remaining life of the field (June 2015: US$64.00 to US$91/bbl). 
The foreign exchange rate used was $AUD: USD 74cents (June 2015:$AUD: USD 78cents).   
Proved and probable (2P) reserves - the cash flow projections are based on the remaining life of field expected production profile.  Life of field 
production used in impairment analysis is that same as that used by the board in key business planning.

Investment - Listed entities 
 
The Company invests in listed investments to take advantage of undervalued companies in the market, during the period the Company acquired and 
disposed of listed investments. 
 
Fair value  
The Company has three methods available to it for estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The methods comprise:  
 
Level 1 - the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets.  
 
Level 2 - the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quotes prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).  
 
Level 3 - the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.  
 
The fair value of the listed investments was calculated using the level 1 method. The carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded 
in the financial statements approximates their respective net fair values, determined in accordance with the accounting policies disclosed in note 2 to 
the annual financial statements.

The Group manages its credit risk on trade receivables by dealing with only large, reputable customers. At balance date credit risk is concentrated to a 
single customer.  The Group does not consider there to be any impairment indicators held with this customer.  The Group’s credit risk is limited to the 
carrying value of its financial assets. None of the Group’s receivables are past due (2015: is consistent with 2016). 
 
As at 30 June 2016 there was no material exposure to  credit risk in relation to cash held by banks as $2,627,782 was held with Australian Financial 
Institutions rated AA- with the remaining balances held in New Zealand of $22,397,706 with institutions rated AA-. $317,774 was held in the accounts of 
joint operations. 
 
Impairment losses 
Based  on  past  experience,  the  Group  believes  that  no  impairment  allowance  is  necessary  in  respect  of  trade  receivables  not  past  due  (2015:  No

During the 2006 financial year the Operator of the Tui Area oil project (PMP 38158, offshore Taranaki basin New Zealand) executed a charter contract for 
the provision of an FPSO for the Tui Oil Field development.  The contract was for a fixed initial term of 5 years.  During 2008 the fixed term of the charter 
was extended by 3.4 years  to 31 December 2015, followed by seven one year options.  The Group provided a letter of credit for the benefit of the 
Charter contractor amounting to US$10 million, which expired during the period in line with the end of the fixed term at 31 December 2015 of the Time 
Charter (see note 26). 
 
The Group may be required to undertake restoration works in addition to that provided at 30 June 2016.  The directors are of the opinion that further 
provisions are not required  in  respect of restoration works, as  it is not  probable  that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be  required or the 
amount is not capable of reliable measurement.   
 
On  15  July  2015  The  Autoridade  Nacional  do  Petróleo  of  Timor-Leste  (“ANP”),  the  Designated  Authority  terminated  the  JPDA  06-103  Profit  Sharing 
Contract (‘PSC’) and requested a payment of USD$17,018,000 (PPP Group share of USD$2,552,000) in respect of the foregone work program in the Joint 
Production Development Area.  However, the Joint Venture Parties (“JVP”) have disputed the above amount with the ANP under the dispute clauses of 
the PSC.  The JVP have submitted a counter offer the amount of which has been provided for in these financial statements nett to PPP.  Due to the 
uncertainty of the outcome of this dispute the remaining portion is a contingent liability at the date of these accounts.  The parties continue to discuss 
the financial liability of the contractor upon termination.  It is the Company’s intention to settle on mutually acceptable terms with the ANP.

Independent auditor's report to the members of Pan Pacific Petroleum 
NL
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Pan Pacific Petroleum NL, which comprises the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement 
of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and 
other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the 
company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true 
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for 
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 2(a), the directors 
also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that 
the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and 
fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001. We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a 
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.
