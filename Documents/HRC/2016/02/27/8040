<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the activities of her office in the Plurinational State of Bolivia  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Corrigendum 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Paragraph 54 
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text <i>substitute 
</i></p>
<p>54. The accumulation of judicial complaints against some members of the political 
opposition and other high-level public figures was observed. Most are related to alleged 
breaches of the anticorruption law, while others involve public statements found offensive 
by constituted authorities and prosecuted under defamation against public servants 
(<i>desacato</i>), libel, denigration, slander or sedition charges. While desacato was declared 
unconstitutional, which would permit the cases related to this offence to be terminated, 
most other cases remain in the preparatory phase, even though the investigations were 
initiated years ago in some cases. OHCHR-Bolivia believes that, in the absence of judicial 
decisions, this accumulation of cases and delays in handling them could affect the rights to 
the presumption of innocence and due process of law for the concerned individuals. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Paragraph 61  
</b></p>
<p>For the existing text <i>substitute 
</i></p>
<p>61. Following the historic Supreme Court judgement of August 2011, condemning two 
former ministers of the former President S&#225;nchez de Lozada Government to three years in 
prison and five former high-level military officials to sentences of between 10 and 15 years 
in prison for their responsibility in the deaths of over 60 persons and more than 400 injured
