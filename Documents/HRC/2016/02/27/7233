<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In August 2012, the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee submitted a 
</p>
<p>research proposal on local government and human rights (A/HRC/AC/9/6) to the Council 
</p>
<p>for its consideration and approval. 
</p>
<p>2. On 26 September 2013, the Council adopted resolution 24/2, in which it took note of 
</p>
<p>the above-mentioned research proposal and requested the Advisory Committee to prepare a 
</p>
<p>research-based report on the role of local government in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including human rights mainstreaming in local administration and public 
</p>
<p>services, with a view to compiling best practices and main challenges, and to present a 
</p>
<p>progress report thereon to the Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>3. The Advisory Committee was also requested to seek the views and inputs of 
</p>
<p>Member States, relevant international and regional organizations, the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and relevant special procedures, 
</p>
<p>as well as national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
</p>
<p>in order to prepare the above-mentioned report. 
</p>
<p>4. At its twelfth session, in February 2014, the Advisory Committee established a 
</p>
<p>drafting group tasked with the preparation of the said report and designated the following 
</p>
<p>members of the Committee as members of the drafting group: Mario Luis Coriolano, Hoda 
</p>
<p>Elsadda, Latif H&#252;seynov (Rapporteur), Anantonia Reyes Prado, Dheerujlall Seetulsingh 
</p>
<p>(Chair), and Imeru Tamrat Yigezu. Subsequently, Katharina Pabel joined the drafting group 
</p>
<p>and replaced Mr. Seetulsingh as Chair, while Ms. Elsadda replaced Mr. H&#252;seynov as 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. Changrok Soh and Laura-Maria Cr&#259;ciunean also subsequently joined the 
</p>
<p>drafting group. 
</p>
<p>5. The drafting group elaborated a questionnaire, in accordance with Council resolution 
</p>
<p>24/2, which was disseminated to different stakeholders. To date, a total of 67 responses 
</p>
<p>have been received: 22 from States, 20 from national human rights institutions, 10 from 
</p>
<p>NGOs, 12 from local authorities and 3 from international or regional organizations. 
</p>
<p>6. In line with Human Rights Council resolution 24/2, a progress report was submitted 
</p>
<p>to the twenty-seventh session of the Council with the recommendation that the Council 
</p>
<p>request the Advisory Committee to submit a final report at its thirtieth session. At its 
</p>
<p>twenty-seventh session, the Council adopted resolution 27/4, which took note with 
</p>
<p>appreciation of the Advisory Committee&#8217;s progress report, and requested the Committee to 
</p>
<p>continue its research and to submit a final report on the role of local government in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights to the Human Rights Council at its thirtieth 
</p>
<p>session.  
</p>
<p>7. The Council also requested the Committee, when elaborating the final report, to 
</p>
<p>include therein the main challenges faced by local governments in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, and to make recommendations on tackling those challenges 
</p>
<p>based on best practices in human rights mainstreaming in local administration and public 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Definition of local government 
</b></p>
<p>8. Local government is commonly defined as the lowest tier of public administration 
</p>
<p>within a given State. In unitary States, local government usually comprises the second or 
</p>
<p>third tier of government, whereas in federal States, it is constituted as the third or 
</p>
<p>sometimes fourth tier of government. Local government aims at bringing government to the </p>


<p>grass roots and enabling citizens to participate effectively in the making of decisions 
</p>
<p>affecting their daily lives. As the level closest to the citizens, local government is, in 
</p>
<p>principle, in a much better position than central government to deal with matters that 
</p>
<p>require local knowledge and regulation on the basis of local needs and priorities. 
</p>
<p>9. The organization and functioning of local government vary considerably between 
</p>
<p>countries. Different names are used for local government entities in different countries 
</p>
<p>(county, prefecture, district, city, town, borough, parish, municipality, village, etc.). Local 
</p>
<p>governments exist geographically both in urban and rural settings. 
</p>
<p>10. Local governments possess certain powers conferred upon them by legislation or 
</p>
<p>directives of the higher levels of government.1 These powers consist, in substance, in 
</p>
<p>regulating and managing certain public affairs related to the local surroundings and 
</p>
<p>delivering certain public services. The extent of powers of local government should always 
</p>
<p>be analysed in the context of relations between local authorities and central government or 
</p>
<p>regional authorities. In general, in unitary States, central governments tend to shoulder the 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the planning, programming, regulating and funding of houses, and local 
</p>
<p>governments manage implementation with varying degrees of autonomy. In federal 
</p>
<p>systems, on the other hand, local governments tend to have more autonomy regarding 
</p>
<p>programmes, policies and implementation of housing (Report of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
</p>
<p>right to non-discrimination in this context, Leilani Farha (A/HRC/28/62)). One of the 
</p>
<p>important features of local government is that it has a specific, subordinate regulatory 
</p>
<p>power for the exercise of its function which is, however, subject to compliance with the 
</p>
<p>law. 
</p>
<p>11. Although in some countries &#8220;local government&#8221; and &#8220;local self-government&#8221; are 
</p>
<p>used interchangeably, given the fact that local government has different forms in different 
</p>
<p>countries, these two concepts should be differentiated. Local public administration can be 
</p>
<p>exercised not only by local self-government entities (e.g. municipalities), but also by local 
</p>
<p>units of State administration; the former are directly elected by the local population and 
</p>
<p>enjoy wide-ranging autonomy, whereas the latter act as agents of the higher authorities and 
</p>
<p>their officials are appointed by and accountable to those authorities. Local self-government 
</p>
<p>is thus based on the principle of decentralization, and local State administration is based on 
</p>
<p>the principle of deconcentration. 
</p>
<p>12. The degree of self-government enjoyed by local authorities can be regarded as a key 
</p>
<p>element of genuine democracy. In this regard, political, fiscal and administrative 
</p>
<p>decentralization is essential for localizing democracy and human rights. It should be borne 
</p>
<p>in mind that democracy is not possible without respect for human rights and no human right 
</p>
<p>can be achieved without democracy. Nevertheless, local self-government does not 
</p>
<p>automatically lead to participatory democracy. While decentralization in general works 
</p>
<p>towards the empowerment of citizens in decision-making and control over policies, certain 
</p>
<p>measures and procedures must be securely in place to create the necessary environment to 
</p>
<p>make democratic participation possible and effective. 
</p>
<p>13. The role of local authorities should not be limited to mere executors of decisions 
</p>
<p>taken and policies developed without them. On the other hand, local independence should 
</p>
<p>have certain limits clearly prescribed by law, and mechanisms should be available for 
</p>
<p>supervising the legality of local authorities&#8217; activities. Democratic checks and balances 
</p>
<p>mechanisms are essential for augmenting the capability of local government in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 In Brazil, municipalities are part of the Federation and not just dependent divisions of the State, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Constitution. </p>


<p>implementing human rights. Government officials who are accountable to voters are more 
</p>
<p>likely to respond to citizens&#8217; demands than those who are not.2 
</p>
<p>14. To ensure effective local governance and adequate implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>at the local level, it is important to have a proper legal framework for local government. 
</p>
<p>The organization, powers and functions should be clearly prescribed by law. Further, 
</p>
<p>national legislation should delineate clearly the responsibilities and powers of central and 
</p>
<p>local government authorities in relation to one another. 
</p>
<p>15. Local government should preferably be recognized in the national constitution; 
</p>
<p>indeed, in a number of countries, the constitutions specifically protect local government 
</p>
<p>autonomy. It should be underlined that constitutional protection provides the greatest 
</p>
<p>guarantee of stability. A specific law on local government passed by a national parliament 
</p>
<p>is the next best solution in this regard. In a few countries, legal safeguards are in place to 
</p>
<p>maintain the stability of laws governing local government. In Hungary, for example, the 
</p>
<p>Law on Local Authorities can be adopted or amended only by a two-thirds majority of the 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians present. The same applies to any legislation restricting the rights 
</p>
<p>associated with local self-government. 
</p>
<p>16. It is noteworthy that the principles of subsidiarity, decentralization and 
</p>
<p>accountability are explicitly envisaged in a number of countries as main principles of local 
</p>
<p>government. Furthermore, the respective laws provide for the right of local authorities to 
</p>
<p>have recourse to a judicial remedy in order to ensure respect for such principles. 
</p>
<p><b> III. States and local governments: Shared and complementary 
duties to respect, protect and fulfil human rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. As a matter of international law, the State is one single entity, regardless of its 
</p>
<p>unitary or federal nature and internal administrative division. In this regard, only the State 
</p>
<p>as a whole is bound by obligations stemming from international treaties to which it is a 
</p>
<p>party. Thus, by becoming a party to an international human rights treaty, a State assumes 
</p>
<p>obligations to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. More specifically, only States are 
</p>
<p>obliged to submit reports as required by the respective universal and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>treaties, and only States can be the subject of individual or inter-State complaints under 
</p>
<p>such treaties. Furthermore, a State appearing before an international human rights 
</p>
<p>complaints mechanism cannot defend itself by claiming that the alleged violation was 
</p>
<p>committed by a local authority. 
</p>
<p>18. It should also be emphasized that under general international law a State, as 
</p>
<p>represented by the central government, is responsible for all acts of all its organs and 
</p>
<p>agents.3 In addition, when it comes to State responsibility, despite its internal organization, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with customary international law, there are several principles that apply. 
</p>
<p>Firstly, the structure of the State, the functions of State organs and even the mere definition 
</p>
<p>of what constitutes a State organ are not, in general, governed by international law. It is 
</p>
<p>within State sovereign competence to decide how its own administration is to be structured 
</p>

</p>
<p> 3 In this respect, a reference could be made, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to art. 50 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Parties, according to which the provisions of the Covenant &#8220;shall extend to all 
</p>
<p>parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions&#8221;. </p>


<p>and which functions are to be ascribed to its central and/or local government. But, while the 
</p>
<p>State remains free to determine its internal structure and functions through its own law and 
</p>
<p>practice,4 for the purposes of international responsibility the conduct of its institutions, 
</p>
<p>administrative divisions performing public functions and exercising public powers is 
</p>
<p>attributable to the State, even if those institutions are regarded, in domestic law, as 
</p>
<p>autonomous and/or independent of the central executive government.  
</p>
<p>19. According to customary international law, it is recognized that &#8220;the conduct of any 
</p>
<p>State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the 
</p>
<p>organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it 
</p>
<p>holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central 
</p>
<p>government or of a territorial unit of the State&#8221;.5 In its General Comment No. 16, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasized, &#8220;Violations of the rights 
</p>
<p>contained in the Covenant can occur through the direct action of, failure to act or omission 
</p>
<p>by States parties, or through their institutions or agencies at the national and local levels&#8221;.6 
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the conduct of certain institutions exercising public powers is 
</p>
<p>attributed to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous 
</p>
<p>and independent of the executive Government.7 
</p>
<p>20. Illegal acts of any public authority, including local government, are attributable to 
</p>
<p>the State even if they are <i>ultra vires</i> or contravene domestic laws and instructions. This 
</p>
<p>flows directly from the principle contained in article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Law of Treaties, according to which a State Party &#8220;may not invoke the provisions of its 
</p>
<p>internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. It is the central government which has the primary responsibility for the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights, while local government has a complementary role to play. 
</p>
<p>Upon ratifying an international human rights treaty, a State may delegate implementation 
</p>
<p>thereof to lower tiers of government, including local authorities. In this respect, the central 
</p>
<p>government might need to take necessary measures at the local level, in particular, to 
</p>
<p>establish procedures and controls in order to ensure that the State&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations are implemented. Local authorities are obliged to comply, within their local 
</p>
<p>competences, with their duties stemming from the international human rights obligations of 
</p>
<p>the State. Local authorities are actually those who are to translate national human rights 
</p>
<p>strategies and policies into practical application. Representatives of local authorities should 
</p>
<p>therefore be involved in the drafting of such policies. In decentralized States, local 
</p>
<p>government can play a more proactive and autonomous role as regards the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights. Institutionalized cooperation on human rights between the 
</p>
<p>central and local governments can have a positive impact on the level of implementation of 
</p>
<p>the international human rights obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>22. To comply with their human rights responsibilities, local authorities should have 
</p>
<p>necessary powers and financial resources. Adequate implementation of human rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly economic, social and cultural rights, by local authorities require financial 
</p>

<p>resources, which are not available everywhere; this should be taken into consideration both 
</p>
<p>at the national and international level. It should be particularly emphasized that, whatever 
</p>
<p>powers that are conferred upon local authorities, they would not be effective if no financial 
</p>
<p>resources were available to carry them out. 
</p>
<p>23. The principle of shared responsibility of different tiers of government for the 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights has been on several occasions underlined by the 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights treaty bodies. Thus, in its General Comment No. 4 (the right 
</p>
<p>to adequate housing), the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted that 
</p>
<p>States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should 
</p>
<p>take steps &#8220;to ensure coordination between ministries and regional and local authorities in 
</p>
<p>order to reconcile related policies (economics, agriculture, environment, energy, etc.) with 
</p>
<p>the obligations under article 11 of the Covenant&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Role of local government in the protection and promotion  
of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. The legislation of a number of States &#8211; in some cases, at the constitutional level &#8211; 
</p>
<p>explicitly requires local government to respect human rights (e.g. Australia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>Morocco and Slovenia). In some other States, the respective constitutional requirement 
</p>
<p>applies to all public powers (e.g. Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, South Sudan, Spain and Togo). In Luxembourg, the powers of 
</p>
<p>the communes must be exercised in accordance with the law, which means that they are 
</p>
<p>obliged to observe human rights guaranteed by the law. In some countries, the duty of local 
</p>
<p>government to observe human rights is limited in the law to specific rights or principles. 
</p>
<p>For instance, the Local Self-Government Act of Serbia stipulates that municipalities must 
</p>
<p>ensure promotion and protection of the rights of national minorities and ethnic groups. In 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, municipal administrations are required by law to take care of gender 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming. In Ireland, the local government legislation does not specifically provide 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights, but in discharging their functions local 
</p>
<p>authorities are required to have regard for the need to promote social inclusion. Similarly, 
</p>
<p>the legislation on local governments in India does not specifically mention protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights among their responsibilities; however, the constitutionally mandated 
</p>
<p>municipal functions directly relate to core human rights, such as implementation of 
</p>
<p>initiatives for democratic inclusion, welfare measures and the local justice system. 
</p>
<p>25. Having an explicit legal provision which obliges local government to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights appears to be a more preferable approach. Local authorities are thus 
</p>
<p>made aware of their human rights responsibilities, understanding that any failure to comply 
</p>
<p>with these responsibilities will entail their liability under national law as well as 
</p>
<p>international responsibility of the State as a whole. Further, such a provision imposes a 
</p>
<p>clear obligation on local authorities to apply a human rights-based approach to delivering 
</p>
<p>public services within their defined competences. Consequently, it may well encourage 
</p>
<p>rights holders to claim their rights vis-&#224;-vis local authorities. 
</p>
<p>26. Local authorities are close to citizens&#8217; everyday needs and they deal with human 
</p>
<p>right issues on an everyday basis. Therefore, there exists a clear and strong connection 
</p>
<p>between human rights and local government. When performing their functions, local 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights General Comment No. 4, the right to adequate 
</p>
<p>housing (art. 11 (1) of the Covenant), para. 12, adopted at the Sixth Session of the Committee on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, on 13 December 1991, available from 
</p>
<p>http://www.refworld.org/docid/47a7079a1.html. </p>


<p>authorities take decisions relating in particular to education, housing, health, the 
</p>
<p>environment, and law and order, which are directly connected with the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights and which may enforce or weaken the possibilities of its inhabitants to enjoy 
</p>
<p>their human rights. Furthermore, local government is always facing the risk of 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practices against perceived outsiders, such as immigrants or ethnic 
</p>
<p>minorities, to the local community. In the area of housing, for example, &#8220;scapegoating, 
</p>
<p>stigmatization and discrimination against homeless people&#8221; are often more pronounced at 
</p>
<p>the local level. Integrating a human rights dimension in all local government initiatives is 
</p>
<p>vital for addressing these violations. Actually, it is difficult to imagine a situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights being realized where there are no local authorities to provide the necessary services. 
</p>
<p>Local officials are thus responsible for a wide range of human rights issues in their day-to-
</p>
<p>day work. However, this work is rarely perceived as human rights implementation, neither 
</p>
<p>by the authorities, nor by the public. Consequently, human rights remain distant as a frame 
</p>
<p>of reference or analysis in most policies and practices at the local level, while they may 
</p>
<p>actually be human rights in practice.9 In this regard, it should be borne in mind that the real 
</p>
<p>effect of human rights is experienced locally. 
</p>
<p>27. Human rights duties of local government follow the classical tripartite typology of 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; human rights obligations, namely, the duty to respect, the duty to protect and the 
</p>
<p>duty to fulfil. The duty to respect means that local officials must not violate human rights 
</p>
<p>through their own actions. It requires local government to refrain from interfering with the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of all persons within its jurisdiction. For example, in 
</p>
<p>relation to the freedom of religion, local government may not prohibit religious 
</p>
<p>communities, beyond the permissible limitations, from using public squares or municipal 
</p>
<p>buildings for religious celebrations. Regarding the right to health, local government may 
</p>
<p>not deprive certain communities or groups of access to health care facilities. The duty to 
</p>
<p>protect requires measures to ensure that third parties do not violate the rights and freedoms 
</p>
<p>of the individual. For example, local authorities are required to take action to ensure that 
</p>
<p>children are not prevented by others from attending school. The duty to protect can 
</p>
<p>necessitate creating safer urban environments that reduce the risk of violence, for example 
</p>
<p>against women. The duty to fulfil means that local government must take positive action to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms. For example, local authorities are 
</p>
<p>obliged to fulfil the right to education by sustaining a good educational system. To comply 
</p>
<p>with the duty to fulfil the right of individuals not to be discriminated against, local human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms such as ombudspersons or specialized anti-discrimination agencies can 
</p>
<p>be established. 
</p>
<p>28. Further, local authorities should promote the understanding of and respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights of all individuals within their jurisdiction through education and training. In 
</p>
<p>particular, local authorities should organize, on a systematic basis, human rights training for 
</p>
<p>their elected representatives and administrative staff, and the dissemination of relevant 
</p>
<p>information among citizens about their rights. By promoting human rights, local authorities 
</p>
<p>can help build a culture of human rights in the community. 
</p>
<p>29. Local authorities should pay particular attention to the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>rights of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups such as persons with disabilities, ethnic 
</p>
<p>minorities, indigenous communities, victims of sexual discrimination, children and elderly

<p>26th session, CG(26)5FINAL, &#8220;Best practices of implementation of human rights at local and 
</p>
<p>regional level in member states of the Council of Europe and other countries&#8221; (Rapporteur: O. Molin),

<p>people. In this respect, the quality of the services that local governments provide to such 
</p>
<p>groups &#8220;tests&#8221; the degree to which local governments in practice respect human rights.10 
</p>
<p>30. In a number of countries, efforts are made to mainstream human rights into local 
</p>
<p>authorities&#8217; activities. Thus, measures are taken to foster participatory governance, to 
</p>
<p>conduct human rights-based audits and impact assessments, to reframe local concerns as 
</p>
<p>human rights issues, to establish procedures for verifying the compatibility of local policies 
</p>
<p>and regulations with human rights, to report on local compliance with human rights treaties, 
</p>
<p>to provide systematic human rights training to local civil servants, to raise public awareness 
</p>
<p>of human rights, etc. Drafting a local human rights charter (or human rights ordinance)11 
</p>
<p>setting out specific human rights responsibilities that fall upon the local government can be 
</p>
<p>regarded as another important step towards localizing human rights. In this context, it is 
</p>
<p>highly desirable that local authorities have human rights offices with sufficient human and 
</p>
<p>financial resources that could fully take charge of human rights issues within the respective 
</p>
<p>local competences. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Main challenges faced by local governments in the protection 
and promotion of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>31. The main challenges faced by local governments in the protection and promotion of 
</p>
<p>human rights are political, economic and administrative. The biggest challenge facing local 
</p>
<p>governments is lack of political will, particularly in countries with non-democratic systems 
</p>
<p>or with incipient democracies. This is exacerbated by political conflicts and tensions in the 
</p>
<p>country. Local governments in such States suffer from a lack of autonomy and the absence 
</p>
<p>of long-term vision/planning and/or commitment. In some cases, tensions and power 
</p>
<p>struggles may exist between central and local governments, especially in situations of 
</p>
<p>instability or conflict. Furthermore, in States with a highly centralistic structure it may also 
</p>
<p>be difficult to develop a strong political effort for human rights at the local level. The lack 
</p>
<p>of autonomy and self-government inhibits the accountability and the sense of responsibility 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of human rights. Centralized policies and structural adjustment 
</p>
<p>measures may often impede the observance of human rights in local governments. 
</p>
<p>32. A second challenge to local governments that obstructs their implementation and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights is shortage in institutional capacity and/or resources, due either 
</p>
<p>to the lack of political will to enable local governments, or to the difficult economic 
</p>
<p>situation in the country. The report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
</p>
<p>component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in this context, Leilani Farha, on the roles of local and other subnational 
</p>
<p>levels of government, highlights the conclusion that &#8220;decentralization is not always 
</p>
<p>favourable to the implementation of the right of adequate housing&#8221; (A/HRC/28/62, para. 
</p>
<p>71). For even though decentralization is potentially conducive to participatory democracy, 
</p>
<p>citizen engagement, transparency and accountability, these positive features remain 
</p>
<p>contingent on the existence of mechanisms and political will to implement democratic 
</p>
<p>governance. Lack of the necessary resources and budgets to finance the implementation of 
</p>
<p>projects and services at the local level undermines the ability of local governments and 
</p>
<p>detracts from their legitimacy in local communities. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 Ibid. 
</p>
<p> 11 Human rights ordinances adopted in several cities in the United States of America, beginning with the 
</p>
<p>San Francisco Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women ordinance, could be 
</p>
<p>specifically mentioned, as they represent a good example of incorporation of human rights into local 
</p>
<p>policies and measures. </p>


<p>33. A third challenge is the lack of adequate coordination between central and local 
</p>
<p>governments. A problem also arises where laws regarding the competence sharing between 
</p>
<p>central government and local government are not simple, accessible and clear. A clear-cut 
</p>
<p>division of powers between the different tiers of government is the precondition for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of accountability, and hence the precondition for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights. It must become self-understood that every authority provided with public 
</p>
<p>powers has to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. The linkage between the exercise of 
</p>
<p>public powers and the observance of human rights is often/sometimes neglected at the local 
</p>
<p>level. 
</p>
<p>34. A further challenge is the lack of information about the requirements resulting from 
</p>
<p>human rights at the local level. Every person in charge of the local government must be 
</p>
<p>aware of the obligations imposed by human rights. Often this awareness lacks a well-
</p>
<p>founded knowledge about the content and the scope of human rights. As a result, many 
</p>
<p>local governments fail to understand and incorporate human rights into local policy and 
</p>
<p>practice. Efforts to increase human rights coordination are marred by a lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency.12 
</p>
<p>35. The fifth challenge to local governments is the non-recognition of the role and 
</p>
<p>contributions from civil society. This is usually coupled with a lack of understanding of 
</p>
<p>human rights at the local government level. Failure to recognize and work with civil society 
</p>
<p>curtails efforts by local governments to reach marginalized communities. 
</p>
<p>36. Another challenge to local government is the absence of human rights obligations in 
</p>
<p>the priorities of donor and international development agencies in the context of 
</p>
<p>decentralization. For example, in Indonesia, the International Monetary Fund, the World 
</p>
<p>Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and 
</p>
<p>other donor agencies promoted decentralization while disregarding human rights.13 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Human rights mechanisms at the local level 
</b></p>
<p>37. The protection of human rights requires independent human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Such mechanisms may take different forms in different communities, and there are several 
</p>
<p>examples that could serve as a model for the implementation of human rights at the local 
</p>
<p>level &#8211; local ombudspersons, consumer complaints boards, patient injury boards, anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination agencies, etc. The competences and structures of these mechanisms can be 
</p>
<p>very diverse, but they must be seen as important means of safeguarding human rights and 
</p>
<p>handling citizens&#8217; complaints at first instance. Importantly, the establishment of a local 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanism gives visibility to the role of local authorities in human rights 
</p>
<p>protection. In order for them to effectively discharge their functions, these should be 
</p>
<p>provided with sufficient human and financial resources and be accessible to everyone 
</p>
<p>within the respective locality. 
</p>
<p>38. The European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City, adopted in 
</p>
<p>Saint-Denis in 2000,14 provides for the creation of ombudspersons as a prevention

<p>50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hundreds of mayors and political

<p>mechanism and also as a means of upholding human rights at the local level. 
</p>
<p>Ombudspersons monitor local administrations to ensure they do not violate the rights and 
</p>
<p>principles set down in the Charter.  
</p>
<p>39. Only a few States have human rights protection mechanisms at the local level. For 
</p>
<p>instance, in Switzerland, several cities have established ombudsperson offices. These 
</p>
<p>offices are independent organs that mediate in case of conflicts between private individuals 
</p>
<p>and the authorities. Even though they are not authorized to make binding decisions, only 
</p>
<p>recommendations, they have proven to be a successful means to resolve disputes. In the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, several local governments have established human rights commissions. 
</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, complaints regarding human rights violations can be filed with the 
</p>
<p>national ombudsperson or with the complaint mechanism of a municipality. In Denmark, 
</p>
<p>the Copenhagen Citizens&#8217; Counsellor was the country&#8217;s first citizen counselling institution 
</p>
<p>established by the Municipal Council to create an independent ombudsperson function in 
</p>
<p>Copenhagen. Today, 21 municipalities have citizen counselling institutions. In Norway, 
</p>
<p>municipalities have ombudspersons for certain administrative areas. In Bosnia and 
</p>
<p>Herzegovina, a number of local governments have established human rights commissions, 
</p>
<p>which acts as advisory bodies to municipal councils, although they are not a mechanism for 
</p>
<p>the protection of human rights per se. In Australia, the Victorian Equal Opportunity and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission facilitate local government forums. It developed a toolkit for 
</p>
<p>local government, which reviews local government programmes and practices upon request 
</p>
<p>to ensure that they are compatible with the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Responsibilities, and provides training to local councils. In Azerbaijan, the Council of 
</p>
<p>Independent Experts at the Ombudsman Institute was established in April 2003, in which 
</p>
<p>members of influential NGOs and civil society dealing with protection of human rights are 
</p>
<p>represented. The Commissioner conducts conferences, trainings, round-table discussions 
</p>
<p>and other activities in association with NGOs.15 
</p>
<p>40. In a number of countries (e.g. Azerbaijan, Ireland and Slovenia), the national 
</p>
<p>ombudsperson office is empowered to investigate complaints not only against State 
</p>
<p>agencies, but also local government authorities. 
</p>
<p>41. The Municipal Code of Guatemala establishes the obligation of local government to 
</p>
<p>convene different social sectors of the municipality to participate in the development and 
</p>
<p>institutionalization of municipal public policies and plans for urban and rural development. 
</p>
<p>It also stipulates the preservation and promotion of rights of communities to their cultural 
</p>
<p>identification according to their values, languages, traditions and customs. The Code also 
</p>
<p>authorizes the establishment of commissions for compliance. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Human rights city: Conceptual framework and guiding 
principles 
</b></p>
<p>42. The idea of a &#8220;human rights city&#8221; is one of the globally developed initiatives aimed 
</p>
<p>at localizing human rights. It is based on the recognition of cities as key players in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights, and refers in general to a city whose local 
</p>
<p>government and local population are morally and legally governed by human rights 
</p>
<p>principles. The concept was launched in 1997 by the People&#8217;s Movement for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>representatives participated in the event and united their voices to call for a stronger political 
</p>
<p>acknowledgement as key actors in safeguarding human rights in a highly urbanized world. Available

<p>Education (PDHRE), a non-profit international service organization.16 It was further 
</p>
<p>developed, particularly as a normative concept, by the World Human Rights Cities Forum, 
</p>
<p>which takes place annually in the city of Gwangju, Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p>43. The Gwangju Declaration on Human Rights City, adopted at the 2011 World 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Cities Forum on 17 May 2011, defines a human rights city as &#8220;both a local 
</p>
<p>community and socio-political process in a local context where human rights play a key 
</p>
<p>role as the fundamental values and guiding principles&#8221;. A human rights city requires a 
</p>
<p>shared human rights governance in the local context where local government, local 
</p>
<p>parliament (council), civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders cooperate to 
</p>
<p>improve the quality of life for all people in the spirit of partnership based on human rights 
</p>
<p>standards and norms. A human rights-based approach to local governance includes the 
</p>
<p>principle of democracy, participation, responsible leadership, transparency, accountability, 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination, empowerment and rule of law. The concept of a human rights city also 
</p>
<p>emphasizes the importance of securing the broad participation of all actors and 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, in particular marginalized and vulnerable groups, and the importance of 
</p>
<p>effective and independent human rights protection and monitoring mechanisms to which all 
</p>
<p>people have recourse. It recognizes the importance of inter-local and international 
</p>
<p>cooperation and solidarity among cities engaged in the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights.17 
</p>
<p>44. The Gwangju Guiding Principles for a Human Rights City, adopted at the 2014 
</p>
<p>World Human Rights Cities Forum on 17 May 2014, contains the following principles for a 
</p>
<p>human rights city: the right to the city; non-discrimination and affirmative action; social 
</p>
<p>inclusion and cultural diversity; participatory democracy and accountable governance; 
</p>
<p>social justice, solidarity and sustainability; political leadership and institutionalization; 
</p>
<p>human rights mainstreaming; effective institutions and policy coordination; human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training; and right to remedy. 
</p>
<p>45. A number of cities throughout the world have officially declared themselves &#8220;human 
</p>
<p>rights cities&#8221;,18 and several international networks of cities have developed. 
</p>
<p>46. Other concepts have been developed, both in doctrine and in practice, which 
</p>
<p>essentially pursue the same objective. One of them is &#8220;the right to the city&#8221; first articulated 
</p>
<p>by the French philosopher Henri Lefebvre;19 it refers mainly to the right of the inhabitants 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;users&#8221; of the city to participate in local public affairs and define the space of the city.20 
</p>
<p>So far the concept of &#8220;the right to the city&#8221; has been institutionalized in a limited manner, 
</p>
<p>examples being the City Statute of Brazil (2001), the Montreal Charter of Rights and 
</p>
<p>Responsibilities (2006) and the Mexico City Charter for the Right to the City (2010). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 The Human Rights Cities Program run by PDHRE includes the development of 30 human rights cities 
</p>
<p>and the training of 500 young community leaders at four Regional Learning Institutions for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Education.

</p>
<p> 20 The Habitat International Coalition and its Housing and Land Rights Network have worked over the 
</p>
<p>past decade to promote and develop the definition of &#8220;the right to the city.&#8221; </p>


<p>47. The right to the city was specifically laid down in the World Charter for the Right to 
</p>
<p>the City (2005);21 a wide range of organizations and networks, including UNESCO and 
</p>
<p>UN&#8211;HABITAT, participated in the preparation of this important document. The charter 
</p>
<p>defines the right to the city as the equitable use of cities according to principles of 
</p>
<p>sustainability, democracy, equity and social justice. It is a collective right of urban 
</p>
<p>inhabitants that confers upon them the legitimate right to action and organization, based on 
</p>
<p>respect of their differences, cultural expressions and practices, with the objective of 
</p>
<p>exercising their right to self-determination and attaining an adequate standard of living. The 
</p>
<p>right to the city is interdependent with other internationally recognized human rights, 
</p>
<p>including civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, as defined in 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>48. The concept of &#8220;the rights of the city&#8221; has emerged during the past decades as an 
</p>
<p>alternative to the withdrawal of central and state governments&#8217; responsibilities and 
</p>
<p>resources in the globalized market. Many cities are increasingly subordinated to central 
</p>
<p>decision-making institutions, public budgets and investment, whereas municipalities have 
</p>
<p>to fend for themselves and/or compete over resources for development and services, often 
</p>
<p>without the authority to levy revenues or participate effectively in decisions affecting 
</p>
<p>allocations. In such cases, local authorities face the prospect of resorting to the privatization 
</p>
<p>of public goods and services &#8211; with their typically harmful economic consequences for the 
</p>
<p>poor &#8211; and/or to seek fiscal support from the private financial market. The concept may 
</p>
<p>refer to the administrative, political and economic rights of the local governments in 
</p>
<p>relation to national/federal authorities, and to the presence and role of local authorities vis-
</p>
<p>&#224;-vis the international and multilateral institutions (United Nations, World Bank, 
</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund, etc.). 
</p>
<p>49. The concept of &#8220;human rights in the city&#8221;, developed mainly in the European 
</p>
<p>Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City and Global Charter-Agenda for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in the City,22 implies the commitment to: respect, protect and fulfil all 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized human rights at the local level; give priority attention to 
</p>
<p>marginalized groups and populations living under vulnerable conditions; and mainstream a 
</p>
<p>human rights approach to local policies (not just the implementation of human rights 
</p>
<p>programmes). 
</p>
<p>50. Meanwhile, best practices include policy initiatives that also recognize the validity 
</p>
<p>of the approach to establish a &#8220;human rights habitat&#8221;, with its more-embracing concept of 
</p>
<p>the rural-urban continuum, and the conscious recognition that the same rights of city 
</p>
<p>dwellers apply equally to other inhabitants of the periphery of urban centers, as well as 
</p>
<p>those in more distant regions. One example of this appellation is the First Civic Forum of 
</p>
<p>Nairobi declaring its city a &#8220;human rights habitat&#8221; (2002). This initiative emerged with the 
</p>
<p>support of the local Mazingira Institute, with its environmental programme and scope. Also, 
</p>
<p>the Habitat International Coalition and its Housing and Land Rights Network have worked 
</p>
<p>over the past decade to promote and develop the definition of &#8220;the right to the city&#8221;.

</p>
<p> 22 The charter was drafted by the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) Committee on Social 
</p>
<p>Inclusion, Participatory Democracy and Human Rights. It was discussed and approved by elected 
</p>
<p>representatives, experts and representatives of civil society from all over the world in 2011. </p>


<p><b> VIII. Role of civil society in the planning and implementation  
of activities for the promotion and protection of human rights 
at the local level 
</b></p>
<p>51. Most States responding to the questionnaire did not answer the question on the role 
</p>
<p>of civil society in the planning and development of activities for the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights at the local level, or gave nonspecific answers. However, 
</p>
<p>examples of replies note the participation of civil society organizations in trainings 
</p>
<p>(Burundi). Other States reported NGOs as active, but not necessarily cooperating with the 
</p>
<p>Government (Georgia, Hungary, Lebanon, Slovenia and Switzerland). 
</p>
<p>52. Civil society continues to be in the background of decision-making, rather than as a 
</p>
<p>partner. The working conditions for NGOs in some countries are reportedly under 
</p>
<p>government restrictions and they are prevented from receiving funds, and respondents 
</p>
<p>claim that numerous violations of the human rights to freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>association for NGOs take place. 
</p>
<p>53. The majority of respondents clarified that the motives for promoting human rights 
</p>
<p>are primarily based on struggles to counter human rights violations and human suffering 
</p>
<p>that they have witnessed and/or endured. The Human Rights City model of Gwangju, 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea has spread to other cities in the spirit of the 18 May Gwangju 
</p>
<p>Democratization Movement. The response from Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland (United 
</p>
<p>States of America) made reference to roots in the local experience of a former slave-
</p>
<p>holding county.23 Many respondents characterized violations as ongoing, including those 
</p>
<p>arising from: economic insecurity and the financial crisis; corruption and armed conflict; 
</p>
<p>authoritarian regimes; and discrimination based on gender, race and colour.  
</p>
<p>54. Following the Gezi Park Protests in Turkey, civil society has played an increasingly 
</p>
<p>important role in organizing meetings and preparing reports on specific groups&#8217; 
</p>
<p>expectations from local government authorities. Positive examples are initiatives 
</p>
<p>undertaken by SPoD (a national lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex NGO), two 
</p>
<p>Internet-based social movements, the Association for the Support and Training of Women 
</p>
<p>Candidates (KA.DER), Urbanism Movement of People, IULA&#8211;EMME (International 
</p>
<p>Union of Local Authorities, Section for the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East Region 
</p>
<p>(currently UCLG&#8211;MEWA).24 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Best practices 
</b></p>
<p>55. Analysis of the responses received to the questionnaire shows that civil society plays 
</p>
<p>an important role in boosting local action in the field of human rights in the respective 
</p>
<p>countries. In Hungary, for example, NGOs can participate in the planning and in the 
</p>
<p>implementation phase of regulations and programmes of the municipalities in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the law. In Burundi, civil society participates actively in the training activities on 
</p>
<p>human rights for the creation of programmes of information and awareness-raising. In 
</p>
<p>India, civil society representatives have been contributing to strengthening the roles of local 
</p>
<p>governments in effectively addressing rights of marginalized citizens at the local level. In 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, NGOs are free to bring forth different projects, for example, against racism. In 
</p>
<p>Luxembourg, the National Council for Foreigners is an example of the participation of civil 
</p>
<p>society in the promotion and protection of human rights. The Council is composed of civil 
</p>

<p>society representatives and is a consultative body that studies the situations of foreigners 
</p>
<p>and their integration. It gives recommendations on government projects and recommends 
</p>
<p>policies. That said, it should also be noted that in some countries civil society does not have 
</p>
<p>any role in protecting human rights at the local level. 
</p>
<p>56. Some initiatives are building local governments&#8217; and authorities&#8217; capacity on human 
</p>
<p>rights: Burundi has targeted police for human rights training; Mexico conducts sessions for 
</p>
<p>civil servants on the new constitutional principles, including human rights; Georgia focuses 
</p>
<p>this capacity-building on citizens directly, rather than on local governments; the Australian 
</p>
<p>Local Government Association and the National Human Rights Commission in Australia 
</p>
<p>work in cooperation to operationalize human rights locally. 
</p>
<p>57. In Hungary, local governments are required to analyse the conditions of 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups in their area and promote equal opportunities for them. Luxembourg 
</p>
<p>mandates Consultative Commissions for social integration &#8211; these commissions make 
</p>
<p>recommendations to the local governments. Burundi states as a best practice the 
</p>
<p>cooperation between local government and the United Nations system. Luxembourg is 
</p>
<p>promoting multilingualism and multiculturalism in public services, such as for integrating 
</p>
<p>migrants. 
</p>
<p>58. In Australia, the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>facilitate local government forums, and has developed a toolkit for local government. The 
</p>
<p>Commission will review local government programmes and practices on request to ensure 
</p>
<p>they are compatible with the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities, and 
</p>
<p>will provide training to local councils.25 
</p>
<p>59. In 1980, the Sakai, Japan, City Government recognized the sanctity of human rights, 
</p>
<p>and affirmed that it would enlist the efforts towards the realization of a &#8220;Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Protection City&#8221;. Sakai City subsequently advanced policy based on the human rights 
</p>
<p>principles and later joined other local governments in formulating its own education and 
</p>
<p>enlightenment plan called the &#8220;Sakai City Action Plan for the United Nations Decade for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Education&#8221;. Following on from previous efforts, in 2007 Sakai enacted the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;City Ordinance for Community Development Respecting Peace and Human Rights&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>the Sakai City Human Rights Policy Promotion Plan&#8221;, and has since comprehensively and 
</p>
<p>systematically advanced human rights policy. 
</p>
<p>60. A programme of the People&#8217;s Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE), 
</p>
<p>since 1998, included the development of 30 human rights cities and the training of 500 
</p>
<p>young community leaders at four Regional Learning Institutions for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Education. By 2007, PDHRE had trained 100 community leaders, and 17 human rights 
</p>
<p>cities were in development.26 
</p>
<p>61. In the Republic of Korea, several local governments and cities have been leading the 
</p>
<p>human rights city movement domestically and internationally. Gwangju was the first 
</p>
<p>human rights city officially announced in the Republic of Korea and Asia in 2010 with full-
</p>
<p>fledged programmes consisting of its Human Rights Charter, human rights action plan with 
</p>
<p>human rights indicators, ombudsperson, etc. Other local governments, such as Seongbuk-gu 
</p>
<p>and Chungnam Province, have also adopted the human rights city framework as a way to

<p>address the challenges in their own contexts, such as a district city within a metropolitan 
</p>
<p>city and an urban-rural complex area. 
</p>
<p>62. Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea, has also declared itself a human rights 
</p>
<p>city and adopted an ordinance in 2012 to protect and promote human rights for its citizens. 
</p>
<p>The ordinance establishes a Human Rights Division within the City Government, human 
</p>
<p>rights policies, a Human Rights Ombudsperson, as well as concrete measures and 
</p>
<p>guidelines to safeguard adequate housing and protect citizens from forced evictions. Other 
</p>
<p>human rights ordinances include the Ordinance on the Promotion of Human Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the Ordinance on the Protection and Promotion of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child and Youth. Human rights mechanisms include the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Division, which carries out human rights education programmes and builds cooperation 
</p>
<p>with civil society, the Ombudsperson, the Seoul Committee on Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Citizen Jury on Human Rights Cases. Major policies on human rights implemented by the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Division include the Seoul Action Plan on Human Rights, to mainstream 
</p>
<p>human rights in overall administration. Human rights sensitivity has been enhanced through 
</p>
<p>human rights education for civil servants and by supporting human rights organizations and 
</p>
<p>activities. 
</p>
<p>63. Like Brazil&#8217;s groundbreaking City Statute (2001), the Mexico City Charter also 
</p>
<p>establishes new rights at a collective dimension of certain individual rights, such as the 
</p>
<p>social function of property. This is a key component of the right to the city that entails 
</p>
<p>fundamental urban reforms and the redistribution and regulation of urban land for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of constructing a more just and inclusive city. The Mexico City Charter also 
</p>
<p>incorporates at least two important principles addressing the right to the city as first 
</p>
<p>articulated by Lefebvre: (a) the right to participate in decisions affecting urban inhabitants 
</p>
<p>and the production of urban space; and (b) the right to appropriate urban space in favour of 
</p>
<p>its use value over exchange value. Notably, these components include legal rights, social 
</p>
<p>and political claims and material conditions. 
</p>
<p>64. The Alliance for Democracy and Tolerance against Extremism and Violence focuses 
</p>
<p>on transferring successful projects and possible solutions among municipalities across 
</p>
<p>regions of Germany. In certain cities, local equality bodies as well as regional commissions, 
</p>
<p>human rights centres, equality bodies and other institutions are established by regional or 
</p>
<p>local governments and maintained by law.27
 The &#8220;human rights city council&#8221; of the City of 
</p>
<p>Graz (Austria) stands as one example.28 
</p>
<p>65. In Slovenia, the Local Government Act (&#167;39) defines rights of national minorities 
</p>
<p>and Roma population to have a formal representation in municipal council, and other 
</p>
<p>municipalities might establish municipal bodies to deal with human rights issues. The 
</p>
<p>programme for solving settlement issues of the Roma population is managed by the State 
</p>
<p>and financially supported by the State budget. 
</p>
<p>66. In the United States, human rights mainstreaming in local administration is taking 
</p>
<p>place through initiatives such as Bringing Human Rights Home: How State and Local 
</p>
<p>Governments Can Use Human Rights to Advance Local Policy. It includes aspirational 
</p>
<p>commitments to, and raising awareness of, human rights, reframing local concerns as 
</p>
<p>human rights issues, reporting on local compliance with human rights treaties, conducting 
</p>
<p>human rights-based audits and impact assessments, and fostering participatory governance. 
</p>
<p>The federal role in respecting and ensuring human rights at the state and local level includes 
</p>
<p>fostering additional reporting, monitoring and education initiatives. The Human Rights

<p>project advocates for greater coordination of federal, state and local efforts to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights within the United States, working directly with state and local 
</p>
<p>agencies. However, state and local efforts are <i>ad hoc</i>, patchwork and vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>elimination through budget cuts.29 
</p>
<p>67. In Denmark, a development project was launched: &#8220;The municipality and Civil 
</p>
<p>Society&#8221; (2008) to test the extent to which new ways to share responsibilities between the 
</p>
<p>municipality and civil society can help to increase the quality of local government tasks. 
</p>
<p>There is an untapped potential &#8211; both in terms of new areas for closer interaction and in 
</p>
<p>relation to the involvement of new groups of volunteers.30

</p>
<p>Racism, the &#8220;Forum der Europapreistr&#228;gerst&#228;dte&#8221;, and the cities coalition &#8220;Cities for 
</p>
<p>Children&#8221;, and was the Cultural Capital of Europe in 2003. In November 2009, Graz invited 
</p>
<p>partner-towns to exchange successful methods of integration for immigrants against racism. 
</p>
<p>Campaigns against racism and anti-discrimination have been organized with other cities 
</p>
<p>and with NGOs. 
</p>
<p>69. Through its programme &#8220;Medellin protects Human Rights&#8221;, the City Council seeks 
</p>
<p>to guarantee for the city integral protection, acknowledgement, restoration and reparation of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The organs empowered for the implementation of this goal are the 
</p>
<p>Sub-Secretary of Human Rights, which is composed of three Units, including a Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Unit, whose activities and some of its programmes are described by the collaborator. 
</p>
<p>The Unit has the duty to coordinate its actions with the diverse national organs, social 
</p>
<p>organizations and NGOs. The Unit includes a Municipal System for Information on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, which consists of a tool for the gathering, processing and analysis of information 
</p>
<p>related to human rights and International Humanitarian Law.

<p>70. In San Francisco, the Commission on the Status of Women is required by a city 
</p>
<p>charter amendment to conduct gender analysis of its commissions and boards every two 
</p>
<p>years. There also, the San Francisco Gender Equality Principles Initiative is a programme 
</p>
<p>that helps companies around the world achieve greater equality and build more productive 
</p>
<p>workplaces through practical implementations of the Initiative. A Violence against Women 
</p>
<p>Prevention and Intervention Grants Program addresses domestic violence, sexual assault, 
</p>
<p>and human trafficking in a variety of San Francisco communities. San Francisco&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Collaborative against Human Trafficking, launched in 2010, comprises a diverse array of

<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations

<p>71. <b>Civil society should actively be involved in human rights planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation at the local level. It can pressure local authorities into adopting a 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights-based approach and making them more engaged. It also has an

<p><b>of local government performance. Civil society organizations may also work directly 
</b></p>
<p><b>with local government to strengthen its human rights expertise and awareness. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Local public officials should keep up ongoing dialogue with citizens and with 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society. There have to be well-developed channels for this communication and 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaboration. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Measures should be taken, both nationally and internationally, to strengthen 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society capacity to monitor and engage with local government. Outside large 
</b></p>
<p><b>urban municipalities, civil society is often weak and has little experience of monitoring 
</b></p>
<p><b>or cooperating with local government.</b>32<b> International city networks such as the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) can play a key role in developing toolkits, 
</b></p>
<p><b>foster research, provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and create 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities for action. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Central government is responsible for providing valuable information on 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and their impact at the local level to local governments. This obligation 
</b></p>
<p><b>to inform the respective bodies at the local level includes both human rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national constitution or other law and human rights guaranteed by international law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Developments in improving human rights on the international level (e.g. new treaties 
</b></p>
<p><b>and conventions, recommendations, guidelines and examples of best practice) must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>brought to the local level. In doing so, it is of utmost importance that there is more 
</b></p>
<p><b>than mere information <i>in abstracto</i>. There is a need for making human rights more 
</b></p>
<p><b>concrete and more practicable for the specific needs on the local level. Particularly 
</b></p>
<p><b>when it comes to international guarantees of human rights, the central government 
</b></p>
<p><b>has to translate the relevant issues of human rights protection into concrete measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be taken or standards to be obeyed. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In making human rights more practicable and more effective on the local level, 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific areas that are highly connected to the effective implementation of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights at the local level should be identified. For example, if public services are 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided at the local level, this can be identified as a field where non-discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>access must be guaranteed. In order to support the local government in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>observance of human rights, </b>&#8220;road maps&#8221; for human rights implementation for these 
</p>
<p><b>specific areas should be developed. They could be a valuable tool to facilitate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of human rights at the local level (by non-experts in human rights). 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In its report to the Human Rights Council, the Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>emphasized the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/HRC/28/73). It recommended building up an integrated strategy for the promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights and for the fight against corruption. This outcome of the report is 
</b></p>
<p><b>also relevant for the promotion of human rights at the local level. Specific attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be paid to any area at the local level being prone to corruption, especially the 
</b></p>
<p><b>provision of public services. On the one side, taking measures against corruption 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be regarded as a human rights issue. On the other side, promoting human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights cannot be successful and effective without taking measures against corruption. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific consideration should therefore be given to any preventive measures in this 
</b></p>
<p><b>regard. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>In the context of monitoring of the domestic implementation of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights commitments, the relevant United Nations mechanisms should 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourage States to engage in a dialogue with local governments as well. Local 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities should be involved in the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in respect of

<p><b>their Government; this would improve the quality of the follow-up to the accepted 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations. UPR recommendations and concluding observations of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations treaty bodies should be disseminated by the central government to the local 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. A reference should also be made to the Harmonized guidelines on 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting under the international human rights treaties, including guidelines on a 
</b></p>
<p><b>common core document and treaty-specific targeted documents, in which the 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting States are encouraged to </b>ensure the &#8220;p<b>articipation of governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>departments at the central, regional and local levels and, where appropriate, at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>federal and provincial levels</b>&#8221;<b> (HRI/MC/2005/3, para. 50 (a)). 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>There is also a need to develop guiding principles for local government and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, taking into account various standards related to the role of local 
</b></p>
<p><b>government and the city in implementing internationally recognized human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Such guiding principles, once adopted, will be a useful instrument to clarify the role of 
</b></p>
<p><b>various actors and institutions, and to develop concrete strategies in implementing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations of the present report and other recommendations from special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures of the Human Rights Council, its UPR mechanism and United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies.
