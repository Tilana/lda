</p>
<p>  &#8220;1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the latest legal and political 
developments in Haiti, which have been marked by:

president to another who is from an opposition party, and stresses the 
importance of ensuring that forthcoming local and parliamentary elections are 
carried out under proper conditions; 
</p>
<p> (b) The appointment and investiture of 11 of the 12 judges of the Court of 
Cassation, including the chief justice, and progress towards placing sufficient 
material and human resources at the disposal of the justice system to permit 
the implementation of the judicial reform adopted in 2007, and underscores 
the need to improve the operation of the Haitian prison system. 
</p>
<p>  2. The Council also welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; plans to build 
housing for victims of the earthquake of 12 January 2010. It further welcomes the 
establishment of a special fund for children&#8217;s schooling in Haiti.

commitment and determination to improve the living conditions of Haitian women 
and men by, inter alia, devoting greater attention to respect for human rights.

<p>  4. The Council also applauds the priorities set by the President of the 
Republic, which include the rule of law, education, the environment and

<p>  5. The Council emphasizes that the strengthening of national human 
rights institutions, such as the Office of Citizen Protection, as well as respect for 
human rights and due process of law, the fight against crime and its causes, and the 
effort to combat impunity are essential in order to ensure the rule of law and security 
in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>  6. The Council invites the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt the 
necessary political and legal measures, including measures to combat the trafficking 
of children, in order to guarantee the rights of members of vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>  7. The Council also invites the Government of Haiti to continue to adopt 
the necessary political and legal measures to increase women&#8217;s participation in 
political affairs and to continue to combat gender-based violence and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>  8. The Council is aware of the many obstacles to development in Haiti 
and the difficulties encountered by its leaders following the earthquake of 12 
January 2010. It recognizes that the full enjoyment of civil and political, economic, 
social and cultural human rights is a factor in peace, stability and development in 
Haiti. 
</p>
<p>  9. The Council encourages the international community as a whole and, 
in particular, international donors, the Group of Latin American and Caribbean 
States, the group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti and United Nations 
specialized agencies to step up their cooperation with the Haitian authorities with a 
view to the full realization in Haiti of civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p>  10. The Council welcomes the request of the Haitian authorities for a one-
year extension of the mission of the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in Haiti, whose mandate concerns technical assistance and capacity-building, 
and decides to approve this request. 
</p>
<p>  11. The Council encourages the independent expert to work with 
international institutions, donors and the international community to raise their 
awareness of the need to provide their expertise and sufficient resources to support 
the Haitian authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the country in the wake of the earthquake 
of 12 January 2010. 
</p>
<p>  12. The Council also encourages the independent expert to continue to 
work with Haitian non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations in 
Haiti. 
</p>
<p>  13. The Council invites the independent expert to assist the Government 
of Haiti to act upon the recommendations made in the course of the universal 
periodic review. He will also provide his experience, expertise and contribution to 
the cause of human rights, including civil and political rights and with particular 
emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights, in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>  14. The Council also invites the independent expert to submit his report at 
the twentieth session, to pursue his mission in Haiti in the near future and to report 
to the Council thereon at its twenty-second session. It encourages the Haitian 
authorities to continue to cooperate with the independent expert.&#8221;
