<p> </p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided also</i> by article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>according to which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be 
</p>
<p>arbitrarily deprived of his nationality, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its decision 2/111 of 27 November 2006, as well as all previous 
</p>
<p>resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the issue of human 
</p>
<p>rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality, in particular resolution 2005/45 of 19 
</p>
<p>April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the right of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, 
</p>
<p>renunciation or loss of nationality, in accordance with international law, and noting 
</p>
<p>that the issue of statelessness is already under consideration by the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>within the broad issue of State succession, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the relevant provisions of international human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>instruments on statelessness and nationality, inter alia, article 5, paragraph (d) (iii) of

</p>

</p>
<p>Statelessness, </p>

<p> <i>Recalling</i> that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality are protected by 
</p>
<p>international human rights and refugee law as well as instruments on statelessness, 
</p>
<p>including, with respect to States parties, the Convention relating to the Status of 
</p>
<p>Stateless Persons and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 
</p>
<p>Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
</p>
<p>interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a 
</p>
<p>fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, as reaffirmed 
</p>
<p>in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World 
</p>
<p>Conference on Human Rights in June 1993, the 2005 World Summit Outcome and 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, by which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>established the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 61/137 of 25 January 2007, in which, 
</p>
<p>inter alia, the Assembly urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Refugees to continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, 
</p>
<p>preventing and reducing statelessness and protecting stateless persons, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the important work of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees in seeking to address and prevent the problem of 
</p>
<p>statelessness, including the adoption by its Executive Committee of the conclusion on 
</p>
<p>identification, prevention and reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless 
</p>
<p>persons No. 106 (LVII) - 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 
</p>
<p>of 3 December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms and to refrain from denying these to individuals in their 
</p>
<p>populations because of nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 55/153 of 12 December 2000 and 
</p>
<p>59/34 of 2 December 2004 on the nationality of natural persons in relation to the 
</p>
<p>succession of States, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the resolutions of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and 
</p>
<p>Protection of Human Rights on the rights of non-citizens, in particular of paragraph 7 </p>

<p>of its resolution 2003/21 of 13 August 2003, and also of the final report of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the rights of non-citizens 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/23 and Add.1-4), 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups 
</p>
<p>of persons of their nationality, especially on racial, national, ethnic, religious, gender 
</p>
<p>or political grounds, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead 
</p>
<p>to statelessness, and in this regard expressing concern at various forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination against stateless persons that violate the obligations of States under 
</p>
<p>international human rights law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Emphasizing</i> that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons 
</p>
<p>whose nationality may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the right to a nationality of every human person is a 
</p>
<p>fundamental human right; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that arbitrary deprivation of nationality on racial, national, 
</p>
<p>ethnic, religious, political or gender grounds is a violation of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures 
</p>
<p>and from enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of 
</p>
<p>their nationality on grounds of race, colour, gender, religion, political opinion or 
</p>
<p>national or ethnic origin, especially if such measures and legislation render a person 
</p>
<p>stateless; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a 
</p>
<p>view to avoiding statelessness, consistent with fundamental principles of international 
</p>
<p>law, in particular by preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness 
</p>
<p>as a result of State succession; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not already done so to consider accession 
</p>
<p>to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to 
</p>
<p>the Status of Stateless Persons; </p>

<p> 6. <i>Notes</i> that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms of an individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of 
</p>
<p>nationality, thereby hampering his or her social integration; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure that an effective remedy is available to 
</p>
<p>persons who have been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> the appropriate mechanisms of the Council and the appropriate 
</p>
<p>United Nations treaty bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Refugees to continue to collect information on the issue of human 
</p>
<p>rights and arbitrary deprivation of nationality from all relevant sources and to take 
</p>
<p>account of such information, together with any recommendations thereon, in their 
</p>
<p>reports and activities conducted within their respective mandates; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to collect information on this question 
</p>
<p>from all relevant sources and to make it available to the Council at its tenth session; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter at its tenth session 
</p>
<p>under the same agenda item. 
</p>
<p><i>40th meeting 
27 March 2008 
</i></p>
<p>Adopted without a vote.
