<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/9 of 
16 June 2011 on national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, 
which requests the Secretary-General to report at the twentieth session of the Human Rights 
Council on the implementation of the resolution. The report outlines progress achieved 
since the last report of the Secretary-General on this subject, submitted to the Human 
Rights Council at its sixteenth session in March 2011 (A/HRC/16/76). This report should 
be read in conjunction with the Secretary-General&#8217;s report to the General Assembly on 
national human rights institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights 
(A/66/274) and with the Secretary-General&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council on the 
activities of the International Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in accrediting national institutions in 
compliance with the Paris Principles (A/HRC/20/10). 
</p>
<p>2. By its resolution 17/9, the Human Rights Council recognized the important role of 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 
assisting the development of independent and effective national institutions for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (NHRIs) in accordance with the principles 
relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human 
rights (Paris Principles). It also welcomed the role of the International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 
assessing the conformity of NHRIs with the Paris Principles and in providing assistance in 
strengthening their capacities. The Human Rights Council recognized the role of 
independent NHRIs in working together with Governments to ensure full respect for human 
rights at the national level, including by contributing to follow-up actions, as appropriate, to 
recommendations resulting from the international human rights mechanisms, as well as in 
supporting cooperation between their Governments and the United Nations in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. The Human Rights Council encouraged NHRIs 
to continue playing an active role in the prevention and protection of human rights as 
provided for in international human rights instruments and encouraged member States to 
establish effective, independent and pluralistic NHRIs; or, where they already exist, to 
enhance their capacities to better promote and protect all human rights.

<p><b> 2. International expert seminar on the relationship between NHRIs and Parliaments  
</b></p>
<p>67. On 22 and 23 February 2012, an international expert seminar on the relationship 
between NHRIs and Parliaments was held in Belgrade, organized by OHCHR, the 
International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs, the National Assembly of the Republic of 
Serbia and the Protector of Citizens of the Republic of Serbia, with the support of the 
United Nations country team. The seminar brought together representatives of NHRIs, 
Parliaments and scholars from all over the world to discuss ways to strengthen cooperation 
between NHRIs and Parliaments. The participants adopted a set of principles aimed at 
providing guidance on how to develop the cooperation between NHRIs and Parliaments 
called the Belgrade principles on the relationship between NHRIs and parliaments (see 
annex). 
</p>
<p><b> III. Cooperation between United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>68. NHRI cooperation with international and regional human rights mechanisms is a key 
requirement of the Paris Principles. Therefore, OHCHR, in coordination with the 
International Coordinating Committee and its Geneva representative, continued to support 
NHRI engagement with the Human Rights Council mechanisms, namely the universal 
periodic review and special procedures. In June 2011, the General Assembly, by its 
resolution 65/281, adopted the outcome of the review of the work and functioning of the 
Human Right Council, which includes provisions regarding the &#8220;A&#8221; status NHRI 
participation and interaction with the universal periodic review and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>69. In 2011, an average of 21 NHRIs participated in each of the Human Rights Council 
sessions. They were active before and during the sessions, presenting statements, 
submitting written documentation, participating in general debates, organizing parallel 
events and interacting with special procedures. 
</p>
<p>70. At the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, NHRIs from Georgia, South 
Africa and Timor-Leste made video statements following the presentation of the reports of 
the special procedures on enforced disappearances, the right to food, and arbitrary 
detention. This new practice is expected to be further applied in future sessions of the 
Council, on a case-by-case basis, upon request from interested NHRIs. 
</p>
<p>71. On 9 March 2011, in the margins of the sixteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council, OHCHR and the Advisory Council on Human Rights of Morocco organized, a

</p>
<p>Coordinating Committee in accrediting national institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles, 
A/HRC/20/10. </p>


<p>side event on the implementation of the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission of Morocco.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>72. In 2011, 49 countries were reviewed under the universal periodic review (tenth&#8211;
twelfth sessions) out of which 21 have an NHRI accredited by the International 
Coordinating Committee. Eighteen NHRIs (16 &#8220;A&#8221; status and 2 &#8220;B&#8221; status) submitted 
information for the stakeholders&#8217; report.4 
</p>
<p>73. During the review of Ireland and Tanzania (twelfth session), OHCHR assisted the 
Human Rights Commission of Ireland and the Commission for Human Rights and Good 
Governance of the United Republic of Tanzania to organize a side event on the review 
preparation process and on the role NHRIs can play in that context.  
</p>
<p>74. OHCHR assisted upon their request, the NHRIs of Nepal, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste 
and the United Republic of Tanzania to submit information to the review and to participate 
in the relevant sessions of the Council.  
</p>
<p>75. According to the General Assembly resolution 65/281, NHRIs in compliance with 
the Paris Principles will have an active role to play during the second cycle of the universal 
periodic review. A separate section for contributions by NHRIs accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status 
by the International Coordinating Committee of the State under review will be included in 
the summary of information provided by the relevant stakeholders. They will be also 
allowed to intervene immediately after the State concerned during the adoption of the 
outcome of the review by the Council plenary. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Special procedures  
</b></p>
<p>76. During the general debates at the Human Rights Council sessions, a number of 
NHRIs interacted with special procedures and also submitted written contributions 
regarding reports of special procedure mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>77. OHCHR regularly provides special procedure mandate holders with information 
concerning the work of NHRIs in the preparation of their missions. Increasingly, mandate 
holders are seeking NHRIs&#8217; assistance in ensuring that their recommendations are followed 
up at the national level. This is an important area of work for NHRIs and should be further 
encouraged. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>78. OHCHR continued to support the participation of NHRIs in treaty bodies&#8217; sessions. 
OHCHR regularly updates a compilation of all treaty bodies&#8217; concluding observations and 
recommendations referring to NHRIs (http://nhri.ohchr.org) and sends the concluding 
observations to the NHRIs concerned.  
</p>
<p>79. In 2011, OHCHR developed an information note to provide practical information to 
NHRIs wishing to access the treaty body system, including specific opportunities for NHRI 
interaction with the treaty bodies and the working methods and rules of procedures of treaty 
bodies that are relevant to the participation of NHRIs. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Republic of Moldova, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Sierra Leone, Uganda, United 
Republic of Tanzania, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Zimbabwe. </p>


<p>80. On 11 July 2011, the Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee of 
NHRIs and the NHRIs of Denmark, Ethiopia, France and Germany participated in a session 
organized by the Human Rights Committee on improving cooperation with NHRIs.  
</p>
<p>81. In June 2011, a regional seminar on follow-up to the concluding observations of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was held in Pretoria, with about 30 
participants from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe (Governmental 
officials, representatives of NHRIs and NGOs). 
</p>
<p>82. In November 2011, training for South African Government officials and NHRIs was 
held in Pretoria on treaty body reporting and implementation of treaty bodies&#8217; 
recommendations. NHRIs and civil society representatives participated in the training, 
which introduced the treaty body system and, focusing on the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child and the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Commission on the Status of Women 
</b></p>
<p>83. The International Coordinating Committee of NHRIs, with the support of OHCHR, 
continued its advocacy for &#8220;A&#8221; status NHRIs participation rights at annual sessions of the 
Commission, which helped to raise awareness of the role of NHRIs and the practical 
contributions they could make at the Commission&#8217;s sessions to better advance the rights of 
women and girls. At present, NHRIs may only participate at the Commission&#8217;s sessions if 
they are invited to attend as part of their Government&#8217;s delegation. In March 2011, the 
NHRIs of Australia, Jordan, Korea, New Zealand and the Philippines attended the fifty-fifth 
session of the Commission in New York. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Other meetings 
</b></p>
<p>84. At the Fourth Conference of State Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, the International Coordinating Committee delivered a statement on how 
the role of NHRIs in the work of the Conference can be formalized. A side event was 
organized in the margins of the Conference to discuss the role of NHRIs as independent 
mechanisms to promote, protect and monitor the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>85. In 2011, NHRIs were invited to contribute to panel discussions during the first 
sessions of the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing and expressed their readiness for a 
continued participation of NHRIs in the work thereof, based on practices established at the 
Human Rights Council and during the development of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation and support to national human rights 
institutions by United Nations agencies and programmes, and 
international and regional organizations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. United Nations Development Programme 
</b></p>
<p>86. Engagement with NHRIs is a priority area for OHCHR and UNDP, which have both 
been increasingly involved in the establishment and strengthening of NHRIs. Currently, 
UNDP and OHCHR support the establishment and strengthening of 80 NHRIs through 
joint technical cooperation initiatives, including advocacy for the establishment of NHRIs, 
capacity needs assessment, enhancing governments&#8217; capacity to meet international treaty 
obligations and preparation for the universal periodic review. </p>


<p>87. The first annual strategic partnership review meeting between UNDP, OHCHR and 
the International Coordinating Committee took place on 26 August 2011, in New York. The 
purpose of the meeting was to review progress of the partnership and identify areas for 
future cooperation to guide support given to NHRIs.  
</p>
<p>88. In May 2011, a first working session between UNDP, OHCHR and the Network of 
African National Human Rights Institutions was held in the margins of the twenty-fourth 
annual meeting of the International Coordinating Committee. As a result, an outline for the 
development of a comprehensive institutional strategic plan for 2012&#8211;2014 of the Network 
was adopted. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Population Fund  
</b></p>
<p>89. In June 2011, the Asia Pacific Forum and the United Nations Population Fund held a 
regional consultation in Kuala Lumpur on integrating reproductive rights into the work of 
NHRIs. The consultation brought together representatives of NHRIs to promote 
collaboration and develop strategies for strengthening the capacity of NHRIs to work on 
reproductive rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  International Organization of la Francophonie  
</b></p>
<p>90. Within the framework of their standing partnership, OHCHR and the International 
Organization of la Francophonie developed and implemented joint capacity-building and 
technical cooperation programmes to establish and strengthen NHRIs in French-speaking 
countries, including Burundi, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Haiti. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>As part of a strong national protection system, NHRIs compliant with the Paris 
Principles have an important role to address the core human rights concerns at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national level and to ensure that international human rights norms and standards are 
</b></p>
<p><b>respected.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>States are encouraged to ensure that NHRIs are provided with a broad 
mandate to protect and promote all human rights, including economic, social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural rights, and strengthen their independence to enable them to fulfil effectively 
</b></p>
<p><b>their mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The engagement of NHRIs in protecting and promoting the rights of women, 
older persons and persons with disabilities is welcomed. NHRIs are encouraged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue interacting and advocating for independent participation in all relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations mechanisms, including the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conference of States Parties to Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities calls 
upon States to establish national monitoring mechanisms to implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention. Criteria and best practices of NHRI involvement in this function should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be explored and developed. NHRIs are encouraged to continue monitoring the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the Convention at the national level.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Parliaments should play a critical role in securing the independence and 
functioning of NHRIs. The Paris Principles require effective cooperation between 
</b></p>
<p><b>NHRIs and parliaments and, in this regard, the adoption of the Belgrade principles on </b></p>


<p><b>the relationship between national human rights institutions and parliament is 
</b></p>
<p><b>welcomed. States are encouraged to use the Belgrade Principles as guidelines to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen cooperation between NHRIs and parliaments for the promotion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights at the national level.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Paris Principles highlight the need for NHRIs to develop strong 
cooperation with civil society organizations. There is a need for open, participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>and pluralistic processes while establishing or strengthening NHRIs in compliance 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Paris Principles, as well as during the selection and appointment of members 
</b></p>
<p><b>of NHRIs.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>NHRIs are encouraged to continue engaging with all United Nations human 
rights mechanisms, in particular, the human rights treaty bodies, special procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the universal periodic review. NHRIs are encouraged to actively engage in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty body strengthening process with a view to strengthen the protection and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion of human rights at the national level. NHRIs are also encouraged to 
</b></p>
<p><b>actively follow up to the implementation of  recommendations of treaty bodies, special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures and the universal periodic review at the national level, and to promote the 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation of </b>NHRIs in the States parties&#8217; <b>reporting process. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The implementation of OHCHR-UNDP NHRI capacity-assessment project to 
review the effectiveness and efficiency of NHRIs in discharging their mandate is 
</b></p>
<p><b>welcomed and should be continued.

<p><b> I. </b>Parliament&#8217;s role in establishing a <b>national institution for the 
promotion and protection of human rights and securing its functioning, 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence and accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Founding law 
</b></p>
<p>1. Parliaments, when deliberating the draft legislation for the establishment of a 
national human rights institution, should consult widely with relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>2. Parliaments should develop a legal framework for the national institution for the 
promotion and protection of human rights (NHRI) which secures its independence and its 
direct accountability to parliament, in compliance with the principles relating to the status 
of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) 
and taking into account the general observations of the International Coordinating 
</p>
<p>  
 a  The Conference was attended by experts from NHRIs, parliaments and universities from  Ecuador,

of a NHRI and for any amendments to the founding law.  
</p>
<p>4. Parliaments, during the consideration and adoption of possible amendments to the 
founding law of a NHRI, should scrutinize such proposed amendments with a view to 
ensuring the independence and effective functioning of such institution, and carry out 
consultation with the members of NHRIs and with other stakeholders such as civil society 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>5. Parliaments should keep the implementation of the founding law under review.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Financial independence  
</b></p>
<p>6. Parliaments should ensure the financial independence of NHRIs by including in the 
founding law the relevant provisions. 
</p>
<p>7. NHRIs should submit to parliaments a strategic plan and/or an annual programme of 
activities. Parliaments should take into account the strategic plan and/or annual programme 
of activities submitted by the NHRI when discussing budget proposals to ensure financial 
independence of the institution.  
</p>
<p>8. Parliaments should invite the members of NHRIs to debate the strategic plan and/or 
its annual programme of activities in relation to the annual budget.  
</p>
<p>9. Parliaments should ensure that NHRIs have sufficient resources to perform the 
functions assigned to them by the founding law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Appointment and dismissal process  
</b></p>
<p>10. Parliaments should clearly lay down in the founding law a transparent selection and 
appointment process, as well as for the dismissal of the members of NHRIs in case of such 
an eventuality, involving civil society where appropriate.   
</p>
<p>11. Parliaments should ensure the openness and transparency of the appointment 
process.   
</p>
<p>12. Parliaments should secure the independence of a NHRI by incorporating in the 
founding law a provision on immunity for actions taken in an official capacity. 
</p>
<p>13. Parliaments should clearly lay down in the founding law that, where there is a 
vacancy in the composition of the membership of a NHRI, the vacancy must be filled 
within a reasonable time. After expiration of the tenure of office of a member of a NHRI, 
such member should continue in office until the successor takes office.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Reporting 
</b></p>
<p>14. NHRIs should report directly to parliament.  
</p>
<p>15. NHRIs should submit to parliament an annual report on activities, along with a 
summary of its accounts, and report on the human rights situation in the country and on any 
other issue that is related to human rights. 
</p>
<p>16. Parliaments should receive, review and respond to NHRI reports and ensure that 
they debate the priorities of the NHRI and should seek opportunities to debate the most 
significant reports of the NHRI promptly.  
</p>
<p>17. Parliaments should develop a principled framework for debating the activities of 
NHRIs consistent with respect for their independence.  </p>


<p>18. Parliaments should hold open discussions on the recommendations issued by 
NHRIs.  
</p>
<p>19. Parliaments should seek information from the relevant public authorities on the 
extent to which the relevant public authorities have considered and responded to NHRIs 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Forms of cooperation between parliaments and NHRIs 
</b></p>
<p>20. NHRIs and parliaments should agree the basis for cooperation, including by 
establishing a formal framework to discuss human rights issues of common interest.  
</p>
<p>21. Parliaments should identify or establish an appropriate parliamentary committee that 
will be the NHRI&#8217;s main point of contact within parliament.   
</p>
<p>22. NHRIs should develop a strong working relationship with the relevant specialized 
parliamentary committee including, if appropriate, through a memorandum of 
understanding. NHRIs and parliamentary committees should also develop formalized 
relationships where relevant to their work.  
</p>
<p>23. Members of the relevant specialized parliamentary committee and NHRI should 
meet regularly and maintain a constant dialogue, in order to strengthen the interchange of 
information and identify areas of possible collaboration in the protection and promotion of 
human rights.  
</p>
<p>24. Parliaments should ensure participation of NHRIs and seek their expert advice in 
relation to human rights during meetings and proceedings of various parliamentary

<p>27. NHRIs should be consulted by Parliaments on the content and applicability of a 
proposed new law with respect to ensuring human rights norms and principles are reflected 
therein. 
</p>
<p>28. Parliaments should involve NHRIs in the legislative processes, including by inviting 
them to give evidence and advice about the human rights compatibility of proposed laws 
and policies. 
</p>
<p>29. NHRIs should make proposals of amendments to legislation where necessary, in 
order to harmonize domestic legislation with both national and international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>30. NHRIs should work with parliaments to promote human rights by legislating to 
implement human rights obligations, recommendations of treaty bodies and human rights 
judgments of courts.  
</p>
<p>31. NHRIs should work with parliaments to develop effective human rights impact 
assessment processes of proposed laws and policies. </p>


<p><b> IV. Cooperation between NHRIs and parliaments in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>32. Parliaments should seek to be involved in the process of ratification of international 
human rights treaties and should consult NHRIs in this process of ratification, and in 
monitoring the State&#8217;s compliance with all of its international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>33. NHRIs should give opinions to parliaments on proposed reservations or 
interpretative declarations, on the adequacy of the State&#8217;s implementation of human rights 
obligations and on its compliance with those obligations. 
</p>
<p>34. Parliaments and NHRIs should cooperate to ensure that the international treaty 
bodies are provided with all relevant information about the State&#8217;s compliance with those 
obligations and to follow up recommendations of the treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>35. NHRIs should regularly inform parliaments about the various recommendations 
made to the State by regional and international human rights mechanisms, including the 
universal periodic review, the treaty bodies and the special procedure mandate holders.  
</p>
<p>36. Parliaments and NHRIs should jointly develop a strategy to follow up systematically 
the recommendations made by regional and international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Cooperation between NHRIs and parliaments in the education, training 
</b></p>
<p><b>and awareness-raising of human rights</b>b<b>
