<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains an analysis of the progress made by Colombia in 
implementing the recommendations made by the former Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, following his visit to the 
country from 8-18 June 2009 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2). During his visit the Special 
Rapporteur documented killings by security officers, guerrillas and illegal armed groups 
and the effectiveness of the justice system to ensure accountability for the killings; the 
situation of especially vulnerable groups; and institutional capacity and reform. He made 
recommendations on four broad areas, namely: reform of security policies; increased 
allocation of resources to State institutions to provide accountability for human rights and 
humanitarian law violations; establishment of a truth commission to conduct an 
independent investigation into the history of and responsibility for killings by all actors 
during the conflict in Colombia; and the necessity for the State to ensure that its policies do 
not lead to further victimization of vulnerable groups who have been disproportionately 
targeted throughout the conflict. 
</p>
<p> Within the period under review, the State has taken certain steps to prevent the 
occurrence of extrajudicial killings, including through the adoption by the Ministry of 
Defence of 15 specific measures. However, cases of extrajudicial executions continue to be

<p>reported, and progress in criminal and disciplinary investigations remains lacking. The 
persistent impunity and the lack of accountability for officers is a principal concern.  
</p>
<p> While a significant number of cases have been transferred from the military justice 
system to the ordinary penal system, the continuous attempts by the military justice system 
to claim jurisdiction over cases are of great concern. The State did not provide the Special 
Rapporteur with information on the outcome of related disciplinary and criminal 
investigations and whether sanctions were applied. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his 
calls for strengthened resources for investigations by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and for 
undertaking technical investigations through the Technical Investigation Unit of the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office. A national policy on exhumations should be implemented, and 
reports on investigations of grave sites that might contain victims of extrajudicial killings 
should be made public. 
</p>
<p> The State should adopt effective measures to combat illegal armed groups 
established after the demobilization of paramilitary groups. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the State to significantly strengthen its efforts to establish accountability for extrajudicial 
executions, ensure the effective protection of victims and witnesses and, through 
consultations with affected communities, take preventive protection measures for 
vulnerable groups.<b>

<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 17/5, the Human Rights Council urged States, inter 
alia, to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions in the performance of his or her task and to supply all necessary 
information requested by him or her, as well as to ensure appropriate follow-up to his or her 
recommendations and conclusions, including by providing the Special Rapporteur with 
information on the actions taken on those recommendations.   
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur concurs with his predecessor on the importance of follow-up 
reports as a critical component of country visits to investigate allegations of violations of 
the right to life. Country visits are an essential means to obtain direct and first-hand 
information on human rights violations. They allow for direct observation of the human 
rights situation and facilitate an intensive dialogue with all relevant interlocutors in the 
country concerned. The main purpose of country visits is to assess the actual situation in the 
country concerned, including the relevant institutional, legal, judicial, and administrative 
aspects, and to make recommendations thereon in relation to issues that arise under the 
relevant mandate. Country visits by mandate holders provide an opportunity to enhance 
awareness at the country, regional and international levels of the specific problems under 
consideration. This is done, inter alia, through meetings, briefings, press coverage of the 
visit and dissemination of the report.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with established practice,1 the present follow-up report concerns the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor on his visit to Colombia. 
The present report accompanies follow-up reports on the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (A/HRC/20/22/Add.1) and the United States of America (A/HRC/20/22/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>4. The present follow-up report was prepared on the basis of all available information. 
The Special Rapporteur requested information from the Government and from other actors 
on the steps that had been taken to implement the recommendations made by his 
predecessor. Information on the non-implementation of recommendations was also sought. 
In addition, information was sought on the current situation concerning extrajudicial 
executions in the country, and particularly on whether and how the situation has improved, 
deteriorated or remained static since the visit of the previous mandate holder. Consultations 
were also undertaken with domestic and international civil society groups.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>5. The present report contains an analysis of progress made by the Government of 
Colombia in implementing recommendations made by the former Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions following his visit to the country from 8-18 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In order to assess the extent to which States had implemented recommendations, in 2006 the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor, Philip Alston, initiated follow-up reports on country visits. The first 
follow-up report (E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2) concerned the recommendations made by a prior mandate 
holder, Asma Jahangir, on her visits to Brazil, Honduras, Jamaica and Sudan. Subsequent follow-up 
reports were issued: in 2008, on missions conducted to Sri Lanka and Nigeria (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3); in 
2009, on visits to Guatemala (A/HRC/11/2/Add.7) and the Philippines (A/HRC/11/2/Add.8); in 2010, 
on visits to the Central African Republic (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5) and Brazil (A/HRC/14/24/Add.4); 
and in 2011, on visits to Kenya (A/HRC/17/28/Add.4) and Afghanistan (A/HRC/17/28/Add.6); and in 
2012, on visits to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (A/HRC/20/22/Add.1) and the United States 
of America (A/HRC/20/22/Add.3). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>June 2009 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2). During his visit, the Special Rapporteur documented 
killings by security officers, guerrillas, paramilitaries and illegal armed groups, and 
examined the effectiveness of the criminal, civil and military justice systems in relation to 
the killings. He further addressed the situation of especially vulnerable groups, including 
human rights defenders, trade unionists, women, gay, lesbian and transgender activists, and 
Afro-Colombia and indigenous communities, and highlighted the need for strengthened 
institutional capacity and reform.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur made recommendations on four broad areas, namely: reform 
of security policies; increased allocation of resources to State institutions to provide 
accountability for human rights and humanitarian law violations by, inter alia, State forces, 
guerrillas and illegal armed groups; the establishment of a truth commission to conduct an 
independent investigation into the history of and responsibility for killings by all actors 
during the conflict in Colombia; and the necessity for the State to ensure that its policies do 
not lead to further victimization of vulnerable groups who have been disproportionately 
targeted throughout the conflict. 
</p>
<p>7. In the country visit report, it was noted that Colombia was emerging from a conflict 
which has lasted for 50 years, the repercussions of which were still being addressed by the 
Government. The main parties to the conflict were left-wing guerrilla groups, primarily the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&#8211;People&#8217;s Army (Fuerzas Armadas 
Revolucionarias de Colombia &#8211; Ej&#233;rcito del Pueblo, FARC-EP) and the National Liberation 
Army (Ej&#233;rcito de Liberaci&#243;n Nacional, ELN) and right-wing paramilitaries aligned with 
the State against the guerrillas. It was observed that all parties to the conflict committed 
human rights and humanitarian law violations.  
</p>
<p><b> III. </b>&#8213;<b><i>Falsos positivos</i></b> &#8214; and killings by security forces <b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. In the country visit report, the Special Rapporteur documented the phenomenon of 
so-called &#8213;<i>falsos positivos</i>&#8214; (&#8213;false positives&#8214;)&#8212;unlawful killings of civilians, staged by the 
security forces to look like lawful killings in combat of guerrillas or criminals. The 
existence of the falsos positivos was not in dispute; however the motivation behind the 
disturbing frequency of these occurrences between 2004 and 2008 was debatable. Some 
interlocutors contended that it was a State policy, the State on the other hand posited that 
many false allegations of falsos positivos were being made, when some of those killed were 
in fact guerrillas or criminals. The Government noted that the phenomenon was not 
widespread, and that where such unlawful killings occurred they were isolated instances.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur during his mission received reports of such killings across 
the country; however there were discrepancies in the statistics on the number of such 
killings. He concluded that a significant number of falsos positivos killings had been 
committed by security forces across the country by members of the security forces of 
Colombia. He noted that the Soacha cases exemplified the existence of the phenomenon&#8212;
an observation based on, inter alia, interviews with the families of the victims and evidence 
presented (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2, para. 14).  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur indicated that a number of factors contributed to the killings, 
including pressure in military units to produce results and demonstrate that ground was 
being gained against guerrillas and criminals; rewards and incentives for the killings of 
guerrillas by military forces; and lack of accountability for violations. He noted that the 
Government had made efforts to reduce the number of falsos positivos killings, including 
through disciplinary sanctions, dismissal of military personnel, increased cooperation with 
the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations with respect to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>monitoring, and the creation of a specialized prosecutor within the Attorney General&#8217;s 
Office (Fiscal&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n) to deal with alleged extrajudicial killings.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Continued occurrence of killings and accountability efforts 
</b></p>
<p>11. In March 2010, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) reported that since November 2008, complaints of extrajudicial 
executions attributed to security forces, particularly the Army, had drastically decreased, 
primarily as a result of the implementation and monitoring of the measures adopted in 
October and November 2008 by the President and the Ministry of Defence (A/HRC/13/72, 
para. 36).  
</p>
<p>12. In July 2010, the Human Rights Committee expressed deep concern at the 
widespread pattern of extrajudicial executions of civilians, subsequently described by the 
security forces as combat casualties. The Committee further expressed its concern at the 
numerous complaints that directives of the Ministry of Defence which granted incentives 
and payment of rewards without internal oversight or supervision had contributed to 
executions of civilians. The Committee also noted with concern that the military justice 
system continued to assume jurisdiction in cases of extrajudicial executions in which the 
alleged perpetrators were members of the security forces. The Committee underlined the 
responsibility of the Superior Judicial Council in resolving conflicts of jurisdiction, and 
emphasized the importance of ensuring that such crimes remain clearly and effectively 
outside the jurisdiction of military courts (CCPR/C/COL/CO/6, para. 14). 
</p>
<p>13. In March 2011, OHCHR reported that the drastic reduction in the number of persons 
presented as killed in combat while in the custody of the Army (falsos positivos) had been 
consolidated. It furthermore noted that the National Human Rights Unit of the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office was investigating 1,488 cases with 2,547 victims, and that more than 400 
additional cases were being investigated through its sectional units. More than 448 active 
cases still remained in the military justice system and an unknown number of cases may 
have been closed without appropriate judicial action having been taken (A/HRC/16/22, 
paras. 25 and 26). 
</p>
<p>14. By August 2011, the National Human Rights Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office 
had been assigned a cumulative total of 1,622 cases of alleged homicides attributed to State 
agents, involving 3,963 members of the security forces. A total of 148 convictions had been 
handed down. Especially noteworthy was the June 2011 ruling against a retired colonel, 
who accepted his responsibility in 57 extrajudicial executions committed between 2007 and 
2008 when he was commander of the Sucre Task Force. By early 2012, he remained the 
highest ranking military official convicted in the context of the falsos positivos 
(A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, para. 33). 
</p>
<p>15. Based on the available data on cases and victims, OHCHR estimated in 2011 that 
more than 3,000 persons may have been victims of extrajudicial executions, primarily 
attributed to the Army. The majority of these killings were carried out between 2004 and 
</p><p>2008. OHCHR reiterated that it was imperative that the military justice system immediately 
transfer all cases of possible human rights violations to the ordinary justice system, and that 
cases that were closed by the military justice system without proper investigation be 
revisited. Moreover, OHCHR observed that the transfer and dismissal of some military 
judges may have been related to their collaboration with the ordinary justice system 
(A/HRC/16/22, paras. 26, 27 and 28). 
</p>
<p>16. In March 2012, OHCHR reported that extrajudicial executions had not been totally 
eradicated, and that it had observed cases having elements that may indicate the occurrence 
of extrajudicial executions during 2011 in the departments of Arauca, Bogot&#225;, Cauca and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Cesar. OHCHR noted that those cases should alert the authorities about the need to 
redouble their efforts to prevent this serious human rights violation, with an emphasis on 
effectively implementing the measures introduced in 2008 for that purpose. OHCHR 
observed that some Army officers and other senior public officials continued to deny the 
occurrence of extrajudicial executions and to discredit the judicial system when convictions 
were handed down (A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, paras. 30 and 32). 
</p>
<p>17. The current Special Rapporteur, following the review of the information made 
available in the preparation of the present follow-up report, notes reports indicating the 
continued occurrence of extrajudicial executions by the Armed Forces and police and the 
persistent high rate of impunity for such human rights violations due to the lack of progress 
in criminal investigations. While a significant number of cases of extrajudicial executions 
have been transferred to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the Special Rapporteur is concerned 
at the absence of information from the State regarding the number of convictions for 
extrajudicial executions by members of the Armed Forces and the sanctions applied in such 
cases.  
</p>
<p>18. In relation to the disappearances and extrajudicial executions of young men in 
Soacha in 2008 (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2, paras. 14 and 17), the Special Rapporteur received 
information indicating serious threats against the families of the victims (A/HRC/16/22, 
annex, para. 5). He also was informed that out of the 17 criminal investigations initiated in 
2008, only one has resulted in convictions (eight members of the military were convicted in 
June 2011).2 
</p>
<p>19. One specific case indicating the continuing incidence of extrajudicial executions by 
the Armed Forces took place in Arauca in October 2010. The victim, a girl who had 
previously been raped by a member of the military, was killed together with her two 
brothers. The bodies showed signs of torture. The rape had been reported to the authorities, 
yet the relevant military battalion acted negligently in response. Internal control 
mechanisms failed to fulfil their duties. The investigation of the extrajudicial execution has 
been subject to delays, principally by the military body responsible for defending the 
accused (Defensor&#237;a Militar, DEMIL). As of February 2012, no conviction had been made 
in the case. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about various reports indicating that military 
judges who have sought to transfer investigations to the ordinary justice system have been 
subject to reprisals and pressure, and that members of the security forces accused of 
participating in extrajudicial executions are prevented from confessing their involvement in 
such crimes. The Special Rapporteur concurs with OHCHR that it is essential that both 
civilian and military authorities at the highest level unequivocally support members of the 
security forces who collaborate with judicial processes (A/HRC/16/22, para. 30).  
</p>
<p>21. The response by the State to the Special Rapporteur on progress in the 
implementation of the recommendations, dated 13 January 2012, indicated that 486 
homicide cases committed by State agents remained within the military justice system. The 
response failed to provide clear information on how many such cases have been archived 
within the military justice system, and no detailed information was provided on how many 
of the 486 cases are in the process of being transferred by the military justice system to the 
ordinary justice system. 
</p>
<p>22. The Government response referred to a tripartite agreement established in June 2011 
by the Ministry of Defence, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and the Procurator General 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Submission to the Special Rapporteur by the Colombian Commission of Jurists, 16 February 2012, 
</p>
<p>p. 20. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>(<i>Procuradur&#237;a General de la Naci&#243;n</i>) in order to facilitate the transfer of alleged homicide 
cases by State agents from the military justice system to the ordinary justice system. The 
Special Rapporteur, while noting the practical measure of the tripartite agreement, 
underlines that, in accordance with the Constitution of Colombia, the responsibility of 
defining the competent jurisdiction lies with the Superior Judicial Council. 
</p>
<p>23. It is imperative to maintain a clear distinction in relation to the jurisdiction 
competent to assume and investigate killings of civilians that are alleged to have been 
committed by State agents. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his position that the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office should have the primary responsibility for prosecution of military 
personnel accused of human rights violations. The Constitution provides in article 221 that 
only &#8213;crimes committed by members of the National Security Forces on active service, and 
related to the same service&#8214; may be assumed by the military justice system.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that the Constitutional Court and the Superior 
Judicial Council have affirmed that military courts do not have jurisdiction when Force 
members engage in conduct contrary to the constitutional functions of the Forces, such as 
unlawful killings, and that when there is doubt, civilian jurisdiction should apply 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.2, para. 38). Furthermore, the importance of conducting impartial 
investigations of serious human rights violations, such as extrajudicial executions, in the 
ordinary justice system and not in the military justice system have repeatedly been 
underlined by the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture.3  
</p>
<p>25. In this context, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the draft legislative 
amendment to article 221 of the Constitution, which was introduced in Congress in 2011. 
The amendment is aimed at extending the jurisdiction of the military justice for acts by the 
armed forces on the basis that &#8213;in all cases, it is presumed that service in operations is 
related to military procedures&#8214;. The draft legislation specifically mentioned that in such 
situations, penal action will be undertaken by the military and police justice system.4 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur considers that given the persistence of well-documented 
human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions by the Armed Forces in 
Colombia, and in view of the continued tendency of the military justice system to seek to 
assume investigations for human rights violations committed by members of the Armed 
Forces, the proposed amendment to article 221 of the Constitution is of great concern, as it 
would undermine the State obligation to undertake prompt investigations through an 
independent judiciary. The Special Rapporteur regrets that in early 2012, further proposals 
for amending article 221 were submitted to Congress, again seeking to expand the 
jurisdiction of the military justice system and undermine the authority of the Superior 
Judicial Council to resolve conflicts between the ordinary and military jurisdictions.5

</b></p>
<p>27. Among the recommendations issued by the Special Rapporteur in 2009, it was noted 
that the Superior Judicial Council should adhere to time limits for the resolution of 
jurisdictional conflicts between the military and civilian justice systems, and that lists of 
pending cases, indicating the time period they have been pending, should be made public 
regularly. The Special Rapporteur regrets that specific time limits for the resolution of 
jurisdiction conflicts have not been established and that information in relation to cases 
pending before the Superior Judicial Council is not made public in a regular manner on a 
systematic basis. 
</p>
<p>28. In relation to the suspension during the periods of investigation and prosecution of 
members of the military and the police suspected of involvement in killings, the Special 
Rapporteur notes the absence of specific information in the response provided by the State 
in January 2012. The Procurator General has the authority to assume disciplinary 
investigations into the conduct of civil servants, including members of the military, police 
and intelligence services. The Special Rapporteur regrets that neither the Procurator 
General nor the Ministry of Defence have made information available on the number and 
rank of members of the military and police who are or have been subject to disciplinary 
investigations or suspension. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that in 
2011, members of the military who had been convicted of extrajudicial executions had not 
been formally separated from their functions, were detained in conditions of considerable 
comfort in the military facility of Tolemaida and were allowed unregulated freedom of 
movement outside the facility.6 
</p>
<p>29. In relation to the use of incentives, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the 
information provided in the response by the State that payments of reward to the Armed 
Forces were prohibited in 2008 and that the Office of the Comptroller General (<i>Contralor&#237;a 
General de la Rep&#250;blica</i>) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of rewards paid 
by public funds to civilians who have provided information. The Special Rapporteur 
however would have appreciated more detailed information on how the Office of the 
Comptroller General monitors the use of rewards and what findings have been made in 
relation to the rewards issued in accordance with Law No. 1097 of 2006.7 
</p>
<p>30. The previous Special Rapporteur noted in the mission report that the 15 specific 
measures contained in the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s Directive No. 208 to implement 
</p>
<p>international human rights and humanitarian law standards should be put into practice 
effectively. In order to evaluate the implementation of the 15 measures, the Ministry of 
Defence initiated a monitoring project with technical cooperation from OHCHR in 2010.8 
The progress reports of this technical cooperation have not been shared with the public. The 
Special Rapporteur notes however the information provided by the State in January 2012 
indicating that the measures taken to date include the development of a legal manual for 
military operations and training on the rules of engagement and on human rights and 
humanitarian law.9

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>31. An additional, and partly overlapping, 15 measures to combat impunity were 
announced by the Ministry of Defence in June 2011.10 It is unclear to what extent they have 
been implemented and what real impact they have had in practice.  
</p>
<p>32. As documented by OHCHR, cases have continued to arise which illustrate the need 
for the Ministry of Defence to enforce a firm policy that respects the limits of the 
application of military jurisdiction (A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, para. 35). In August 2011, a 17-
year-old died after being shot in the back by a police agent in Bogot&#225;. The investigation 
was voluntarily transferred by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to military justice, before 
being reverted back to the ordinary justice system by the Superior Judicial Council in 
November 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Conduct of forensic inspections and preliminary investigations 
</b></p>
<p>33. In 2009, the Special Rapporteur noted the importance of the Technical Investigation 
Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office (Cuerpo T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n, CTI), as external 
investigators reduce opportunities for the military to cover up unlawful killings and 
promote transparency. When a military unit reports a killing in combat, the initial 
inspection of the scene should be undertaken by the CTI; within 36 hours, CTI officials 
must report to the relevant prosecutor on their investigation. 
</p>
<p>34. In September 2010, OHCHR issued a report on the La Macarena Cemetery, Meta.11 
The report explored allegations which were made public in 2009 regarding a mass grave 
site with hundreds of unidentified bodies. The department of Meta has the second highest 
rate of reported extrajudicial executions in Colombia, according to 2010 statistics of the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office. The cemetery is located next to a military base of the Joint Task 
Force Omega and it was alleged that many of the unidentified bodies were of civilians who 
had been killed in combat by the military and buried clandestinely since 2002.  
</p>
<p>35. In the report, OHCHR noted that it was unclear how many of the unidentified 
cadavers were of persons who had been killed in combat. This was reportedly due to a lack 
of military and judicial control, and procedural lapses by the authorities, including flawed 
forensic investigations and omissions in the official registering of the deaths. A principal 
concern raised was that, routinely, corpses had been examined only after having been 
moved by the military, and without an examination of the scene where they were reported 
as having died. OHCHR reiterated that it was particularly important that the examination of 
corpses be performed by personnel from CTI at the site where the deaths occurred.  
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR concluded that the existence of a large number of unidentified bodies 
buried in other cemeteries around the country posed significant challenges for the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office with regard to undertaking proper investigations, in view of resource 
restrictions. In the preparation of the present follow-up report, the Special Rapporteur 
received information indicating that the scarcity of adequate human and technical resources 
for the CTI continues to restrict the exercise of its work. He calls on the State to publicly 
report on the results of exhumations and investigations undertaken in response to the 
OHCHR report on the La Macarena Cemetery.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports indicating that agents previously 
assigned to the former intelligence agency&#8212;the Department of National Security 
(Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad, DAS), which was dismantled in 2011 due to 
its involvement in human rights violations&#8212;have been reassigned to the CTI without any 
vetting process. The Special Rapporteur furthermore regrets the lack of criminal 
investigations into the responsibility of former DAS agents for human rights violations, and 
that files containing related evidence remain classified. 
</p>
<p>38. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that, in February 2012, the 
Ministry of Defence announced the creation of a System for Assistance with Criminal 
Investigations for the Armed Forces.12 According to this initiative, staff of the National 
Police&#8217;s Directorate for Criminal Investigation (Direcci&#243;n de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal, 
DIJIN), which administratively is under the Ministry of Defence, would undertake the 
initial investigations of deaths in combat. The staff of the DIJIN reside within military 
installations.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the requirement that forensic examinations be 
undertaken in an independent manner, and observes that the DIJIN may not comply with 
this criterion.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Killings by guerrillas  
</b></p>
<p>40. In the country visit report, the Special Rapporteur observed that both FARC-EP and 
ELN were responsible for unlawful killings and often victimized the very population on 
whose behalf they claimed to fight. It was noted that FARC-EP and ELN had killed or 
threatened, inter alia, farmers and labourers, communal leaders and human rights defenders, 
municipal and State government officials, demobilized former FARC-EP or ELN members 
and soldiers on leave. Indigenous communities and Afro-Colombians were especially 
vulnerable to attacks and killings. Both FARC-EP and ELN recruited child soldiers and 
used weapons prohibited under international humanitarian law to cause indiscriminate 
killings.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur urged the Government to ensure that anti-guerrilla strategies 
not focus solely on military solutions, but also include the consideration of humanitarian 
accords and negotiation, as well as the provision of resources to protect civilians. It was 
recommended that the United Nations and humanitarian actors be able to have contact with 
guerrillas in order to further civilian protection activities. 
</p>
<p>42. During the preparation of the present follow-up report, the Special Rapporteur 
received information indicating the continued systematic violation of international 
humanitarian law by both the FARC-EP and the ELN.13 The Special Rapporteur is gravely 
concerned at information indicating the continued occurrence of kidnappings, killings and 
massacres of the civilian population and of forced mass displacement. The continued 
recruitment and use of children in hostilities by guerrillas is of significant concern. Among 
the violations reported in 2012 was the massive displacement in January by the FARC-EP 
of nearly 5,000 people in Anor&#237; in the department of Antioquia.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is particularly disturbed by information indicating the death 
on 25 March 2010 of a 12-year-old boy who was used by the FARC-EP as a &#8213;child bomb&#8214; 
during an attack on a police station in El Charco in the department of Nari&#241;o. Other 
reported cases indicate that guerrillas have severely restricted freedom of movement and 
have shown disregard for medical missions. The Special Rapporteur also notes the 
continued use of land mines, as well as reports indicating an increasing number of injuries 
to civilians in rural areas, notably affecting women, children, indigenous people and Afro-
Colombians. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur laments that the guerrillas continue to display disregard for 
humanitarian law and persist in their attacks against the civilian population and in the 
killing of hostages. Among the regrettable incidents was the killing by the FARC-EP in 
November 2011 of four members of the security forces who had been held hostage for more 
than a decade. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur regrets that there has been no progress 
in humanitarian negotiations, and notes the continued restrictions impeding the United 
Nations from establishing contact with guerrillas to undertake civilian protection activities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Killings by former paramilitaries and illegal armed groups  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Demobilization and implementation of the Justice and Peace Law  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government passed the Justice and Peace Law (Law No. 975) in 2005 in 
response to the mass demobilization of paramilitaries. The Law provided legal benefits for 
persons demobilized from armed groups while it asserted the rights of the victims&#8217; to truth, 
justice and reparation. In the mission report the Special Rapporteur had expressed serious 
concern regarding the process, including at the alarming levels of impunity for the former 
paramilitaries, who had confessed to over 20,000 homicides; the fact that the majority had 
been demobilized without investigations and not a single paramilitary had been convicted 
of human rights violations; the leniency of the prescribed custodial sentences; the fact that 
many of the senior paramilitary leaders had been extradited to the United States for drug 
crime prosecutions in 2008; and the fact that the process had been encumbered by the lack 
of resources, planning and clarity and by procedural problems. Additionally, the Special 
Rapporteur observed that victims had been denied the right to restitution and reparation.  
</p>
<p>46. In the preparation of the present follow-up report the Special Rapporteur received 
information indicating continued impunity for the serious violations committed by 
members of paramilitary organizations. In 2010, the Human Rights Committee expressed 
serious concerns over the existing de facto impunity for serious human rights violations 
(CCPR/C/COL/CO/6, para. 9). Only six convictions of paramilitaries had been issued by 
February 2012 on the basis of Law No. 975. According to the information provided by the 
State, only 540 paramilitaries are currently being investigated in accordance with the Law.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of information in relation to the legal 
situation of the majority of the paramilitaries, including the over 3,500 paramilitaries who 
originally demobilized on the basis of Law No. 975. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
recognition by the State of both the failings of Law No. 975 and the need to seek its urgent 
reform. He also notes the initiative in 2011 by the Attorney General to propose amendments 
to Law No. 975.14 The Special Rapporteur further notes that the OHCHR-Colombia office 
has provided detailed technical advice on the reform of Law No. 975, including on 
measures to improve the prioritization of cases to be investigated on the basis of the gravity 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>of the violations. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the State ensure that the 
technical advice of OHCHR-Colombia is duly considered and that reform of Law No. 975 
is promptly undertaken.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur observes the variety of legal measures and proposals made 
to address the legal situation of the majority of demobilized paramilitaries who are not 
considered in the framework of Law No. 975. In the original mission report, the Special 
Rapporteur expressed concern over legislation incorporating the &#8213;principle of opportunity&#8214;, 
which would allow for the renouncing of criminal investigations of demobilized 
paramilitaries (A/HRC/14/24/Add.2, para. 56). The decision of the Constitution Court in 
November 2010 (C-936/10) that declared the application of the &#8213;principle of opportunity&#8214; 
unconstitutional is therefore considered positive.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes that subsequent attempts to address the legal situation 
of the majority of the paramilitaries led to the adoption of Law No. 1424 in December 
</p><p>2010. The Law is aimed at encouraging the confession of violations and awarding legal 
benefits through a non-judicial mechanism. As at February 2012, the Law had not yet been 
applied in practice. However, it is of concern that the confessions expected to take place in 
the framework of Law No. 1424 will automatically suspend any deprivation of liberty and 
cannot be relied upon in criminal investigations. The Special Rapporteur encourages efforts 
to establish the truth and to locate the whereabouts of disappeared victims. He notes 
however that consultations with concerned victims have been inadequate and that the lack 
of accountability foreseen in Law No. 1424 raises serious concerns.  
</p>
<p>50. In relation to the right of victims to reparation, the Special Rapporteur notes that 
several important measures have been taken. The adoption of the Victims&#8217; and Land 
Restitution Law (Law No. 1448) in June 2011 marked an important recognition of victims&#8217; 
rights, and it is particularly noteworthy that the President himself supported this initiative. 
While Law No. 1448 provides a valuable tool for promoting reconciliation, in practice it 
has faced challenges, such as limited implementation to date, a lack of victim participation 
in the design of its application and, most importantly, insufficient protection measures for 
victims, several of whom have been attacked and killed when seeking to claim their rights. 
The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to give sufficient priority and provide impetus 
to the application of Law No. 1448 and seek close collaboration with victims and civil 
society in its practical implementation.  
</p>
<p>51. In the mission report, the Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government 
consider establishing an independent truth commission to systematically investigate the 
history of, and responsibility for, killings and other crimes committed during the armed 
conflict in Colombia by paramilitaries, guerrillas and State forces. The current Special 
Rapporteur notes that several pieces of legislation containing references to the right to truth 
have been adopted, and that several mechanisms have been established, such as the 
National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation (Comisi&#243;n Nacional de 
Reparaci&#243;n y Reconciliaci&#243;n), and the Centre for Historical Memory (Centro de Memoria 
Hist&#243;rica).15 However, he notes that, to date, no truth commission has been established to 
seek an independent and comprehensive historical record of violations by various actors in 
the context of the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>  
 15  Response by the State to the Special Rapporteur, 13 January 2012. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by new illegal armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>52. In the mission report, the Special Rapporteur noted the rise in killings by new illegal 
armed groups (IAGs). The groups were largely composed of paramilitaries&#8212;especially 
mid-level members&#8212;who did not demobilize, and formerly demobilized paramilitaries and 
organized criminals involved in the drug trade and other illegal activities. The Special 
Rapporteur noted that the relationship and coordination between IAGs and other armed 
groups varied across the country; most new IAGs were engaged in drug trafficking, 
extortion, kidnapping and other criminal behaviour. The Special Rapporteur observed that 
IAG killings and violence towards civilians followed certain patterns, including targeting 
human rights defenders, leaders and members of Afro-Colombian communities and of 
victims&#8217; groups, and local government officials; and killing or threatening civilians as a 
means of terrorizing local populations in order to exert control, especially in areas linked to 
drug production or drug transport.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur observed that investigations by local offices of the Attorney 
General into crimes committed by IAGs had encountered a number of challenges, 
including: interference in the investigative process by the IAGs, who, according to 
interlocutors, were economically powerful and able to pervert the course of justice; 
institutional barriers and weaknesses within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office; and a lack of 
resources, which affects ability of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to address complex 
prosecutions that can target the leadership, economic structure and sources of support of 
IAGs. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Attorney General create a national 
unit to address complex prosecutions such as those required to shut down the new IAGs.  
</p>
<p>54. Reports referring to the period since the mission of the Special Rapporteur indicate 
the continued spread of IAGs across the country and a lack of accountability for their 
action. They also indicate the collusion between such groups and public authorities, notably 
the military and the police. It is of great concern that IAGs continue to commit acts of 
homicide, massacres, sexual violence, forced displacement, involvement and use of 
children in their activities, threats and extortion. Between January and November 2011, 
IAGs were reportedly responsible for 32 massacres (A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, para. 38). Their 
targeting of social leaders and public officials and threats of people involved in land 
restitution process are particularly worrying.16 The Special Rapporteur notes the widespread 
social control exercised by post-demobilization groups in certain regions. An indicative 
example is the two-day strike ordered by the criminal group Los Urabe&#241;os across six 
departments in the north-west of the country in January 2012, the threat of which meant 
that public transport, commerce and public institutions were closed and movement severely 
restricted. The Special Rapporteur notes as positive that a unit against organized crime was 
established within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in 2010,17 and urges that it be reinforced 
as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Especially vulnerable groups  
</b></p>
<p>55. In the mission report, the Special Rapporteur noted that vulnerable groups were 
disproportionately killed and threatened by State forces, paramilitaries and IAGs. The 
targets of killings included human rights defenders, indigenous persons and Afro-
Colombians, trade unionists, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, and persons 
with physical or mental disabilities. The Special Rapporteur observed that human rights

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>defenders were occasionally accused by Government officials of terrorism and undermining 
security policies and that those accusations placed them at risk.  
</p>
<p>56. It was further noted that indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities were 
particularly vulnerable and that, historically, paramilitaries, sometimes in collusion with 
State forces, had appropriated their lands and committed massacres. Furthermore, it was 
observed that guerrilla groups and IAGs fighting for control of land and the drug trade had 
killed or displaced community members. The Special Rapporteur noted that State forces 
often viewed efforts by indigenous communities to protect their rights as a form of 
subversion or collaboration with guerrillas.  
</p>
<p>57. In general terms, the Special Rapporteur notes that the change in Government in 
2010 translated into an improved and more constructive dialogue with human rights 
defenders.18 However, in certain instances, stigmatizing public statements have continued to 
be made by Government officials. In particular, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern 
the public comments made in response to the withdrawal of one person&#8217;s testimony in the 
</p>
<p>case of the Mapirip&#225;n massacre (A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, para. 22). Several senior officials 
suggested that human rights organizations representing victims have fraudulent objectives 
when reporting cases to international and regional human rights mechanisms (see, inter alia, 
ibid., para. 22).  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur notes that the withdrawal of the person&#8217;s testimony does not 
affect the material basis upon which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights emitted its 
sentence on the case in 2005, whereby the State was found to bear responsibility for the 
1997 massacre of 49 civilians whose bodies were dismembered by chainsaws and thrown 
into the nearby river by paramilitaries who had colluded with the Armed Forces. It should 
also be recalled that the witness had been interviewed and defined as a victim by the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call to all public officials 
to immediately cease making statements or engaging in acts of intimidation that place 
human rights defenders at risk. The State should engage with human rights organizations in 
a manner which recognizes and values the legitimacy and importance of their work. 
</p>
<p>59. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur observes that the groups previously identified 
as vulnerable continue to be seriously affected by the armed conflict. The reported recent 
increase in killings of indigenous persons is of particular concern. Between January and 
October 2011, 79 indigenous people had been killed in the context of the armed conflict, 
representing an increase of 54.9 per cent over the same period in 2010 (ibid., para. 98). 
Among the specific cases of killings of indigenous people, on 11 November 2011, two Aw&#225; 
children were murdered by the FARC-EP in Barbacoas in the department of Nari&#241;o, in 
events related to the desertion of another Aw&#225; child from this guerrilla group.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of progress towards improved protection for 
indigenous persons and Afro-Colombians as ordered by the Constitutional Court in Orders 
004 and 005 of 2009, following judgement T-025 of 2004.19 The lack of effective 
protection measures for indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, including several 
who have been awarded precautionary and provisional measures through the Inter-
American Human Rights System, is of particular concern. 
</p>
<p>61. Among the groups whose vulnerability has increased since 2009 are organizations 
and individuals seeking land restitution (A/HRC/19/21/Add.3, para. 43). Several incidents 
of killings and death threats against land claimants have been reported. Some of these cases 
relate to land that was appropriated by paramilitary groups after civilians were forcibly

</p>
<p>displaced during the armed conflict. The continuity between paramilitary groups and 
current groups, and the fact that the social, economic and political structures connected to 
paramilitarism were never dismantled, raise concerns that the post-demobilization groups 
have a vested interest in impeding land restitution.  
</p>
<p>62. Overall, the Special Rapporteur concludes that the persistent lack of accountability 
for violations committed against human rights defenders and vulnerable groups continues to 
place them at grave risk. The State is urged to reinforce its measures to effectively ensure 
their protection and the conduct of prompt and impartial investigations into violations 
against them. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that information about the progress and 
outcome of such investigations should be made publicly available. 
</p>
<p><b> VII.  Institutional capacity and reform  
</b></p>
<p>63. In the mission report, the Special Rapporteur observed that various institutional 
issues must be addressed for the Government to fulfil its obligation to prevent and to 
provide accountability and redress for unlawful killings. He observed the need to eliminate 
institutional barriers to cooperation and information sharing. The following areas of 
concern were raised in the report.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Allocation and effective use of resources  
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur observed the need for additional resources and funding for 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and the need for better internal management to maximize the 
effective use and deployment of attorneys and investigators. He noted that the Attorney 
General should: establish more control mechanisms over prosecutors in the different 
jurisdictions; conduct an audit on the progress of cases; impose time limits for cases to be 
assigned to a prosecutor and investigations to be opened; and ensure that statistics on the 
status of cases are publicly available and updated on a regular basis.  
</p>
<p>65. While noting information by the State indicating increased public budget allocations 
for investigations,20 the Special Rapporteur regrets that no information was provided in 
relation to the specific recommendations made to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Early warning system 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur commended the Early Warning System of the Office of the 
Ombudsman (Sistema de Alertas Tempranas de la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo, SAT), which 
monitors, analyses and reports on risks to civilians and possible violations of international 
law. The Special Rapporteur observed that the Government should: provide the SAT with 
more staff and resources; act upon SAT reports; ensure that the independence of the Inter-
Agency Early Warning Committee (Comit&#233; Interinstitucional de Alertas Tempranas, CIAT) 
and the SAT is maintained; and make SAT reports public.  
</p>
<p>67. According to information received, the State has significantly increased funding for 
the operation of the SAT, which previously was heavily dependent on donor funding. The 
provision of public funding indicates a commitment of the State to support the SAT. While 
this development is very positive, concerns remain with respect to certain operative aspects

</b></p>
<p>of the SAT, such as the significant number of risk reports which are not converted into 
alerts by CIAT, and threats against SAT staff. 
</p>
<p><b> C. </b>Victims&#8217; access to information <b> 
</b></p>
<p>68. In the mission report, the Special Rapporteur observed that it was difficult for 
victims and family members to gain access to information on the status of cases. It was 
recommended that a centralized database system should be established through which each 
institution reports its activity and progress on each individual case.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur welcomes information indicating that a National Registry of 
Disappeared Persons has been established, however, he notes that a central database with 
information on cases and progress on investigations relating to killings by State agents has 
not yet been created. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Colombia has taken certain steps to prevent the occurrence of extrajudicial 
killings, including through the adoption by the Ministry of Defence of 15 specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures. The Special Rapporteur notes as positive the technical cooperation project

<p><b>initiated between the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the United Nations High

</p>
<p>71. <b>Cases of extrajudicial executions continue to be reported and progress in 
criminal and disciplinary investigations remains lacking. The persistent impunity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lack of accountability for officers is a principal concern. The Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>notes that despite information indicating that more than 3,000 persons may have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of extrajudicial executions directly attributable to the Armed Forces, the State 
</b></p>
<p><b>did not provide information on the outcome of related disciplinary and criminal 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations and whether sanctions were applied.</b> 
</p>
<p>72. <b>While a significant number of cases have been transferred from the military 
justice system to the ordinary penal system, the continuous attempts by the military 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice system to claim jurisdiction over cases are of great concern. Furthermore, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur is concerned over information indicating reprisals and pressure 
</b></p>
<p><b>against military judges who have sought to collaborate with the ordinary justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system, and that the military body responsible for defending the accused (Defensor&#237;a 
</b></p>
<p><b>Militar, DEMIL) has obstructed investigations. The Ministry of Defence is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistently assigning responsibility to the Technical Investigation Unit (Cuerpo 
</b></p>
<p><b>T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n, CTI) in forensic investigations where there are deaths 
</b></p>
<p><b>reported in combat. 
</b></p>
<p>73.  <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates his calls for strengthened resources for 
investigations by the </b>Attorney General&#8217;s Off<b>ice and for the undertaking of technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations through the CTI. The State should publicly report on the progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>achieved in the exhumations and investigations related to the Macarena and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>cemeteries, and implement a national policy on exhumations and investigations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>grave sites that might contain victims of extrajudicial killings.</b> 
</p>
<p>74. <b>The continuous impunity for the tens of thousands of former paramilitaries 
remains a serious concern, and the Special Rapporteur notes that there has been very 
</b></p>
<p><b>little progress or political will to establish accountability. Furthermore, the State 
</b></p>
<p><b>should adopt effective measures to combat illegal armed groups established after the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p><b>official demobilization of paramilitary groups, and ensure the protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p><b>from extrajudicial executions and massacres. Specific measures should be adopted to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect persons seeking to claim their land back under the Victims</b>&#8217;<b> and Land 
</b></p>
<p><b>Restitution Law (Law No. 1448). 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The continued disregard of international humanitarian law by guerrilla groups 
remains a deep concern, and efforts must be redoubled to ensure the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilians. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the State to significantly strengthen efforts to 
establish accountability for extrajudicial executions, ensure the effective protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims and witnesses and, through consultations with affected communities, take 
</b></p>
<p><b>preventive protection measures for vulnerable groups. The behaviour aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>discouraging human rights defenders and victims seeking justice is of serious concern. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation* 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killings by security forces 
</b></p>
<p>1. <b>In all cases of alleged killings by security forces, the civilian criminal justice 
system should have jurisdiction. Within two months after publication of this report 
</b></p>
<p><b>[A/HRC/14/24/Add.2], the head of the military justice system should conduct an audit 
</b></p>
<p><b>of all cases of alleged extrajudicial executions still pending before military courts and 
</b></p>
<p><b>should then ensure that such cases are transferred within a short time period. Judges 
</b></p>
<p><b>who fail to effect such transfers should be disciplined. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p>2. <b>The Supreme Judicial Council should adhere to time limits for the resolution of 
jurisdictional conflicts between the military and civilian justice systems. The Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>should publish regularly</b>&#8212;<b>and at least biannually</b>&#8212;<b>the list of such cases before each 
</b></p>
<p><b>judge and the amount of time any such case has been pending before the Council.</b> 
</p>
<p>Insufficient information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the 
implementation of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>3. <b>The Government should prohibit all incentives given to members of the Armed 
Forces for combat killings. It should not permit any rewards for information to 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilians without oversight and should audit discretionary funds for such rewards. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented; however, insufficient 
information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the implementation of 
this recommendation in practice. 
</p>
<p>4. <b>The Government should ensure that Technical Investigation Unit (Cuerpo 
T&#233;cnico de Investigaci&#243;n, CTI) is provided the resources and personnel necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>carry out, and report on, investigations on a timely basis. 
</b></p>
<p>Insufficient information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the 
implementation of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>5. <b>Service members suspected of involvement in killings should be suspended for 
the duration of the investigation and prosecution. 
</b></p>
<p>Insufficient information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the 
implementation of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>The Government should ensure that the specific measures of the Ministry of 
</b>Defence&#8217;s Directive No. 208 to implement international human rights and 
</p>
<p><b>humanitarian law standards are put effectively into practice. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 * As contained in document A/HRC/11/2/Add.6. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>Insufficient information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the 
implementation of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p>7. <b>The Government should prioritize the investigation and prosecution of police 
killings. Civil society groups should place increased emphasis on researching and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reporting such killings. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented; however, insufficient 
information was provided to the Special Rapporteur to assess the implementation of 
this recommendation in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings by guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>8. <b>The FARC, ELN and all illegal armed groups should immediately cease their 
harassment, abuse and murder of Colombians. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>9. <b>The FARC and ELN should immediately cease the use of landmines and the 
recruitment of child soldiers. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>10. <b>The Government should ensure that respect for international humanitarian 
and human rights law are at the forefront of its strategic plans and military 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations. It should be open to dialogue and humanitarian negotiations with 
</b></p>
<p><b>guerrilla groups. The United Nations and humanitarian actors must be able to have 
</b></p>
<p><b>contact with guerrillas in order to further civilian protection activities. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been fully implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings by former paramilitaries and illegal armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>11. <b>The Government should ensure that perpetrators of human rights violations do 
not benefit from any legal measures exempting them from criminal prosecution or 
</b></p>
<p><b>conviction. The judicial authorities must fully investigate alleged human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations and prosecutions must include supposedly demobilized paramilitaries given 
</b></p>
<p><b>de facto amnesties under prior laws. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>12. <b>The Government should reform the Justice and Peace Law (JPL) to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Provide for the expeditious transfer to the ordinary justice system of candidates 
who do not cooperate with or fulfil the criteria of the JPL 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Ensure that the &#8213;principle of opportunity&#8214; is not applied <b>in ways that reinforce 
impunity 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Allow for cases to proceed without the requirement that the <i>Fiscal&#237;a</i> 
investigates and verifies all relevant crimes 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Expedite, in cooperation with other State institutions, the handover to victims 
of all assets (legal and illegal) from those demobilized under the JPL 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Adopt measures to ensure that demobilized combatants are not &#8213;recycled&#8214; into 
<b>the conflict 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>13. <b>The Fiscal General should consider creating a national unit of <i>fiscales 
</i>dedicated to complex prosecutions that would seek to shut down all the major actors 
</b></p>
<p><b>in and sources of support for IAGs. The Government should consider seconding 
</b></p>
<p><b>police, investigators and asset confiscation and management experts to such a unit so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that all investigation and prosecution activities are strategically coordinated. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Truth commission 
</b></p>
<p>14. <b>The Government should consider establishing a truth commission to conduct 
an independent and systematic investigation of the history of and responsibility for 
</b></p>
<p>killings and other abuses committed during the country&#8217;s armed conflict by the 
</p>
<p><b>paramilitaries, State forces and guerrillas. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Killings of and threats against vulnerable groups and State officials 
</b></p>
<p>15. <b>The Government should ensure that full and impartial criminal investigations 
into killings and death threats against human rights defenders, including trade 
</b></p>
<p><b>unionists and minority group members, are conducted as a priority. Within three 
</b></p>
<p><b>months of the publication of this report, the Government should report on the steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>being taken and resources devoted to such investigations and prosecutions. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>The Government should immediately issue instructions to Government officials 
at all levels to cease making statements or engaging in acts of intimidation of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights defenders, members of the judiciary, the Fiscal&#237;a and the Procuradur&#237;a, and 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>personeros</i>. The text of these instructions should be made public. They should 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically prohibit Government officials and State forces from calling into question 
</b></p>
<p><b>the legitimacy of the work done by each of the foregoing groups or equating the work 
</b></p>
<p><b>of any group or member with the strategy or tactics of guerrillas or other illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>The Government should ensure that independent investigations take place to 
determine responsibility and, if appropriate, prosecution for the statements or acts of 
</b></p>
<p><b>intimidation and harassment. Within three months of the publication of this report, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government should report publicly on the steps it is taking to prevent and, if 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate, prosecute any statements or acts of intimidation and harassment.   
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>18. <b>The Government should prioritize the protection of indigenous and Afro-
Colombian communities, especially in conflict zones, through development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of detailed protection plans in consultation with the affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b> F. Strengthening institutional capacity 
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>The Government should provide additional resources and personnel to the 
Fiscal&#237;a and the Procuradur&#237;a for the investigation and prosecution of all cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged unlawful killings.   
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>20. <b>Both the Government and donor countries should make it a priority to provide 
the Fiscal&#237;a with technical assistance for more effective internal management and 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocation of resources. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has not been adequately implemented. 
</p>
<p>21. <b>The Government should provide additional staff and resources to the Early 
Warning System (Sistema de Alertas Tempranas, SAT). It should implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures ensuring that SAT reports are acted upon, and that SAT analysis and Inter-
</b></p>
<p><b>Agency Early Warning Committee (Comit&#233; Interinstitucional de Alertas Tempranas, 
</b></p>
<p><b>CIAT) decision-making processes are not influenced by political pressures. SAT 
</b></p>
<p><b>reports should be made public, subject to security requirements. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partly implemented. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>The Government should establish a centralized database system through which 
each State institution responsible for investigation and participating in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecution of killings, disappearances and other human rights abuses reports its 
</b></p>
<p><b>activity and progress on each individual case. Information from this system should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>available through institutional representatives at the regional, municipal and 
</b></p>
<p><b>community level, so that families would not need to travel long distances to obtain it. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Design of the database system should account for security concerns and the need to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect genuinely confidential information. 
</b></p>
<p> This recommendation has been partly implemented.
