NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited; dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”)
of U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings,” and together with its subsidiaries “we,” “us” or the
“Company”) included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X issued by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). They do not contain certain information
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015;
therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in
conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Financial Statements have been included.
Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. We have reclassified certain immaterial
amounts in the prior years’ operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash
flows to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on
previously reported net cash flows from operations.
In order to make this report easier to read, we refer throughout to (i) our Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets as our “Balance Sheets,” (ii) our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Operations as our “Income Statements,” and (iii) our Condensed Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows as our “Cash Flows.”
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016; the Income Statements and Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015; the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity and Cash
Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016; and other information disclosed in the related
notes are unaudited. The Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements as included in our 2015 Annual Report.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of the Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant areas requiring the use
of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future
cash flow estimates utilized in impairment calculations and units-of-production amortization
calculations; environmental, reclamation and closure obligations; estimates of recoverable
minerals; estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts; estimates of fair value for certain
reporting units and asset impairments (including impairments of goodwill and other long-lived
assets); write-downs of inventory to net realizable value; equity-based compensation expense;
post-employment, post-retirement and other employee benefit liabilities; valuation allowances for
deferred tax assets; reserves for contingencies and litigation; and the fair value and accounting
treatment of financial instruments including derivative instruments. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an Accounting
Standards Update, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which
simplifies the income tax consequences, accounting for forfeitures and classification on the
Statements of Cash Flows. This Update is effective for public entities for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years; early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the new
guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update, Leases, which
supersedes the existing lease guidance and requires all leases with a term greater than 12
months to be recognized on the balance sheet as assets and obligations.  This Update is
effective for public entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; early application is
permitted. This standard mandates
7
a modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the effect that the new
guidance will have on our financial statements and related disclosures.
On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, Simplifying the Measurement
of Inventory. The new standard requires an entity to measure most inventory at the lower of cost
and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must
measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The new standard will not apply to inventories
that are measured using either the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method.
This Update is effective for public entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years

prospectively and have measured our inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value on
our Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016.
NOTE B—CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND ACCUMULATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Common Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes up to 500,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value of $0.01. Subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock,
all of the voting power of the stockholders of Holdings shall be vested in the holders of the
common stock.
In March 2016, we completed a public offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for total
cash proceeds of approximately $186.2 million net of underwriting discounts and offering costs.
There were 63,581,010 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at June 30, 2016. As of
June 30, 2015, there were 53,383,613 shares issued and outstanding.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash
dividends as follows:
Dividends per Common Share Declaration Date  Record Date
$
$
All dividends were paid as scheduled.
Any determination to pay dividends and other distributions in cash, stock, or property by Holdings
in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on then-
existing conditions, including our business conditions, our financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital requirements, contractual restrictions including restrictive covenants
contained in our debt agreements, and other factors. Additionally, because we are a holding
company, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by restrictions on the
ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including restrictions under
the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness.
Preferred Stock
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares, in the aggregate, of preferred stock, par value of $0.01 in one or more
series, to fix the powers, preferences and other rights of such series, and any qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, including the dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights,
redemption rights and liquidation preference, and to fix the number of shares to be included in
any such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders.
There were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding at either June 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015. At present, we have no plans to issue any preferred stock.
Employee Stock Awards
We grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units to our
employees and directors under the Amended and Restated U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. 2011
Incentive Compensation Plan. The weighted-average stock awards (in thousands) that are
antidilutive and are therefore excluded from the calculation of our diluted earnings per common
share are:

Share Repurchase Program
We are authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase shares of our outstanding common
stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of June 30,
2016, we are authorized to repurchase up to $50 million of our common stock through
December 11, 2016. Stock repurchases, if any, will be funded using our available liquidity. The
timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors, including the market
conditions as well as corporate and regulatory considerations. Under our share repurchase
program, as of June 30, 2016, we have repurchased 706,093 shares of our common stock at an
average price of $23.83 and are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $33.2 million of our
common stock.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of fair value adjustments associated
with cash flow hedges and accumulated adjustments for net experience losses and prior service
cost related to employee benefit plans. The following table presents the changes in accumulated
other comprehensive income (in thousands) by component during the six months ended June 30,
2016:

Our senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the
equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries. The facility contains covenants that, among other
things, govern our ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness and liens, to make acquisitions
or investments, to pay dividends and to sell assets. The facility also requires us to maintain a
consolidated total net leverage ratio of no more than 3.75:1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter whenever usage of the Revolver (other than certain undrawn letters of credit) exceeds
25% of the Revolver commitment. As of June 30, 2016, we are in compliance with all covenants
in accordance with our senior secured credit facility.
NOTE G—ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Mine reclamation costs, or future remediation costs for inactive mines, are accrued based on
management’s best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at a
site. Such cost estimates include, where applicable, ongoing care, maintenance and monitoring
costs. Changes in estimates at inactive mines are reflected in earnings in the period an estimate
is revised.
As of June 30, 2016, we had a liability of $12.7 million in other long-term obligations related to
our asset retirement obligation. Changes in the asset retirement obligation (in thousands) during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 are as follows:

NOTE H - FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer
a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is
estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of
input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3—Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Cash Equivalents
Due to the short-term maturity, we believe our cash equivalent instruments at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 approximate their reported carrying values.
11
Short-Term Investments
In general, the fair value of our short-term investments is based on quoted prices for similar
assets in active markets, or for identical assets or similar assets in markets in which there were
fewer transactions (Level 2). Money market mutual funds are based on calculated net asset value
and are reported in Level 1. Variable rate demand obligations underwritten and remarketed by a
financial institution are priced at par value.
Long-Term Debt, Including Current Maturities
We believe that the fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, approximate
their carrying values based on their effective interest rates compared to current market rates.
Derivative Instruments
The estimated fair value of our derivative assets (interest rate caps) are recorded at each
reporting period and are based upon widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted
cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative contract. This analysis reflects
the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable
market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. We also incorporate
credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our nonperformance risk as well as that
of the respective counterparty in the fair value measurements.
Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall
within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our
derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the
likelihood of default of ourselves and our counterparties. However, as of June 30, 2016, we have
assessed that the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our
derivative positions is not significant. As a result, we have determined that our derivative
valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the following table presents the fair value as of
June 30, 2016 of those assets that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis:

Operating Leases
We are obligated under certain operating leases for railroad cars, office space, mining property,
mining/processing equipment and transportation and other equipment. Certain operating lease
agreements include options to purchase the equipment for fair market value at the end of the
original lease term. In general, the above leases include renewal options and provide that we
pay for all utilities, insurance, taxes and maintenance. Expense related to operating leases and
rental agreements totaled approximately $12.2 million and $11.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $25.0 million and $21.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, we have no
obligations under a capital lease.
$ 389,048

Minimum Purchase Commitments
We enter into service agreements with our transload service providers and transportation service
providers. Some of these agreements require us to purchase a minimum amount of services over
a specific period of time. Any inability to meet these minimum contract requirements requires us
to pay a shortfall fee, which is based on the difference between the minimum amount contracted
for and the actual amount purchased.
Other Commitments and Contingencies
Our operating subsidiary, U.S. Silica Company (“U.S. Silica”), has been named as a defendant in
various product liability claims alleging silica exposure causing silicosis. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, no new claims were brought against U.S. Silica. As of June 30, 2016,
there were 74 active silica-related products liability claims pending in which U.S. Silica is a
defendant. Although the outcomes of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, in the
opinion of management, it is not reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters
will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations that exceeds
the accrual amounts.
We have recorded estimated liabilities for these claims in other long-term obligations as well as
estimated recoveries under the indemnity agreement and an estimate of future recoveries under
insurance in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of both June 30, 2016, and
December 31, 2015 other non-current assets included $0.3 million for insurance for third-party
products liability claims and other long-term obligations included $1.5 million in third-party
products claims liability.
Additionally, during the three months ended March 31, 2015, we received an unfavorable ruling
in an arbitration proceeding as a result of exiting a toll manufacturing contract. The amount of the
ruling was approximately $7.6 million. The matter was settled and the settlement amount of $6.5
million was paid on June 9, 2015, which was included in selling, general and administrative
expense in our Income Statement for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
NOTE J - INCOME TAXES
For interim period reporting, we record income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate
based upon projected annual income, forecasted permanent tax differences, discrete items and
statutory rates in states in which we operate. At the end of each interim period, we update the
estimated annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated tax rate changes based on new
information, we make a cumulative adjustment in the period. We record the tax effect of an
unusual or infrequently occurring item in the interim period in which it occurs as a discrete item of
tax. The effective tax rate was 44% and (13)% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Historically, our actual effective tax rates have differed from the statutory effective rate primarily
due to the benefit received from statutory percentage depletion allowances. The deduction for
statutory percentage depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in
income before income taxes.
NOTE K - PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS
We maintain a single-employer noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain
employees. Net pension benefit cost (in thousands) recognized for the three and six months

The weighted average discount rate used to determine the projected pension and post-retirement
obligations was updated during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and was decreased from
4.5% at December 31, 2015 to 3.8% at June 30, 2016. We made no contributions to the qualified
pension plan for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. We contributed $1.0 million to
the qualified pension plan for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Total expected
employer funding contributions during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 are $0 for the
pension plan and $1.9 million for the post-retirement medical and life plan.
NOTE L - OBLIGATIONS UNDER GUARANTEES
We have indemnified Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (“Travelers”) against
any loss Travelers may incur in the event that holders of surety bonds, issued on behalf of us by
Travelers, execute the bonds. As of June 30, 2016, Travelers had $10.2 million in bonds
outstanding for us. The majority of these bonds, $9.9 million, relate to reclamation requirements
issued by various governmental authorities. Reclamation bonds remain outstanding until the
mining area is reclaimed and the authority issues a formal release. The remaining bonds relate to
such indefinite purposes as licenses, permits, and tax collection.
NOTE M - SEGMENT REPORTING
Our business is organized into two reportable segments, Oil & Gas Proppants and Industrial &
Specialty Products, based on end markets. The reportable segments are consistent with how
management views the markets that we serve and the financial information reviewed by the chief
operating decision maker. We manage our Oil & Gas Proppants and Industrial & Specialty
Products businesses as components of an enterprise for which separate information is available
and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and assess performance.
In the Oil & Gas Proppants segment, we serve the oil and gas recovery market by providing
fracturing sand, or “frac sand,” which is pumped down oil and natural gas wells to prop open rock
fissures and increase the flow rate of oil and natural gas from the wells.
The Industrial & Specialty Products segment consists of over 260 products and materials used in
a variety of industries, including container glass, fiberglass, specialty glass, flat glass, building
products, fillers and extenders, foundry products, chemicals, recreation products and filtration
products.
An operating segment’s performance is primarily evaluated based on segment contribution
margin, which excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the
segment. These corporate costs are separately stated below and include costs that are related to
functional areas such as operations management, corporate purchasing, accounting, treasury,
information technology, legal and human resources. We believe that segment contribution
margin, as defined above, is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of
our segments. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, not a substitute for, or
superior to, net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. The other accounting policies of each of the two
reporting segments are the same as those in Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies of our Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should
be read together with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying
notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as the Consolidated
Financial Statements, the accompanying notes and the related Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), contained in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Annual Report").
Overview
We are one of the largest domestic producers of commercial silica, a specialized mineral that is a
critical input into a variety of attractive end markets. During our 116-year history, we have
developed core competencies in mining, processing, logistics and materials science that enable
us to produce and cost-effectively deliver over 260 products to customers across these markets.
As of June 30, 2016, we operate 17 production facilities across the United States and own one of
the largest frac sand processing plants in the United States. Including the purchase of reserves
adjacent to our Ottawa, Illinois, facility in May 2016, we now control 436 million tons of reserves
of commercial silica, 240 million tons of which can be processed to meet American Petroleum
Institute (API) frac sand size specifications. Our operations are organized into two segments
based on end markets served: (1) Oil & Gas Proppants and (2) Industrial & Specialty Products.
Our segments are complementary because our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across
end markets allows us to maximize recovery rates in our mining operations, optimize our asset
utilization and reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
Recent Trends and Outlook
Oil and gas proppants end market trends
Increased demand for frac sand between 2008 and 2014 was driven by the growth in the use of
hydraulic fracturing as a means to extract hydrocarbons from shale formations. According to the
2014 Proppant Market Report, PropTester Inc., published February 2015, global frac sand
consumption grew at a 51.2% compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2014. This included
53.7% growth in frac sand demand from 2013 to 2014. We significantly expanded our sales
efforts to the frac sand market in 2008 and experienced rapid growth in our sales associated with
our oil and gas activities from 2008 until 2014.
However, declines in oil prices in 2015 have reduced oil and gas drilling and completion activity
in North America. As of June 30, 2016, the U.S. land rig count had fallen over 70% from its peak
in 2014. Demand for frac sand fell in conjunction with the rig count and activity levels, partially
offset by higher proppant per well to optimize recovery and production rates. Frac sand pricing
remained under pressure during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The table below
summarizes some revenue metrics of our Oil & Gas Proppants segment for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015. During the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and three months ended March 31, 2016 both tons sold and average selling price
decreased sequentially due to reduced demand from our customers.

A continued reduction in oil and gas drilling and completion activity may reduce frac sand
demand further, which could result in us selling fewer tons, selling tons at lower prices, or both. If
we sell less frac sand, or sell frac sand at lower prices, our revenue, net income, cash generated
from operating activities, and liquidity would be adversely affected. We could evaluate further
actions to reduce cost and improve liquidity. For instance, depending on market conditions, we
may implement additional cost improvement projects or further reduce our capital spending for
2016 and beyond and may delay or cancel capital projects.
Additionally, due to impacts of reduced demand for our frac sand, we are engaged in ongoing
discussions with our take-or-pay supply agreement customers regarding pricing and volume
requirements under our existing contracts. While these discussions continue, in certain
circumstances, we have provided contract customers with temporary
16
reductions to contract pricing in exchange for additional term and/or volume in order to preserve
the value of these agreements. We may deliver sand at prices or at volumes below the
requirements in our existing take-or-pay supply agreements. We expect these circumstances
may continue for the remainder of 2016. For a discussion of customer credit risk, see the Credit
Risk section in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016 leading indicators suggested a possibility of
stabilization or even an increase in North American oil and gas drilling and completion activity in
the near future. We believe fluctuations in frac sand demand and price may occur as the market
adjusts to changing supply and demand due to energy pricing fluctuations. We continue to
expect long-term growth in oil and gas drilling in North American shale basins.
Oil and natural gas exploration and production companies' and oilfield service providers’
preferences and expectations have been evolving in recent years. A proppant vendor’s logistics
capabilities have become an important differentiating factor when competing for business on both
a spot and contract basis. Many of our customers increasingly seek convenient in-basin proppant
delivery capability from their proppant supplier. We believe that, over time, proppant customers
will prefer to consolidate their purchases across a smaller group of suppliers with robust logistics
capabilities and a broad offering of high performance proppants.
Industrial and specialty products end market trends
Demand in the industrial and specialty products end markets is relatively stable and is primarily
influenced by key macroeconomic drivers such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and
remodel activity and industrial production. The primary end markets served by our production
used in Industrial & Specialty Products are foundry, building products, sports and recreation,
glassmaking and filtration. We have been increasing our value-added product offerings in the
industrial and specialty products end markets. These new higher margin product sales have
increased our Industrial & Specialty Products segment's profitability.
Our Strategy
The key drivers of our growth strategy include:
Expand our Oil & Gas Proppants production capacity and product portfolio. We continue to
•consider and execute several initiatives to increase our frac sand production capacity and
augment our proppant product portfolio.
•
•
•
•
•
While we made various initial investments or initial evaluations of new Greenfield sites in recent
years, these expansion projects have been given lower priority due to the current frac sand
market conditions. Our current focus for expanding production capacity is on maximizing
existing production facility efficiencies.
In order to increase our resin coated product portfolio, during 2015, we announced the
introduction of InnoProp® Python RCS, a new high-performance resin coated proppant
designed to increase the production of oil and gas wells in an economical and efficient manner.
In early 2016, we introduced another new resin coated product, InnoProp® PLT, which is a
curable low-temperature product and can be used without an activator in oil and gas wells that
have bottom-hole static temperatures down to 70°F.
Increase our presence and product offering in industrial and specialty products end markets. Our
research and business development teams work in tandem with our customers to develop new
products, which we expect will either increase our presence and market share in certain
industrial and specialty products end markets or allow us to enter new markets. We manage a
robust pipeline of new products in various stages of development. Some of these products have
already come to market, resulting in a positive impact on our financial results. We continue to
work toward offering more value-driven industrial and specialty products that will enhance the
profitability of the business.
Optimize product mix and further develop value-added capabilities to maximize margins. We
continue to actively manage our product mix at each of our plants to ensure we maximize our
profit margins. This requires us to use our proprietary expertise in balancing key variables, such
as mine geology, processing capacities, transportation availability, customer requirements and
pricing. We expect to continue investing in ways to increase the value we provide to our
customers by expanding our product offerings, improving our supply chain management,
upgrading our information technology, and creating a world class customer service model.
Expand our supply chain network and leverage our logistics capabilities to meet our customers’
needs in each strategic oil and gas basin. We continue to expand our transload network to
ensure product is available to meet the in-basin needs of our customers. This approach allows
us to provide strong customer service and puts us in a position to take advantage of
opportunistic spot market sales. Our plant sites are strategically located to provide access to key
Class I railroads, which enables us to cost effectively send product to each of the strategic
basins in North America. We can ship product by truck, barge and rail with an ability to connect
to short-line railroads as
17
necessary to meet our customers’ evolving in-basin product needs. We believe that our supply
chain network and logistics capabilities are a competitive advantage that enables us to provide
superior service for our customers. For example, in 2015, we opened our Odessa, Texas unit
train receiving transload facility, which was built in partnership with Union Pacific Railroad to
support mainly the Permian market. We expect to continue to make strategic investments and
develop partnerships with transload operators and transportation providers that will enhance our
portfolio of supply chain services that we can provide to customers. As of June 30, 2016, we have
storage capacity at 51 transloads located near all of the major shale basins in the United States.
Evaluate both Greenfield and Brownfield expansion opportunities and other acquisitions. We
expect to continue to leverage our reputation, processing capabilities and infrastructure to
increase production, as well as explore other opportunities to expand our reserve base. We may
accomplish this by developing Greenfield projects, where we can capitalize on our technical
knowledge of geology, mining and processing and our strong reputation within local
communities. We are continuing to actively pursue acquisitions to grow by taking advantage of
our asset footprint, our management’s experience with high-growth businesses, and our strong
customer relationships. Our primary objective is to acquire assets with differing levels of frac
sand quality that are complementary to our Oil & Gas Proppants segment, with a focus on
mining, processing and logistics to further enhance our market presence. We prioritize
acquisitions that provide opportunities to realize synergies (and, in some cases, the acquisition
may be accretive assuming synergies), including entering new geographic and frac sand
product markets, acquiring attractive customer contracts and improving operations. For instance,
on July 15, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which we will
acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of New Birmingham, Inc., a regional sand producer
located near Tyler, Texas. The consideration includes 2.6 million shares of our common stock
and approximately $111.1 million in cash and liabilities assumed, subject to customary
adjustments at closing. The transaction is expected to close in August 2016, subject to receiving
regulatory approvals. Additionally, on August 1, 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement
pursuant to which we will acquire all of the outstanding membership units of Sandbox
Enterprises LLC, a provider of logistics solutions and technology for the transportation of
proppant used in hydraulic fracturing in the oil and gas industry. The consideration includes 4.2
million shares of our common stock and approximately $75 million in cash and liabilities
assumed, subject to customary adjustments at closing. The transaction is expected to close in
August 2016, subject to receiving regulatory approvals. We are in active discussions to acquire
additional assets fitting this strategy, which, if completed, would be “significant” under
Regulation S-X and could require additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance
that we will reach a definitive agreement and complete any of these potential transactions. See
the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our 2015 Annual Report, including the risk factor
entitled, “If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our
growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.”
•
•
Maintain financial strength and flexibility. We intend to maintain financial strength and flexibility
to enable us to better manage through the oil and gas proppant industry downturn and pursue
acquisitions and new growth opportunities as they arise. In March 2016, we completed a public
offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately
$186.2 million net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. As of June 30, 2016, we had
$454.2 million of cash on hand and $46.7 million of availability under our Revolver. We intend to
use a portion of this cash to complete our planned acquisition of New Birmingham, Inc and
Sandbox Enterprises LLC.
How We Generate Our Sales
We derive our sales by mining and processing minerals that our customers purchase for various
uses. Our sales are primarily a function of the price per ton and the number of tons sold. The
price invoiced reflects product, transportation and additional services as applicable, such as
storage and transloading the product from railcars to trucks for delivery to the customer site. We
invoice the majority of our customers on a per shipment basis, although for some larger
customers, we consolidate invoices weekly or monthly. Our five largest customers accounted for
approximately 38% of total sales during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Sales to our largest
customer, Halliburton Company, accounted for 13% of our total revenues during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues.
We primarily sell our products under short-term price agreements or at prevailing market rates.
For a number of customers, we sell under long-term, competitively-bid contracts. As of June 30,
2016, we have five take-or-pay supply agreements in the Oil & Gas Proppants segment with
initial terms expiring between 2017 and 2019. These agreements define, among other
commitments, the volume of product that our customers must purchase, the volume of product
that we must provide and the price that we will charge and that our customers will pay for each
product. Prices under these agreements are generally fixed and subject to upward adjustment in
response to certain cost increases. Additionally, at the time the take-or-pay supply agreements
were signed, some customers provided advance payments for future shipments. A percentage of
these
18
advance payments is recognized as revenue with each ton of applicable product shipped to the
customer. Collectively, sales to customers with take-or-pay supply agreements accounted for
20% and 32% of our total company revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Although sales under take-or-pay supply agreements may result in us
realizing lower margins than we otherwise might during periods of high market prices, we believe
such lower margins are offset by the benefits derived from the product mix and sales volume
stability afforded by such supply agreements, which helps us lower market risk arising from
adverse changes in spot prices and market conditions. Additionally, selling more tons under
supply contracts also enables us to be more efficient from a production, supply chain and
logistics standpoint. As discussed in Part I, Item 1A., "Risk Factors", of our 2015 Annual Report
—"A large portion of our sales is generated by our top customers, and the loss of, or significant
reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our operations,” these
customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of product in the future due to a variety
of reasons, contract requirements notwithstanding.
Historically we have not entered into long term take-or-pay contracts with our customers in the
industrial and specialty products end markets because of the high cost to our customers of
switching providers. With these customers, we often enter into price agreements which are
typically negotiated annually.
The Costs of Conducting Our Business
The principal expenses involved in conducting our business are labor costs, electricity and
drying fuel costs, maintenance and repair costs for our mining and processing equipment and
facilities and transportation costs. Transportation and related costs include freight charges, fuel
surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees, railcar lease costs, demurrage costs and storage
fees. We believe the majority of our operating costs are relatively stable in price, but can vary
significantly based on the volume of product produced. We benefit from owning the majority of
the mineral deposits that we mine and having long-term mineral rights leases or supply
agreements for our other primary sources of raw material, which limit royalty payments.
Additionally, we incur expenses related to our corporate operations, including costs for sales and
marketing; research and development; and finance, legal, environmental, health and safety
functions of our organization. These costs are principally driven by personnel expenses.
How We Evaluate Our Business
Our management team evaluates our business using a variety of financial and operational
metrics. Our business is organized into two segments, Oil & Gas Proppants and Industrial &
Specialty Products. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on their tons sold,
average selling price and contribution margin earned. Additionally, we consider a number of
factors in evaluating the performance of the business as a whole, including total tons sold,
average selling price, segment contribution margin, and Adjusted EBITDA. We view these
metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements
frequently to analyze trends and make decisions.
Segment Contribution Margin
Segment contribution margin, a non-GAAP measure, is a key metric that management uses to
evaluate our operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments.
Segment contribution margin excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations
of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs that are related to corporate functional
areas such as operations management, corporate purchasing, accounting, treasury, information
technology, legal and human resources.
Segment contribution margin is not a measure of our financial performance under GAAP and
should not be considered an alternative to measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For
more details on the reconciliation of segment contribution margin to its most directly comparable
GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), see Note M - Segment Reporting to our Financial
Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is included in this report because it is a key metric
used by management to assess our operating performance and by our lenders to evaluate our
covenant compliance. Our target performance goals under our incentive compensation plan are
tied, in part, to our Adjusted EBITDA. In addition, our Revolver contains a consolidated total net
leverage ratio that we must meet as of the last day of any fiscal quarter whenever usage of the
Revolver (other than certain undrawn letters of credit) exceeds 25% of the Revolver commitment,
which is calculated based on our Adjusted EBITDA. Noncompliance with the financial ratio
covenant contained in the Revolver could result in the acceleration of our obligations to repay all
amounts outstanding under the Revolver and the Term Loan. Moreover, the Revolver and the
Term
19
Loan contain covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to make permitted
acquisitions, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments (including dividends) and
retain excess cash flow based, in some cases, on our ability to meet leverage ratios calculated
based on our Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of our financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and
should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance,
cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure
derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a
measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain
cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements.
Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash
expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets
being depreciated and amortized, and excludes certain non-recurring charges. Management
compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and by using
Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily
comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies
in the methods of calculation.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA.

Total sales decreased 21% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015, driven by a 1% decrease in total tons sold and a 20% decrease in
overall average selling price. Tons sold in-basin represented 33% of total company tons sold for
both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the same period in 2015.
The decrease in total sales was primarily driven by Oil & Gas Proppants sales, which decreased
29%. Oil & Gas Proppants average selling price decreased 34% driven by a year over year
decrease in demand for our frac sand from customers due to reduced drilling and completion
activity. Tons sold for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased 9% due to our market
share gain efforts.
Industrial & Specialty Products sales decreased by 8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. Tons sold decreased 13% driven by our
strategic shift among customers and products. Average selling price increased 5%, which was
primarily a result of new higher-margin product sales and price increases.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold decreased by $14.5 million, or 12%, to $102.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $117.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. As a
percentage of sales, cost of goods sold increased to 88% for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to 79% for the same period in 2015. These changes result from the main
components of cost of goods sold as discussed below.
We incurred $52.2 million and $58.1 million of transportation and related costs for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease was due to fewer tons sold
through transloads caused by lower demand for our frac sand at our transload sites. As a
percentage of sales, transportation and related costs increased to 45% for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to 39% for the same period in 2015 mainly due to a lower
average selling price.
We incurred $16.8 million and $20.1 million of operating labor costs for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $3.3 million decrease in labor costs incurred was
primarily due to lower employee headcount and fewer tons sold. As a percentage of sales,
operating labor costs represented 14% for both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the
same period in 2015.
We incurred $5.9 million and $6.5 million of electricity and drying fuel (principally natural gas)
costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $0.6 million
decrease in electricity and drying fuel costs incurred was mainly driven by lower natural gas
prices and fewer tons sold. As a percentage of sales, electricity and drying fuel costs increased to
5% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 4% for the same period in 2015.
We incurred $7.9 million and $9.1 million of maintenance and repair costs for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in maintenance and repair costs
incurred was mainly due to scheduled maintenance and
21
•
fewer tons sold. As a percentage of sales, maintenance and repair costs increased to 7% for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 6% for the same period in 2015.
Segment Contribution Margin
Oil & Gas Proppants contribution margin decreased by $19.3 million, or 145%, to $(6.0) million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015, driven by a $25.9 million decrease in segment revenue, partially offset by lower
segment cost of goods sold mainly due to lower transportation and related costs.
Industrial & Specialty Products contribution margin increased by $2.0 million, or 10%, to $21.5
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $19.5 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015, driven by increased higher-margin products sales as a percentage of total
sales.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8.0 million, or 122%, to $14.6 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $6.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2015. The increase was due to the following factors:
Business development related expense increased by $1.2 million to $0.8 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $(0.4) million for the three months ended June 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to the settlement of an arbitration proceeding during the
three months ended June 30, 2015, which caused a $1.1 million credit to our expense. See Note
I - Commitments and Contingencies of our Financial Statements for more information about this
arbitration ruling.
Compensation-related expense increased by $6.0 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, driven by reduced 2015 incentive
compensation and the valuation adjustments of equity-based compensation expense during
three months ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by lower employee headcount in 2016.
Bad debt expense increased by $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015, mainly due to a recovery of a previously
reserved receivable that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
In total, our selling, general and administrative costs represented approximately 12% and 4% of
our sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by $1.5 million, or 11%, to $15.2
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $13.7 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. The year over year increase was mainly driven by our continued capital
spending. Depreciation, depletion and amortization costs represented approximately 13% and
9% of our sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Operating Income (Loss)
Operating income decreased by $25.5 million, or 254%, to $(15.5) million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The
decrease was due to a 21% decrease in sales, a 122% increase in selling, general and
•
•
administrative expense and an 11% increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense, partially offset by a 12% decrease in cost of goods sold.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 4%, to $6.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $6.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, mainly driven
by decreases in debt principal and customer prepayment recorded as deferred revenue.
Provision for Income Taxes
The income tax benefit increased $3.2 million to $9.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was
driven primarily by increased loss before income
22
taxes. The effective tax rate was 44% and (176)% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. See accompanying Note J - Income Taxes of our Financial Statements for
more information.
Historically, our actual effective tax rates have differed from the statutory effective rate primarily
due to the benefit received from statutory percentage depletion allowances. The deduction for
statutory percentage depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in
income before income taxes.
Other income, net, including interest income
Other income was relatively flat at $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Net Income/Loss
Net loss was $12.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net income
of $10.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The year over year decrease was due
to the factors noted above.

decrease in total tons sold. Tons sold in-basin represented 32% and 37% of total company tons
sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The decrease in total sales was driven by Oil & Gas Proppants sales, which decreased 42%. Oil
& Gas Proppants tons sold for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased 6% and average
selling price decreased 39%. These decreases were driven by the year over year decrease in
demand for our frac sand from customers due to reduced drilling and completion activity.
Industrial & Specialty Products sales decreased 10% for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Tons sold decreased 12%, driven by our
strategic shift among customers and products. Average selling price increased 3%, driven new
higher-margin product sales and price increases.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold decreased by $46.4 million, or 18%, to $209.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 compared to $255.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. As a
percentage of sales, cost of goods sold increased to 87% for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to 73% for the same period in 2015. These changes result from the main components
of cost of goods sold as discussed below.
We incurred $104.3 million and $131.1 million of transportation and related costs for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $26.8 million decrease was mainly
due to fewer tons sold through transloads caused by lower
23
demand for our frac sand at our transload sites. As a percentage of sales, transportation and
related costs increased to 44% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 37% for the
same period in 2015 mainly due to a decrease in average selling price.
We incurred $36.5 million and $41.4 million of operating labor costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $4.9 million decrease in labor costs incurred was
primarily due to lower employee headcount and fewer tons sold. As a percentage of sales,
operating labor costs represented 15% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 12%
for the same period in 2015.
We incurred $12.6 million and $14.7 million of electricity and drying fuel (principally natural gas)
costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in electricity
and drying fuel costs incurred was due to fewer tons sold and lower natural gas prices. As a
percentage of sales, electricity and drying fuel costs represented 5% for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to 4% for the same period in 2015.
We incurred $16.0 million and $19.3 million of maintenance and repair costs for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in maintenance and repair costs
incurred was due to scheduled maintenance and fewer tons sold. As a percentage of sales,
maintenance and repair costs increased to 7% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to 5% for the same period in 2015.
Segment Contribution Margin
Oil & Gas Proppants contribution margin decreased by $70.6 million, or 108%, to $(5.1) million
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $65.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015, driven by a 42% decrease in revenue partially offset by a 17% decrease in
segment cost of goods sold.
Industrial & Specialty Products contribution margin increased by $3.4 million, or 10%, to $38.4
•
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $35.0 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015, driven by increased higher margin products sales as a percentage of total
sales and price increases.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million, or 10%, to $30.1 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $33.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the following factors:
Business development related expense decreased by $7.0 million to $1.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $8.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
This decrease is mainly due to a $6.5 million settlement of an unfavorable arbitration ruling
during the six months ended June 30, 2015. See Note I - Commitments and Contingencies of
our Financial Statements for more information about this arbitration ruling.
Compensation related expense increased by $3.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to reduced 2015 incentive compensation and the
valuation adjustments of equity-based compensation expense happened during three months
ended June 30, 2015, partially offset by lower employee headcount in 2016.
Bad debt expense increased by $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to the six months ended June 30, 2015, mainly due to a recovery of a previously reserved
receivable occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
In total, our selling, general and administrative costs represented approximately 13% and 10% of
our sales for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased by $2.8 million, or 10%, to $29.8
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $26.9 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. The year over year increase was driven by the addition of our Utica, Illinois
plant, Odessa, Texas transload facility and other capital spending. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization costs represented approximately 12% and 8% of our sales for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Operating Income (Loss)
Operating income decreased by $64.9 million, or 185%, to a $29.8 million operating loss for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $35.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The decrease was due to a 32% decrease in sales and a 10% increase in depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense, partially offset by a 18% decrease in cost of goods sold and
a 10% decrease in selling, general and administrative expense.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 3%, to $13.3 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $13.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, mainly driven
by decreases in debt principal and customer prepayment recorded as deferred revenue.
Provision for Income Taxes    
The income tax benefit increased $15.2 million to $18.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was driven
primarily by increased loss before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 44% and (13)% for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See accompanying Note J - Income
Taxes of our Financial Statements for more information.
Historically, our actual effective tax rates have differed from the statutory effective rate primarily
due to the benefit received from statutory percentage depletion allowances. The deduction for
statutory percentage depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in
income before income taxes.
Other income, net, including interest income
Other income was $2.4 million and $0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The increase was mainly due to a gain of $1.5 million on insurance
settlements that we received during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Net Income (Loss)
Net loss was $22.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net income of
$24.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The year over year decrease was due to
the factors noted above.
25
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal liquidity requirements have historically been to service our debt, to meet our
working capital, capital expenditure and mine development expenditure needs, to return cash to
our stockholders, and to finance acquisitions. We have historically met our liquidity and capital
investment needs with funds generated through operations. We have historically funded our
acquisitions through cash on hand or borrowings under our credit facilities and equity issuances.
Our working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities and is a
measure of our ability to pay our liabilities as they become due. In March 2016, we completed a
public offering of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of
approximately $186.2 million net of underwriting discounts and offering costs. As of June 30,
2016, our working capital was $513.9 million and we had $46.7 million of availability under the
Revolver.
We believe that cash generated through operations and our financing arrangements will be
sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled debt
payments and any dividends declared for at least the next 12 months.
Management and our Board remain committed to evaluating additional ways of creating
shareholder value. Any determination to pay dividends and other distributions in cash, stock, or
property in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on then-existing
conditions, including our business conditions, our financial condition, results of operations,
liquidity, capital requirements, contractual restrictions including restrictive covenants contained in
debt agreements, and other factors. Additionally, because we are a holding company, our ability
to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by restrictions on the ability of our
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of
the agreements governing our indebtedness.

Net cash provided by (used in): 
Operating activities

Financing activities
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash and working
capital items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation, depletion and
amortization, deferred revenue, deferred income taxes, equity-based compensation and bad debt
provision. In addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and
liabilities, principally accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current
assets, income taxes payable and receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $38.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This $37.1 million
decrease in cash provided by operations was the result of a $47.4 million decrease in net income
and the impact of the other components of operating activities.
Net Cash Provided Used in Investing Activities
Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance and
proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
This was due to capital expenditures of $23.4 million being partially offset by $21.9 million in
proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital expenditures for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily for a purchase of reserves adjacent to our Ottawa,
Illinois, facility, engineering, procurement and construction of our growth projects and other
maintenance and cost improvement capital projects.
26
Net cash used in investing activities was $22.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2015, which totaled $27.1 million, were
primarily for the engineering, procurement and construction of our Greenfield raw sand plant near
Fairchild, Wisconsin, an expansion project at our Pacific, Missouri facility and other maintenance
capital projects.
Subject to our continuing evaluation of market conditions, we anticipate that our capital
expenditures in 2016, including the purchase of reserves adjacent to our Ottawa, Illinois, facility,
will be in a range of $28 million to $33 million, which is primarily associated with growth,
maintenance and cost improvement capital projects. We expect to fund our capital expenditures
through cash on our balance sheet, cash generated from our operations and cash generated from
financing activities.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Financing activities consist primarily of equity issuances, capital contributions, dividend
payments, borrowings and repayments related to the Revolver and Term Loan, as well as fees
and expenses paid in connection with our credit facilities, and advance payments from our
customers.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $177.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, driven by $200.0 million of common stock issuances and $1.3 million of proceeds from
options exercised, both of which were partially offset by $13.8 million of common stock issuance
costs, $6.7 million of dividends paid, $2.6 million of long-term debt payments, and $1.0 million of
tax payments related to shares withheld for vested restricted stock.
Net cash used in financing activities was $31.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015,
driven by $15.3 million of common stock repurchases, $13.4 million of dividends paid, and $2.6
million of long-term debt payments.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future
material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales, expenses, results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Contractual Obligations
There have been no significant changes outside the ordinary course of business to our
“Contractual Obligations” table in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of our 2015 Annual Report. For more details on
future minimum annual commitments under such operating leases, please see accompanying
Note I - Commitments and Contingencies to our Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other
things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, environmental contamination and
reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and
expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot
predict the full amount of such future expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, we had $12.7 million
accrued for future reclamation costs, as compared to $12.3 million as of December 31, 2015.
We discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities,
certain regulatory requirements relating to human exposure to crystalline silica and our mining
activity and how such matters may affect our business in the future under Item 1, “Business,”
Item 1A, “Risk Factors” Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”, and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Environmental Matters” in our 2015
Annual Report.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe that the
reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the
exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,
actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an
ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other
27
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant
accounting policies, including certain critical accounting policies, are disclosed in our 2015
Annual Report.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New accounting guidance that we have recently adopted, as well as accounting guidance that
has been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, are included in Note A - Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies to our Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations.
Such risks arise from adverse changes in market rates, prices and conditions. We address such
market risks as discussed in "How We Generate Our Sales" in Item 2 of this Form 10-Q,
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of June 30,
2016, we have $496.7 million of debt outstanding under our senior credit facility. Assuming no
change in the amount outstanding, and LIBOR is greater than the 1.0% minimum base rate on
the Term Loan, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% would have
changed our interest expense by $3.2 million per year.
We use interest rate derivatives in the normal course of our business to manage both our interest
cost and the risks associated with changing interest rates. We do not use derivatives for trading
or speculative purposes. The following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative
instruments (in thousands) at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

(1) Agreements limit the LIBOR floating interest rate base to 4%.
Credit Risk
We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers.
We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage
our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring
procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of credit, prepayments or
guarantees, although collateral is generally not required.
Despite enhancing our examination of our customers' credit worthiness, we may still experience
delays or failures in customer payments. Some of our customers have reported experiencing
financial difficulties. With respect to customers that may file for bankruptcy protection, we may not
be able to collect sums owed to us by these customers and we also may be required to refund
pre-petition amounts paid to us during the preference period (typically 90 days) prior to the
bankruptcy filing.
29
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. The
term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30,
2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management’s
evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter
ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
30
PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In addition to the matter described below, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims,
and governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of our business which cover
matters such as general commercial, governmental regulations, antitrust and trade regulations,
product liability, environmental, intellectual property, employment and other actions. Although the
outcomes of these routine claims cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of
management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position or results of operations.
Prolonged inhalation of excessive levels of respirable crystalline silica dust can result in silicosis,
a disease of the lungs. Breathing large amounts of respirable silica dust over time may injure a
person’s lungs by causing scar tissue to form. Crystalline silica in the form of quartz is a basic
component of soil, sand, granite and most other types of rock. Cutting, breaking, crushing,
drilling, grinding and abrasive blasting of or with crystalline silica containing materials can
produce fine silica dust, the inhalation of which may cause silicosis, lung cancer and possibly
other diseases including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. Sources of exposure to
respirable crystalline silica dust include sandblasting, foundry manufacturing, crushing and
drilling of rock, masonry and concrete work, mining and tunneling, and cement and asphalt
pavement manufacturing.
Since at least 1975, we and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually
among many defendants, in numerous lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former
employees of our customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. Prior to 2001, the
number of silicosis lawsuits filed annually against the commercial silica industry remained
relatively stable and was generally below 100, but between 2001 and 2004 the number of
silicosis lawsuits filed against the commercial silica industry substantially increased. This
increase led to greater scrutiny of the nature of the claims filed, and in June 2005 the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an opinion in the former federal silica multi-district
litigation remanding almost all of the 10,000 cases then pending in the multi-district litigation
back to the state courts from which they originated for further review and medical qualification,
leading to a number of silicosis case dismissals across the United States. In conjunction with this
and other favorable court rulings establishing “sophisticated user” and “no duty to warn” defenses
for silica producers, several states, including Texas, Ohio and Florida, have passed medical
criteria legislation that requires proof of actual impairment before a lawsuit can be filed.
As a result of the above developments, the filing rate of new claims against us over the past three
years has decreased to below pre-2001 levels, and we were named as a defendant in three, one
and zero new silicosis cases filed in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. During the six months
ended June 30, 2016, no additional claims were brought against us. As of June 30, 2016, there
are a total of approximately 74 active silica-related products liability claims pending in which we
were a defendant and approximately 165 inactive claims. Almost all of the claims pending
against us arise out of the alleged use of our silica products in foundries or as an abrasive blast
media, and involve various other defendants. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2012, we had
insurance policies for both our predecessors that covered certain claims for alleged silica
exposure for periods prior to certain dates in 1985 and 1986 (with respect to certain insurance).
As a result of a settlement with a former owner of ours and its insurers in the fourth quarter of
2012, some of these policies are no longer available to us, and we will not seek reimbursement
for any defense costs or claim payments from these policies. Other insurance policies, however,
continue to remain available to us and will continue to make such payments on our behalf.
The silica-related litigation brought against us to date has not resulted in material liability to us.
However, we continue to have silica-related products liability claims filed against us, including
claims that allege silica exposure for periods for which we do not have insurance coverage. Any
such pending or future claims or inadequacies of our insurance coverage could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations. For more information
regarding silica-related litigation, see Part I, Item 1A of our 2015 Annual Report “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to Our Business—Silica-related health issues and litigation could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.”
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
As of June 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A
of Part I in our 2015 Annual Report.

ITEM 3.DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
None.
ITEM 4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
Safety is one of our core values, and we strive for excellence in the achievement of a workplace
free of injuries and occupational illnesses. Our health and safety leadership team has developed
comprehensive safety policies and standards, which include detailed standards and procedures
for safe production, addressing topics such as employee training, risk management, workplace
inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. We place special
emphasis on the importance of continuous improvement in occupational health, personal injury
avoidance and prevention, emergency preparedness, and property damage elimination. In
addition to strong leadership and involvement from all levels of the organization, these programs
and procedures form the cornerstone of our safety initiatives, ensuring that employees are
provided a safe and healthy environment and are intended as a means to reduce workplace
accidents, incidents and losses, comply with all mining-related regulations and provide support
for both regulators and the industry to improve mine safety. While we want to have productive
operations in full regulatory compliance, we know it is equally essential that we motivate and
train our people to think, practice and feel a personal responsibility for health and safety on and
off the job.
All of our production facilities, with the exception of our resin-coated sand facility, are classified
as mines and are subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration
(“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects
our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation
has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New
Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly increased the numbers of citations and
orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has
also increased in recent years. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory
matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to
this Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q.

•fluctuations in our sales and results of operations due to seasonality and other factors;
•
•
•interruptions or failures in our information technology systems;
•the impact of a terrorist attack or armed conflict;
extensive and evolving environmental, mining, health and safety, licensing, reclamation and
other regulation (and changes in their enforcement or interpretation);
•silica-related health issues and corresponding litigation;
our ability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and
restoration of mining property; and
•other factors included and disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of our 2015 Annual Report.
We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts,
which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are
reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is
impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are
disclosed under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2015 Annual Report. All written and oral
forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly
qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements
that are made from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q, and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements
made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that
are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or
developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the
consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date hereof.
We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
