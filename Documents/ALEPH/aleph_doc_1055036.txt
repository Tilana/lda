Tribute Minerals Inc. 
2008 Annual Financial Statements
Management’s Responsibility  
for Financial Statements
Tribute’s management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial 
statements and all the information in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared by management in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and 
reflect management’s best estimates and judgments based on currently available information. Financial 
information presented elsewhere in this annual report has been prepared by management to ensure 
consistency with that in the financial statements. The financial statements have been reviewed by the 
Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. 
 
Management is responsible for the development and maintenance of a system of internal controls and 
disclosure controls in order to ensure, on a reasonable and cost effective basis, that the financial 
information is accurate and reliable, disclosures are complete, and that the Company’s assets are 
adequately safeguarded. 
 
The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities and is 
ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements and the accompanying 
management’s discussion and analysis. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its 
Audit Committee. 
 
The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent 
auditors, in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards on behalf of the Company’s 
shareholders. This report outlines the nature of their examination and their opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company. The independent auditors have full and unrestricted access to the 
Audit Committee.

Auditors’ Report
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF TRIBUTE MINERALS INC.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Tribute Minerals Inc. as at December 31, 2008 and 
2007 and the consolidated statements of loss and deficit, comprehensive loss and cash flows for the 
years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our 
audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the 
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. 
 
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for the years then ended in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Tribute Minerals Inc. 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
December 31, 2008 
 
1. Nature of operations and going concern uncertainty 
 
Tribute Minerals Inc. (the “Company” or “Tribute”) is a publicly held company amalgamated under the 
Ontario Business Corporations Act. The Company is engaged in the investigation, acquisition, exploration 
and development of mineral properties in Ontario, Canada. Substantially all of the efforts of the Company 
are devoted to these business activities. 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes 
that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of 
business for the foreseeable future. As at December 31, 2008 the Company had no sources of operating 
cash flows. The Company will therefore require additional funding which, if not raised, would result in the 
further curtailment of activities and project delays. Tribute had a working capital deficit of $717,627 as at 
December 31, 2008, and had incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated operating deficit 
of $14,538,141 as at December 31, 2008. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is 
uncertain and is dependent upon its ability to continue to raise adequate financing. There can be no 
assurances that the Company will be successful in this regard, and therefore, there is substantial doubt 
regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, and accordingly, the use of accounting 
principles applicable to a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not reflect 
adjustments that would be necessary if the “going concern” assumption were not appropriate. If the “going 
concern” assumption were not appropriate for these consolidated financial statements, then adjustments 
to the carrying values of the assets and liabilities, the expenses and the balance sheet classifications, 
which could be material, would be necessary. 
 
2. Summary of significant accounting policies 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company is a development stage enterprise that has yet to 
generate revenue from mining operations. 
 
Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McFaulds Resources Inc., of which the 
Company holds a 50% ownership interest. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been 
eliminated on consolidation. 
 
Interest in mineral properties 
Exploration and development expenditures related to mineral properties are recorded as an expense in 
the period in which they are incurred, or deferred if it is determined that these costs will be recovered from 
future operations as a result of established proven and probable reserves. Determination as to reserve 
potential is based on the results of feasibility studies, which indicate whether production from a property is 
economically feasible. Significant acquisition costs for mineral properties are deferred until it is 
determined that these costs will not be recovered from future operations, at which point these costs are 
written down to fair market value. Acquisition costs and deferred exploration and development 
expenditures will be depleted on a unit-of-production basis commencing at the onset of commercial 
production for the related property. 
 
Operating leases 
Payments for operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  
 
Property, plant & equipment 
Property, plant & equipment consisting of computer equipment are recorded at cost and amortized at 30% 
per annum on a declining balance basis.
Tribute Minerals Inc
6
Stock based compensation 
The Company has a stock-based compensation plan, which is described in Note 6(b). The Company 
accounts for stock options using the fair value method. Under this method, compensation expense for 
stock options granted is measured at fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model 
and recognized over the vesting period of the options granted.  
 
Flow through shares 
The Company has financed a portion of its exploration activities through the issuance of flow-through 
shares, which transfer the tax deductibility of exploration expenditures to the investor. The proceeds 
received on the issuance of such shares have been credited to share capital and the related exploration 
costs are written off to expense when incurred. Resource expenditure deductions for income tax purposes 
related to exploration and development activities funded by flow-through share arrangements are 
renounced to investors in accordance with income tax legislation. When these expenditures are 
renounced, temporary taxable differences created by the renunciation will reduce share capital. 
 
Income taxes 
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method future 
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the substantively enacted tax rates and laws that 
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. 
 
Transaction costs 
Transaction costs related to the acquisition or issue of held-for-trading financial instruments are charged 
to the statement of loss as incurred. Transaction costs related to financial instruments not designated as 
held-for-trading are included in the financial instrument’s initial recognition amount. 
 
Loss per share 
Loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during 
the year. Since the Company is in a loss position, the effects of exercising share purchase options and 
warrants are anti-dilutive. Therefore, diluted loss per common share and basic loss per common share 
are the same for both 2008 and 2007. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term deposits with maturity dates at the date of 
purchase of less than three months. 
 
Financial instruments 
Cash, short-term investments and committed cash are classified as held for trading and are carried at fair 
values on the consolidated balance sheets. Accounts receivable are designated as loans receivable, and 
accounts payable and bank overdraft are designated as other financial liabilities. The carrying amount of 
these items approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these financial instruments. 
 
Marketable securities that the Company does not have significant influence over are classified as 
available-for sale investments and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, to the 
extent that the equity investment has a quoted market price. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in 
other comprehensive income or loss. Realized gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated 
statements of operations and deficit when the investment is sold. An impairment loss is recorded in the 
consolidated statements of operations and deficit to the extent that any unrealized declines in fair value 
are judged to be other than temporary. 
 
Use of estimates and assumptions  
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Tribute Minerals Inc
7
Hedging 
The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook Section 3865 specifies the 
circumstances under which hedge accounting is permissible and how hedge accounting may be 
performed. The Company does not engage in hedging transactions and, therefore, does not have any 
financial instruments which are subject to hedge accounting. 
 
Comprehensive income 
Comprehensive income is the change in shareholders’ equity of a company, during a period, other than 
those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. These items include holding 
gains and losses on certain investments, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, and foreign 
currency gains and losses related to self-sustaining foreign operations. 
 
Change in accounting policy - capital disclosures 
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Section 1535 (“Capital Disclosures”). This section 
establishes standards for disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information about an entity’s capital 
and how it is managed in order to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the entity’s 
objectives, policies and processes of managing capital. Beyond additional disclosures, the adoption of 
these standards did not have an effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The 
new disclosures are included in note 11. 
 
Change in accounting policy – financial instruments – disclosure and presentation 
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Section 3862 (“Financial Instruments – Disclosures”) 
and Section 3863 (“Financial Instruments – Presentation”). Section 3862 replaces the disclosure portion 
of Section 3861, Financial Instruments – Disclosure and Presentation, and enhances the disclosure 
requirements on the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments, and how these risks are 
managed. Section 3863 carries forward the presentation requirements from Section 3861. Beyond 
additional disclosures, the adoption of these new pronouncements did not have an effect on the 
Company’s financial position or results of operations. The new disclosures are included in note 10. 
 
Change in accounting policy - general standards of financial statement presentation 
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the amendment to Section 1400 (“General Standards of 
Financial Statement Presentation”). The amendment to this section provides revised guidance related to 
management’s responsibility to assess the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern. Beyond 
additional disclosure, the adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on the Company’s financial 
position or results of operations. The new disclosures are included in note 1. 
 
Future changes in accounting policy  
 
Goodwill and other intangible assets and financial statement concepts 
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company will adopt Section 3064. Section 3064 provides guidance on the 
recognition of intangible assets in accordance with the definition of an asset and the criteria for asset 
recognition, clarifying the application of the concept of matching revenues and expenses, whether these 
assets are separately acquired or are developed internally. The Company is currently evaluating the 
effect of adopting this standard. 
 
Business combinations 
In January 2009, the CICA issued Section 1582, Business Combinations, replacing Section 1581 of the 
same name. The new section will apply prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition 
date is on or after January 1, 2011. Section 1582, which provides the Canadian equivalent to International 
Financial Reporting Standard 3, Business Combinations, establishes standards for the accounting for a 
business combination. Section 1582 requires business acquisitions (including noncontrolling interests and 
contingent consideration) to be measured at fair value on the acquisition date, generally requires 
acquisition-related costs to be expensed, requires gains from bargain purchases to be recorded in net 
earnings, and expands the definition of a business. As Section 1582 will apply only to future business 
combinations, it will not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements prior 
to such acquisitions.
Tribute Minerals Inc
8
Consolidated financial statements and non-controlling Interests 
In January 2009, the CICA issued Sections 1601 “Consolidated Financial Statements”, and 1602, “Non-
controlling Interests”, which replaces existing guidance. Section 1601 establishes standards for the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements. Section 1602 provides guidance on accounting for a 
non-controlling interest in a subsidiary in consolidated financial statements subsequent to a business 
combination. These standards are effective on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
beginning on or after January 2011 with earlier application permitted. 
 
Credit risk and the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities 
In January 2009, the Emerging Issues Committee of the CICA issued EIC-173, Credit Risk and the Fair 
Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which applies to interim and annual financial 
statements for periods ending on or after January 20, 2009. The Company has evaluated the new section 
and determined that adoption of these new requirements will have no impact on the Company’s financial 
statements beyond additional disclosures. 
 
Mining exploration costs 
In March 2009, the CICA issued EIC-174, “Mining Exploration Costs.” The EIC provides guidance on 
accounting for capitalization and impairment of exploration costs. This standard is effective for our fiscal 
year beginning January 1, 2009. The application of this EIC did not have an effect on our consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
International financial reporting standards 
On February 13, 2008, the Accounting Standards Board announced that publicly accountable entities will 
be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) for interim and annual financial statements for fiscal years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2011. The Company is assessing the impact of the conversion from CGAAP to IFRS on the 
consolidated financial statements and will develop a conversion implementation plan. 
 
3. Short-term investments 
 
Short-term investments include a variable rate guaranteed investment certificate due April 20, 2009. The 
certificate has been pledged as security against the Company’s credit card.

Confederation Lake 
 
The Confederation Lake properties (8 claim groups) are base metal and gold prospects situated in the 
Red Lake Mining Division, Northwestern Ontario. On February 12, 2002 the Company entered into an 
option agreement to acquire from Noranda Inc. (now known as Xstrata Canada Corporation (“Xstrata”)) a 
100% interest in a group of mineral properties collectively known as the Confederation Lake properties. In 
order to earn the 100% interest in the properties, the Company was required to have incurred a minimum 
$3,500,000 in exploration and development expenditures.
The Company met all criteria to earn its 100% interest subject to its agreement to pay to Xstrata a 2.0% 
net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty and other underlying royalties on certain properties. There is also a 
back-in option whereby Xstrata has a right to reacquire a 50% interest in any area where a deposit is 
identified (the “Project Area”) after the delivery by the Company to Xstrata of an independent scoping 
study confirming the existence of a deposit of at least 8 million tonnes of massive sulphide or one million 
ounces of gold within the Project Area. In order to exercise the back-in right, Xstrata must expend 150% 
of the Company’s cumulative expenditures on the Project Area to the exercise date. The Company has 
spent approximately $10 million to date.  In addition, the Company is required to make one-time 
payments to Xstrata consisting of $500,000 upon the submission of the first such independent scoping 
study with respect to which Xstrata does not exercise its back-in option and a further $1,500,000 upon the 
commencement of commercial production from the subject Project Area. 
 
McFaulds Lake 
 
On November 20, 2007 (the “Agreement Date”), the Company entered into an agreement with Goldeye 
Explorations Limited (“Goldeye”) to form a joint venture related to a group of properties within the area 
known as “The Ring of Fire” located in the Lower James Bay region of Ontario, in the proximity of 
McFaulds Lake (“the Property”). The joint venture was effective on January 21, 2008 with the purpose of 
sharing on a 50/50 basis, the exploration activity and economic results underlying the mineral claims 
staked. At the time of the agreement, Goldeye had 15 claims, totaling 216 claim units, covering 3,456 
hectares in the McFaulds Lake area.  The agreement required the Company to reimburse Goldeye for 
100% of the staking costs, $74,981, in return for a 50% interest in the claims staked as of the agreement 
date. Interest in, and the cost of, claims staked subsequent to the Agreement Date and up to the 
formation of the joint venture are shared on a 50/50 basis. The McFaulds Lake joint venture currently 
holds approximately 27,000 hectares. 
 
On June 25, 2008, the Company and Goldeye jointly announced that they intended to roll their respective 
interests in their land holdings in the McFaulds Lake property into a new company known as “McFaulds 
Resources Inc.” (“MFR”). Each of Tribute and Goldeye retained a 1% NSR in the Property and each hold 
14,000,000 common shares of MFR. It was intended that MFR file a prospectus to acquire a listing on a
Tribute Minerals Inc
10
recognized Canadian stock exchange as soon as a National Instrument 43-101 technical report was 
completed.  
 
On April 2, 2009, the Company signed a letter of intent with Goldeye to acquire the 50% interest in the 
McFaulds Lake joint venture not already owned by the Company, in exchange for issuing a total of 
11,671,500 of its common shares to Goldeye, the payment of $115,000 in cash, settlement of $85,000 in 
accounts payable and the retention by Goldeye of a 1 percent net-smelter-returns royalty (subject to 
adjustment) in the property. On April 22, 2009, the formal letter of agreement was signed. The transaction 
is conditional upon the Company raising $1,500,000 by June 29, 2009,and both parties closing the 
transaction by July 7, 2009. All prior agreements with Goldeye will be terminated. 
 
As at December 31, 2008 the Company has recorded $74,981 in acquisition costs as mineral properties, 
$85,000 in accounts payable to Goldeye and $192,935 as exploration and project evaluation costs related 
to the McFaulds Lake property. No work is required to keep the McFaulds Lake property in good standing 
until the fall of 2009.  
 
Other properties 
 
“Other” includes exploration expenditures on projects with minor activity during the year and includes the 
Richardson Lake property, the Bridget Lake property, the Fredart Lake property, the Woman River 
property and the Clay South Property, all of which are in Northern Ontario.  
 
On September 16, 2008 (the “effective date”), the Company signed an option agreement with Halo 
Resources Ltd. (“Halo”) for the exclusive right and option for Halo to earn up to 75% interest in the Bridget

10. Financial instruments and risk management 
 
Categories of financial assets and liabilities 
 
Under Canadian GAAP, financial instruments are classified into one of the following five categories: held-
for-trading, held to maturity investments, loans and receivables, available-for-sale financial assets and 
other financial liabilities. The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, including those held 
for sale on the consolidated balance sheets are classified into the following categories:

Risks arising from financial instruments and risk management 
 
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk 
and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management program focuses on 
the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the financial 
performance of the Company. 
 
The Company uses various methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These 
methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate and other price risks.  
 
(a) Market risk  
 
 (i) Price risk  
 
Commodity price risk  
Commodity price risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from movements in the price of the Company’s 
commodity inputs and outputs. The Company is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the 
fluctuation of the value of the metals it is exploring for. The Company does not manage commodity price 
risk through the use of derivative instruments.
Tribute Minerals Inc
15
Sensitivity  
At December 31, 2008, a change in the value of gold and base metals would not change the recognized 
value of any of the Company’s financial instruments. 
 
(ii) Cash flow fair value interest rate risk  
 
The Company does not have interest-bearing borrowings for which general rate fluctuations apply. The 
Company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent of the balance of the bank accounts. 
 
(b) Credit risk  
 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in 
financial loss to the group. Credit risk arises from cash and deposits with banks and financial institutions 
as well as credit exposures to outstanding receivables.  
 
The Company has no concentration of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the 
consolidated financial statements are adjusted for any impairment and represent the Company’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk.  
 
(c) Liquidity risk  
 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining at all times sufficient cash, liquid investments and 
committed credit facilities to meet the Company’s commitments as they arise. The Company manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows.  Prior to the world-wide financial liquidity crisis the Company maintained operations by way of 
equity financings. The Company is currently assessing all options to address its liquidity issues. It is not 
possible to determine with any certainty the success and adequacy of these initiatives. 
 
 (d) Fair value estimation  
 
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and 
measurement or for disclosure purposes. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets 
(such as publicly traded available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the reporting 
date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is the closing bid price.  
 
11. Management of capital 
 
The Company’s objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate levels of funding to support 
exploration and development of its properties and to maintain corporate and administrative functions.  
 
The Company manages its capital structure in a manner that provides sufficient funding for mineral 
exploration and operational activities. Funds are primarily secured through issuance of common share 
capital. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to continue adequate funding of its 
business in this manner.  
 
12. Subsequent events 
 
On February 1, 2009 600,000 common share purchase stock options, with an exercise price of $0.25 per 
common share, expired unexercised (see note 6 (b)). 
 
On April 2, 2009, the Company signed a letter of intent with Goldeye to acquire the 50% interest in the 
McFaulds Lake joint venture not already owned by the Company, in exchange for issuing a total of 
11,671,500 of its common shares to Goldeye, the payment of $115,000 in cash, settlement of $85,000 in 
accounts payable and the retention by Goldeye of a 1 percent net-smelter-returns royalty (subject to 
adjustment) in the property. On April 22, 2009, the formal letter of agreement was signed. The transaction 
is conditional upon the Company raising $1,500,000 by June 29, 2009 and both parties closing the 
transaction by July 7, 2009. All prior agreements with Goldeye will be terminated.
