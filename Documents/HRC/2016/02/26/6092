<p>A/HRC/8/WG.<footnote name="2">3. In a statement on behalf of the African Group, the observer for Egypt highlighted key 
elements of Human Rights Council resolution 4/4 referring to it as a strong vote of confidence in 
the task force. The representative expressed the Group&#8217;s support for geographic and thematic 
expansion within MDG 8, particularly on technology transfer. He further noted that the process 
of progressively refining the criteria should better reflect the principles of the right to 
development and, at the end of phase III of the Work Plan mandated by the Working Group (see 
A/HRC/4/47, paras. 53-54, on its Work Plan), the international community will be in a position 
to start the drafting process of a Convention on the Right to Development.

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its fifth session, in February 2004, the Working Group on the Right to Development 
recommended to the Commission on Human Rights that it establish a high-level task force on the 
implementation of the right to development, in order to assist it in fulfilling its mandate as 
reflected in paragraph 10 (a) of Commission resolution 1998/7. At its eighth session, in 
February 2007, the Working Group recommended to the Council to extend its own mandate and 
the mandate of the high-level task force for a further period of two years (see A/HRC/4/47, 
para. 58). 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 4/4 of 30 March 2007, the Human Rights Council decided to renew the 
mandates of the Working Group and the high-level task force for a period of two years, 
requested the Working Group to convene for an annual period of five days and to present its 
reports to the Council and requested the task force to convene for seven days annually and 
present its reports to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>3. The high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development convened its 
fourth session in Geneva from 7 to 15 January 2008. As requested by the Working Group, the 
mandate of the task force was to consider the criteria for periodic evaluation of global 
development partnerships - as identified in Millennium Development Goal 8 (MDG 8) - from the 
perspective of the right to development (&#8220;the right to development criteria&#8221;), and in an initial 
phase covering the year of 2007, deepen its study on the three development partnerships 
considered at its third session, as well as take up an additional partnership, with a view to 
refining the right to development criteria and corresponding sub-criteria (A/HRC/4/47, para. 54). 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ORGANIZATION OF THE SESSION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>4. The high-level task force (&#8220;task force&#8221;) was opened by Maria Francisca Ize-Charrin, 
Director, Operations, Programmes and Research Division, Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), followed by Doru Costea, President of the 
Human Rights Council, who made a statement referring to the fact that the task force&#8217;s meeting 
is the first of the year marking the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. He underlined the importance and universality of the right to development and called for 
a pragmatic and constructive engagement in addressing its realization. Arjun Sengupta (India), 
who was elected in September 2007 as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on the 
Right to Development, also made a statement highlighting the recent achievements of the task 
force and the Working Group and the need to make the right-to-development criteria applicable 
and widely acceptable, while defining obligations in a step-by-step process of consensus 
building. In conclusion, he introduced the expert and institutional members of the task force. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>5. At its first meeting, on 7 January 2008, the task force elected by acclamation 
Stephen Marks (United States of America) as Chairperson-Rapporteur. Mr. Marks<b> </b>highlighted 
the importance of the work of the task force in transforming the right-to-development agenda 
from aspiration to development practice, thereby transcending the political debate. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.<footnote name="2">2. In a statement on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the observer 
for Pakistan called for effective international cooperation, the creation of an international 
enabling environment, including a fair trade regime, as well as broader participation of 
developing countries in international economic decision-making. He also noted the role of a 
rights-based approach to development in catalyzing the achievement of internationally agreed 
developmental objectives, including the MDGs, the importance of identifying innovative sources 
of financing for development in order to achieve sustainable development and the need to 
remove the constraints placed on development by certain aspects of Trade-Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement and other technology control regimes. 
</footnote>/TF/2

</p>
<p><b>C.  Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the same meeting, the task force adopted its agenda (A/HRC/8/WG.<footnote name="2">1. In a statement on behalf of the European Union (EU) and associated countries, the 
observer for Slovenia noted the usefulness of evaluating global development partnerships, while 
indicating the need for improving the criteria, and called for more focus on MDG 8 issues and 
partnerships involving other regions. The observer concluded by expressing hope that the task 
force adopt a gradual approach based on rigorous empirical analysis and the constructive 
consolidation of its findings in a phased manner. She also referred to the importance of applying 
a gender perspective to the implementation of the right to development and a holistic human 
rights-based approach. 
</footnote>/TF/1; see also 
annex I) and programme of work.

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.<footnote name="2">0. In a statement on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and China, the observer 
for Cuba reiterated NAM&#8217;s call for the elevation of the right to development to the same level as 
all other human rights and its operationalization, including the elaboration of an internationally </footnote>/TF/2

</p>
<p><b>E.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>14. The task force had before it a number of pre-session and background documents to inform 
its deliberations (see annex III). 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Statements by institutional members and observers 
</b></p>
<p>15. The World Bank representative reiterated that while the Bank has no formal position on 
the right to development, it supports the right to development criteria, welcomes their 
progressive development into operational tools and endorses the principles underlying the 
Declaration on the Right to Development. She also provided examples of synergies between the 
criteria and World Bank activities, including a research project on human rights indicators, the 
Bank&#8217;s co-chairing of the Human Rights Task Team of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC), the Human 
Rights Impact Assessment Tool developed by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and 
the proposed Human Rights Trust Fund Initiative. The representative suggested that the further 
refinement of the right to development criteria focus on identifying their practical benefits and 
explaining in empirical terms how human rights benefit the development processes and 
outcomes. 
</p>
<p>16. The UNDP representative expressed interest in the efforts to include human rights, and 
specifically the right to development, more systematically within the partnerships set up to 
contribute to achieve the MDGs. UNDP&#8217;s work in the area of MDG 8, included the co-chairing 
of the United Nations MDG Gap Task Force and a project with the Overseas Development 
Institute of the United Kingdom&#8217;s Department for International Development to map MDG 8 
impact at a country level and define indicators for MDG 8. The right to development criteria 
have revealed many relevant insights, but need to be refined. The task force can explore whether 
it is relevant to assess the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations, the Heavily Indebted 
Poor Countries initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. 
</p>
<p>17. The UNCTAD representative expressed support for the work of the task force in the 
refinement of the criteria, noting the importance of this task for the purpose of building on the 
consensus that had been achieved within the Working Group at its last session. 
</p>
<p>18. While noting that it does not have a human rights mandate, the IMF representative stated 
that the Fund&#8217;s objectives of promoting high levels of employment and macroeconomic stability 
contribute to an agenda that fosters human rights. 
</p>
<p>19. The WTO representative referred to the challenges facing the Doha Round development 
agenda and debates within the WTO surrounding Aid for Trade and highlighted the WTO&#8217;s 
intention to continue its dialogue with the task force and the Working Group.

The task force also heard a presentation by Xigen Wang, resource person, who described an 
ongoing research project to assess the right to development in China. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS 
</b></p>
<p>27. The task force focused successively on each of the four partnerships reviewed in 2007, 
with presentations by task force members on missions undertaken and by the consultants on their 
studies on those partnerships, followed by discussions including observers. The three days of 
public deliberations concluded with a discussion on the assessments of the aforementioned 
partnerships, a preliminary presentation of partnerships to be reviewed in phase II of the 
Work Plan and a preliminary discussion of phase III of the Work Plan. The task force then met 
for four days in closed meetings to review and refine the criteria and to discuss and adopt its 
report. 
</p>
<p>28. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced the four partnerships to which the right to 
development criteria were applied: the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM); the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) Mutual 
Review of Development Effectiveness in the context of the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s 
Development (NEPAD) (&#8220;Mutual Review&#8221; or MRDE); the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness; and the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between EU and African, Caribbean and 
Pacific Countries (ACP) (Cotonou Agreement). 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The African Peer Review Mechanism 
</b></p>
<p>29. Margaret Sekaggya, task force member, presented the report of the technical mission of the 
task force (for task force texts, see annex III) for the follow-up assessment of APRM, which was 
undertaken from 12 to 16 October 2007, in Addis Ababa. The technical mission met with 
relevant actors and partners that facilitate, monitor and implement APRM. The mission held 
multiple meetings with the ECA, as well as with African Union (AU) and the APRM secretariat. 
Ms. Sekaggya noted the warm reception for the mission and the officials&#8217; enthusiasm for and the 
commitment to the mechanism and the initial outcomes, while recognizing the challenges 
resulting from capacity constraints and the lengthy and cumbersome process. After elaborating 
on the background of APRM, she presented the concluding observations of the technical mission 
as well as the main follow-up actions for the task force. 
</p>
<p>30. Bronwen Manby, consultant to the task force, presented her report, which noted that 
APRM emerged from the NEPAD programme of the African Union as a specific tool to address 
governance concerns and as a voluntary South-South review. The review process could be

</p>
<p>strengthened from a human rights perspective and the integration of sustainable development 
throughout its framework. Areas of weakness are access to information about its implementation, 
harmonization with other processes, such as Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), and 
monitoring and enforcement of the implementation of the programmes of action. Proposed 
reforms of African Union structures would be an important opportunity to integrate more 
effectively the APRM work with other institutions of the African Union, in particular the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
</p>
<p>31. The Executive Director of APRM Secretariat provided clarifications on APRM with 
respect to the comments in Ms. Manby&#8217;s study. He highlighted the voluntary nature and 
independence of the APRM process, underlined that a country review mission is conducted by 
African experts, while UNDP, ECA and the African Development Bank (ADB) contributed 
input as advisers. Even though it is not spelled out in the questionnaire, sustainability is one of 
the objectives of APRM. Furthermore, PRSPs are part of the review and marginalized groups are 
provided opportunities to voice their concerns. He explained reasons for not making a 
self-assessment report public, referred to APRM interactions with the Pan-African Parliament 
and pointed out the clear distribution of functions between the African Union, NEPAD, and 
APRM. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>32. Nico Schrijver, member of the task force, reported on the technical mission of the task 
force for the follow-up assessment of the Mutual Review, which was undertaken in two steps, on 
13 and 14 September 2007 in Paris, and from 12 to 16 October 2007 in Addis Ababa. He noted 
the constructive engagement of OECD and ECA with the task force and their willingness to have 
their policies reviewed at an international level. Mr. Schrijver highlighted the concluding 
observations of the technical mission and presented the main follow-up actions for the task force. 
</p>
<p>33. Ms. Manby&#8217;s study also addressed the Mutual Review. She noted that a strength of the 
first 2005 review was that it reported both the compliance of developing countries and OECD 
members, with their commitments in the same report. However, it suffered from lack of 
specificity, and as a consequence had not been made use of by the NEPAD Secretariat. The 
study highlighted the benefit of better provision of public information in the process, a more 
detailed focus on African human rights instruments, increased participation and attention to 
developed countries&#8217; compliance. 
</p>
<p>34. Noting that his views do not represent those of the OECD as a whole, the representative of 
OECD stressed that the work of the task force, including the right-to-development criteria was 
useful in OECD&#8217;s approach to the Mutual Review and characterized Ms. Manby&#8217;s report as a 
balanced and fair review which contained useful recommendations to be taken into account in 
the 2008 review process. A dialogue with the task force should be followed up and the mission 
and consultants&#8217; studies should be circulated to OECD and ECA during the next meeting of the 
partners in Addis Ababa in February 2008. 
</p>
<p>35. The discussion that ensued touched upon the objectives of the task force&#8217;s assessment of 
selected partnerships in relation to the criteria; the nature of the criteria; the need to follow up </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>on the technical missions and their methods. Some observers commented positively on the 
consultants&#8217; proposals for the refinement of the criteria. Reference was also made to the 
importance of using the criteria to bring out policy coherence regarding commitments to both the 
human rights and economic objectives of the participating governments and institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Chairperson-Rapporteur, presented the report of the technical mission of the task 
force, undertaken from 13 and 14 September 2007, in Paris, to enter into a dialogue with the 
OECD. The mission met senior officials and also participated in a seminar on the right to 
development. The Chairperson-Rapporteur further highlighted the principal conclusions of the 
report and referred to the conclusions from the Workshop on Development Effectiveness in 
Practice: Applying the Paris Declaration to Advancing Gender Equality, Environmental 
Sustainability and Human Rights, held in Dublin, on 26-27 April 2007, and stated that 2008 
presents itself as an opportunity for dialogue, especially with the forthcoming third High Level 
Forum on Aid Effectiveness, in Accra in September 2008. 
</p>
<p>37. In his presentation of the study, Roberto Bissio, consultant to the task force, argued that the 
Paris Declaration is not a global partnership in itself, but it can contribute to the MDGs indirectly 
when it deals with aid efficiency. The consultant commented on asymmetries and imbalances in 
this process, in favour of developed countries. The Paris Declaration principles are conducive to 
the right to development criteria; however, the corresponding indicators do not strictly relate to 
the principles. In this context, he commented on indicators on ownership, procurement, financial 
management, aid predictability and untied aid. In conclusion, he suggested that a mutual 
accountability mechanism be established at the international level in order to assess the 
performance of donor countries. 
</p>
<p>38. The representative of OECD acknowledged that the consultant raised valid points, 
including risks associated with a narrow focus on aid management and limitations of Paris 
Declaration indicators. The consultant&#8217;s study in certain areas presented a simplistic dichotomy 
between donor and developing countries which did not reflect all the nuances in the context of 
the Paris Declaration. Participation of developing countries and civil society organizations within 
the Paris Declaration process has been evolving and is well institutionalized. 
</p>
<p>39. The representative of the World Bank pointed out that the consultant&#8217;s study did not take 
note of the extensive work of the Human Rights Task Team of the OECD-DAC on human rights 
and aid effectiveness and stated that even though human rights are not referred to explicitly in 
the Paris Declaration, there are synergies between the Paris Declaration principles and human 
rights which highlight their mutually reinforcing potential. The representative also emphasized 
the importance of clarifying the value added of human rights in empirical and practical terms. 
</p>
<p>40. During the discussions observers referred to need for a cost-benefit analysis of the 
harmonization and alignment principles of the Paris Declaration, the implications for the poorest 
of a decision to withhold health-related aid due to lack of absorbing capacity in a recipient 
country, and the significance of the power imbalances for realizing the right to development. </p>

</p>
<p><b>D. Cotonou Partnership Agreement between European Union (EU) 
and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries 
</b></p>
<p>41. Nico Schrijver, member of the task force, presented a report of the technical mission of the 
task force for the preliminary assessment of the Cotonou Agreement undertaken from 19 to 
21 September 2007 in Brussels, to interact and promote dialogue with relevant actors, including 
the European Commission (EC), the ACP secretariat and civil society organizations and experts. 
The Cotonou Agreement has unique, far-reaching and multilateral features, covering a wide 
range of regions and topics, including development, political dialogue, trade, migration, 
investment, and participation of civil society. Although the Agreement contains provisions on 
human rights, the right to development is not mentioned expressly. Nevertheless, both the 
Agreement and the practice based thereon contain various relevant elements. Mr. Schrijver 
reviewed examples of both positive measures (&#8220;incentives&#8221;, additional assistance) and negative 
measures (sanctions, suspending aid) of EU-ACP human rights policies. He also gave an 
overview of the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), which are being negotiated between 
the EU and regional groupings of ACP countries, referring to concerns raised regarding the 
extent to which the agreements respect the ownership of ACP countries, as well as the extent of 
stakeholders&#8217; participation and information sharing in the process of conclusion of EPAs. 
Mr. Schrijver presented the preliminary observations and conclusions of the mission. 
42. On behalf of James Thuo Gathii, consultant to the task force who had been unable to travel 
to Geneva, the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the task force read out the summary and conclusions 
of the consultant&#8217;s study. EPAs are being negotiated under conditions that undermine the full 
participation of ACP countries in determining their development objectives and may result, at 
least in the short run, in revenue losses and restricted access to the EU market, making it highly 
likely that the social and economic human rights of millions will be adversely affected. Other 
human rights concerns include expanding negotiations into new areas such as competition and 
government procurement, imposing a heavy cost burden on ACP countries that far outweighs the 
potential dynamic benefits that the new commitments will require. EPA negotiations on trade 
need to take into account the special needs of developing and least developed countries, 
particularly the need for preferential treatment in trade relations which are increasingly becoming 
the dominant pillar of EU-ACP relations. Human rights, in particular the right to development, 
ought to take centre stage in EPA negotiations as well as in EU development cooperation. The 
right-to-development criteria could play a crucial role in the measurement of the partnership in 
general and the EPAs in particular. 
</p>
<p>43. The representatives of the EC provided background information on the Cotonou 
Agreement and the EPAs and clarified a number of issues raised in the consultant&#8217;s study. The 
EC representative stressed that at the conclusion of the Agreement in 2000 all parties had 
accepted the expiration of the waiver of WTO-compatibility at the end of 2007 and that EPAs 
were needed to replace that waiver, which has not had the desired effect, especially on 
investment in sub-Saharan Africa. He also explained why it was not feasible to request new 
exemptions from WTO obligations and why a region-by-region approach had been taken in 
concluding EPAs. The EC representative responded to the criticism of the EPAs based on the 
lost tariff income and lost policy space of the ACP countries by referring to the actions that 
States can take to address these issues. The EC maintained that any additional resources to cover </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>adjustment costs would be met by initiatives such as Aid for Trade, which amounts to about 
2 billion euros for ACP countries and about 1 billion euros by 2010 in bilateral assistance. A 
number of points in the consultant&#8217;s study were misleading and led to wrong conclusions, 
including the strong criticism of the European Common Agricultural Policy, indicating that 
EPAs completely opened the European markets to ACP products. It was also pointed out that a 
number of provisions in EPAs contribute to increased transparency and better governance and 
that, overall, the agreements will have a positive economic impact, while recognizing that the 
process could have benefited from broader consultations and civil society participation. The 
representatives of the EC also provided further clarifications on technical questions which had 
been raised, including those related to rules of origin reforms, and outlined the measures taken 
by the EC to address the disparities between negotiating partners. 
</p>
<p>44. The representative of UNDP noted the importance of support for trade capacity 
development and especially support targeted at productive sectors and referred to bottlenecks in 
areas like technology and technology transfer, and market access. He also referred to monitoring 
and evaluation as one area of weakness of aid for trade arrangements, which is mainly based on 
self-assessment. In UNDP&#8217;s view, trade and trade liberalization are not ends in themselves but 
can lead to poverty reduction and development. 
</p>
<p>45. During the ensuing discussion, the absence of ACP secretariat representatives to present 
their perspective was regretted. Reference was made to the economic vulnerabilities of many 
ACP countries. Comments and discussion focused on whether the agreement promotes a human 
rights-based approach to development, the place of intellectual property protection in 
negotiations, and the impact of the work of transnational corporations involved in extractive 
industries on natural resources and the environment in Africa. Particular attention was paid to the 
usefulness of development benchmarks and the need for a consistent review and assessment of 
the implications and the impact of the EPAs as well as the need to have measures in place to 
confront any possible developmental shortfalls. It was noted that it is too early to judge the 
impact of EPAs, but that the task force should undertake an analysis of their developmental 
aspects.  
</p>
<p><b>E. Preliminary discussion of phase II of the Work Plan: 
additional partnerships in the context of MDG 8 
</b></p>
<p>46. As mandated by the Working Group, the task force discussed additional partnerships in the 
context of MDG 8 to be considered in phase II. The Chairperson-Rapporteur suggested the task 
force consider Target 17 of MDG 8, as one of the thematic areas of global partnership which 
would also allow a right-to-development review of the trade dimension of intellectual property 
rights and health. A right to development focus on Target 17 could also incorporate the work of 
WHO, UNDP, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, the World Bank, and public-private 
partnerships involving the pharmaceutical industry. The representative of the WHO welcomed 
the proposal and possible future collaboration with the task force and elaborated on the linkage 
between access to medicines and the right to health as well as human rights-based approach to 
health in the work of WHO. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>47. In the discussion of a Target 17 thematic focus, task force members and observers tackled 
the question of which global partnership would be most appropriate for review in accord with the 
task force&#8217;s mandate. Reference was made to: discussions within the WTO on the right to health, 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Global Alliance for Vaccines 
and Immunization. Additionally, the idea was presented that the WHO convene a meeting of 
relevant stakeholders during which these partnerships might be explored. Observers also 
mentioned debt burden, migration, environment, and post-conflict peacebuilding as possible 
areas of thematic expansion. 
</p>
<p>48. In order to expand the regional scope of the partnerships, Jorge Vargas Gonzalez, task 
force member, presented on possible partnerships within Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Mr. Vargas explored the following possible entry points: the Organization of American States 
(OAS), benefiting from a dialogue with its regional mechanisms on human rights; the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which is one of the most important partners for 
development in Latin America and the Caribbean and is taking important initiatives concerning 
debt reduction and climate change; the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) and its 
Meeting of human rights high-level authorities; and finally, the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM). In the discussion, reference was also made by Mr. Schrijver to the consideration of 
other regions, especially, Asia, in view of the recent adoption of the Charter of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including provisions relating to the promotion of respect for 
human rights. The representatives for the Philippines and Thailand explained that it was too soon 
to consider the ASEAN Charter, which has only just been adopted and that the status and 
mandate of the human rights body would be the subject of future negotiations. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>49. Having completed the deliberations at the public and private segments of the fourth 
session, and taking into account the findings of the technical missions, the independent expert 
studies and the views of the delegations and other observers, the task force has reached the 
following conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>A. Concluding observations on the initial pilot applications 
of the criteria to the three partnerships presented at its 
third session 
</b></p>
<p>50. The initial pilot application of the criteria to the African Peer Review Mechanism, the 
ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness in the context of the New 
Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, began 
with constructive dialogue established with representatives of the institutions responsible for 
these partnerships during the task force&#8217;s third session and has benefited from a deeper 
exploration of the issues during technical missions. The task force considered these missions 
essential for its continued dialogue with the three partnerships, in order to explore perceived 
strengths and weaknesses from the perspective of the criteria and to draw lessons for the 
operationalization of the right to development. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/WG.2/TF/2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>51. The task force did not approach the application of the criteria as a process of judging the 
performance of partnerships against a &#8220;scorecard&#8221;, but rather as a constructive dialogue with 
them about concrete commitments congruent with the right to development, identifying possible 
entry points for introducing relevant features of this right. In order to assist the partners, the task 
force encouraged incremental change in partners&#8217; policies and activities. The technical missions 
indicated a willingness on the part of partners to consider, over time and based on further 
collaboration with the task force, the application of the criteria to such complex issues as 
ownership, mutual accountability, and reciprocal responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>52. The observations and findings of the three technical missions, supported by 
independent expert studies, confirmed many of the tentative assessments made at the 
third session of the task force, as to conformity with the criteria. The relevant findings are as 
follows. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) 
</b>53. The APRM has the potential to be a novel model of monitoring African governance. While 
not, in the strict sense, a global partnership under MDG 8, this South-South partnership preserves 
the autonomy and the voluntary nature of State participation, while replacing conditionality 
imposed by donor countries with accountability among peers and responsibility at the national 
level to assume ownership through independent national governing councils, and national focal 
points. The APRM secretariat, the Panel of Eminent Persons, and national institutions and 
research centres which administer the questionnaire perform essential functions to control the 
accuracy and thoroughness of national reporting and lend credibility and legitimacy to the 
process. The level of popular participation in its reviews comes closer to meeting the right to 
development criteria than any of the partnerships the task force has studied. However, the APRM 
should make efforts to improve access to information about its processes both at a national and 
regional level and improve follow-up and implementation of the Programme of Action, which 
should be costed, time-bound and aligned with existing development strategies. 
</p>
<p>54. The African Union (AU), NEPAD, APRM and African human rights institutions need to 
work together to achieve institutional cohesion. APRM serves as a partnership supporting 
implementation of the right to development and should relate directly to the African human 
rights institutions (the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the African Court 
and national human rights institutions). The full range of human rights should be taken into 
account, drawing on all African and international norms and standards, including the right to 
development and other human rights under the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. 
In particular, more detailed reporting on freedom of expression, assembly, association and access 
to information, as well as election management and non-discrimination, should be explicitly and 
systematically integrated into the APRM process. 
</p>
<p>55. The task force wishes to continue dialogue with key partners, examine country 
self-assessments, country reviews and the implementation of National Programmes of Action, 
as well as establish contact with national and regional African human rights institutions. </p>

</p>
<p><b>2.  Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Mutual Review of Development Effectiveness (MRDE) process is a biennial 
instrument for monitoring and assessing development progress in Africa and its OECD 
development partners relative to their shared goals and commitments including MDGs, in 
support of the NEPAD. The partnership complies in large measure with several 
right-to-development criteria, in particular, those related to national ownership, accountability 
and sustainability. However, participation in the process poses a special challenge as there is at 
present no stakeholder or civil society participation. The governance component of the Mutual 
Review is a useful entry point for integrating reference to applicable human rights instruments. 
The first review (MRDE I) in 2005 did not pay particular attention to the position and needs of 
the most marginalized groups in the countries under review. 
</p>
<p>57. The preparation of the second Mutual Review on Development Effectiveness report 
in 2008 (MRDE 2) offers a special opportunity to address the above-mentioned issues and 
increase attention to human rights and the right to development. That report should aim for 
greater specificity than the first report, and pay particular attention to reporting and analysing 
compliance with existing commitments by both African and OECD countries. 
</p>
<p>58. The task force believes it would be helpful to participate in a review of the various 
documents that will be prepared leading up to MRDE 2, in June 2008, in consultation with 
OECD and ECA. The task force is willing to provide input for the preparation of the report. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>59. The importance of aid effectiveness for MDG 8 is highlighted by progress indicators 33 
to 37 under Target 15. Technical aspects of efficiency and lack of mutual accountability are 
predominant in the Paris Declaration, although the task force believes there are opportunities to 
build on the congruence between the principles of aid effectiveness and the right to development. 
The task force felt that ownership under the Paris Declaration required greater efforts to promote 
untied aid aligned with national priorities, particularly in the fields of procurement and financial 
management. There is a danger that the political momentum around the Paris Declaration might 
detract attention from the need to build global development partnerships under MDG 8. The 
Paris Declaration does not adequately address the asymmetries in power. Institutional ownership 
rests by and large with OECD-DAC and the World Bank, while developing countries have a 
limited voice. Though the principles of the Paris Declaration are consistent with human rights, 
several of the indicators and targets can work in practice against the right to development and 
erode national democratic processes. The willingness of the OECD to adjust these deficiencies 
was welcomed and the task force felt it should follow developments on this issue. 
</p>
<p>60. The task force should contribute to efforts to include human rights and 
right-to-development considerations in the preparation and round tables of the High Level Forum 
on Aid Effectiveness to be held in Accra in September 2008. In this approach, there is a distinct 
advantage to build on the Dublin workshop and work with the Human Rights Task Team of 
OECD-DAC, which shares the task force&#8217;s concern to reinforce human rights in aid 
effectiveness. The task force should also consult the United Nations Development Group 
(UNDG) through its Working Group on Aid Effectiveness, as well as the OECD-DAC Working 
Party on Aid Effectiveness. </p>

</p>
<p><b>B.  Preliminary review of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement 
between European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and 
Pacific (ACP) countries 
</b></p>
<p>61. Pursuant to the proposal of the presidency of the EU during the third session of the task 
force, the Working Group mandated the task force to give priority to the Cotonou Agreement.<b>2</b> 
The cooperation under the agreement encompasses a wide range of policy fields, including 
human rights, good governance, environmental conservation and peacebuilding. 
</p>
<p>62. Although the assessment of this partnership is still at an early stage, the technical mission 
provided an opening for further dialogue on the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, in 
light of its various pillars. Active and fruitful dialogue has also been initiated with various actors, 
such as the European Commission (EC), the ACP secretariat and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>63. The task force has identified a clear link between the Cotonou Agreement and the 
right-to-development framework and criteria. While the right to development is not explicitly 
referred to in the Cotonou Agreement, certain core elements are reflected in it.<b>3</b> The right to 
development criteria relating to an enabling environment and explicit incorporation of human 
rights principles in the partnership reveal gaps in the agreement and highlight the value of impact 
assessments, especially as regards gender equality and marginalized groups. The task force 
believes more attention should be paid to the mutually-reinforcing obligations of the Cotonou 
Agreement and the right-to-development criteria. 
</p>
<p>64. The task force favours development monitoring benchmarks in the Economic Partnership 
Agreements (EPAs), currently in the process of being negotiated or concluded. Other concerns of 
the task force include ownership by the ACP countries of their development processes, the 
continued special and differential treatment of ACP countries in the EPAs, and the impact of the 
latter on the least developed countries and on vulnerable communities within ACP States. In the 
view of the task force, there should be adequate recognition of the need for country-specific 
adjustment compensation and for additional resources for trade capacity-building, and for 
independent monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, the task force is concerned about non-tariff 
barriers to trade such as overly restrictive sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers 
to trade and rules of origin procedures. 
</p>
<p>65. During meetings at the EC and with the ACP secretariat, it became clear that more in-depth 
assessment of Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) as well as EPAs and their relationship to the 
human rights provisions in the Cotonou Agreement is required. Therefore, further dialogue 
should take place with relevant officials in the EC Directorate-General for Development, the 
Directorate-General for Trade, Europe Aid, and the ACP secretariat, as well as civil society 
organizations that have been identified as future contacts.

</p>
<p><b>C. Progressive development and refinement of the criteria for 
periodic evaluation of global partnerships for development 
from the perspective of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>66. The task force has drawn several lessons from applying the right to development criteria to 
four partnerships through a dialogue with the institutions responsible for them and confirms the 
conclusion of the Working Group that &#8220;the application of the criteria has provided the empirical 
basis for their progressive development and refinement&#8221;.<b>4</b> The task force has learned from the 
experience with the technical missions that it is important to find ways and means of enhancing 
the criteria as a practical tool for evaluating global development partnerships from the 
perspective of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>67. The constant concern of the task force for the quality of the criteria has been echoed by its 
institutional members, Member States, as well as the agencies responsible for the partnerships 
reviewed so far. The Working Group requested the task force to review the structure of the 
criteria, their coverage of aspects of international cooperation and the methodology for their 
application with a view to enhancing their effectiveness as a practical tool for evaluating global 
partnerships,<b>5 </b>and eventually lead to &#8220;the elaboration and implementation of a comprehensive 
and coherent set of standards&#8221;<b>6</b> and present it with corresponding sub-criteria in phase III of its 
work (2009). At this stage of its work, the task force is responding to the request by the Working 
Group that it &#8220;progressively develop and further refine the criteria, based on actual practice&#8221;.<b>7 </b> 
</p>
<p>68. The task force has therefore drafted the list in annex II as a progressive development of the 
criteria, which maintains essentially the same content, while reordering, clarifying and 
developing them based on lessons learned from applying the criteria so far. The list in annex II 
represents an intermediary stage for use in phase II of its work (2008) and anticipates a more 
significant refinement in phase III (2009).<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>69. In order to achieve the desired level of quality, the task force considers that the criteria 
must (a) become analytically and methodologically rigorous; (b) provide empirically oriented 
tools to those involved in implementing development partnerships that can improve the 
outcomes of their work in light of their respective mandates; (c) integrate analytical work done 
by expert groups within the World Bank, OECD, UNDP, UNCTAD, UNICEF, UNESCO, the 
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, OHCHR, and others, as well as 
academic research centres, and (d) provide guidance so that global partnerships for development

</p>
<p>are enabled to respond better to the broader objectives of the right to development. With respect 
to item (c) above, the task force welcomed the information provided by UNDP on the MDG Gap 
Task Force,<b>9</b> and the country level mappings of the Global Partnership for Development (a joint 
UNDP-DFID-ODI project) and regards these initiatives as demonstrating the need for and 
seeking to provide rigorous qualitative and quantitative tools in dealing with MDG 8 and broader 
global partnership for development.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>70. For these reasons, the task force considers that a proper refinement of the criteria could 
best be carried out through an expert consultation, and drawing upon the expertise and 
experience of its institutional members and academic researchers. In this way, the task force 
could better meet the expectations of the Working Group that it &#8220;provide a consistent mapping of 
the criteria and relevant checklists, viewing the latter as operational sub-criteria&#8221;.<b>11</b> The outcome 
of the consultation could then be applied during phase III (2009) of the task force&#8217;s Work Plan 
and thus allow it to benefit from methodologically-sound criteria and operational sub-criteria in 
order to consolidate its findings and present a revised list of the criteria and operational 
sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p><b>D. Consideration of additional partnerships:  further 
thematic and regional expansion 
</b></p>
<p>71. In phase II (2008), the task force was requested by the Working Group &#8220;to study additional 
partnerships with a view to broaden its coverage of the regions implementing development 
partnerships, as well as its analysis of thematic issues of international cooperation identified 
under MDG 8&#8221;.<b>12</b> This step-by-step approach would allow the task force to follow up on the 
current four partnerships, in various stages of assessment and initiate evaluation of additional 
partnerships, expanding thematically and geographically. 
</p>
<p>72. The first three partnerships reviewed by the task force have allowed it to focus primarily 
on aid and on Africa, while the examination of the Cotonou Agreement has expanded its work 
thematically to trade and geographically to the Caribbean and Pacific countries. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The inter-agency MDG Gap Task Force has the objective of developing a methodology to 
</p>
<p>systematically track international development commitments, primarily under MDG 8, and their 
fulfilment at the international and country level. It reports to the Secretary-General and suggests 
improvements to the implementation of existing commitments. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  The aim of the initiative is to design and pilot a tool to systematically map the ways in which 
a range of global issues impact on poverty, in particular country contexts.

</p>
<p>73. For phase II of its Work Plan, the task force proposes to continue to follow developments 
relating to the three partnerships considered in phase I and assess more thoroughly the Cotonou 
Agreement. 
</p>
<p><b>1. MDG Target 17:  Access to affordable essential drugs 
in developing countries 
</b></p>
<p>74. Target 17 reads &#8220;in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to 
affordable essential drugs in developing countries&#8221;. At its second session (2005), the task force 
considered this target<b>13</b> and welcomed the adoption of general comment No. 17 (2005) by the 
Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and considered that further reflection was 
needed on the complex relationship between intellectual property and human rights with a view 
to identifying criteria for the periodic evaluation of this aspect of MDG 8.<b>14</b> At its current session 
the task force felt it was appropriate to take up Target 17 during phase II of its Work Plan, not 
only to address intellectual property but also because health figures prominently throughout the 
MDGs.<b>15</b> It is significant that, as noted by the Working Group on Access to Essential Medicines 
of the Millennium Project&#8217;s Task Force on HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB and Access to Essential 
Medicines, &#8220;The lack of access to life-saving and health-supporting medicines for an estimated 
2 billion poor people stands as a direct contradiction to the fundamental principle of health as a 
human right.&#8221;<b>16 </b>Moreover, the examination of Target 17 would also allow the task force to apply 
the criteria to an important dimension of international trade, namely, the intellectual property 
regime both through the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO and numerous bilateral and regional free 
trade agreements. 
</p>
<p>75. The pertinence of the subject is further underscored by the work of the Special Rapporteur 
on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental heath, who has prepared draft &#8220;Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies 
in Relation to Access to Medicines&#8221;,<b>17 </b>and by various advocacy and research initiatives.<b>18</b>

<p>76. The task force proposes to explore, during a working session, progress made in realizing 
Target 17 from the perspective of the right to development criteria in the activities of key 
partnerships of the private sector (pharmaceutical companies), governments, and multilateral 
agencies (e.g. WHO, WTO, UNICEF, UNAIDS, UNDP, OHCHR, the World Bank). In this 
regard, the WHO can be approached, as co-convenor of the High-Level Forum on the Health 
MDGs, and in light of the special position of its Department of Medicines Policy and Standards, 
in relation to Target 17, to convene such a working session. The task force considers that these 
issues would be best addressed through two separate sessions: one dealing with procurement and 
pricing issues and involving primarily public-private partnerships, with relevant multilateral 
initiatives,<b>19 </b>and the second devoted to trade-related aspects of intellectual property protection 
under the TRIPS agreement of WTO and bilateral and regional free trade agreements, involving 
relevant institutions.<b>20 </b>These sessions would also provide an opportunity for the Special 
Rapporteur to present his guidelines to the stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  MDG 8, Targets 13 and 15:  Debt relief and sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>77. At its first session, the task force considered a heavy debt burden as a major obstacle for 
poor developing countries in achieving the MDGs and in meeting their obligations under the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<b>21</b> It considered the matter 
further at its second session deeming it necessary to define debt sustainability within a State 
context with a view to attaining a level of debt that allows countries to achieve the MDGs and 
avoid an increase in debt ratios by 2015 and agreed that poverty reduction and promotion and 
protection of human rights should be key considerations in finding solutions for debt 
sustainability.<b>22</b> Finally, it considered that a State&#8217;s obligation to service national debt had to

<p>take sufficiently into account national priorities of human development and poverty reduction, 
consistent with its human rights obligations and the need to maintain trust in the financing 
system.<b>23 </b>The importance of the issue is underscored by MDG Target 13,<b>24 </b>and Target 15.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>78. The task force is aware of the experience of the two phases of the HIPC initiative and the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and of other facilities dealing with debt relief. For its 
current Work Plan, it sees the advantage of combining its interest in this issue with its 
geographical expansion and taking up the experience of the IDB with debt relief. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Latin America and the Caribbean - Targets 12, 13 and 15 
</b></p>
<p>79. Regarding the regional expansion of the application of right to development criteria to 
global development partnerships, the task force has identified the following partnerships and 
institutions within Latin America and the Caribbean and hopes to begin a constructive dialogue 
moving on to future assessments.  
</p>
<p>80. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is the oldest and largest regional bank and 
one of the main sources of multilateral financing for development in the Latin America and the 
Caribbean. The task force takes note of IDB&#8217;s work on debt, regional integration and human 
development, as well as on the environment. The Southern Cone Common Market 
(MERCOSUR) constitutes a regional trade agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and 
Uruguay with potential new and associate members. Although a trade agreement, MERCOSUR 
also pursues a development agenda. The task force also takes note of the work being done with 
the Meeting of High Level Authorities on Human Rights within MERCOSUR. 
</p>
<p>81. These potential partnerships should be viewed within the wider context of the 
Inter-American system and global cooperation. Particularly relevant are the Organization of 
American States (OAS) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and 
the Caribbean (ECLAC). The OAS has a long tradition in human rights with an established 
regional system of human rights promotion and protection.<b>26</b> The Charter of the OAS contains 
several principles of the right to development and specifically promotes development of States in 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>24
</b>  This target reads: &#8220;Address the special needs of the least developed countries. Includes: tariff 
</p>
<p>and quota free access for least developed countries&#8217; exports; enhanced programme of debt relief 
for HIPCs and cancellation of official bilateral debt; and more generous ODA for countries 
committed to poverty reduction.&#8221; 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  This target reads: &#8220;Deal comprehensively with the debt problems of developing countries 
through national and international measures in order to make debt sustainable in the long term.&#8221;

<p>a framework of human rights.<b>27</b> ECLAC has a long record of influencing economic development 
policies and has embraced most recently a vision of development based on social cohesion and 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>82. Other regional instruments which may be examined at a later stage of the task force&#8217;s work 
include the recently adopted ASEAN Charter and the Arab Charter for Human Rights, 
containing an explicit article on the right to development, which is expected to enter into force 
soon. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The task force has reordered and slightly developed the list of criteria in light of 
lessons from their application and recommends their approval, as they appear in annex II. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The task force recommends that a dialogue continue with partners of the African 
Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), the ECA/OECD-DAC Mutual Review of Development 
Effectiveness (MRDE), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and the Cotonou 
Partnership Agreement between ACP countries and the EU. It further recommends (a) a 
second round of technical missions for the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and the 
APRM; (b) participation, subject to an invitation, at the third High Level Forum on Aid 
Effectiveness at Accra in September 2008; and (c) providing input as appropriate to 
MRDE 2. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>For phase II, the task force recommends devoting attention to the region of 
Latin America and the Caribbean, and to expand thematically under MDG 8 to the issues 
of essential medicines (Target 17), debt relief (Targets 13 and 15), and trading and 
financial systems (Target 12): 
 (a) The task force proposes to examine the role of key multilateral and 
public-private initiatives in implementing Target 17 relating to access to affordable 
essential drugs in developing countries. This dialogue would involve partnerships focused 
on procurement and pricing as well as on trade-related aspects of intellectual property 
protection in the WTO and bilateral and regional free trade agreements involving relevant 
institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The task force therefore recommends to the Working Group that it encourage 
the task force to explore with WHO and relevant institutions identified, the possibilities of 
organizing a working session or other suitable method to collect information on the 
application of the right to development criteria to Target 17 with a view to identifying the 
strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to advancing this target, benefiting from 
the draft Guidelines of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental heath;

</b>  In particular, see article 17 and chapter VII of the revised OAS Charter which includes 
</p>
<p>references to the right to development and integral development. </p>

</p>
<p><b> (c) As part of its geographical expansion into the region of Latin America and the 
Caribbean, the task force recommends that it study the work of the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) on debt under Target 15 as well as other relevant programmes 
for sustainable development. Alternatively, it could study MERCOSUR in the context of 
Target 12. 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> In view of the essential role and valuable contribution to its work, the task force 
recommends continuing and reinforcing the active participation of international financial 
and development institutions, including the World Bank, UNDP, IMF, UNCTAD, and 
WTO, as well as other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the 
United Nations. Further, it recommends that for the technical missions relating to phases II 
and III of its work, the involvement of regional development banks, economic integration 
and human rights institutions be actively encouraged. </b></p>

<p><b>CRITERIA FOR PERIODIC EVALUATION OF GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT 
PARTNERSHIPS FROM A RIGHT TO DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVE 
</b></p>
<p>(as revised by the task force at its fourth session)<b>a</b> 
</p>
<p> To facilitate their application, the criteria remain organized in three groups related to 
development partnerships: structure and institutional framework, process and outcome. 
</p>
<p><b>Structure/institutional frameworkb 
</b></p>
<p><i>The extent to which a partnership: 
</i></p>
<p>(a) Contributes to creating an enabling environment for sustainable development and the 
realization of all human rights;<b>c</b> 
</p>
<p>(b) Draws on all relevant international human rights instruments, including those relating 
to the right to development, in elaborating the content of development strategies and 
tools for monitoring and evaluating their implementation;<b>d</b> 
</p>
<p>(c) Promotes good governance, democracy and the rule of law and effective 
anti-corruption measures at the national and international levels;<b>e</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>a
</b>  The revision is in response to the request of the Working Group that the task force review the 
</p>
<p>criteria and enhance their effectiveness as a practical tool for evaluating global partnerships, and 
that it &#8220;progressively develop and further refine the criteria, based on actual practice&#8221; 
(A/HRC/4/47, paras. 51 and 55). This version maintains essentially the same content, while 
reordering, clarifying and developing some of them slightly based on lessons learned from 
applying the criteria so far. It represents an intermediary stage for use in phase II of its 
work (2008) and anticipates a more significant refinement of the criteria to be carried out in 
phase III (2009).
