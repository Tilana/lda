<p><b>Summary 
</b> 
</p>
<p>This report presents the findings and recommendations of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders on her mission to Belgrade 
from 17 to 19 September 2007 and to Kosovo on 20 and 21 September 2007. The mission was 
part of a visit to the region that was concluded with a follow-up mission to The former Yugoslav 
</p>
<p>Republic of Macedonia from 23 to 25 September 2007. The findings and recommendations on 
the visit to The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are presented in a separate report.1 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In Serbia, the Special Representative recognized a number of positive developments, 
including a generally non-repressive environment, improved access to information and a vibrant 
community of human rights defenders. She is nevertheless concerned about the hostile 
environment  defenders, particularly those working on transitional justice and minority rights, 
who are constantly under attack, mainly in the media, and portrayed as enemies of the country. 
Public authorities should take concrete steps to give political recognition and legitimacy to 
human rights defenders and their work. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In Kosovo, the question of status dominates the political debate and negatively affects the 
</p>
<p>possibility for human rights defenders to grow and function. Human rights defenders who 
advocate for the status of Kosovo in ways that are critical or distant from the predominant  view 
are marginalized. Others self-censor their activities and positions, especially those critical of the 
authorities, for fear of endangering the decision on status. Deficient accountability mechanisms 
for the actions of the international administration are another major problem that affects the 
possibility of defenders performing their function in defense of human rights and should be 
addressed as a matter of priority.

<p><b>I. VISIT TO SERBIA 
 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report provides an account of the visit to Serbia by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, from 17 to 
19 September 2007. 
 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Representative met the President of the Assembly and other 
</p>
<p>members of the Parliament, the Minister of Justice, the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
representatives of the Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, the 
Ministry of Interior, the Government Agency for Human and Minority Rights, the War Crimes 
Prosecutor, the Public Prosecutor and the head of the first instance criminal department in the 
District Prosecutor&#8217;s office. She also met with the Ombudsperson and the Commissioner for 
Information of Public Importance. 
 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Representative is grateful to the Government of Serbia for extending the 
</p>
<p>invitation to visit the country and for its cooperation during the visit. She nevertheless regrets 
that some of the meetings with public authorities she had requested could not take place. In 
</p>
<p>particular, she was not able to meet the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister. Other 
meetings did not take place at the level she had requested, as in the case of the Minister of 
Interior, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Public Administration and Local Self 
-Government.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Representative met with a wide range of representatives of non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), journalists and individual human rights defenders, as well 
as representatives of the international community. A press conference was held on the final day 
</p>
<p>of the visit. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5. She is particularly grateful to the office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator for 
the support provided during her visit and for the commitment in following up the 
recommendations of this report. 
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p><b>A. A country in transition  
</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, the armed conflicts in the region 
during the 1990s and the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, Serbia faced the multiple 
challenges of State building, democratization and economic transition, whilst also having to deal 
</p>
<p>with the crimes committed under the past regime. In 2000, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
was again admitted into the United Nations and sanctions were lifted. In 2003, the country was 
</p>
<p>reformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and admitted to the Council of Europe. 
However, the pace of democratic reforms slowed down after the assassination of Serbian Prime 
Minister Zoran Djindjic in the same year. In 2006, Montenegro voted for independence in a 
referendum; the State Union was dissolved and Serbia as an independent State adopted a new 
constitution.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. Uncertainties related to the status of Kosovo and European Union (EU) accession 
dominate the political discourse in Serbia. The fragility of the democratic process slows down 
</p>
<p>the advancement of the country in many areas, including and in particular in the area of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8. In 2007, Serbia and the EU initialled a Stabilisation and Association Agreement as a first 
step towards Serbian membership of the EU. However, full cooperation with the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains a condition for its actual signing.2 
 
</p>
<p>9. Political instability and armed conflict limited economic growth and development, and 
poverty still remains a great challenge in Serbia. The unemployment rate is high, especially 
among women and persons with disabilities.3 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. This is the context in which human rights defenders operate and that affects their work 
</p>
<p>both in terms of challenges as well as achievements that can be registered. 
 
</p>
<p>

<b>B. The legal framework on the rights and freedom set forth in the Declaration on the Right 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect 
Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  
</b></p>
<p><b>(Declaration on human rights defenders) 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. Constitutional and international human rights law 
</b> 
</p>
<p>11. Serbia is party to almost all the core international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It has not yet ratified the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families. Serbia is also party to relevant regional human rights treaties, including the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
 
</p>
<p>12. In September 2006, the Serbian National Assembly adopted a new constitution. The 
Constitution contains provisions that generally safeguard the rights and responsibilities 
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Freedoms (Declaration on human rights defenders).4 There was, however, a general 
regret amongst civil society actors that the Special Representative met that there was insufficient 
</p>
<p>public consultation and debate during the drafting phase and several civil society organisations 
criticized the process. It is estimated that just over 50 per cent of voters in a referendum in 
October 2006 favoured the new constitution. 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Freedom of association 
</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Article 55 of the 2006 Constitution of Serbia guarantees freedom of association. 
Currently, NGOs are governed by the 1982 Serbian Law on Associations, the 1989 Serbian Law 
on Foundations and the 1990 federal Law on Associations. These laws are, however, outdated in 
many respects. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 General Assembly resolution 53/144. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 7 
</p>
<p>14. A new draft law on citizens&#8217; associations has been submitted to the Parliament for debate. 
The adoption of this law would be a significant development for civil society, as the draft 
provides for a legal status for civil society organizations, which is a positive step in enhancing 
their legitimacy. The consultative process involving different sectors of civil society undertaken 
during the drafting stages of the law is noted as positive. The Special Representative hopes that 
</p>
<p>this process will result in a law that adheres to existing international human rights standards, 
including the Declaration on human rights defenders. The recommendations of her 2004 report to 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly can be used as guidelines in this area.5 
 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Representative is however concerned to learn that voluntary organizations 
are not exempted from taxation. In her discussions on these issues with representatives from the 
Ministry of Public Administration and Local Self-Government, the Special Representative was 
assured that the Ministry intends recommending the adoption of a tax-free regime for non-profit 
organizations, and she trusts such a system will be introduced in the very near future. 
 
</p>
<p><b>3. Access to information 
</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Access to information is essential for the work of human rights defenders and it is a pillar 
of the transparency that should govern the functioning of democratic public authorities. 
 
</p>
<p>17. The Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance was adopted in 2004. It 
established the office of the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance, an autonomous 
and independent institute receiving complaints if public authorities refuse to provide information 
they should make accessible according to the law. 
 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Representative welcomes the improved access to information for human 
rights defenders due to the work of this institution. The positive role of the Commissioner was 
</p>
<p>consistently recognized by the defenders as fundamental in the implementation of the law and 
the actual realization of the right to access information. One thousand, one hundred and eighty-
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 8 
eight cases of access to information, amounting to 68 per cent of the cases submitted to the 
Commissioner, were resolved by this institution in 2006.6 
 
</p>
<p>19. Challenges that still exist in the realization of the right to access to information include 
the attitude and limited or lacking cooperation of some Governmental bodies. The decisions and 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Commissioner are often not implemented and there is no mechanism to 
enforce these decisions or to sanction Governmental entities that violate the law. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20. The Commissioner is under-resourced and has accumulated a big backlog of cases. The 
Special Representative was told that 21 employees are sanctioned for this office, but there was a 
staff of only six persons at the time of her visit. The reason for this was the shortage of space in 
</p>
<p>the existing premises. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Representative was encouraged by the quality of the work of the 
Commissioner. She hopes that sufficient support will be given to this institution in order for it to 
</p>
<p>continue this important work.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Freedom of assembly 
</b> 
</p>
<p>22. Article 54 of the 2006 Constitution states that &#8220;Citizens may assemble freely.&#8221; The 
constitutional provisions on limitations on assembly are in conformity with international 
standards. The Serbian Public Assembly Act (2005) regulates the exercise of this right in more 
detail. 
 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Representative received information that defenders have normally been able 
</p>
<p>to carry out assemblies without restrictions. However, she also notes the case brought to her 
attention regarding the demonstration in July 2007 staged by the NGO coalition &#8220;Facing the 
</p>
<p>Past&#8221; which was forcibly dispersed by the authorities. 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 Commissioner for Information of Public Importance, &#8220;Report of the Implementation of the Law on Free Access to 
</p>
<p>Information of Public Importance in 2006&#8221;, Belgrade, March 2007.
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 9 
</p>
<p><b>5. Freedom of expression and the media 
</b> 
</p>
<p>24. The right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press is guaranteed by articles 46 
and 50 of the Constitution. 
 
</p>
<p>25. Several independent media organizations operate in Serbia. However, there is an 
environment of political pressure and insecurity for independent journalism. Independent 
journalists and media have experienced threats, attacks and reprisals for publishing views critical 
of the Government. The environment is particularly hostile for reporting on war crimes and past 
abuses. 
 
</p>
<p><b>6. Legislation for the protection of defenders 
</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Article 387, paragraph 2 of the new Serbian Criminal Code of January 2006 (racial and 
other discrimination), identical to article 154 in the previous criminal code, envisages racial and 
other discrimination as a criminal offence, and stipulates that a sentence (a minimum of six 
months but not exceeding five years) shall be imposed on anyone who persecutes organizations 
or individuals for advocating equality among people. 
 
</p>
<p>27. This seems a good provision to protect the human rights defenders attacked for their work 
on equality. However, after consulting with the authorities, the Public Prosecutor, the 
Ombudsperson and several defenders the Special Representative could not find information on 
case law applying this provision. The only NGO which claimed the application of this article in 
about 20 cases provided information to the effect that courts used a narrow interpretation of the 
provision and rejected the complaints.
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Accountability for Human Rights Violations Act, known as the Lustration Law, was 
</p>
<p>adopted in 2003. It covers human rights violations as far back as 1976. However, according to 
the information received by the Special Representative it has still not been implemented.  
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Institutional settings and interaction with defenders 
 </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 10 
<b>1. The Ombudsperson 
</b> 
</p>
<p>29. The law on the Ombudsperson, Law on the Protector of Citizens, was adopted in 
September 2005 and the first Ombudsperson appointed in June 2007 by the Parliament. 
 
</p>
<p>30. The law provides for a comprehensive mandate. The Ombudsperson has the mandate to 
supervise respect for human rights within the administration by controlling the work, acts, 
</p>
<p>failures to act, and decisions of Governmental agencies. The mandate includes the right to 
receive complaints and investigate cases, initiate new laws related to human rights, suggest 
amendments to existing laws, as well as to make suggestions about draft laws submitted to the 
Parliament.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31. The office of the Ombudsperson has yet to become fully operational. The Special 
Representative recommends to the Ombudsperson to establish a close cooperation with human 
rights NGOs, providing them with a channel through which they can communicate concerns and 
</p>
<p>suggestions to the Government. 
 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Representative considers the creation of the office of the Ombudsperson to 
be a positive step forward. The mandate is broad and the institution has the power to undertake a 
wide range of activities. The Special Representative recommends the Government to collaborate 
with and support the work of this institution to allow it deliver the expected results.  
 
</p>
<p><b>2. The Government Agency for Human and Minority Rights  
</b> 
</p>
<p>33. The Government Agency for Human and Minority Rights is the successor of the former 
</p>
<p>Ministry for Human and Minority Rights. It is under the authority of the Prime Minister and its 
mandate includes reporting to international organizations. The Agency is meant to coordinate 
</p>
<p>human rights work across ministries, however, there does not seem to be a system or procedure 
of coordination with the result that implementation of its mandate of has been largely ineffective. 
 
</p>
<p>34. There is no national plan of action or strategy on human rights that guides the 
coordination function of the Agency. This reflects, on the one hand, a lack of commitment to its </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 11 
</p>
<p>mandate and, on the other renders the Agency unable to take a lead role in driving a Government 
human rights agenda. The Special Representative was, however, told that national action plans 
on children and on women are in the process of preparation. 
 
</p>
<p>35. The Agency informed the Special Representative that it monitors prisons. However, the 
reports on this monitoring work are not public, nor are any recommendations it may have made 
to other concerned organs of the State and administrative units. Human rights monitors are, 
</p>
<p>therefore, unable to assess or report on the impact of the work of the Agency. 
 
</p>
<p>36. The Agency also informed the Special Representative that it had organized discussions 
and awareness programmes prior to presentation of its reports. However other information 
received by the Special Representative indicated that cooperation with civil society is not 
systematic, including on the occasion of reporting to the United Nations treaty bodies. Few 
defenders reported having had any interaction with the Agency. 
 
</p>
<p><b>3. The police 
</b> 
</p>
<p>37. A police force trained in human rights and protective of the right to defend human rights 
is an important factor in providing an enabling environment for defenders.  
 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Representative was informed by the Ministry of Interior that a curriculum 
reform in police training has introduced the principles of human and minority rights, police 
ethics and community policing. The Special Representative also noted the preparation of a 
rulebook on filing complaints against police officers, and was informed by representatives of the 
Ministry that information about this procedure would be printed and distributed to the public in 
</p>
<p>relevant languages. While appreciating the progress made in establishing the complaints 
procedure, the Special Representative encourages the internal control department of the police to 
</p>
<p>seek cooperation with the office of the Ombudsperson and notes the continued absence of an 
independent external oversight mechanism. 
 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Representative is mindful of claims by some defenders that they have to deal 
with cases related to police torture and maltreatment and is, therefore, particularly interested in </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 12 
the establishment of an effective accountability system. Access for defenders to such 
accountability processes would be critical in helping victims receive justice in cases related to 
abuses by the police.  
 
</p>
<p><b>4. The judiciary 
 
</b></p>
<p>40. In 2003 Serbia passed a law creating the office of the War Crimes Prosecutor and 
</p>
<p>designating a special department at the Belgrade District Court to handle new war crimes cases.  
Progress in bringing suspected war criminals to justice in domestic proceedings at the special 
war crimes chamber is a positive development, including the efforts in making these cases and 
procedures as transparent as possible. The contribution of human rights defenders to the 
achievements of the Serbian War Crimes Tribunal has been fundamental, in particular their work 
on collecting evidence and assisting witnesses. 
 
</p>
<p>41. The recently adopted law on witness protection provides for several measures to protect 
</p>
<p>the life and integrity of a witness before and during a trial and after its termination. It is an 
important legislative tool for defenders working on war crimes investigations and trials. The 
</p>
<p>Special Representative believes that support of the Government can encourage witnesses to come 
forward. More broadly, it would contribute to a healing process among communities to the 
benefit of the country and the region. 
 
</p>
<p><b>5. Cooperation between civil society and the Government  
</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Representative notes some examples of interaction between State actors and 
civil society. Access of human rights defenders to prisons has improved significantly. The 
</p>
<p>defenders generally reported that they have observed a policy shift and participation of civil 
society in drafting legislation affecting them and their work has generally improved. They also  
</p>
<p>observed that some of the laws recently adopted reflect their recommendations. It is apparent that 
NGOs are also involved in institutional capacity-building activities, including as regards the 
judiciary.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 13 
</p>
<p>43. The interaction of defenders with the Government and other State actors is, however, not 
systematic or institutionalized. There is no institutional mechanism to facilitate communication 
and cooperation with the Government. Interaction occurs on an ad hoc basis and depends on 
personal contacts or the good will of individuals in public institutions.  
 
</p>
<p>44. Defenders reported their difficulties in accessing public authorities. Reports, petitions, 
communications and other documents that defenders send to Governmental authorities do not 
</p>
<p>engender any reaction from the Government, not even to refute the findings that defenders 
present. The Government tends to work with NGOs that are less critical, and uses NGO expertise 
in what are seen as non-sensitive issues, such as poverty reduction strategies, child rights, and 
social inclusion. In some cases, consultation between the Government and civil society takes 
place because of the pressure of international donors. 
 
</p>
<p><b>6. International donors and human rights defenders 
</b> 
</p>
<p>45. The role of international organizations and donors has been crucial to support defenders 
in Serbia and to strengthen their capacity. Their presence and support of the international 
</p>
<p>community for both State institutions and civil society is particularly critical for countries in 
transition. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>46. In recent years, the support from international donors has tended to focus more on State 
institutions and capacity-building in Governmental institutions. While strengthening Government 
institutions and their capacity to govern on the basis of democratic rules is critical, building the 
capacity of civil society is equally important to ensure consistency in good governance and in 
respect for human rights and the rule of law. NGOs must be supported in such a manner that they 
</p>
<p>are able to function independently and to contribute towards the accountability of the State. Their 
presence also contributes towards raising public awareness and creating a culture that values 
</p>
<p>human rights. A relationship of trust and confidence between the State and civil society can only 
be built if there is a balance in their capacity and strength. 
 
</p>
<p>47. Some donors provide funding only to NGOs that collaborate with the Government. Such 
collaboration is to be proven by Government letters that are to be included in the documents that </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 14 
NGOs present when submitting their applications. This prevents independent and critical NGOs 
from accessing funding. 
 
</p>
<p>48. Moreover, the decreasing amount of funding available to NGOs is resulting in a sort of 
brain drain phenomenon, by which the best qualified NGO personnel take positions in 
</p>
<p>Government institutions or move to other parts of the public sector, or to the private sector, 
where more stable jobs or higher salaries are available. 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. The human rights defenders community 
</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Civil society in Serbia developed as an anti-war movement in the 1990s, when human 
rights defenders were systematically targeted by the Milosevic regime. Once the regime fell, the 
role of Serbian NGOs was central to reporting and denouncing war crimes and human rights 
abuses, as well as in strengthening and developing the civil society. 
 
</p>
<p>50. A large number of NGOs are registered in Serbia today, but only a limited number are 
actually active. NGOs operate on a low budget and the lack of domestic support makes them 
</p>
<p>dependent on foreign funding, although access to this is also becoming more difficult. 
 
</p>
<p>51. However, the Special Representative observed a vibrant and active human rights 
community in Serbia with a wide range of expertise and knowledge, including the ability to use 
the international and regional human rights mechanisms. 
 
</p>
<p>52. A high-profile coalition of eight NGOs has prepared the ground for other human rights 
organizations which are now functioning in the country. Many of these defenders work on 
</p>
<p>transitional justice and accountability for past abuses and war crimes. 
 
</p>
<p>53. Other areas of work include the rights of minorities, discrimination, women&#8217;s rights, 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) rights, disability, and children&#8217;s rights. 
Defenders provide legal aid, monitor and report on prisoners&#8217; rights, and conduct human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training. Some defenders file cases at the European Court of Human Rights and 
refer to the decisions of the Court at the national level. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 15 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>54. There are a few NGOs concentrating their work on social, economic or cultural rights, an 
area in which human rights work should be strengthened and the ongoing efforts encouraged, 
such as NGO involvement in the Poverty Reduction Strategy. 
 
</p>
<p><b>1. The environment for the defence of human rights 
</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Representative observes that the freedom for human rights defenders to 
operate in Serbia has improved since the Milosevic era. National and international human rights 
groups operate without Government restriction and are able to carry out their work without 
interference. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>56. However, the information that she received indicates a hostile environment for human 
rights defenders working on certain areas of rights. The Special Representative is concerned 
about the hostile attitude against human rights NGOs and prominent defenders, who are under 
</p>
<p>constant attack, mainly in the media, but also in the Parliament. A report of one human rights 
organization records 20 attacks on journalists and 14 on NGO activists and their property 
between October 2006 and April 2007.7 
 
</p>
<p>57. The victims of these attacks are mostly organizations and individuals who are targeted 
because of their work on transitional justice and war crimes, which, according to some 
defenders, are issues that some sectors of the political establishment do not want to address.  
 
</p>
<p>58. There are also reports of present human rights violations, such as police torture and ill-
treatment, domestic violence, trafficking in women and girls and discrimination against Roma. 
</p>
<p>Defenders working on LGBTI rights are confronted with cases of hate speech, intolerance and 
homophobia, both in the media and in public discourse. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>59. Women defenders working on women&#8217;s rights have been subject to repeated and 
systematic intimidation, threats and propaganda in the media, but also to physical attacks by 
</p>
<p>people in the street and death threats. In some cases personal information, such as ethnic 
</p>
<p>

background and addresses have been published, in a deliberate attempt to instil fear into them. 
The Special Representative was told that women defenders in rural areas face specific 
challenges, as they operate in a more conservative environment in terms of gender roles and with 
an increasing influence of the church and nationalist movements. 
 
</p>
<p>60. From information received during her visit, the Special Representative also gathered that 
human rights defenders outside the capital are more vulnerable to attacks and harassment as they 
</p>
<p>are more isolated and distant from the protection networks that exist in Belgrade.  
 
</p>
<p>61. Some defenders indicated that the Kosovo issue and the wave of patriotism related to it is 
another source of threat and attacks against human rights defenders. Some of the threats received 
by defenders lately have specifically stated that attacks will increase depending on the solution of 
the Kosovo issue.8 Such incidents have caused fear amongst NGOs that work at the regional 
level and are engaged with the issue of minority rights. 
 
</p>
<p>62. Many of the defenders that met with the Special Representative considered that parts of 
the political establishment support what they described as a style of governance with strict 
</p>
<p>regulations and control over civil society and limited space for the expression of dissent. 
 
</p>
<p>63. This environment is further damaged by the lack of an adequate legal framework for 
NGOs, donors downsizing their presence, generally weak human rights knowledge amongst the 
wider public, and campaigns trying to discredit the work of human rights defenders. 
 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Representative was disturbed by accounts by defenders of incidents in which 
the very organizations that have been in the forefront of Serbia's human rights movement are 
</p>
<p>targeted for marginalization and criticism by some parts of the Government and Members of 
Parliament. The Special Representative is concerned about the Government's failure to denounce 
</p>
<p>more forcefully verbal and physical attacks against human rights defenders. This stigmatization 
of defenders, which portrays them as traitors and enemies of the country, should be countered by 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>8For instance, a message received in December 2006 by the Director of the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights 
(YUCOM) was brought to the attention of the Special Representative. The message said that &#8220;if Kosovo gets 
independence we will massacre you and [&#8230;] and all other traitors&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 17 
</p>
<p>supportive statements of State authorities that would give them legitimacy. A firm stand by State 
authorities would contribute to community recognition and protection of defenders.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>65. Some of the specific cases of human rights defenders brought to the attention of the 
Special Representative include the case of Maja Stojanovic, a human rights defender, who was 
charged with hanging posters in an unauthorized place, convicted and  the highest possible fine 
imposed on her for putting up posters urging the Serbian authorities to arrest and transfer the 
</p>
<p>alleged war criminal Ratko Mladic to the ICTY.. The defender risked imprisonment if she did 
not pay the fine, which was ultimately paid by her organization. 
 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Representative was also informed of attacks against women defenders 
belonging to the organization Women in Black. In January 2007, two members of this 
organization were allegedly attacked, with one sustaining serious injuries. It was presumed that 
the attackers were the same individuals who threw tear gas at the Women in Black in July 2005 
during an assembly to mark the tenth anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>67. More recently, in a communication of 29 November 2007 the Special Representative 
brought to the attention of the Government information received on alleged insults and hate 
speech addressed against Natasa Kandic, Executive Director of the NGO Humanitarian Law 
Centre, by members of the Parliament belonging to the Serbian Radical Party. The Special 
Representative is concerned that this episode illustrates the hostile environment surrounding 
human rights defenders in Serbia. 
 
</p>
<p>68. In communications of previous years, the Special Representative raised other incidents 
concerning attacks and threats against defenders or criminal proceedings prosecuting defenders 
</p>
<p>for their human rights activity. These are the cases of Vladan Vlajkovic of the Helsinki 
Committee for Human Rights, Svetlana Djordjevic, and the television and radio station B92 .9 In 
its replies on these cases, the Government provided information on ongoing investigations to 
identify and prosecute the perpetrators. The Special Representative regrets that the Government 
failed to provide information on further measures taken to remove the impunity of those who 
</p>
<p>attacked human rights defenders in the cases concerning the television and radio station B92 and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

Svetlana Djordjevic, and that it did not prevent the criminalization of what appeared to be 
legitimate human rights work in the case of Vladan Vlajkovic.10 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>69. These incidents, cumulatively, indicate a lack of respect for the freedom of assembly and 
the right to protest and for academic and media freedom. In several incidents reported to the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative, non-State actors were allegedly the perpetrators. These cases raise 
concerns regarding the commitment of Government to its responsibility to protect defenders and 
</p>
<p>to prosecute the acts of non-State actors that obstruct the performance of their functions. 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Impunity 
 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Representative is particularly concerned by the lack of investigation and 
public condemnation by State officials of some of the gravest human rights violations from the 
past, or of attacks on human rights defenders who deal with these violations. 
 
</p>
<p>71. Research conducted by human rights defenders describes the lack of State response to 
politically motivated assaults in the period October 2006 &#8211; April 2007, showing that perpetrators 
of 85 out of 119 recorded incidents were not caught. In 34 incidents with clear evidence 
regarding the perpetrator's identity there is no information on an adequately conducted 
investigation, or the prosecution and punishment of these persons.11<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>72. In April 2007, the well known journalist Dejan Anastasijevic survived an attempted 
murder with a bomb blast. Dejan Anastasijevic reports on war crimes cases and testified before 
the ICTY in the Milosevic trial. Investigations in this case have not yet resulted in the 
</p>
<p>identification of the perpetrators. The Special Representative considers this case an emblematic 
one to illustrate the overall climate of impunity regarding attacks committed against defenders. If 
</p>
<p>even cases of defenders with the visibility of Dejan Anastasijevic remain unpunished, the 
community of defenders inevitably feels at risk and without protection. The attempted murder of 
Dejan Anastasijevic is not only an attack against his person but also a threat addressed to 
defenders working on sensitive issues, such as war crimes.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Representative was also informed of the outstanding cases of journalists 
Dada Vujasinovic, Slavko Curuvija and Milan Pantic. The Special Representative encourages the 
Serbian authorities to complete investigations into the circumstances of their deaths as a matter 
of priority, to identify, prosecute and punish the perpetrators and to fully disclose the facts to the 
</p>
<p>public. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3. State security files 
 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Representative has previously commented on the Government practice of 
maintaining intelligence files, which is not regulated by law and lacks transparency.12 Defenders 
in Serbia expressed serious apprehension regarding this practice and resented the attempts at 
surveillance of human rights defenders and the treatment of them as a security risk. 
 
</p>
<p>75. A decision on the opening of State security files has not been taken yet. There have been 
frequent declarations on the will to do so but no action has followed so far. Opening secret files 
would be an important sign of transparency, particularly crucial during the transition period 
</p>
<p>through which Serbia is living. Such a step would contribute to confronting the totalitarian past 
of the country and to overcoming it. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E. Recommendations 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>For the consideration of the Government and relevant State actors 
 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Establish and institutionalize interaction and consultation processes with civil 
society. This also includes involving civil society in the preparation and follow-up of the 
reports to United Nations treaty bodies and to the Human Rights Council in the context of 
the universal periodic review. 
 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Adopt a national plan or strategy on human rights with specific measures for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of human rights defenders and their activities. The plan or strategy should

<b>include the protection of defenders in vulnerable positions, like women defenders in rural 
areas and defenders working on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights. 
The Government should engage non-governmental organizations and other members of 
civil society in the process of discussion of such a strategy at the national level. 
 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Take forceful action on investigating, prosecuting and sentencing cases regarding 
violations against human rights defenders and provide adequate protection and redress to 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights defenders affected by these violations. 
 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Ensure a tax exemption regime for non-profit organizations, in order to establish a 
stronger framework for the freedom of association. 
 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>Create better systems and procedures for the implementation of the decisions and 
recommendations of the office of the Ombudsperson and the Commissioner for 
Information of Public Importance. Set up accountability arrangements, like a reporting 
system, to monitor the degree of collaboration of Government ministries and departments. 
 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Continue to incorporate human rights education in the curriculum for training of 
the police forces, as well as judges and lawyers, and ensure access of human rights 
defenders, as well as victims, to the accountability mechanisms that address human rights 
violations by the police. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>For the consideration of human rights defenders 
 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Improve coordinating networks aimed at strengthening the protection of defenders, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly those outside the capital and those in a more vulnerable position. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>For the consideration of the international community, including the United Nations 
country team, and donors 
 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Continue and strengthen support provided to human rights defenders, both in 
terms of funding and capacity-building. This should be done while respecting the </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 21 
</p>
<p><b>independence of defenders in determining their priorities and strategies, and preserving 
their role in monitoring State institutions. 
 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>Ensure that diplomatic missions of the European Union countries are aware of and 
committed to the implementation of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights 
Defenders in all cases where they can be applied to support and protect defenders.</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b>II. VISIT TO KOSOVO 
 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Special Representative conducted a mission to Kosovo on 20 and 21 September 
</p><p>2007. The Special Representative would like to thank the United Nations Interim Administration 
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) for 
allowing her to undertake a fruitful visit. The Special Representative expresses her deep gratitude 
to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Kosovo 
for its commendable assistance in the organization of the agenda.  She values the involvement of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in the visit and considers it a good basis to ensure follow-up to the recommendations of 
this report. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>86. The mission visited Pristina/Prishtine and an enclave of Kosovo Serbs outside 
Pristina/Prishtine in the village of Caglavica/Cagllavice. The Special Representative had 19 
meetings during her two-day visit. She met with representatives of the Provisional Institutions of 
Self-Government, the international community, and human rights defenders. In particular, she 
met with the President of Kosovo, members of the Kosovo Assembly, the Minister of Interior, 
the Minister for Communities and Returns, the Government Coordinator for Human Rights, the 
acting Ombudsperson, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Kosovo, the 
</p>
<p>Office of the personal representative of the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and 
Security Policy, and the Head of Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
</p>
<p>Europe (OSCE). She also met with representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 
journalists and individual human rights defenders. She took part in the television debate &#8220;Life in 
Kosovo&#8221; (<i>Jeta ne Kosove</i>) to provide information on her mandate and its relevance to the 
promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 22 
</p>
<p><b>A. The quest for status and how it affects human rights defenders 
</b> 
</p>
<p>87. The historically difficult relationship between Kosovo Albanians and Serbs was 
exacerbated under the Milosevic regime in the 1990s. Discrimination and repression was 
followed by armed conflict involving the loss of lives, &#8220;disappearances&#8221; and abductions, massive 
</p>
<p>displacement and forcible expulsions affecting mainly Kosovo Albanians, but also Kosovo Serbs 
and members of other ethnic groups. The deterioration of the humanitarian crisis prompted the 
</p>
<p>intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the spring of 1999 and the 
withdrawal of Serbian military and police forces from Kosovo in June 1999. Security Council 
resolution 1244 (1999) authorized the creation of an interim international administration 
(UNMIK) and the stationing of a NATO-led force (KFOR) in Kosovo. UNMIK assumed all 
legislative, executive and judicial authority throughout Kosovo, pending the creation of 
provisional governmental institutions. Since then, although Kosovo has remained legally part of 
the Republic of Serbia or its predecessors, Kosovo and Serbia have been governed in complete 
separation, in a situation in which Serbia has not exercised any governing authority over Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>88. Under UNMIK authority, the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Kosovo 
</p>
<p>(PISG) have been created since 2001 and have increasingly taken on responsibility for most 
aspects of government although UNMIK retains the ultimate authority over all actions 
</p>
<p>undertaken by PISG and still governs under &#8220;reserved&#8221; powers which mainly relate to policing, 
the judiciary and international representation. The establishment and reinforcement of PISG had 
the merit of setting in motion a political process. However, the role of UNMIK as an interim 
</p>
<p>administration, which is at the same time a United Nations body whose staff members enjoy 
privileges and immunities, the gradual transfer of competences to PISG, and the existence of 
Serbian parallel court and administrative structures in some parts of Kosovo raise questions of 
</p>
<p>accountability and legal uncertainty. 
 
</p>
<p>89. Legal inconsistencies affect the enjoyment of human rights of the people of Kosovo and 
impair the ability of human rights defenders to defend these rights. An emblematic example is 
the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of 
</p>
<p>Europe. The standards contained in the Convention must be observed by PISG in Kosovo </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 23 
</p>
<p>through an UNMIK regulation13  but people in Kosovo cannot claim its violation before the 
European Court of Human Rights.14 To do so, Kosovo would have to become a member of the 
Council of Europe and this is linked to the issue of status. 
 
</p>
<p>90. This is one among the many problems that are in a situation of impasse because of the 
uncertainties surrounding the political status of Kosovo. 
 
</p>
<p>91. All the interlocutors met by the Special Representative agreed on this point. &#8220;People need 
security and this is what status provides&#8221;, said a representative of the international community. 
&#8220;Time has come to decide on status. We have come to a stage in which we cannot do more to 
prepare the ground. A lot still needs to be done for democratic institutions to work but this 
cannot happen in the present institutional set-up, which lacks accountability&#8221;, said the Head of 
the OSCE Mission.15 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>92. The question of status dominates the political debate even more acutely than in Serbia 
and negatively affects the possibility of human rights defenders to grow and function. The quest 
for status is a polarizing element: those who want independence against those who do not. There 
</p>
<p>is no place in between and the expression of dissent on how status should be decided is subtly 
but strongly discouraged. 
 
</p>
<p>93. Human rights defenders who advocate for status in ways that are critical of or somewhat 
distant from the predominant view are silenced and marginalized. Other defenders somehow 
self-censor their activities and positions, especially those critical of the authorities, for fear of 
being accused of endangering decisions on status. 
 
</p>
<p>94. Such a sanitized environment, which discourages civil society organizations from 
criticizing, protesting, resisting, and monitoring public authorities is not conducive to the 
</p>
<p>development of a strong and vibrant community of human rights defenders and it is a major 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>defenders in Kosovo. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. The Ahtisaari status proposal 
</b> 
</p>
<p>95. In November 2005, the Secretary-General appointed Martti Ahtisaari as his Special 
Envoy for the Future Status Process for Kosovo. In March 2007, the Special Envoy submitted his 
</p>
<p>report proposing a political settlement for Kosovo.16 The Special Envoy proposed that the 
independence of Kosovo be supervised for an initial period by the international community, the 
</p>
<p>International Civilian Representative, who would be double-hatted as the European Union 
Special Representative. After a transition period, UNMIK&#8217;s mandate would expire and all 
legislative and executive authority vested in UNMIK would be transferred en bloc to the 
authorities of Kosovo. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>96. In December 2007, the troika following negotiations on status, composed of the EU, the 
Russian Federation and the United States of America, reported to the Security Council that 
 
</p>
<p>despite four months of intense and high-level negotiations, Belgrade and Pristina/Prishtine were 
unable to reach an agreement on Kosovo&#8217;s final status. At the time of writing this report, an 
</p>
<p>outcome on this process was still awaited. 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Human rights defenders in Kosovo 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The lost origins of the human rights movement 
</b> 
</p>
<p>97. The interlocutors of the Special Representative, including representatives of civil society 
organizations, consistently considered that human rights defenders are not particularly strong in 
</p>
<p>Kosovo. With different degrees of intensity, they described their disappointment or disillusion 
over what ten years ago was a civil society movement anchored in human rights that moved 
Kosovo forward in denouncing violations and crimes committed during the Milosevic regime, 
but that today has lost its potential. &#8220;It is a paradox. We moved from a decade when the whole 
discourse on Kosovo was sustained by human rights and human rights defenders to a decade of 
</p>
<p>total apathy&#8221;, remarked a defender. 
                                                 
</p>
<p>16
 S/2007/168. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 25 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>98. &#8220;Before the NATO bombing, human rights activists had a common enemy. After the 
bombing, many activists entered politics. Their priority became the status of Kosovo and not 
human rights. They swallowed past abuses in exchange for independence&#8221;, commented a 
defender to explain the rise and fall of what was perceived to be a strong human rights 
movement. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>99. An emblematic case is the Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms, 
which did consistent work in documenting and reporting human rights violations committed 
</p>
<p>under the Milosevic regime. It was the leading organization of the human rights movement 
which brought crimes and violations against Kosovo Albanians to the attention of the 
international community and the media. Today the Council complains about having been 
marginalized and prevented from undertaking activities that were core functions of the 
organization for many years, like monitoring elections. The Council further complains of being 
unfairly labelled as an organization that protects only the rights of Kosovo Albanians. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>100. Without entering into the merits of the specific situation and without expressing views as 
to whether these allegations are well-founded, the Special Representative considers that the 
</p>
<p>marginalization of the Council may also be partly due to its views and positions that do not fit 
the predominant discourse on status. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Human rights defenders today 
</b> 
</p>
<p>101. At the time of the Special Representative&#8217;s visit there were over four thousand registered 
NGOs in Kosovo many of whom list human rights among their activities, but it was unclear how 
many were actually functioning. Most of them are donor-driven and flourish and perish with the 
</p>
<p>availability of foreign funding or lack of it. 
 
</p>
<p>102. Most defenders reported they have contacts with PISG but consultation processes are ad 
hoc rather than systematic or institutionalized. NGOs find it particularly difficult to be involved 
in policy-making processes within PISG. Information provided by PISG on NGOs with which 
</p>
<p>they collaborate mainly indicates international NGOs. The collaboration between civil society 
organizations and UNMIK was reported to be even more difficult. </p>

</p>
<p>103. The ethnic divide appears to be a major source of animosity between some civil society 
organizations and an obstacle to uniting for common human rights objectives. &#8220;Unfortunately, 
we have come to a situation in which human rights are just ethnic rights&#8221;, commented a 
representative of an NGO. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>104. Organizations working on the rights of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minorities are 
particularly affected by the enmity between the Kosovo Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians and feel 
</p>
<p>excluded from decision-making processes at the political level as &#8220;they do not belong&#8221;. 
 
</p>
<p>105. While civil society organizations as a whole are quite fragmented, NGO work on some 
thematic areas is solid and well-coordinated. The Special Representative was encouraged by 
some examples of multi-ethnic coalitions and networks of organizations working on thematic 
areas, such as women&#8217;s rights and disability. These organizations are part of networks within 
both Kosovo and the wider region, and have linkages with international platforms. 
 
</p>
<p>106. Other prominent human rights NGOs are those with headquarters in Belgrade and local 
offices in Kosovo. They work mainly on transitional justice and war crimes, and on public 
accountability issues, such as monitoring the implementation of the law on access to information. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>107. Defenders working for the rights of lesbians, gays, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) 
persons are in a particularly vulnerable situation. They have chosen not to register as an 
association for fear of being then identified as individuals and harassed or attacked. In the recent 
past, members of this group were confronted with homophobic episodes at the hands of the 
police, who did not protect their privacy when they reported cases of attacks. The Special 
Representative was reassured by the Ministry of Interior, who was aware of these episodes, 
acknowledged the problem, and was committed to addressing it. Improvements in the attitude of 
</p>
<p>the police were confirmed by defenders working on LGBTI rights, who stressed the need to train 
the police on these issues. They also pointed to the ostracism they face vis-&#224;-vis other human 
rights organizations, which, with few exceptions, are openly against considering LGBTI issues 
as human rights issues.

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3

</p>
<p><b>1. Freedom of expression and access to information 
</b> 
</p>
<p>108. Freedom of expression is generally respected in Kosovo. However, the Special 
Representative is concerned about an overall climate of self-censorship among journalists, who 
avoid writing about sensitive issues. This is not necessarily for fear of blatant acts of harassment 
</p>
<p>and violence against journalists but rather of subtle forms of retaliation, like marginalization, 
unemployment or being confined to less challenging areas of work. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>109. The area of journalism where journalists are most at risk is the investigation of organized 
crime. In September 2004 a journalist was wounded and another killed in June 2005, presumably 
in connection with their investigative work on organized crime. The Special Representative is 
concerned that there has not been significant progress in the investigation of these crimes. 
 
</p>
<p>110. Despite the existing legislation establishing a right of access to official documents of 
PISG,17 journalists and defenders reported deficient implementation. Defenders and journalists 
pointed to the problem that there is no legislation allowing access to UNMIK documents. 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b> 
</p>
<p>111. At the time of the visit, the Kosovo Assembly had recently adopted a law on public 
assembly, which was in the legal office of UNMIK for examination. The Special Representative 
was later informed that the law could not be promulgated because legislation in this area is not 
within the competency of the Kosovo Assembly. The legislation in force on freedom of assembly 
is therefore a law adopted in 1981 under the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.18 
Without entering into procedures regulating the complicated legal setting of Kosovo, the Special 
Representative urges the authorities to adopt adequate legislation on freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly. Adequate legislation and its scrupulous implementation are fundamental to preventing 
the reoccurrence of the tragic incidents that happened on 10 February 2007. The Special 
Representative suggests using the Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly published by the 
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODHIR) of OSCE to draft and implement

Assembly of 2006 and 2007, which focus on freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to

</p>
<p><b>3. The events of 10 February 2007 
</b> 
</p>
<p>112. In Kosovo, the most controversial demonstrations in the streets have been around the 
</p>
<p>issue of status. Tensions mounted around the issuing of the Ahtisaari proposal (see paragraph 95 
above), which generated strong reactions from radical elements and in particular within the 
<i>Vetevendosje</i> (Self-Determination) movement. This movement advocates a policy of non-
negotiation and antagonism towards the international establishment and the provisional 
authorities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>113. On 10 February 2007, the <i>Vetevendosje</i> movement under the leadership of Albin Kurti 
organized a demonstration in Pristina/Prishtine. The demonstration turned violent and UNMIK 
</p>
<p>Special Police Units (SPU) started using teargas and firing rubber bullets into the crowd. This 
resulted in the injuring of over 80 persons and the death of two men. 
 
</p>
<p>114. The investigations by UNMIK into the case led to the conclusion that Romanian 
policemen had been responsible for the death of the two men, who died from the injuries caused 
by the rubber bullets, but that the evidence available and the lack of further access to the 
Romanian police officers meant that the individual officers who fired the rubber bullets could not 
be identified. 
 
</p>
<p>115. As it emerged from reports on the incident,20 Romanian legislation permits a significantly 
greater use of firearms and deadly force than that accepted in international law and guiding 
United Nations principles on the use of lethal force. When there are such divergences between 
</p>
<p>the domestic legislation of a contributing country to a peacekeeping mission and international 
standards, measures are to be taken at the level of training, command, control and supervision to 
ensure the application of United Nations standards in operations under the responsibility of the 
United Nations.

<p> 
</p>
<p>116. These legal inconsistencies, together with other factors including ammunition which was 
long past its expiry date, ambiguities in operational orders and imprecision in authorizing the 
deployment of rubber bullets, and a breakdown in the chain of command and supervision, 
indicate the responsibilities of the international police in the deaths of two persons and the injury 
of many others, and are illustrative of the problem of accountability of the actions of UNMIK. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative appreciated the information provided by the Special Representative 
for Kosovo who reported that rubber bullets have been removed from the arsenal of UNMIK 
</p>
<p>police as a consequence of the independent investigation carried out into the incidents of 10 
February. She nevertheless considers this measure to be just one among many that should be 
taken to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents and to ensure that those responsible for the 
excessive use of force during the demonstration of 10 February are held accountable. 
 
</p>
<p>117. A further concern is expressed about the situation of Mr Albin Kurti, who was arrested on 
10 February 2007 in connection with his role in the demonstration. He has been indicted for the 
offences of (a) participating in a crowd committing a criminal offence (causing general danger  
 
</p>
<p>and/or damage to property); (b) participating in a group obstructing official persons in the 
performance of their official duties; and (c) calling for resistance.21 Without entering into the 
merits of the case, the Special Representative calls on all those responsible for the judicial 
situation of Mr Kurti to ensure that his right to a fair trial is respected. The case is highly 
politically charged as it is linked to key issues for Kosovo, i.e. its political status and the 
accountability of the international administration. The perception that Mr Kurti is a scapegoat 
paying for the faults of the international police is dangerous and is to be dissipated. The best way 
to do it is through a fair trial. Human rights defenders can contribute by monitoring the trial to 
ensure its transparency and should be encouraged to do so. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>4. Human rights structures within the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</b> <b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p>118. The international community, and OSCE in particular, have made considerable efforts to 
inject into governmental structures an institutional framework conducive to human rights being 
mainstreamed in the policies and actions of the Kosovo governmental authorities. The role of the 
</p>

Page 30 
OHCHR office in Kosovo has also been crucial in supporting human rights structures at the 
governmental and non-governmental level and in monitoring compliance with human rights 
standards. 
 
</p>
<p>119. Since 2005, human rights units have been progressively established in each of the 15 
ministries. They are coordinated by the government coordinator for human rights and Director of 
the Advisory Office of Good Governance (AOGG). The AOGG is a small office within the 
Office of the Prime Minister. It has a broad mandate including human rights, counter-trafficking 
and gender. The AOGG organizes training programmes on human rights for governmental staff 
in collaboration with international organizations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>120. The AOGG and the human rights units within the Ministries are very under-resourced 
and rely on the support of donors and international organizations to carry out their activities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>121. The governmental structure on human rights is still nascent and needs more time to start 
yielding the expected results. Adequate resources are needed, as well as a genuine commitment 
to human rights within the political establishment, to ensure that this institutional setting is 
</p>
<p>actually instrumental in the promotion and protection of human rights through governmental 
action and does not remain an empty framework established because of international pressure 
</p>
<p>and for the sole purpose of formally satisfying the requirements for independence. 
 
</p>
<p><b>5. The police 
</b> 
</p>
<p>122. Pending further transfer of policing powers which are proposed under the Ahtisaari plan, 
the Kosovo police service (KPS) is commanded by the KPS Deputy Commissioner who is 
supervised by the UNMIK Police Commissioner. The Ministry of Interior has a strategic role in 
preparing for the transfer of authority and overseeing policies such as police training. An 
</p>
<p>UNMIK international police force (1,993 police officers from 44 countries as at August 2007),22 
exists alongside the KPS and has mainly monitoring functions, but it is also operational in certain 
situations or for certain types of crime.  
</p>

</p>
<p>123. The Kosovo Police Inspectorate is an agency within the Ministry of Interior that acts as 
</p>
<p>an independent supervision mechanism with the mandate to investigate all complaints for 
misconduct of KPS police officers, regardless of their rank. The Minister of Interior further 
informed the Special Representative of the existence of an internal oversight mechanism to 
investigate police allegations of misconduct.23 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>124. Allegations of misconduct by the police reported to the Special Representative essentially 
</p>
<p>related to episodes of harassment and inadequate protection of defenders working on LGBTI 
rights already referred above (paragraph 107 above). The envisaged enhancement of community 
policing and community/police problem solving24 is perceived as a step forward in improving the 
attitude and the capacity of the police to deal with members of vulnerable groups and defenders 
supporting them. Training in this area is also recommended. 
 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>6. The judiciary 
</b> 
</p>
<p>125. In Kosovo there are 311 local judges, 88 local prosecutors, 14 international judges and 10 
international prosecutors. 25 Judges are nominated by the Kosovo Judicial Council and appointed 
by the SRSG for Kosovo. This system in which the final decision on the appointment of a judge 
rests in the hands of the Special Representative for Kosovo creates an imbalance of power and is 
an obstacle to the independence of the judiciary. 
 
</p>
<p>126. International judges and prosecutors are appointed directly by the Special Representative 
for Kosovo. The length of their term of office is not established by UNMIK regulations and the 
procedure attached to their appointment is not transparent. These factors make their impartiality 
</p>
<p>and independence questionable. Moreover, there is no supervisory body to complain to in cases 
of misconduct. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>127. Of further concern is the lack of clarity on the cases for which international judges are 
competent. Section 1.2 of UNMIK regulation No. 2000/06 merely states that international judges 
</p>

may select and assume responsibility over criminal cases. Some cases go directly to international 
judges, other are transferred to them by local judges.26 
 
</p>
<p>128. The Human Rights Committee has also raised concerns about the absence of adequate 
guarantees for the independence of international judges and prosecutors and recommended that 
UNMIK, in cooperation with PISG, establish independent procedures for the recruitment, 
appointment and discipline of international judges and prosecutors.27 
 
</p>
<p>129. In Kosovo four sources of law apply: international standards, UNMIK regulations, laws 
adopted by the Kosovo Assembly and laws of the former Yugoslavia (including some laws 
which were enacted under the Milosevic regime in the 1990s). Legal uncertainties due to the 
many sources of law applying in Kosovo, coupled with a judiciary lacking guarantees of 
independence lead to a wide diversity and often inconsistency in decisions taken by judges, 
which negatively affect the ability of the judiciary to provide justice. The Human Rights 
Committee also raised concerns about the lack of legal certainty resulting from the failure to 
</p>
<p>specify which provisions of the formerly applicable law are being replaced by those UNMIK 
regulations and Kosovo Assembly laws which merely state that they supersede any inconsistent 
</p>
<p>laws or provisions.28 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>7. The Ombudsperson 
</b> 
</p>
<p>130. The Ombudsperson Institution was created in 2000 with the appointment of an 
international Ombudsperson whose main focus was the oversight of UNMIK. In February 2006, 
in UNMIK regulation 2006/06 the &#8220;localization&#8221; of the Ombudsperson, who was to be a local 
person appointed by the Kosovo Assembly, was started. After the departure of the international 
</p>
<p>Ombudsperson, on 1 January 2006 one of the two Deputy Ombudspersons was appointed acting 
Ombudsperson by the Special Representative for Kosovo. At the time of writing this report, the 
</p>
<p>Kosovo Assembly still had not appointed the Ombudsperson and the institution was still headed 
by the acting Ombudsperson. The long duration, over two years, of a temporary position at the

</p>
<p>head of the institution has been detrimental to the development and strengthening of the office of 
the Ombudsperson. 
 
</p>
<p>131. The Ombudsperson has the mandate to accept and investigate cases he/she has received 
and can open investigations in the absence of a formally filed complaint. Section 3.1 of UNMIK 
</p>
<p>regulation 2006/6 clearly states that the Ombudsperson can only deal with cases in which human 
rights violations occur as a result of actions of Kosovo institutions. The Ombudsperson is 
</p>
<p>therefore no longer competent to investigate complaints against UNMIK although Section 3.4 
provides for the possibility of concluding a bilateral agreement with the Special Representative 
for Kosovo on procedures for dealing with cases involving UNMIK. 
 
</p>
<p>132. The acting Ombudsperson informed the Special Representative that he had sent a letter to 
the Special Representative for Kosovo asking him to clarify this provision of the regulation and 
to give clear instructions on the cases against UNMIK still pending with the institution. A letter 
received in August 2006 by the acting Ombudsperson from the Principal Deputy Special 
Representative for Kosovo stated that UNMIK&#8217;s position was that the Ombudsperson Institution 
should focus on PISG structures and that the Human Rights Advisory Panel (see below) will 
provide a mechanism for examining complaints against UNMIK, but did not explicitly clarify the 
Ombudsperson&#8217;s mandate during the transition to a local Ombudsperson.  The Special 
Representative raised this concern during her meeting with the Special Representative for 
Kosovo and his staff. The legal advisor of the Special Representative for Kosovo stated that the 
Ombudsperson would continue to have oversight functions over UNMIK until the Human Rights 
Advisory Panel was operational. However, UNMIK only clarified the mandate in January 2008.  
 
</p>
<p>133. The Special Representative is surprised that the office of the Special Representative for 
</p>
<p>Kosovo did not clarify such a fundamental point relating to the issue of accountability through 
the appropriate institutional channels, i.e. by responding to the letter of the acting Ombudsperson 
</p>
<p>in a clear and timely manner. This lack of clarity and communication between UNMIK and the 
office of the Ombudsperson on such an important matter related to the accountability of UNMIK 
action raises concerns that should not exist with regard to the practices of an administration that 
</p>
<p>is governed by United Nations standards. 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 34 
</p><p>134. The complaints received by the acting Ombudsperson are mostly related to the 
functioning of the judiciary and lengthy proceedings, several others relateto the public 
administration and minority issues, particularly those affecting Kosovo Serbs. The acting 
Ombudsperson considered the fact that he had received complaints from all ethnic groups was an 
indication of the trust of Kosovo people in the institution. Complaints are mainly submitted by 
</p>
<p>individuals and very few by civil society organizations. This may suggest that civil society 
organizations are not conversant with the use of accountability mechanisms as a means to defend 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>135. The Special Representative is concerned about the unsatisfactory level of implementation 
of the findings of the Ombudsperson that was reported to her. The Human Rights Committee had 
already expressed its concern &#8220;that UNMIK and PISG have not always extended due cooperation 
to the Ombudsperson Institution, especially as regards interim measures requests by the 
Ombudsperson&#8221;.29 It is regrettable that no progress can be registered since the recommendations 
of the Human Rights Committee in August 2006. 
 
</p>
<p><b>8. The Human Rights Advisory Panel 
</b> 
</p>
<p>136. In March 2006, UNMIK regulation 2006/12 established the Human Rights Advisory 
Panel with a mandate to examine complaints about violations committed by UNMIK. The 
rationale for the establishment of the Advisory Panel was to respond to a recommendation of the 
Venice Commission of the Council of Europe to create additional accountability mechanisms.30 
However, upon completion of the &#8220;localization&#8221; of the Ombudsperson (see above) the Advisory 
Panel would become the only accountability mechanism for human rights violations committed 
by UNMIK. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>137. The Advisory Panel is composed of three members appointed by the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative for Kosovo upon the proposal of the President of the European Court for Human 
Rights. The three members of the Panel were appointed on 12 January 2007 but had their 
inaugural session only on 15 and 16 November 2007.

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 35 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>138. The delays in the establishment of the Advisory Panel and in putting it into motion were 
aggravated by the limbo around the delay and a lack of clarity over the competence of the 
Ombudsperson on cases related to UNMIK action in the responses provided by UNMIK. This 
gravely obstructed the functioning of accountability mechanisms for the international 
</p>
<p>administration. 
 
</p>
<p>139. The Special Representative is now reassured to learn that the Advisory Panel is finally 
functioning and will examine complaints filed since 23 April 2006. However, she is concerned at 
the long delay leading to this and the limited publicity that has been given to the Panel. The 
Special Representative recommends disseminating information through all relevant means, 
including by reaching out to human rights defenders. She also recommends that the Panel be 
provided with the necessary resources to carry out its mandate. 
 
</p>
<p><b>9. The problem of accountability 
</b> 
</p>
<p>140. The concerns related to the obstacles and constraints affecting the work of the 
Ombudsperson and the functioning of the Human Rights Advisory Panel illustrate the 
</p>
<p>seriousness of the accountability problems of the international administration. 
 
</p>
<p>141. Accountability is essential for public confidence in the actions of the international 
administration. It is also essential to the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights, as it is 
essential for the work of human rights defenders. The mission of human rights defenders is to 
defend human rights. To do so they report human rights violations by bringing them to the 
attention of competent mechanisms. Effective accountability mechanisms are a fundamental 
component of an enabling environment for the work of defenders. Regrettably, this is not what 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative found in Kosovo during her mission. 
 
</p>
<p><b>10. The role of the international community 
</b> 
</p>
<p>142. The international community, both as donors as well as implementing agencies, has 
</p>
<p>played a vital role in Kosovo. Almost all the activities of NGOs rely on international funding. 
The availability of large amounts of funding in the early period of the international presence </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/28/Add.3 
Page 36 
allowed the establishment and functioning of several important programmes and the improved 
capacity of civil society organizations. However, this also resulted in the creation of many NGOs 
for the sole purpose of accessing funds. The Special Representative noted with concern that 
many of the over 4,000 existing NGOs are donor-driven, and are generally engaged with 
programmes that are determined by donors. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>143. In recent years, the approach of international donors has rather shifted to the 
</p>
<p>reinforcement of PISG. 
 
</p>
<p>144. OSCE did a lot of monitoring work in the early years of the international administration 
as well as capacity-building for PISG and civil society organizations. In recent years, OSCE has 
shifted its activities towards capacity-building, mainly for PISG. While capacity-building is an 
important area of work for the development of Kosovo institutions, the Special Representative is 
concerned that the monitoring role played by the international community is less prominent, 
while local organizations still do not seem to have enough expertise in this area. An effective 
</p>
<p>monitoring system is essential in countering the problems of the accountability mechanisms. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Conclusions and recommendations 
 
</b></p>
<p>145. <b>The Special Representative is concerned about the overall climate that discourages 
expressions of criticism, dissent and resistance that characterize the action of human rights 
defenders. Several factors explain such a climate in Kosovo. The recent conflict with its 
wounds still open, vividly visible in the ongoing tensions along ethnic lines, has somehow 
absorbed and nullified all human rights issues and turned them into two issues: the 
determination of the political status of Kosovo, and the rights of minorities. The many 
</b></p>
<p><b>years of international administration have distorted the dynamics between civil society and 
public authorities. In a system in which powers are vested in an international entity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>are then transferred to a transitional national authority, there is all the more need to 
ensure that this process of transition has catered for the informed participation of civil 
society in decision-making, with the space to allow for critical assessment of progress. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>not enough to make funds available for the mushrooming of NGOs, but to ensure the </b></p>

carry out its advocacy and monitoring functions with independence and without fear.</b> 
 
</p>
<p>146. <b>While the Special Representative is aware of the extremely challenging environment 
for governance in Kosovo and fully acknowledges the positive contributions and good 
</b></p>
<p><b>intentions of the international presence there, she is concerned about grievances expressed 
to her that indicate a sense of marginalization amongst many human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b>stemming from the practices or attitudes of the international administration.  The Special 
Representative finds that an environment of trust can only be created if there is space to 
voice these sentiments and genuine grievances are addressed. She hopes that this will be 
done before the international presence leaves Kosovo, so that it does not leave behind any 
perceptions that observance of the best standards of transparency and accountability for 
the promotion and protection of human rights were in any way ignored or neglected in the 
implementation of its mandate by UNMIK, or other international partners. 
</b> 
</p>
<p>147. <b>The Special Representative considers the issue of accountability a central element of 
an enabling environment for the defence of human rights. If accountability mechanisms are 
</b></p>
<p><b>deficient, human rights defenders are deprived of one of their primary means of action. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations addressed to UNMIK and the future international presence 
 
</b></p>
<p>148. <b>Address the problem of accountability as a matter of priority. The following 
measures should be adopted: 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>a) Provide the Human Rights Advisory Panel with adequate resources to carry out 
its functions and ensure that there is no accountability gap on human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed by UNMIK and the future international administration. In the event UNMIK 
withdraws from Kosovo, complaints on violations committed should still be investigated 
</b></p>
<p><b>and identified perpetrators held accountable; 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>b) Extend full cooperation to the Human Rights Advisory Panel and the 
Ombudsperson and implement their findings.

149. <b>Adopt measures to ensure that personnel of the international administration and 
NATO forces operate on the basis of United Nations standards, including when the 
domestic legislation of the countries of origin of personnel of NATO forces, UNMIK 
regulations and those of a future international presence differ from United Nations 
standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>150. <b>Implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee on the 
independence of the judiciary and lack of legal certainty.31 
 
</b></p>
<p>151. <b>In the event that UNMIK withdraws from Kosovo and a future international 
presence takes over part of the functions it currently performs, ensure a system to address 
pending human rights issues both during the transitional period and after, and create 
accountability mechanisms for the future international presence. OHCHR should be asked 
to provide assistance and guidance in this area. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>152. <b>Hold a series of consultations at the highest level with the human rights community 
and other civil society actors on the legal and policy framework for human rights and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional development of Kosovo.  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government</b> <b> 
 
</b></p>
<p>153. <b>The process of consultation with civil society and human rights defenders should be 
institutionalized and systematized so that their active participation in legislative and policy 
decision-making is ensured, particularly that of defenders working on the human rights of 
people discriminated against or marginalized. These include defenders working on Roma, 
Ashkali and Egyptian rights, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) 
rights. 
 
</b></p>
<p>154. <b>The Kosovo Assembly should consider institutionalizing the holding of regular 
public hearings.  
 
</b></p>
<p>155. <b>Legislation on freedom of peaceful assembly complying with international human 
rights standards should be adopted. In drafting and implementing this legislation, the

and 2007 reports of the Special Representative to the General Assembly, which focus on 
freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to protest in the context of freedom of 
assembly32 () should be used for reference. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>156. <b>Bearing in mind that political commitment to mainstream human rights within 
governmental structures is fundamental, adequate resources should be provided to the 
human rights units within ministries and to the government human rights coordinator. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>157. <b>Full cooperation should be extended to the Ombudsperson, his/her reports debated 
and his/her recommendations implemented, and the institution should be provided with 
adequate resources for fulfilment of its mandate. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>158. <b>An appropriate and independent mechanism should be established to monitor the 
implementation of the legislation on access to information and it should be provided with 
the necessary resources to carry out its functions. Access to information of public interest

<p><b>should be granted as regards the documents and actions of UNMIK and any future 
international presence.

rights.

<p>162. <b>Enhance monitoring skills in order to monitor the actions of public authorities,

adopting the best standards of accuracy and objectivity. Human rights defenders should 
play a proactive role by making concrete recommendations and by creating effective

<p><b>Recommendations for the consideration of the international community 
 
</b></p>
<p>163. <b>Continue to provide support to civil society and human rights defenders. This 
should be done while respecting the independence of defenders in determining their 
priorities. When funding is given to international organizations, ensure that the 
programmes they implement envisage the transfer of capacities to local organizations. 
 
</b></p>
<p>164. <b>Strengthen the capacity of defenders to do monitoring work and to use 
accountability mechanisms. A strong community of defenders in a position to monitor 
</b></p>
<p><b>public authorities and report on their violations is the best way to ensure the accountability 
of the authorities and the good functioning of democratic institutions.
