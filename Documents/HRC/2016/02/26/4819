</p>
<p> * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council.

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-14241 
</p>
<p><i> Underscoring</i> the fact that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to prevent 
violence against women and girls includes using<b> </b>all those appropriate means of a legal, 
political, administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and 
ensuring that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, 
effective, prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies, including reparations, are 
available,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and 
women are among the root causes of violence against women, and that effective prevention 
of violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government, the 
engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and boys, and the adoption and 
implementation of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that promote gender 
equality and empowerment of women, and integrate awareness, education, training, 
political will, legislation, accountability, targeted policies and programmes, specific 
measures to reduce vulnerability, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, 
and protection, support and redress for women who have experienced violence,   
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that violence against women is one of the factors impeding 
progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>further </i>the importance of the full participation of women in the 
development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence 
against women,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, 
practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women is 
fundamental to ensuring effective prevention,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those 
regarding ownership of land, property, inheritance, housing, financial services, including 
loans, nationality and legal capacity, education, conditions of work, access to health, 
economic participation, access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, 
public and political participation, access to decision-making processes, social security, 
public and political participation, and cultural life, supported by interventions dealing with 
legal literacy, skills training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in 
preventing violence against women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different 
treatment of women before the law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them 
in these areas, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of 
discrimination and disadvantage can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of 
some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, 
refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living 
in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women 
living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with 
disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women 
who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise 
discriminated against, including those on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a 
barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Stresses</i> that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and must exercise due diligence to 
prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and 
girls and provide protection to women and girls who have experienced violence, and that </p>


<p>GE.10-14241 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and 
fundamental freedoms;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic 
legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of women and girls who have 
experienced violence, to investigate, prosecute, punish and redress, including by ensuring 
access to adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies, including 
reparations, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, 
whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations 
of armed conflict; to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant international 
human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish existing laws, 
regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women, and to 
remove gender bias in the administration of justice;  
 3. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to place a high priority on strengthening and 
implementing legal and policy measures that promote the full enjoyment by women and 
girls of all human rights, particularly those aimed at eliminating discrimination against 
women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their full 
autonomy, including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and 
inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and 
employment opportunities, land, credit, agricultural extension, adequate housing, just and 
favourable conditions of work, and business and leadership skills training; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges </i>States to adopt and implement policies and programmes that enable 
women to avoid and escape situations of violence and prevent its recurrence, and that 
provide, inter alia, financial support and affordable access to safe housing or shelters, 
childcare and other social supports, legal assistance, skills training and productive 
resources, and to make these services accessible to women and girls with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also urges</i> States at all levels to promote environments and communities that 
are safe for women and girls, and to support the efforts of civil society and other 
stakeholders towards this end, including by taking measures designed to enhance personal 
security and reduce the risk of violence in the community, in the home and in the 
workplace, in particular those that eliminate barriers to safe access to schools and other 
educational settings, drinking water sources and sanitation facilities, workplaces and 
livelihoods, and participation in the life of the community; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> States to publicly condemn violence against women and provide 
visible and sustained leadership at the highest levels to prevent all forms of violence against 
women and girls, and, in particular, in efforts to confront and change the attitudes, customs, 
practices and gender stereotypes that lie at the core of discriminatory and harmful practices 
that are violent towards women, such as female genital mutilation, forced and early 
marriages, femicide and honour crimes;   
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to support initiatives undertaken by women&#8217;s groups, 
international and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and 
community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender 
equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising 
awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges </i>States to devote the resources necessary to ensure effective and 
ongoing outreach, awareness-raising, education, training and engagement with relevant 
stakeholders who have an important role in prevention and responding to early warning 
signs of violence against women and girls, including government officials, community and 
religious leaders, health, education, justice and law enforcement, including prison 
personnel; </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-14241 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Encourages</i> States to integrate gender analysis in policymaking to better 
understand the potential impact of policies on women and their contribution to eliminating 
violence against women and girls; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Urges</i> Governments to identify and address the effects of all forms of 
discrimination that combine to heighten the vulnerability of women and girls to violence 
and includes targeted discrimination directed against groups of women, compounded 
discrimination whereby gender and belonging to a minority or marginalized group prevent 
women and girls from having access to opportunities that would otherwise be available to 
them, and structural discrimination whereby State policies that are intended to be gender-
neutral have an adverse impact on women and girls, thus increasing their degree of 
marginalization;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also urges</i> States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in efforts to 
prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against 
women; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Stresses</i> that women should be empowered to protect themselves against 
violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide 
freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and 
reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and calls upon States to 
take all necessary legislative and policy steps to fully empower women to this end, and in 
particular:  
</p>
<p> (a) To effectively promote and protect women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights, 
including reproductive rights and sexual health, in the context of HIV/AIDS to lessen their 
vulnerability to HIV infection and to the impact of AIDS, as referred to by the Council in 
its resolution 12/27 of 2 October 2009, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, 
programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental 
organizations in this regard; 
</p>
<p> (b) To strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacities of women and 
adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV- and 
AIDS-prevention, treatment, care and support services, and to ensure protection from and 
prevention of stigma and discrimination;   
</p>
<p> (c) To provide comprehensive, age-appropriate education on human sexuality, 
sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and how to deal positively and responsibly 
with sexuality;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> relevant United Nations entities to pursue their work on 
indicators for violence against women, and States to intensify their efforts to systematically 
collect, analyse and disseminate data, including data disaggregated by sex, age, disability 
and other relevant information, to fully integrate data on the extent, nature and 
consequences of violence against women in national data-collection systems, and to 
monitor and evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the impact of initiatives aimed at preventing 
violence against women, including legislation, policies and their implementation, 
programmes and the provision of services, to better understand the effectiveness of specific 
measures, enable corrective action and contribute to the development of good practice, and 
to ensure that such data are publicly accessible;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Encourages</i> States to implement Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) 
and 1820 (2008), and other relevant United Nations resolutions on women, peace and 
security; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Also encourages</i> States to create gender-sensitized training and education 
programmes and other appropriate measures for their armed forces, civilian police, 
peacekeeping units and humanitarian personnel that include instructions on their </p>


<p>GE.10-14241 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>responsibilities towards the civilian population, particularly women and children, as well as 
mechanisms to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent violence against women and full 
accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Urges</i> States to establish or strengthen plans of action to eliminate violence 
against women and girls that clearly delineate government accountabilities for prevention 
and are supported by the necessary human, financial and technical resources, including, 
where appropriate, time-bound measurable targets, to promote the protection of women 
against any form of violence, and accelerate the implementation of existing plans of action 
that are regularly monitored and updated by Governments, taking into account inputs by 
civil society, in particular women&#8217;s organizations, networks and other stakeholders;  
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Notes with appreciation</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, as well as the ongoing contribution to 
prevention efforts, including her recent report on reparations for women subjected to 
violence (A/HRC/14/22); 
 18. <i>Decides</i> to include in the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human 
rights at its seventeenth session, in consultation with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, the theme of violence against women and 
girls, with an emphasis on prevention, with a view to sharing good practices and identifying 
remaining gaps in the area of prevention, and requests the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare and disseminate a summary of the 
proceedings; 
</p>
<p> 19. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a compilation of 
good practices in the prevention of violence against women, in consultation with the 
Special Rapporteur, States, civil society and other relevant stakeholders, and to present the 
report thereon during the annual full-day discussion on women&#8217;s human rights at its 
seventeenth session; 
</p>
<p> 20. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to present her/his written annual report to 
the General Assembly, beginning at its sixty-sixth session;  
</p>
<p> 21. <i>Welcomes</i> the decision to establish, as soon as possible, the new United 
Nations composite entity for gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment with a view to 
maximizing the impact of interventions to prevent and eliminate violence against women, 
and encourages the Secretary-General to promote collaboration and coordination with the 
High Commissioner, the Council and its mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 22. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the issue of the elimination of all forms 
of violence against women, its causes and consequences, as a matter of high priority, in 
conformity with its annual programme of work.
