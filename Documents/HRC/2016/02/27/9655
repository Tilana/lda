<p><b>I.  Resolution adopted by the Council at its tenth special session 
</b></p>
<p><b>S-10/1 The impact of the global economic and financial crises on the  
universal realization and effective enjoyment of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, 
<i> Guided</i> <i>also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Vienna Declaration 
and Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that peace and security, development and human rights are the interrelated 
pillars of the United Nations system, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming further</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and 
interrelated and that they must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and 
with the same emphasis,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 60/251, which affirms that the Human Rights 
Council shall be responsible for promoting universal respect for the protection of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind; should serve inter alia as 
a forum for dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights and that the promotion and 
protection of human rights should be based on the principles of cooperation and genuine 
dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of member States to comply with their human 
rights obligations for the benefit of all human beings,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> that General Assembly resolution 60/251 affirms that the work of the 
Council shall be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and 
non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation with a view to enhancing the 
promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living for himself and his 
family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of 
living conditions, as reflected in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Committed</i> to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those 
contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major 
United Nations conferences and summits, as they contribute to the universal realization and 
effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,  
<i> Reaffirming</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including its provision that 
everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself 
and his family, including food, and recalling the Universal Declaration on the Eradication of 
Hunger and Malnutrition and the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first 
Millennium Development Goal of eradication of hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, </p>

<p>A/HRC/S-10/2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective 
enjoyment of human rights by all, its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must 
remain a high priority for the international community,  
</p>
<p><i> Cognizant</i> that, as a result of globalization, domestic economies are now interwoven, and 
that good governance at the national and international levels, as well as fair, effective, 
transparent and accountable financial, monetary and trading systems, are essential prerequisites 
for attaining sustainable development and for the elimination of poverty,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing </i>serious concern at the negative impacts of the global economic and financial 
crises on economic and social development and on the full enjoyment of all human rights in all 
countries, and recognizing that developing countries, particularly least developed countries and 
small island developing States, are in a more vulnerable situation when facing these impacts, 
</p>
<p><i> Regretting</i> that the global economic and financial crises have resulted in the decline of 
exports, foreign direct investment, and remittances which are essential factors contributing to the 
growth of economies of developing countries, and have led to difficulties in foreign indebtedness 
and in the realization of all human rights, including the right to development,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that the State has a responsibility to ensure that an increase in unemployment 
does not exacerbate the potential for discrimination, in particular against migrants and other 
vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the economic and financial crises are global in scope and require global 
concerted solutions, developed in partnership by the international community with a view to 
preventing and alleviating any of their impacts on the universal realization and effective 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
 1.<i> Expresses</i> deep concern that the universal realization and effective enjoyment of 
human rights are challenged due to multiple and interrelated global economic and financial 
crises; 
</p>
<p> 2<i>. Recognizes</i> the severe impacts that the global economic and financial crises are 
having on the ability of countries, particularly developing countries, to mobilize resources for 
development and to address the impact of these crises, and, in this context, calls upon all States 
and the international community to alleviate, in an inclusive and development oriented manner, 
any negative impacts of these crises on the realization and the effective enjoyment of all human 
rights; 
</p>
<p> 3<i>. Underlines </i>the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and democratic 
international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of developing countries in 
international economic decision-making and norm-setting; </p>
<p> 4.<i> Expresses </i>grave concern that these crises threaten to further undermine the 
achievement of the internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium 
Development Goals and calls upon all States to refrain from reducing international financial  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/S-10/2 
  page 5 
</p>
<p>resources for development, including<b> </b>official development assistance and from imposing 
protectionist measures, and to maintain their commitments to mobilize and sustain financial 
resources for development, in accordance with the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for 
Development, and to make concerted and sustained efforts to contribute to an early recovery; 
</p>
<p> 5.<i> Calls</i> <i>upon</i> States to note that the global economic and financial crises do not 
diminish the responsibility of national authorities and the international community in the 
realization of human rights and calls upon them to assist, in particular, the most vulnerable in 
this regard, and in this context urges the international community to support national efforts to, 
inter alia, establish and preserve social safety nets for the protection of the most vulnerable 
segments of their societies; 
</p>
<p> 6<i>. Calls on</i> States to ensure that those at risk of being most affected by the global 
economic and financial crises are protected in a non-discriminatory way; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that an open, equitable, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral 
trading system can substantially stimulate development worldwide, benefiting all countries, 
particularly developing countries, and thereby contributing to the universal realization and 
effective enjoyment of all human rights; 
 8. <i>Recognizes </i>the central role of the United Nations in the international system and 
<i>welcomes</i> the decision by the General Assembly to hold a high-level conference on the world 
economic and financial crises and its impacts on development due to take place from 
1 to 4 June 2009; and in this context, recommends that an invitation be addressed by the 
General Assembly to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to participate in 
this high-level event and to present a report with suggested recommendations, building on the 
deliberations of this special session, so as to mainstream a human rights perspective in the 
analysis of the global economic and financial crises; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Invites</i> relevant thematic Special Procedures, within their respective mandates, 
building on the deliberations of this special session, to consider any of the impacts of the global 
economic and financial crises on the realization and effective enjoyment of all human rights 
particularly economic, social and cultural rights, and to integrate their findings in this regard in 
their regular reports presented to the Human Rights Council, with special attention to 
non-discrimination and to ways and means to ensure respect for and protection of the human 
rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups, particularly women, children, migrants, migrant 
workers and their families, indigenous peoples, and people living in poverty, and on the 
elimination of acts of racism and xenophobia and promoting greater harmony and tolerance in all 
societies; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Invites</i> the treaty bodies, within their respective mandates, to consider any of the 
impacts of the global economic and financial crises on the realization and effective enjoyment of 
all human rights, and to consider presenting recommendations thereon; </p>
