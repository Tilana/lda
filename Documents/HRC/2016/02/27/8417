<p><b>  Mission to Albania</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The visit of the Special Rapporteur to Albania focused primarily on extrajudicial 
executions in the context of blood feuds and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p> Both in terms of economic and social development and of respect for human rights 
and the rule of law, Albania has achieved an enormous amount in a very short period of 
time. The communist era was characterized by extreme repression, persecution, the 
imprisonment and killing of thousands for political purposes, and economic isolation and 
stagnation. Since its transition in 1991, Albania has enacted comprehensive democratic, 
economic, social and legal reforms. These impressive achievements should serve it well as 
it proceeds towards candidacy for membership of the European Union. At the same time, 
Albania continues to face strong challenges, including corruption and the need to 
implement its ambitious reform agenda with limited resources and in the face of political 
gridlock between the main parties. These challenges make it all the more important that 
issues of justice and accountability be addressed effectively. 
</p>
<p> The blood feuds dealt with in the present report involve the pre-meditated revenge 
killing of a member of a murder victim&#8217;s family, committed in order to restore the honour 
lost as a result of the initial murder. Such killings have decreased steadily over the past five 
years, but the phenomenon has not been entirely eliminated, and the broader implications of 
the feuds continue to have a corrosive effect on society. The most important problems are

<p>significant self-isolation by families fearing a revenge killing, and a continued belief in the 
legitimacy of collective punishment of a wrongdoer&#8217;s family members, even when they are 
completely innocent in the matter. It is, however, also important not to exaggerate the 
magnitude of the problem. While the Government has taken important steps to address 
blood feuds, much more can be done to ensure adequate research to address root causes and 
to bolster and target education efforts so that individuals do not resort to private violence or 
collective punishment of family members as a means of dispute resolution. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also investigated domestic violence against women, which 
is pervasive in Albania and has resulted in victims&#8217; deaths. Despite efforts by the 
Government and international donors, much remains to be done by the Government, 
including the allocation of necessary financial and other resources to fund shelters, 
counselling and educational programmes. 
</p>
<p> The Government should also prioritize accountability &#8211; with action and not just 
words &#8211; for past crimes, including cooperation with the various investigations into killings 
that allegedly took place in Albania following the Kosovo war, prosecution of all those 
responsible for the deaths in G&#235;rdec, and a full and transparent accounting for the 
thousands of disappearances and deaths during the communist era.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited Albania from 15 to 23 February 2010 to investigate extrajudicial 
executions, primarily in relation to blood feuds and domestic violence. I also investigated 
issues of accountability relating to other alleged killings. 
</p>
<p>2. The cooperation provided to me by all levels of the Government of Albania was 
exemplary. I am also grateful for the cooperation extended by international and domestic 
civil society representatives, victims&#8217; family members, and witnesses. I deeply appreciate 
the support provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, the Human Rights 
Adviser and other members of the United Nations country team in Albania.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>3. Despite their anachronistic nature, blood feuds are still a significant problem in 
Albania. Relevant policies and programmes can only work, however, if based on an 
accurate and well-rounded understanding of the problem. Unfortunately, the statistics on 
those killed, and families isolated as a result, vary wildly from one source to another. 
Factors that have combined to create confusion and misunderstanding include 
terminological imprecision; sensationalist media coverage, especially by the international 
press; international donor fascination with what appears to be an &#8220;exotic&#8221; remnant of the 
country&#8217;s feudal history; civil society incentives to be overly inclusive in their counting; 
and Government sensitivity leading to a concern to downplay the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> A. What is a blood feud? 
</b></p>
<p>4. Blood feuds generally arise out of an argument, usually between two men whose 
families are neighbours or friends. The argument could have any cause, including an 
accident, a perceived insult, a property ownership disagreement or a conflict over access to 
electricity, water or fuel.1 The argument escalates into a physical fight, and one man kills 
the other. The victim&#8217;s family then feels that it is &#8220;owed blood&#8221; by the killer&#8217;s family. This 
blood debt carries a related loss of honour, which can only be satisfied by taking the life of 
a member of the killer&#8217;s family. The situation is generally governed by culturally embedded 
rules, generally derived from the <i>kanun</i>, as codified by Lek&#235; Dukagjinit in the fifteenth 
century and updated in the first half of the twentieth century by Shtjef&#235;n Gje&#231;ov.2 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Feuds have often been over &#8220;seduction, abduction, runaway wives, or the refusal of a girl to marry the 
</p>
<p>man she was betrothed to . . . and land disputes.&#8221; Mentor Mustafa and Antonia Young, &#8220;Feud 
narratives: contemporary deployments of <i>kanun</i> in Shala Valley, northern Albania&#8221;, <i>Anthropological 
Notebooks</i>, vol. 14, no. 2, Slovene Anthropological Society, 2008, p. 93. 
</p>
<p> 2 Despite the importance of these codification efforts, the <i>kanun</i> is largely a set of orally transmitted 
customary rules, the content of which differs from region to region and over time. See ibid., p. 94 
(&#8220;Ethnographic studies of blood feuds find that the <i>kanun</i> should be considered the &#8216;ideal&#8217; version; 
but in reality, blood feuds are managed quite differently in different local contexts.&#8221;). Under the 
traditional requirements of <i>kanun</i>, as soon as one person kills another, the murderer should inform the 
victim&#8217;s family, so that there is no confusion regarding the identity of the perpetrator. Kanun, art. 164. 
After the initial killing, the <i>kanun</i> calls for a truce so that the murderer can attend the victim&#8217;s funeral. 
Kanun, arts. 854-856. Local practices may differ, however, and based on accounts of blood feuds in 
the Shkodra region and Puka, in some localities the victim&#8217;s family is understood to be permitted to 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>5. A great deal of definitional confusion has resulted from the fact that different actors 
tend to use different meanings of the terms &#8220;blood feud&#8221; and &#8220;blood feud killings&#8221;. The 
narrowest understanding of a blood feud (<i>gjakmarrja</i>), based on the above fact-pattern, is 
that it is a premeditated familial avenging of lost blood; that is, where the family of a 
murdered victim kills a member of the perpetrator&#8217;s family to restore the honour and blood 
lost as a result of the initial murder. One anthropologist thus refers to a blood feud as a 
&#8220;sanctioned killing that cleanses honour with blood to avenge a crime or infringement upon 
the honour of oneself or one&#8217;s family.&#8221;3 
</p>
<p>6. A less strict interpretation will classify any revenge killing (<i>hakmarrja</i>) between 
families as a blood feud regardless of any reference to the need to restore blood and honour 
or of guidance by any <i>kanun</i>-related considerations.4 In still broader understandings &#8211; which 
are also sometimes referred to as <i>hakmarrja</i> &#8211; even a revenge killing without a familial 
dimension (for example, killings between gangs) could be counted as blood feud killings. 
</p>
<p>7. The broadest and most questionable definition would count any initial killing 
because it may, at some point, lead the victim&#8217;s family to seek revenge against the 
perpetrator&#8217;s family. An equally questionable approach is to count among families 
characterized as self-isolated &#8220;due to blood feud&#8221; cases in which no killing had occurred 
and without any strong or formal element of self-isolation, but where a physical assault, a 
threat or some intense dispute had created a family or neighbourly feud. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Impact of blood feuds on families 
</b></p>
<p>8. Although it is primarily the alleged murderer who is targeted for a blood feud killing 
under <i>kanun</i>, local practices may differ so that potential targets also include other male 
relatives of the alleged murderer, including brothers, uncles, children and grandchildren. In 
northern Albania, as an example, families identify according to their <i>fisi i madh</i> (the clan or 
tribe, generally consisting of approximately 100 households, which may be spread over two 
or more villages) and their <i>fisi i vog&#235;l</i> (a smaller unit based on patrilineage, which usually 
encompasses five to ten households). It is the small <i>fis</i> that is relevant in the context of 
blood feuds and it is generally the nuclear family (<i>familja</i> or <i>sht&#235;pia</i>, consisting of parents, 
their children, the father&#8217;s parents, any son&#8217;s wife and children) that &#8220;carries the burden of 
revenge&#8221;.5 The basic shared understanding, however, is that the killer&#8217;s family is implicated 
by his act, thus entitling the victim&#8217;s family to take revenge against them. 
</p>
<p>9. Family members of those subjected to blood feuds, and mediators, emphasized that 
it is generally not permitted to kill a family member in his own home, or to kill women or 
children. Thus, for those families observing the traditions of blood feuds, when the initial 
killing occurs, the male members of the killer&#8217;s family immediately &#8220;self-isolate&#8221; by not 
leaving their home. This self-isolation is maintained even where there are no specific 
threats or assault attempts by the other family. The isolated family presumes that an attack 
is possible, unless the other family offers them a <i>besa</i> (a reprieve from the threat of 
revenge, which is often limited in scope or temporary in duration). Isolated families often 
</p>
<p>  
take revenge on the murdered or any of his male family members encountered within the first 24 
hours of the murder.  
</p>
<p> 3 Mustafa and Young, &#8220;Feud narratives&#8221;, p. 95. 
 4  The term <i>gjakmarrja</i> is often used interchangeably with <i>hakmarrja</i>, a broader term that encompasses 
</p>
<p>the concept of revenge or obtaining justice by taking back something justly owed, including, for 
example, a stolen object, or a revenge killing.  
</p>
<p> 5 Mustafa and Young, &#8220;Feud narratives&#8221;, p. 92. Traditionally it is considered a waste of one&#8217;s own 
blood to kill within the <i>fis</i>, although one study found that 28 per cent of intra-<i>fis</i> feuds in the northern 
Albanian Shala Valley. Ibid., p. 100. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>also feel that, in the absence of a <i>besa</i>, honour requires them to remain isolated, even where 
there has been no concrete threat of vengeance. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Resolution of blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>10. The blood feud continues until the lost blood is avenged or until the family of the 
deceased man forgives the killer&#8217;s family. When it occurs, forgiveness generally follows 
lengthy mediation. The <i>kanun</i> sets out the steps for mediation and conflict resolution, 
essentially requiring that the offending party repay the blood debt so that the honour of the 
victim&#8217;s family is restored in the eyes of the community. The settlement may be in goods, 
such as livestock, or in money (although monetary payments are often not regarded as the 
most honourable means of settling a blood debt), and may also include the agreement of the 
offender&#8217;s family to relocate from the area or community. Marriage between feuding 
families may also settle a feud.6 I was informed by mediators that settlements often require 
the offending party to never again mention the killing, reflecting the traditional sense that it 
is inappropriate to discuss settlement terms. Reconciliation is generally formalized in a 
ceremony. 
</p>
<p>11. Mediation is usually performed by a male elder of stature in the community. The 
mediation process is seen as delicate and sensitive, involving overtures to family members 
directly affected by the blood feud, as well as other family members who may intercede, 
and may take years to resolve. One reconciliation ceremony that took place around the time 
of my visit involved a feud that had been resolved after approximately 50 years. A number 
of non-governmental organizations devoted to the reconciliation of blood feuds have also 
been established in recent years.7 They perform reconciliations on a voluntary basis, 
receiving payment only for their expenses. Payment to mediators is not prohibited, 
however, and some interlocutors expressed concern that monetary incentives may be 
involved, with negative consequences. 
</p>
<p>12. Government officials may also play a helpful role. District officials and police in 
Shkodra detailed their own successful efforts in some cases to work with local religious 
leaders and mediators to ensure the security of families and children and to permit isolated 
children to return to school. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Disputed extent of blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>13. As noted above, there are deep discrepancies in the statistics concerning blood feuds 
and related killings. At one extreme, media reports have referred to hundreds of blood feud 
killings per year and thousands of children living in isolation.8 At the other, according to 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Ibid., p. 103. 
 7 These include the Albanian Foundation for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation of Disputes, the 
</p>
<p>Committee for Nationwide Reconciliation and the League of Peace Ministries, House of Justice and 
National Reconciliation. 
</p>
<p> 8 See for example Nicola Smith, &#8220;Blood feuds trap 1,200 Albanian youths at home&#8221;, <i>Sunday Times</i>, 20 
January 2008 (in which the author cites figures from non-governmental organizations reporting that 
&#8220;1,200 children are without schooling because of feuds&#8221;, and that &#8220;since the end of the communist 
dictatorship in 1990, more than 20,000 families have been affected by blood feuds and 6,000 lives 
have been lost.&#8221;); Richard Pine, &#8220;Albania&#8217;s deadly tradition of blood feuds as pervasive as ever&#8221;, <i>Irish 
Times</i>, 26 June 2009 (in which the author refers to unspecified &#8220;official figures&#8221; that, from 1998 to 
2003, &#8220;put the number of feud-related deaths at 330; today it is approximately 10 per cent or less of 
all murders in the country. In one southern town, 28 deaths have been directly identified with a single 
blood-feud over a seven-year period&#8221;); and Bojan Pancevski and Nita Hoxha, &#8220;Thousands fear as 
blood feuds sweep Albania&#8221;, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 3 June 2007 (in which the authors refer to &#8220;more than 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>Government statistics, such killings fell steadily from 45 in 1998 to just one in 2009, while 
the number of isolated children ranges from 36 to 57 countrywide, of which 29 to 45 in 
Shkodra.9 The variation in Government figures depended on whether the sources were 
police, education, or ministry officials.10 The Government estimates that 124 to 133 
families are in isolation countrywide.11 
</p>
<p>14. The figures used by civil society groups also vary widely. The Albanian Foundation 
for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation of Disputes, an organization, with extensive 
field operations, told me that there had been significant reductions over the past five years 
and that there were currently only a few blood feud killings per year, with most cases taking 
place in Shkodra, Puke and the Malesise se Madhe districts. The organization estimated that 
not more than 350 families and 80 to 100 children were in isolation nationally. Another 
prominent organization, however, estimated some 9,800 blood feud killings since 1991, 
dropping to a figure still in excess of 30 in 2009.12 By their calculations, there were 1,450 
families and 800 children in isolation nationally.13 
</p>
<p>15. My own carefully considered view is that the correct numbers are at the lower end of 
the scale. Consistent with the view of the Government and the non-governmental 
organization with extensive field experience cited above, there are now few blood feud 
killings each year. The official figures for isolation seem more likely to be an 
underestimate, but not by a large margin. This is not to say that any one set of published 
estimates is definitive. Their accuracy is limited by inadequate data-gathering and recording 
techniques, and insufficient coordination. Even the official figures provided were 
inconsistent, and there seems to be no sustained effort to reconcile the discrepancies that 
result from definitional differences, underreporting, limited coverage of issues and 
incentives to exaggerate. 
</p>
<p>16. The largest discrepancy results from the use of differing definitions described above 
&#8211; from the narrow <i>gjakmarrja</i> revenge killing of a member of the perpetrator&#8217;s family to 
avenge honour, to the <i>hakmarrja</i> revenge killing that is unrelated to the restoration of 
honour. Both of these understandings &#8211; the narrow <i>gjakmarrja</i> and the broader <i>hakmarrja</i> &#8211; 
are reflected in most police and court statistics, especially since it is difficult to prove any 
specific cultural motivation for a particular killing. The greatest distortion is caused by 
counting as a &#8220;blood feud&#8221; any killing that might lead, at some point, to revenge. 
</p>
<p>17. Comparable problems result from differing interpretations of the effect or impact of 
blood feuds on family members. Some statistics count children who are &#8220;completely&#8221; 
isolated and unable to go to school as affected by blood feuds, while others include children 
who occasionally leave the house (including to go to school).14 
</p>
<p>  
20,000 [families] in the country who live under an ever-present death sentence because of &#8230; blood 
feuds&#8221;). 
</p>
<p> 9 See appendix II. 
 10 According to figures provided to me by the police, in Shkodra district in 2009, there were 90 families 
</p>
<p>(228 individuals) in isolation, with 45 children unable to attend school but receiving State-provided 
schooling through the Second Chance programme. According to the Ministry of Education, there 
were 41 children in the Second Chance programme, of whom 22 were boys and 19 girls. 
</p>
<p> 11 According to statistics provided by the national police, as at February 2010, there were 133 families 
in isolation, of whom 83 were in Shkodra district, 7 in Malesise se Madhe district, 13 in Lezha 
district, 8 in Kurbin district and 15 in Kukes district.

</b></p>
<p>18. A second factor is underreporting by affected families or officials. Killings in remote 
areas might not be systematically reported, and some families opt to pursue traditional 
remedies and avoid all State involvement. In addition, to the extent that statistics are based 
on court judgements, they may be a poor indicator of blood feud killings because the 
perpetrator of a premeditated blood feud killing may be found guilty of a lesser charge, 
whether because of insufficient evidence, a family refusal to testify or corruption leading to 
a conviction for a lesser offence. 
</p>
<p>19. The coverage of Government programmes may also be incomplete. For example, 
Government figures on children in isolation are based on its Second Chance home-
schooling programme, which goes only through ninth grade; older children are thus not 
covered. Similarly, focusing only on those killed and on self-isolated children will only 
partly capture the total of lives seriously affected by blood feuds. 
</p>
<p>20. A fourth factor is a tendency by some groups to overstate the magnitude of the 
problem to enhance their funding prospects. While various non-governmental organizations 
do extremely good work on these issues, many officials and independent observers 
expressed concern that a small number of groups deliberately exaggerate for fund-raising 
purposes. One group, for example, cited the figure of 300 police officers killed since 1991 
in the line of duty. The historical accuracy of this figure cannot be confirmed, but it seems 
highly questionable, especially since police records over the past five years show just four 
killings of police in the line of duty. Some mediators told me that blood feud statistics 
should include all persons affected by any possible source of conflict that could be 
governed by <i>kanun</i>. Such a figure, however, would number in the tens of thousands and 
bear little or no relation to actual blood feuds. International donors do not help the situation 
when they provide funding for blood feud-related programmes without adequate scrutiny. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Causes  
</b></p>
<p>21. Commentators attribute the revival of the blood feud to various causes. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Criminal and civil justice systems 
</b></p>
<p>22. The blood feud phenomenon re-emerged at the end of the communist era and 
increased significantly following the 1997 breakdown in law and order.15 Many observers 
consider that the absence of effective governmental responses to criminality and the 
inability of the civilian justice system to provide effective dispute resolution have 
encouraged Albanian citizens to use <i>kanun</i>-based mechanisms to obtain justice.16 Since 
1998, the justice system has been almost entirely transformed from its non-adversarial 
communist-era structure to a more modern one with checks and balances, although in 
practice much remains to be done to implement those reforms, build capacity and train 
Government officials.17 
</p>
<p>23. Weaknesses that undermine citizens&#8217; trust in the legal system exist at all stages of 
the process and among all institutions. Historically, Albania had no experience with an 
</p>
<p>  
 15 In 1997, the Government of Albania collapsed following the failure of financial pyramid schemes in 
</p>
<p>which a large share of the population had invested. The national armouries were looted and large 
numbers of people fled the country as a result of instability and economic hardship. 
</p>
<p> 16 Accounts of the blood feud phenomenon in the post-communist period almost uniformly identify as a 
cause individuals&#8217; recourse to an alternative justice system because the State justice system is, in 
reality and perception, subject to political pressure, inefficient and corrupt.  
</p>
<p> 17 Council of Europe, report by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, on his visit 
to Albania, 18 June 2008. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>adversarial justice system and the Government has not done enough to build the necessary 
understanding of the system.18 In addition, the judicial process lacks transparency: poorly 
reasoned decisions are issued by often inadequately trained judges, judgements are often 
not published or made easily available, and public access to judicial proceedings is limited 
by the inadequate size and availability of courtrooms. Enforcement mechanisms, including 
bailiffs&#8217; powers, are also lacking. Even reasoned and reasonable decisions may not result in 
effective remedies. This applies in both the criminal and civil contexts, especially in 
relation to property disputes.19 Other major problems include the lack of reliable data on 
judicial processes and enforcement and the lack of meaningful institutional monitoring and 
evaluation mechanisms, both of which impede effective reform. 
</p>
<p>24. Although the Constitution guarantees separation of powers, it is widely 
acknowledged that there is improper political influence on the judiciary at all levels.20 
Constitutional rights are either not reflected in the Criminal or Civil Procedure Codes, or 
not implemented in practice because of a lack of resources, lack of infrastructure, 
inexperienced judges and counsel, and corruption. Interlocutors also raised concerns about 
the treatment of the constitutional immunity of ministers and judges in the Criminal 
Procedure Code. This immunity applies from the earliest stage of investigation, rather than 
at the point of charge or arrest. Thus, the target of what is often a sensitive investigation is 
informed as soon as an investigation is instigated, thus jeopardizing the chances of an 
effective investigation. 
</p>
<p>25. A number of interlocutors also raised concerns about the impact of corruption in the 
justice system on charges and sentencing for blood feud-related killings.21 There is at least a 
widely held perception that bribing a judge may result in a lower sentence. Bribing a 
prosecutor was also seen as a means of reducing the potential charge from that for blood 
feuds, which carries a 20-year minimum sentence, to one that carries a lesser sentence. 
These concerns highlight the need for judicial probity to maintain the ability of the justice 
system to prosecute and punish killings effectively. They also underscore the necessity of 
anti-corruption and oversight measures. 
</p>
<p>26. Finally, there is continuing &#8211; and destabilizing &#8211; uncertainty around the composition 
of the Constitutional Court and the criteria and process for the appointment of judges to the 
Court. The Constitutional Court is a vital component in upholding the rule of law in 
Albania. The terms of two thirds of the judges expired in early 2010, and they were due to 
be replaced by the President, with the consent of the Assembly. In any such situation, a 
Government runs the risk of being seen to use the opportunity to significantly alter the 
composition of the court in its own favour. It is therefore important for the Government to 
demonstrate that the replacement process is governed by procedures that are, and can be 
seen to be, fair. It is desirable for the Government to commit itself, in all judicial 
appointments, to transparent procedures formulated to ensure a qualified and independent 
judiciary, and to reflect those procedures in legislation. 
</p>
<p>27. While the criminal justice system is thus significantly flawed, suggestions that it is 
so inefficient and corrupt as to necessitate continuing resort to blood feuds to achieve

<p>justice appear misplaced. There is no evidence that a perceived law and order vacuum 
explains a continuing attachment to the practice of blood feuds. While some cases, 
particularly older ones, remain unresolved, and some accused killers have gone into hiding 
or fled the country and not been extradited, in most of the cases I examined, the killer had 
either surrendered or been quickly arrested, and was prosecuted and sentenced. Moreover, 
the reduction in recent years in the overall homicide rate has also brought with it a 
reduction in blood feuds, thus attesting to the impact of more effective policing, among 
other factors. 
</p>
<p>28. A much more salient problem is that many families involved in blood feuds do not 
see the State&#8217;s criminal justice system as being capable of addressing their concerns, which 
centre on the loss of blood and honour caused by the initial killing. Sentencing a killer to a 
long prison term might be inadequate to satisfy some families&#8217; conception of justice, which 
requires restoration of the lost blood, either through a revenge killing or a voluntary formal 
reconciliation between the families. The actions of the State vis-&#224;-vis the perpetrator are 
thus sometimes perceived to be irrelevant in the families&#8217; evaluation of whether there has 
been a &#8220;just&#8221; response. 
</p>
<p>29. On the other hand, the State&#8217;s role in relation to the family in isolation varies. For 
many such families, it is limited at best. Some believe that, in practical terms, there is little 
the State could do to protect them. Others think the State should do little because matters of 
honour and respect must be resolved privately, rather than by the police. One such family 
indicated to me that, although they were deeply unhappy with the restraints and strictures of 
isolation under <i>kanun</i>, they felt obliged to remain in isolation in deference to the other 
family&#8217;s respect for <i>kanun</i> rules. To this family, State intervention was beside the point. 
Moreover, many isolated families never receive a specific threat to which police could 
respond; they just believe that the lack of <i>besa</i> means they could be targeted at any time. 
</p>
<p>30. There are, however, cases in which the State could play a more active protection role 
for the isolated family. Offers to monitor are sometimes made, but it is not clear how 
seriously they are followed up. In one case in which I received evidence, the individual 
subject to threats and isolation sought protection from the local police and Government 
officials, but was told that, unless he could document and prove that he was under threat, he 
could receive no assistance. Internal relocation has occurred, but a more systematic 
programme could be developed. Threats could be tracked more effectively and prosecuted 
far more often than has been the case to date. 
</p>
<p>31. Each of these weaknesses, and the actions necessary for reform, have been 
exhaustively analysed and addressed by entities, including the European Assistance 
Mission to the Albanian Justice System, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, the Council of Europe, the United States Agency for International Development, 
and international civil society organizations, such as the American Bar Association.22 The 
problem is not a lack of analysis or a dearth of recommendations. Rather, greater 
coordination among institutions and, above all, the exercise of political will and 
deployment of necessary resources to implement reforms are necessary.

<p><b> 2. Property disputes 
</b></p>

blood feuds, in the post-communist era.23 In one village in Shkodra district, for example, I

</p>
<p>was provided with evidence of six families who were in isolation as a result of blood feuds; 
the underlying cause in four of these cases was property disputes. Expert interlocutors told 
me that, given the current state of property and land reform, property issues would continue 
to be a source of conflict for the foreseeable future. Yet, neither the Government nor civil 
society has attempted to collect or analyse data on the issue, including which of the many 
complex aspects of the country&#8217;s post-communist property decollectivization and land 
reform process gives rise to blood feuds. Police statistics indicate that killings as a result of 
property disputes appear to be tracked separately from blood feud or revenge killings, 
although they may be related.24 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Background 
</i></p>
<p>33. That the property and land reform system has been at best confusing and at worst 
chaotic will come as little surprise, given the magnitude and complexity of the challenges. 
The source of conflicts and complexity extends back to the collectivization of land 
ownership starting in the 1940s, and a brief background is necessary to understand the 
likely reasons that property disputes continue to give rise to blood feuds.25 
</p>
<p>34. The post-Second World War communist regime abolished nearly all property rights. 
Beginning in 1945 with agricultural land, property was nationalized. By 1980, 76 per cent 
of agricultural land was cultivated by &#8220;agricultural production cooperatives&#8221;, 21 per cent by 
State farms and 3 per cent by private owners.26 In 1991, following the collapse of 
communism and in the face of an economic crisis, the new Government began a massive 
and speedy transition to a market economy through, in large part, the privatization of land 
and housing and its distribution to private parties and historical owners. Problems arise 
from the very beginning of this process. 
</p>
<p>35. First, the complexity of the legal structure of privatization and the enormity of the 
task led to confusion and a lack of uniformity. Each category of land and of ownership &#8211; 
agricultural fields (arable land), forests, pastures, housing properties with or without land 
plots, urban properties, commercial structures, and so on &#8211; has its own regime of law, with 
separately defined procedures for privatization, property registration and compensation. For 
certain kinds of land, there may also be restrictions on those seeking to obtain ownership or 
usage rights.27 Thus, for example, privatization of agricultural land was governed by a law 
mandating that prior ownership of land was to have no impact on distribution, while the law 
on privatization of other immovable property mandated that it be returned to the former 
owners.28 In 2004, a new legal framework for property restitution and compensation was 
</p>

pertaining to issues of honour or violations of the home (e.g., theft, trespassing, etc.)&#8221;). See also 
Mustafa and Young, &#8220;Feud narratives&#8221;, pp. 90-100; and World Bank, Status of Land Reform and Real 
Property in Albania, Tirana, 2006, p. 17. 
</p>
<p> 24 There was confusion and apparent discrepancies between definitions and the explanations of national 
and district police specifically with regard to statistics relating to property motive-based killings or 
disputes. According to the national police, killings due to &#8220;property motive&#8221; were not related to blood 
feuds. According to the police in Shkodra district, however, the single greatest cause of blood feud 
killings was property disputes, but the statistics on these killings were not included in the numbers for 
blood feuds, but rather in the statistics for murders committed for &#8220;weak&#8221; motives, which were 
provided at a national level, but not at the Shkodra district level.

<p>established, but it too has been plagued with problems, including inconsistency in 
application and lack of resources and funding.29 Second, parcels and property units were so 
fragmented during collectivization that owners have often had to enter into multiple 
processes and transactions for approval to use their property even in a routine way. This has 
added to insecurity about property rights and generated an extralegal system of property 
transfer. Third, the Government agencies responsible for each step of the process and for 
the various kinds of property privatization regime often have overlapping and sometimes 
vague mandates, further leading to delays, confusion and high costs. 
</p>
<p>36. Progress lags on each of the three major reform prongs that would clarify and 
guarantee citizens&#8217; title to their property: registration, legalization, and restitution and 
compensation. Diverse problems at each level contribute to the insecurity of title for what is 
the principal asset or source of livelihood for most citizens. That insecurity is heightened in 
the view of many interlocutors by what is seen as the Government&#8217;s constantly shifting 
strategy to address land and property ownership reform. Such heightened insecurity, 
combined with chronic delays in resolving disputes, enhances the likelihood of resort by 
some to alternative, private and violent means of dispute resolution, which may in turn give 
rise to blood feuds. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Causes and patterns of conflicts over property 
</i></p>
<p>37. Although there has been no study of how, why and to what extent property disputes 
specifically give rise to blood feuds, my investigations and review of the available literature 
illustrate some of the likely causes and patterns for feuds arising out of the privatization of 
agricultural land, which are discussed as an example below. Much more detailed and 
specific study is, however, necessary in order to isolate the causes of different kinds of 
property-based feuds, and to enact the necessary targeted reforms and solutions. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Disputes over boundaries and property usage rights 
</i></p>
<p>38. Law No. 7501, the original law on land privatization enacted in 1991, presupposed 
that there were clearly defined boundaries for properties and for villages. Years of 
collectivization, however, often blurred recollections, and recordkeeping has not always 
been uniform or accurate. Thus, conflicts may arise over the boundaries of land to be 
redistributed or the nature of historical agreements about the right to graze animals or log 
timber. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) State corruption and inefficiency 
</i></p>
<p>39. In a number of areas, the issuance of <i>Tapi</i> &#8211; land certificates that are the first step to 
establishing title under Law 7501 &#8211; lagged behind the allocation or occupation of land, 
leading to uncertainty and conflicts among villagers.30 Often, the actions of local officials 
aggravate conflicts by mis-measuring land parcels, allocating land on the basis of 
corruption and favouritism, or failing to communicate their decisions efficiently and 
accurately to other relevant Government offices.31

</p>
<p><i> (e) Dispute patterns based on pre-collectivization ownership and geography 
</i></p>
<p>40. The patterns of property-related disputes vary according to geography and who 
owned the property at the time it was collectivized. In the southern part of Albania, for 
example &#8211; where there are comparatively fewer reported blood feuds &#8211; collectivized land 
originally belonged primarily to the owners of large estates who were killed or went into 
exile, and thus are less likely to dispute ownership again. The current occupants of the land 
thus have less strong familial attachment to it, and privatization and reallocation and 
restitution have resulted in relatively little conflict.32 In contrast, land in the north-east, 
where there are comparatively more reported blood feuds, and in the central part was more 
widely and evenly distributed before collectivization.33 Collectivization was also a more 
recent phenomenon in the north-east. As a result, in these areas, families and clans may 
want to reclaim their ancestral lands and conflict is far more likely. 
</p>
<p>41. Geography and internal migration also gave rise to conflict between relative 
&#8220;newcomers&#8221; and longer-term &#8220;locals&#8221;.34 In addition, in instances in which individual 
families built houses on collectivized land, disputes arise when the land &#8211; but not the 
relatively new housing &#8211; is redistributed or reverts to hereditary owners.35 
</p>
<p><i> (f) </i>Kanun<i>-related issues 
</i></p>
<p>42. According to ethnographic studies and surveys, attachment to &#8220;ancestral land&#8221; and 
thus the desire to assert pre-collectivization rights is based not just on emotional ties but 
also on security concerns. Some feel that obtaining title to a &#8220;father&#8217;s land&#8221;, as recognized 
by the community under <i>kanun</i>-based precepts on ownership, is a stronger guarantee of 
rights vis-&#224;-vis neighbours and the community than the &#8220;legal&#8221; guarantee of a relatively 
new central Government with a justice system that is seen as weak.36 In parts of the 
mountainous north-east (for example, in Kukes), families and clans have reportedly ignored 
the restrictions of Law No. 7501 and have in fact redistributed land according to old 
boundaries and <i>kanun</i> principles, which have &#8220;exhaustive guidelines&#8221; on boundary 
recognition.37 In these areas, disputes may arise over differences between property 
allocation under <i>kanun</i>, and that required under Law No. 7501. Conflicts may also arise for 
more traditional <i>kanun</i>-based reasons, such as familial disagreements over tradition-based 
inheritance rights.38 
</p>
<p><i> (g)  Shortcomings of the legal system 
</i></p>
<p>43. The inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the justice system is the main barrier to the 
resolution of property disputes by courts instead of through illegal and extralegal 
measures.39 The problems described above mean that judgements are long delayed, 
unregistered, unexecuted or ignored.40 Both the Government and donors are taking steps to 
address the broader reforms needed in the Albanian justice system, but training and specific

<p>reforms targeted at resolving land and property cases would significantly reduce the 
likelihood of resort to extralegal or traditional measures.41 
</p>
<p><b> D. Socio-economic effects  
</b></p>
<p>44. Isolation imposed by blood feuds has an impact not only on males, but also on 
women and children who are subject to home confinement. Such families are denied their 
rights not just to freedom of movement, but also to education, childhood development, 
social security, access to health care and to vote. 
</p>
<p>45. I requested statistics on the number of families and individuals who leave the 
country and seek asylum elsewhere as a result of blood feuds, but was told by the national 
police that this information did not exist because people generally do not provide 
information about the basis for their departure. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Need to increase efforts to address blood feuds  
</b></p>
<p>46. Important steps have been taken in the past five years to address blood feuds. The 
Criminal Code has been amended in important respects (minimum sentences and specific 
criminalization of blood feuds and blood feud killings),42 and specialized police and 
prosecution units have been created to investigate blood feud killings and conflicts.43 A 
high-level coordination committee on blood feuds was established by the Government in 
2005, but it appears to have achieved little. The Second Chance programme of the Ministry 
of Education is an effective means of providing home schooling for isolated children. 
Based on my investigations in Shkodra district, the programme is staffed by clearly 
dedicated officials and teachers. But much more could and should be done. 
</p>
<p>47. Many interlocutors suggested the Government could do relatively little beyond its 
existing efforts to eliminate blood feuds and that community groups must do the rest 
themselves.44 I disagree. I believe that the Government has important additional work to do 
in research, community education and outreach. 
</p>
<p>48. In research terms, the deeper cultural underpinnings of the system require better 
understanding, which can be promoted through sustained interdisciplinary research. Two 
examples illustrate some insights based on my research. First, it is important to recognize 
that there are significantly different levels of self-isolation. Some people are virtually 
confined full time, while others go out occasionally, and still others might leave the house 
quite often. All would consider themselves to be in isolation, however, because the families 
concerned have not yet reconciled. I also did not find significant evidence that women self-
isolated for fear of being the subject of a revenge attack. A large number of girls did self-
</p>
<p>  
 41 Ibid., pp. 77-78. 
 42 See Albanian Criminal Code, articles 78 (blood feud murder carries a sentence of 25 years to life) and 
</p>
<p>83(a) (serious threats of revenge or blood feud to a person or minor causing them to stay isolated 
results in a fine or up to three years of confinement).  
</p>
<p> 43 In Shkodra, for example, the police told me that, in 2004-2007, a specialized unit was established to 
focus on criminal activity related to blood feuds or arising out of a revenge motive. Personnel 
assigned to this section investigated alleged crimes for prosecution, and also monitored the security of 
families in isolation as a result of blood feuds. The police attributed the decline in blood feuds in 
Shkodra largely to these efforts, and stated that the special unit had been merged back into the regular 
police force. 
</p>
<p> 44 In Shkodra, for example, the police stated that they were often unable to protect families in isolation 
as a result of a blood feud because these families refused to make official complaints.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>isolate, though this tended to be out of respect for the other family or fear that the girls 
would be assaulted or trafficked. In other words, more research will provide a more 
accurate picture of the challenges that need to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>49. Community education is also important. Although more research is needed, it is 
clear that low educational levels, especially in the areas most affected by blood feuds, are 
an important contributing factor to the decision to revenge killings. The north-east, in which 
feuds are the most common, is the poorest region in Albania.45 Community education 
requires schooling and training, as well as broader community outreach. This includes 
educating citizens about the justice system and confronting the notion that collective 
punishment is acceptable. Such notions are utterly incompatible with the assumptions upon 
which Albanian society now operates, and the Government should encourage a greater 
understanding of the individual foundations of rights. Greater State involvement is also 
necessary to educate families who, once a killing has occurred, might turn for advice to 
civil society interlocutors who unnecessarily invoke the <i>kanun</i>. The perpetuation of the 
<i>kanun</i> mentality might unintentionally result. 
</p>
<p>50. Indeed, a number of self-isolating families indicated that they may not have gone 
into isolation were it not for pressure from societal elders or mediators to follow <i>kanun</i>-
based precepts. This was borne out by a recent study carried out by the Justice and Peace 
Commission of Albania and Caritas.46 Some 75 per cent of adults surveyed in 12 different 
districts of Albania stated that they knew little or nothing about <i>kanun</i>, and 81 per cent 
&#8220;blamed&#8221; the <i>kanun</i> for being the main cause of blood feuds.47 For 57 per cent of those 
surveyed, killings were better dealt with through law enforcement.48 
</p>
<p>51. Finally, the Government could play a stronger role in outreach, especially in 
facilitating efforts to achieve family reconciliation, which to date has been almost 
completely left to families themselves and civil society.49 A number of interlocutors 
informed me that they had approached the Government for assistance to end their self-
isolation through reconciliation, but the State did little in response. The Government should 
be aware that while traditional mediation services can assist, they also perpetuate a parallel 
structure for conflict resolution that may be to the detriment of the government&#8217;s goal of 
strengthening courts to achieve justice.

<p>for blood feud mediation, who can work as a mediator and how the process works. The law provides 
that mediation is fully voluntary, and neither family should pay for it. The law also provides that the 
non-governmental organizations that conduct the mediation must be registered, the mediators must be 
especially trained, and the organizations must complete studies on the conflicts addressed.

Survey, March 2009. The survey found that 50.6 per cent of surveyed women reported emotional

</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>often spousal abuse, although it has also resulted from attempts to restore &#8220;honour&#8221;. 
According to official figures, 15 women were killed as a result of domestic violence in 
2008 and 2009.51 In 2005, there were 21 homicides resulting from violence in the home, and 
25 murder threats.52 The number of women killed as a result of domestic violence is likely 
an undercount because of the limitations of Government statistics on the causes of deaths, 
families underreporting of &#8220;private&#8221; violence and death, and the possibility that deaths 
occur, especially in rural areas or informal settlements, without the State being notified. 
</p>
<p>53. Apart from some commendable civil society efforts and the recent report of the 
National Institute of Statistics (the first comprehensive national domestic violence survey), 
there have been few efforts at reliable recordkeeping on, or sociological and other analysis 
of, the high level of violence in the home and the deaths that result. The few studies that are 
specific to Albania highlight cultural factors, including a strong historic tradition of male 
dominance,53 the fact that domestic violence has long been considered to be a &#8220;normal&#8221;, 
private part of family life, and that Albanian society has emphasized hierarchical family 
order and intergenerational control.54 The <i>kanun</i> is also seen as contributing to a culture of 
disrespect for and violence against women because of its patriarchal approach (for example, 
referring to women as sacks or a burden) and because it specifically sanctions violence, 
including murder of a wife for violations of the husband&#8217;s &#8220;honour&#8221; or for adultery,55 and 
beating for a disobedient wife.56 Women who are unemployed, less educated and living in 
rural areas are also seen as more vulnerable to violence.57

<p>54. High domestic violence levels have recently received much-needed attention. The 
Government, with United Nations support, has developed a national strategy on gender 
equality and domestic violence (2007-1010),58 which appraises State institutions dealing 
with domestic violence. It exposes failures of capacity, effectiveness, training and 
recordkeeping on the part of public health and medical officials, the police and the 
judiciary. It proposes extensive reforms to enhance victim protection and the investigation 
and punishment of perpetrators, a judicial and police infrastructure to protect victims, 
enhanced Government/civil society cooperation to assist victims, specialized training for 
public health, police and judicial officials, an information-sharing protocol and 
maintenance of reliable statistics. 
</p>
<p>55. The 2006 Law against Domestic Violence sets up a network of authorities for 
protection, rehabilitation and prevention, establishes victim support structures and enhances 
judicial protection measures for victims. Donors have funded training for police, court and 
other officials, special domestic violence police units have been established, and shelters

</p>
<p>have increasingly been supported. Education campaigns have been launched and civil 
society groups have played an active mobilizing role. 
</p>
<p>56. The above-mentioned efforts have led to dramatic increases in the number of women 
reporting violence to police officials (from 270 in 2007 to over 1,000 in 2009), of 
protection orders and of offenders prosecuted.59 Experts have also noted encouraging 
changes in official attitudes to domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>57. Attitutes remain a major challenge, however, especially with regard to Government 
budgeting for programme initiatives. Most financing currently comes from donors. Of 13 
shelters for abused women and children, only four receive Government funding. A new 
shelter in Tirana, refurbished by the United Nations Development Programme, has 
Government support but no clear agreed budget allocation. The Government assured me 
that adequate funding would be forthcoming. Additional shelters are also urgently needed. 
</p>
<p>58. Gender violence experts reported that, while many police were increasingly willing 
to assist women, they often lacked the knowledge, resources or institutional support to do 
so most effectively. In some cases, the matter was as simple as providing police with the 
referral details of shelters and psychosocial support. In other cases, especially in rural areas, 
additional training and specialist police units are required. 
</p>
<p>59. More needs to be done by the Government to implement the provisions of the 
Domestic Violence Law. The Ministry of Justice needs to train lawyers to provide free legal 
representation of victims, and the Ministry of Health needs to assist health and medical 
officials to identify, record and provide services for victims. These burdens cannot be 
shouldered entirely by civil society. Finally, the media needs to be more responsible in its 
coverage of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Disappearances and killings after the Kosovo war  
</b></p>
<p>60. For a number of years, allegations have been made that a few hundred people, 
reportedly including ethnic Albanians, Kosovars and Serbs, were abducted and taken across 
the Kosovo-Albania border after June 1999 by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). 
Allegedly, these prisoners were held in KLA camps in Albania, some were tortured or 
killed, and some were victims of organ trafficking.  
</p>
<p>61. Initial investigations were undertaken in 2004 by the Office of the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, although the cases were not 
then pursued. Subsequent investigations have been made by various other entities, 
including by the Council of Europe, the Serbian war crimes prosecutor and the European 
Union Rule of Law Mission n Kosovo (EULEX). For the most part, none of the various 
efforts to investigate have received meaningful cooperation from the Government of 
Albania. 
</p>
<p>62. The Albanian authorities insist that the allegations are politically motivated and 
entirely unfounded. While Government officials offered a variety of explanations for non-
cooperation to me, these amounted in practice to a game of bureaucratic and diplomatic 
ping pong in which the responsibility for not responding to investigators&#8217; requests for 
cooperation was moved from one office to the next, each official insisting that, if requested 
by the right authorities and under the proper conditions, they would not hesitate to 
cooperate.   
</p>
<p>  
 59 For example, see Amnesty International, &#8220;Ending Domestic Violence in Albania: The Next Steps&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>March 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>63. Shortly after my visit to Albania, the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly stated 
that Albania was willing to cooperate fully and transparently with investigations into the 
allegations of abuse and killings. This commitment was a positive step, and I looked 
forward to seeing increased cooperation with EULEX and the Council of Europe. 
Unfortunately, this cooperation has not been forthcoming. In December 2010, the Council 
of Europe noted that the EULEX inquiries have been &#8220;hampered by a lack of co-operation 
on the part of Albanian authorities&#8221;.60 
</p>
<p>64. Nevertheless, since my visit, there has been some progress in both the EULEX and 
Council of Europe investigations. In May 2010, EULEX arrested a former KLA 
commander suspected of torturing and mistreating prisoners at an illegal KLA detention 
facility in northern Albania. The Serbian war crimes prosecutor indicated that his office 
was also prosecuting the individual in two cases.61 In December 2010, the Council of 
Europe investigations, led by Rapporteur Dick Marty, were made public. The Marty report 
documents &#8220;abuses widespread enough to constitute a pattern&#8221; committed by the KLA in 
Albania.62 It identifies at least six KLA detention facilities in Albania operated during and 
after the conflict, and documents ill-treatment; beatings; secret detention; disappearances; 
and killings, including killing for the purposes of forced organ removal and organ 
trafficking (particularly of cadaver kidneys). 
</p>
<p>65. The Marty report documents severe abuses that must not be ignored. The 
perpetrators should be criminally investigated and prosecuted, and serious efforts made to 
investigate sites on Albanian territory that may contain further evidence and the bodies of 
victims. Unless the Government of Albania cooperates fully and meaningfully with 
EULEX and the other independent investigators into the reported abuse and killings by the 
KLA and other actors in Albanian territory, impunity will continue. In response to the 
present report, the Government indicated that it had invited &#8220;Mr. Marty to provide proof of 
the war crimes and organ trafficking described in his report and to turn them over to the 
relevant authorities.&#8221; Reversing the onus of proof in this way is entirely incompatible with 
the function of human rights fact-finding and with the Government&#8217;s own responsibility to 
investigate, prosecute and punish. 
</p>
<p><b> V. G&#235;rdec 
</b></p>
<p>66. On 15 March 2008, the explosion of obsolete munitions at an Albanian army base in 
G&#235;rdec left 26 people dead, many hundreds injured or left homeless and property destroyed. 
Prosecutions of those responsible for the tragedy have lagged badly. The issue is heavily 
weighted with political implications that go beyond my mandate, but it is essential that the 
G&#235;rdec deaths be meaningfully investigated and effectively prosecuted. Where necessary, 
requests for the lifting of immunities must be made. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Communist-era abuses  
</b></p>
<p>67. Some 20 years after the fall of communism, Albania has still not dealt 
comprehensively with the killings and other human rights abuses committed during those

</p>
<p>years. Thousands were tortured, executed and disappeared by the State between 1946 and 
</p><p>1991. The Association of Former Political Prisoners estimates that 5,577 men and 450 
women were executed under communist rule.63 Mass graves continue to be discovered, 
including one containing 19 bodies the week before my visit, and another containing 80 
bodies soon after. Nevertheless, the Association believes that about 4,000 victims of the 
communist regime are still missing.64 
</p>
<p>68. Victims&#8217; families are still unable to learn the truth, and the communist regime&#8217;s 
abuses have not been accounted for, because Albania is one of the few former communist 
countries not to have opened the archives of communist-era security services. Instead, the 
measures taken are symbolic and politicized, and thus bound to fail. The small number of 
prosecutions in the 1990s are no substitute for the broader accounting required. A lustration 
law was introduced by the Government in December 2008,65 but it drew heavy domestic 
and international criticism for being open to political misuse, including measures to remove 
or intimidate judges and prosecutors working on sensitive cases involving Government 
officials.66 The Constitutional Court suspended the law in February 2009, annulled it in 
February 2010, and finally repealed it in March 2010.67 
</p>
<p>69. Until a full accounting is achieved, the Government will not have met its 
international legal obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish abuses. It may also leave 
the country hostage to its past when the rights violations of former officials are not openly 
acknowledged and resolved through judicial mechanisms. When violations are large scale 
and still politically charged, as is the case in Albania, justice may best be achieved through 
a national commission that could conduct an independent, systematic and sustained 
investigation of communist-era abuses. The Government has instead opted to establish an 
institute to study abuses during the communist era, and a task force to uncover mass graves 
from that period of history.68 The Prime Minister assured me that the institute would have 
full access to secret service and all other Government files from that time. Without full 
access to communist-era records, these efforts will not satisfy family members&#8217; need to 
know what happened to their loved ones, and will not achieve accountability for thousands 
of dead and disappeared Albanian citizens.

<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Blood feuds 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>While blood feud killings will soon be largely a thing of the past, a belief in the 
practice of vindicating honour and blood outside the regular legal system remains well 
entrenched in certain parts of the society. Its elimination will require additional 
measures to those taken to date. The Government&#8217;s understandable desire to see 
blood feuds as a purely historical artefact should not blind it to the need to consider 
taking measures such as: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Establishing the secretariat long envisaged but not created for the 
coordination committee on blood feuds. As a matter of priority, the Government 
should, through the National Institute of Statistics, conduct a statistical survey and 
analysis, using uniform and meaningful definitions of the blood feud phenomenon and 
its prevalence and manifestation in Albanian society; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Encouraging sustained interdisciplinary research on the issue of blood 
feuds, including its root causes and means of ending both killings and self-isolation, a 
task perhaps best entrusted to a new national institute of criminology; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Consulting leading scholars and religious leaders to determine how best 
the Government might (i) conduct outreach to end self-isolation of families in blood 
feuds, (ii) facilitate more effective forms of reconciliation by community leaders of 
stature, and (iii) ensure mediators have no potential conflict of interest of any kind in 
the issue;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensuring that educational curricula at all levels include an emphasis on 
individual human rights and specifically rebut the collective punishment message sent 
by the relevant parts of the <i>kanun</i>.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>International donors should be more discerning in their funding programmes, 
and should be as concerned about broader issues of violence and problematic 
traditions of collective punishment as they are about the &#8220;exotic&#8221; notion of blood feud 
killings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  B. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Government should follow through on its assurances to fund programmes 
and shelters. Domestic violence programmes will need to be long-term to erode the 
deep-seated patriarchal views facilitating violence and to increase victims&#8217; access to 
justice. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The media should be more responsible in its coverage of domestic violence 
issues.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  C. Disappearances and killings after the Kosovo war 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Government of Albania should cooperate fully with EULEX and other 
independent investigations into abuses by the KLA on Albanian territory, including 
by providing access to Albanian territory for the purposes of evidence-gathering and 
excavation and by responding to EULEX requests for judicial assistance. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  D. G&#235;rdec 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Prosecutor-General should ensure that the events leading to the G&#235;rdec 
explosion are fully investigated, that all responsible parties prosecuted, and where 
necessary, requests for the lifting of immunities are made. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  E. Communist-era abuses 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Government should establish a national commission to conduct an 
independent, systematic and sustained investigation of communist-era abuses. In the 
interim, it should give the proposed institute for the study of communist-era abuses 
comprehensive access to all sources of information about that era and enable it to 
make effective use of its power to refer specific cases to the Prosecutor. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  F. Justice system and anti-corruption reforms 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Government should adopt, through legislation, criteria and procedures to 
ensure the professionalism, independence and integrity of judges, especially in relation 
to the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Government should amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enable the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to commence investigations of high officials, including ministers 
and judges, without first having to have their immunity lifted. Immunity need only be 
lifted once the Prosecutor has sufficient evidence to warrant charges. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Government should develop the capacity and expertise of statisticians and 
analysts at the National Institute of Statistics and in the relevant ministries to collect, 
analyse and report on criminal justice-related data in accordance with internationally 
accepted standards. </b></p>

<p><b>  Programme of the mission 
</b></p>
<p> I visited Albania at the invitation of the Government from 15 to 23 February 2010. I 
travelled to Tirana, the region of Shkodra, and Fush&#235; Kruj&#235;.  
</p>
<p> I met with the President, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, as well as 
senior officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of 
the Interior, the Ministry of Education and Sciences and the Ministry of Labour, Social 
Affairs and Equal Opportunities. I also met with the Chief Prosecutor and members of the 
General Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, representatives of the Commission to Assess the Witness 
Programme and Collaborators of Justice, the Judicial Enforcement Service, the Internal 
Audit Service, the Director-General of the State Police, the directors and members of the 
Directorate of Witness and Special Persons Protection, the Directorate against Serious 
Crimes, the Directorate against Organized Crime, the Directorate of Criminal Information 
and Analysis and the Financial Crime Directorate. In addition, I met with representatives of 
the Property Restitution and Compensation Agency, the Central Office of Immovable 
Property Registration and the Directorate of Land Administration and Protection. I held 
discussions with representatives of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Court 
of Serious Crimes and the High Council of Justice, as well as the People&#8217;s Advocate and 
the Commissioners of the People&#8217;s Advocate, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and 
representatives of the Parliamentary Commissions on Legal Affairs, Public Administration 
and Human Rights, and Labour, Social Affairs and Health. Officials with whom I met in 
Shkodra include the Mayor, the Prefect, the District Director of Police, the Director of 
Investigation of Serious Crimes and Organized Crime, the Director of Economic and 
Financial Crime, the Director of Forensic Police and Criminal Information and Analysis 
Sector, the Chairperson of the Investigative Unit for Combating Economic Crime and 
Corruption, the District Attorney, and members of the Shkodra District Court and the 
Education Directorate.  
</p>
<p> I also met with international officials and members of the diplomatic community, 
representatives of domestic and international civil society, and academics. I am grateful for 
the cooperation extended by witnesses to human rights abuses and the significant number of 
families involved in blood feuds with whom I met.  
</p>
<p> Before visiting Albania, I was able to analyse in detail the available reports prepared 
on the relevant human rights issues in Albania, including Government data and 
publications, reports by intergovernmental organizations, and reports by international, 
national and local civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p> I am indebted to the United Nations Resident Coordinator and the Human Rights 
Adviser to the United Nations in Albania for facilitating my mission, and to the 
representatives from many United Nations and other intergovernmental institutions and 
agencies who provided information on the issues I addressed during the course of my 
mission. </p>

<p><b>  Police statistics 
</b></p>
<p> According to the national police, the statistics for murder between 2005 and 2009, 
including blood feuds and revenge killings (for a discussion of the distinction between the 
two, see discussion in main text below) are as shown in the table below.

<p> In the past five years, 16 individuals have been arrested and prosecuted for blood 
feud killings, receiving sentences of 15 to 25 years imprisonment. The number of other 
cases resulting in prosecutions and sentences were not provided to me broken down by 
motive. In addition, 195 of 1982 murders committed from 1998 to 2004 were blood feud-
related &#8211; but these statistics do not distinguish blood feud and revenge killings, and could 
include both categories. 
</p>
<p> According to the police in Shkodra, the number of killings committed with a 
revenge motive in the Shkodra region between 2005 and 2009 are as shown below.

information about the number of perpetrators concerned.
