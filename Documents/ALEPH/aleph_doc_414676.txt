Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies and methods followed in preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are those used by American Natural Energy 
Corporation (the “Company”) as described in Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unaudited 
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and do not conform in all respects to the disclosure and 
information  that  is  required  for  annual  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  year-end  condensed  consolidated  balance  sheet  data  was  derived  from  audited 
consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These 
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the most recent annual consolidated financial statements of the Company.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, all of which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for fair statement have been included in these 
interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2014 are not indicative of the results that may be 
expected for the full year ending December 31, 2014.
Reclassification of Prior Period Statements
Certain reclassifications of prior period consolidated financial statement balances have been made to conform to current reporting practices.

Going Concern, Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company currently has a severe shortage of working capital and funds to pay its liabilities. The Company has no current borrowing capacity with any lender. The 
Company incurred a net loss of $972,133 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The Company has a working capital deficit of $14,471,982 and an accumulated 
deficit  of  $27,665,493  at  March  31,  2014  which  leads  to  substantial  doubt  concerning  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  meet  its  obligations  as  they  come  due.  The 
Company also has a need for substantial funds to develop its oil and gas properties and repay borrowings as well as to meet its other current liabilities.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets 
and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. As a result of the losses incurred and current negative working capital, there is no assurance that the 
carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded. The ability of the Company to continue as a going 
concern is dependent upon adequate sources of capital and the Company’s ability to sustain positive results of operations and cash flows sufficient to continue to 
explore for and develop its oil and gas reserves and pay its obligations.

American Natural Energy Corporation 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
March 31, 2014 and 2013
Management’s strategy has been to obtain additional financing or industry partners. It is management’s intention to raise additional debt or equity financing to fund its 
operations and capital expenditures or to enter into another transaction in order to maximize shareholder value. Failure to obtain additional financing can be expected to 
adversely affect the Company’s ability to pay its obligations, further the development of its properties, grow revenues, oil and gas reserves and achieve and maintain a 
significant level of revenues, cash flows, and profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company will obtain this additional financing at the time required, at 
rates that are favorable to the Company, or at all. Further, any additional equity financing that is obtained may result in material dilution to the current holders of 
common stock.

American Natural Energy Corporation 
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
March 31, 2014 and 2013
As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had an outstanding note to TPC Energy with a principal balance of $164,183. On March 31, 2014, the 
Company  extended  the  maturity  of  the  note  until  March  31,  2015.  The  company  evaluated  the  extension  under  FASB  ASC  470-50  and  FASB  ASC  470-60  and 
concluded the revised term constituted a debt modification, rather than a debt extinguishment or a troubled debt restructuring. There were no other changes to the terms 
of the note.
As of March 31, 2014, the Company had another outstanding note to TPC Energy with a principal balance of $250,000. On March 11, 2014, the Company extended the 
maturity  date  of  the  note  until  March  11,  2015.  There  were  no  other  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  note  and  TPC  Energy  will  continue  to  receive  the  50%  of  the 
company’s interests in its share of the Liquidation Agents account distributions for an extra year until March 11, 2015. The TPC note is included in Notes Payable –
Related Parties on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2014. The company evaluated the extension under FASB ASC 470-50 and FASB ASC 470-60 and concluded the 
revised term constituted a debt modification, rather than a debt extinguishment or a troubled debt restructuring.
On February 17, 2011, the Company entered into a $500,000 note payable with Mike Paulk and Steven Ensz, directors of the Company, with an annual interest rate of 
10%.  On  February  17,  2014,  the  Company  extended  the  note  payable  until  February  17,  2015.  There  were  no  other  changes  to  terms  of  the  note.  The  Company 
evaluated the application of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded that the revised terms constituted a debt modification rather than a debt extinguishment or a 
troubled debt restructuring. Principal payments totaling $25,000 were made during the quarter ended March 31, 2014.
The Company entered into a financing agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP during the first quarter of 2012. Proceeds of the financing are to be used 
for the drilling and completion of wells included in the Company’s inventory of Proved Undeveloped reserves (“PUD”). The Company has a commitment for a total 
amount of $3 million, before fees and expenses, through the issuance of a series of $1 million debentures. The debenture is secured by a first priority, perfected security 
interest and mortgage in oil and gas leases and properties. At no time shall the investor funds exceed 65% of the drilling and completion cost of the PUD’s with the 
balance provided by the Company’s generated funds.
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP. The amendment 
provides for interest only payments pursuant to existing amended and restated debenture for the month of December 2013, that all previous outstanding principal and 
accrued and unpaid interest, an accommodation fee $200,000 for entering into this sixth Amendment and all outstanding Redemption Premium fees will comprise the 
agree upon outstanding amount of $2,196,609. Principal and interest in the amount of $371,459 is due monthly, inclusive of all fees and redemption amounts. The 
Company  evaluated  the  amendment  under  FASB  ASC  470-50  and  determined  that  the  modification  was  substantial  and  qualified  as  a  debt  extinguishment.  The 
additional $200,000  accommodation  fee and the  remaining unamortized  debt  discount  of  $208,490  and were  recorded as a loss on  debt  extinguishment.  Principal 
payments of $100,000 each for the months of March, April and May 2014 along with accrued interest have been made.

On June 30, 2013, the Company extended the maturity date of note payable to Leede Financial to December 31, 2013. The other terms of the note payable remain 
unchanged. The Company evaluated the application of ASC 470-50 and ASC 470-60 and concluded the revised term constituted a debt modification. As the note is 
denominated in Canadian dollars, the Company adjusted the face value of the note based on fluctuations in exchange rates and recorded a foreign exchange gain of

related to the $1million convertible Palo Verde debt issued on December 31, 2012. The Company amortized $195,485 of debt discount during the three months ended 
March 31, 2014.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
We  currently are experiencing a severe shortage of  working  capital and funds to pay our liabilities.  We  have no current  borrowing capacity  with any lender. We 
incurred a net loss of $972,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and a net loss of $3,147,000 and $3,318,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. We 
have a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2014 which leads to substantial doubt concerning our ability to meet our obligations as they come 
due. We also have a need for substantial funds to develop our oil and gas properties and repay borrowings as well as to meet our other current liabilities.
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  in  this  Report  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  contemplates  continuity  of  operations, 
realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The independent registered public accounting firm’s report on our consolidated financial 
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes an explanatory paragraph which states that we have sustained a substantial loss in 2013 and have a working 
capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2013 that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These matters raise substantial 
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of our losses incurred and current negative working capital, there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of 
assets will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon adequate sources of 
capital and our ability to sustain positive results of operations and cash flows sufficient to continue to explore for and develop our oil and gas reserves and pay our obligations.
A Comparison of Operating Results For The Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013
We recorded a net loss of $972,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to a net loss of $496,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. 
During the three months ended March 31, 2014, our revenues were comprised of oil and gas sales totaling $575,000 compared with oil and gas sales of $998,000 during the 
same period of 2013. Oil and gas prices decreased as well as production for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our net average daily production 
for the three month period ended March 31, 2014 decreased by 38% over the same period of the prior year, from 101 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 62 net barrels of oil 
equivalent per day. The weighted average price was $103.86 per barrel of oil equivalent for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $112.06 per barrel of oil 
equivalent for the same period in 2013. Production from our existing wells is subject to fluctuation based upon which zones of wells are in production.
11
We had operating expenses of $746,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to operating expenses of $961,000 for the three months ended March 31, 
2013. Our general and administrative expenses were $345,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to $488,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. 
General and administrative expenses were higher for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 primarily due to higher professional fees and higher payroll expense.
Interest and financing costs decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 at $392,000 and $506,000 respectively. Interest
and financing costs were lower in the first quarter of 2014 due to lower amortization of note discounts.
Lease operating expenses of $139,000, production taxes of $57,000 and depletion, depreciation and amortization of $217,000 during the three months ended March 31, 
2014 changed from $290,000, $75,000, and $369,000, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2014. Lease operating expenses were lower for the first quarter of 
2014 compared to the same period in 2013 due to decreased production.  Production  taxes  decreased  for the first  quarter of  2014 as  a  result  of decreased production.  The 
decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of 2014 is a result of decreased production.
During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we had a foreign exchange gain of $12,000 compared to a $260,000 foreign exchange gain for the three months ended 
March 31, 2013. Our foreign exchange gains arise out of an inter-company indebtedness we owe to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gothic, which is payable in Canadian dollars, 
in  addition  to  a  note  owed  to  a  third  party  denominated  in  Canadian  dollars.  The  foreign  exchange  gain  for  the  three  months  ended  March  31,  2014  was  caused  by  the 
strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar. The gain related to the note denominated in Canadian dollars was $12,000 for the three months ended March 31, 
2014
During the three months ended March 31, 2014 we also amended the loan with TCA. The amendment qualified as debt extinguishment and $408,490 were recorded as
a loss on debt extinguishment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
To date, our production has not been sufficient to fund our operations and drilling program. At March 31, 2014, we do not have any available borrowing capacity and
have negative working capital of approximately $14.5 million.
We have substantial need for capital to develop our oil and gas prospects. Since 2001, we have funded our capital expenditures and operating activities through a series 
of debt and equity capital-raising transactions, drilling participations and through an increase in vendor payables and notes payable. We expect any future capital expenditures 
for drilling and development to be funded from the sale of drilling participations and equity capital. It is management's plan to raise additional capital through the sale of 
interests in our drilling activities or other strategic transaction; however, we currently have no firm commitment from any potential investors and such additional capital may not 
be available to us in the future.

A Comparison of Cash Flow For The Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013
Our net cash provided by operating activities was $273,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $92,000 
for the three months ended March 31, 2013, an increase of $365,000. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was 
due to an increase in noncash items of $407,000 and an increase in working capital of $434,000 offset by an increase in net loss of 476,000. Changes in working capital items 
had the effect of increasing cash flows from operating activities by $389,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2014 mainly due to an increase in accounts payable and 
accrued  liabilities  of  $400,000  and  offset  by  an  increase  in  accounts  receivable  and  other  current  assets  of  $11,000.  Changes  in  working  capital  items  had  the  effect  of 
decreasing cash flows from operating activities by $45,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2013 mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable and other current 
assets of $104,000 and offset by an increase and accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $59,000 and offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $92,000.
We used $14,000 of net cash in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to net cash used of $56,000 in 2013. The cash used in
investing in 2014 and 2013 was for the purchase and development of oil and gas properties.
Our net cash used in financing activities was $341,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to net cash provided of $245,000 for the same period in 
2013. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, net cash outflows from financing activities were a result of payments against outstanding notes of $341,000, of which 
$25,000 was to related parties. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, net cash inflows from financing activities were a result of the issuance of notes, net of fees, of 
$966,000,  of  which  $500,000  was  to  related  parties,  offset  by  payments  against  outstanding  notes  of  $696,000,  of  which  $42,000  was  to  related  parties,  and  payments  of 
deferred financing costs of $25,000.
We have no other commitments to expend additional funds for drilling activities for the rest of 2014.
How We Have Financed Our Activities
Our activities since 2002 have been financed primarily from sales of debt and equity securities and drilling participations. These transactions during this period of time
included the following, among other previously reported financing transactions we entered into during the period:
13
We entered into a financing agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP during the first quarter of 2012. Proceeds of the financing were used for the drilling 
and completion of wells included in the Company’s inventory of proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD”). We have a commitment for a total amount of $3.0 million, before fees 
and expenses, through the issuance of a series of $1.0 million debentures. The debenture is secured by a first priority, perfected security interest and mortgage in oil and gas 
leases and properties. At no time shall the investor funds advanced exceed 65% of the drilling and completion cost of the PUD’s with the balance provided by our generated 
funds. During  the  year ended December 31, 2012,  three tranches of  TCA debt  totaling  $3 million  were issued. The total  note principal  balance of TCA  debts and related 
unamortized debt discounts on December 31, 2012 are $1,608,973 and $186,791, respectively.
In March 2013, the fourth tranche TCA debt of $1 million was issued. The debt is due on March 1, 2014 and is payable monthly with a mandatory redemption fee 
equal to 10% and interest of 5%. Out of $1 million debt proceeds, $500,000 was withheld for the future development of wells, $55,550 was paid to TCA for various fees, and 
net proceeds of $944,450 were received by the Company. In July 2013 an additional tranche of $750,000 was drawn by the Company under the same terms with net proceeds of 
$705,825 received by the Company after the payment of fees.
The Company will also pay TCA $100,000 in cash in lieu of a stock bonus related to the issuance of the note. Fees paid and to be paid in cash totaling $155,550 to
TCA Global Credit Master Fund, LP were recorded as a debt discount.
In July 2013, the fifth tranche TCA debt of $750,000 was issued. The debt is due on August 1, 2014 and is payable monthly with a mandatory redemption fee equal to 
10% and interest of 5%. Fees totaling $44,175 were paid with net proceeds of $705,825 received by the Company. Along with the issuance of the fifth tranche TCA debt, the 
Company combined all the outstanding TCA debts into one debt by entering into an amended debt agreement with TCA. The amended debt has a principal of $2,290,548, 
accrues interest at 5% per annum, and is due on August 1, 2014. From August 1, 2013 through November we paid the amended TCA debt in monthly installments of $230,451.
On January 29, 2014, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement with TCA Global Credit Master Fund LP. The amendment 
provides for interest only payments pursuant to existing amended and restated debenture for the month of December 2013, that all previous outstanding principal and accrued 
and  unpaid  interest,  an  accommodation  fee  $200,000  for  entering  into  this  sixth  Amendment  and  all  outstanding  Redemption  Premium  fees  will  comprise  the  agree  upon 
outstanding amount of $2,196,609. Principal and interest in the amount of $371,459 is due monthly, inclusive of all fees and redemption amounts. The Company evaluated the 
amendment under FASB ASC 470-50 and determined that the modification was substantial and qualified as a debt extinguishment. The additional $200,000 accommodation fee 
and the remaining unamortized debt discount of $208,490 and were recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment. Principal payments of $100,000 each for the months of March, 
April and May 2014 along with accrued interest have been made.
14
On July 31, 2012, we received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange for the issuance of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement. All
such shares were sold at $0.06 in the private placement, resulting in gross proceeds of $420,000.
On August 13, 2012, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Palo Verde Acquisitions, LLC (“Palo Verde”), pursuant to which we sold to Palo Verde (1) 
a $2,000,000 12% unsecured Convertible Debenture due August 13, 2014 (the “First Palo Verde Debenture”) and (2) warrants to purchase up to 20,000,000 shares of our 
common stock at a purchase price of $0.23 per share and expiring on August 13, 2014. The aggregate consideration received by us from Palo Verde for the First Palo Verde 
Debenture and the 20 million warrants was $2,000,000.
On December 31, 2012, we sold to Palo Verde (1) a $1,000,000 12% unsecured Convertible Debenture due December 31, 2014 (the “Second Palo Verde Debenture”) 
and  (2)  warrants  to  purchase  up  to  10,000,000  shares  of  our  common  stock  at  a  purchase  price  of  $0.23  per  share  and  expiring  on  December  31,  2014.  The  aggregate 
consideration received by us from Palo Verde for the Second Palo Verde Debenture and the 10 million warrants was $1,000,000.
15
Future Capital Requirements and Resources
At  March  31,  2014,  we  do  not  have  any  available  borrowing  capacity  under  existing  credit  facilities  and  our  current  assets  are  $257,000  compared  with  current 
liabilities of $14.8 million. Our current liabilities include accounts payable, revenues payable, notes payable (a portion of which is past due), and other current obligations. We 
have  substantial  needs  for  funds  to  pay  our  outstanding  payables  and  debt  due  during  2014.  In  addition,  we  have  substantial  need  for  capital  to  develop  our  oil  and  gas 
prospects. At March 31, 2014, we have no commitments for additional capital to fund drilling activities in 2014.
Since 2001, we have funded our capital expenditures and operating activities through a series of debt and equity capital-raising transactions, drilling participations and, 
during the last two quarters of 2004 and all of 2005 and 2006, through an increase in vendor payables and notes payable. It is our intention to raise additional capital through the 
sale of interests in our drilling activities or other strategic transaction; however, we currently have no firm commitment from any potential investors and such additional capital 
may not be available to us in the future. We expect that any capital expenditures for drilling purposes during 2014 will be funded from the sale of drilling participations and 
equity capital.
Our business strategy requires us to obtain additional financing and our failure to do so can be expected to adversely affect our ability to grow our revenues, oil and gas 
reserves and achieve and maintain a significant level of revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance we will obtain this additional funding. Such funding may be 
obtained through the sale of drilling participations, joint ventures, equity securities or by incurring additional indebtedness. Without such funding, our revenues will continue to 
be limited and it can be expected that our operations will not be profitable. In addition, any additional equity funding that we obtain may result in material dilution to the current 
holders of our common stock.
Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the “Safe Harbor” Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
With the exception of historical matters, the matters we discussed below and elsewhere in this Report are “forward-looking statements” as defined under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements appear in various places including under the headings Item 1. Financial 
Statements and Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation. These risks and uncertainties relate to• our ability to raise capital and fund our oil and gas 
well drilling and development plans,• our ability to fund the repayment of our current liabilities, and • our ability to negotiate and enter into any agreement relating to a merger 
or sale of all or substantially all our assets.
16
These risks and uncertainties also relate to our ability to attain and maintain profitability and cash flow and continue as a going concern, our ability to increase our 
reserves of oil and gas  through  successful drilling activities and acquisitions, our ability to enhance and maintain production from existing wells and successfully develop 
additional producing wells, our access to debt and equity capital and the availability of joint venture development arrangements, our ability to remain in compliance with the 
terms of any agreements pursuant to which we borrow money and to repay the principal and interest when due, our estimates as to our needs for additional capital and the times 
at which additional capital will be required, our expectations as to our sources for this capital and funds, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, our ability 
to  maintain  compliance  with  covenants  of  our  loan  documents  and  other  agreements  pursuant  to  which  we  issue  securities  or  borrow  funds  and  to  obtain  waivers  and 
amendments when and as required, our ability to borrow funds or maintain levels of borrowing availability under our borrowing arrangements, our ability to meet our intended 
capital expenditures, our statements and estimates about quantities of production of oil and gas as it implies continuing production rates at those levels, proved reserves or 
borrowing availability based on proved reserves and our future net cash flows and their present value.
Readers are cautioned that the risk factors described  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and  other reports filed with the 
Commission, as well as those described elsewhere in this Report, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our business plans and actual results of operations 
and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2014 and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf.
Our common shares have no trading market in the United States, and there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our common 
shares, the ability of the holders of common shares to sell their common shares in the United States or the price at which holders would be able to sell their common shares. Any 
future trading prices of the common shares will depend on many factors, including, among others, our operating results and the market for similar securities.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  on  Form  10-Q,  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  our  Chief  Financial  Officer  performed  an  evaluation  of  the 
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure 
controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the 
desired control objectives.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q 
that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that it files or submits 
under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  our  management,  including  the  CEO  and  CFO,  as  appropriate  to  allow  timely  decisions 
regarding required disclosure by us; and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, 
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. In our evaluation of disclosure controls and 
procedures as of December 31, 2013, we concluded there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting which we viewed as an integral part of our 
disclosure controls and procedures. See our discussion at “Item 9A (T) - Controls and Procedures” on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.
17
In order to mitigate these material weaknesses to the fullest extent possible, all financial reports are reviewed by the CEO and CFO. All unexpected results are investigated. At 
any time, if it appears that any control can be implemented to continue to mitigate such weaknesses, it is immediately implemented. As soon as our finances allow, we will hire 
sufficient staff and implement appropriate procedures to address the segregation of duties and improve the closing process.
There were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that 
have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
