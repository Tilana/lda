CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements provide our current
expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements include statements:
•
•
•
containing a projection of revenues, income (including income loss), earnings (including
earnings loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure, or other financial
items;
of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans or objectives
relating to the products or services of Glori;
of future economic performance, including any such statement contained in a discussion and
analysis of financial condition by the management or in the results of operations included
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”);
•of the assumptions underlying or relating to any statement described above; or
containing a projection or estimate of such other items as may be specified by rule or regulation
of the SEC.
•
Forward-looking statements may also include any report issued by an outside reviewer retained
by Glori, to the extent that the report assesses a forward-looking statement made by Glori.
Forward-looking statements may include statements about our expectations, strategy, beliefs,
plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions, prospects, estimates, projections, the future of our
industry, our future profitability, estimates and projections of future activity and trends in the oil
and natural gas industry, and other statements that are not historical facts. Words or phrases
such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,” “encouraging,” “project,” “will” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives
of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these
words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Examples of forward-
looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to,
statements regarding our disclosure concerning Glori's proposed operations, cash flows, and
financial position.
These forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor are they guarantees of future
performance. These statements are based on management’s expectations that involve a number
of business risks and uncertainties, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, most of which are difficult to predict
and many of which are beyond our control, including the factors described under “Risk Factors”,
that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from any future
results or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such risks and
uncertainties include, among other things:
•
•our ability to continue as a going concern;
•the potential delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ;
•our ability to secure additional capital to fund operations;
•our ability to service our debt and make future required payments;
•the sustained or an increased decline of oil and gas commodity prices;
•increase in oil production rate and ultimate quantity of oil recovered using our AERO System;
•the percentage of the world’s reservoirs that are suitable for our AERO System;
our ability to prove our technology and develop and maintain positive relationships with our
customers and prospective customers;
•competition and competitive factors in the markets in which we operate;
•demand for our AERO System and our expectations regarding future projects;
adaptability of our AERO System and our development of additional capabilities that will expand
the types of oil fields to which we can apply our technology;
our plans and ability to acquire and develop additional currently producing mature oil fields and
the AERO System’s impact on these fields;
•our plans to develop some abandoned and low producing mature oil fields;
•the expected cost of recovering oil using our AERO System in our projects;
•potential environmental or other liabilities associated with our acquired properties;
•any projections, including earnings, revenues, expenses or any other financial items;
•the impact of legislation and regulations on our operations;
•our ability to compete with other enhanced oil recovery methods;
our ability to generate positive cash flows, including from the acquisition of oil producing
properties, increases in oil prices, and improvement in our AERO System revenues;
•our cash needs and expectations regarding cash flow from operations;
•
•
•

•our ability to manage and grow our business and execution of our business strategy;
•our financial performance;
•our estimates of oil reserves; and
•the costs associated with being a public company.
We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether
as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except to the
extent law requires.
MARKET, INDUSTRY AND OTHER DATA
 
Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
concerning Glori’s industry and the markets in which Glori operates, including its general
expectations and market position, market opportunity and market size, is based on information
from various sources, on assumptions that it has made that are based on that information and
other similar sources and on Glori’s knowledge of the markets for its services. That information
involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue
weight to such estimates. While Glori believes that information from third-party sources used in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is generally reliable, it has not independently verified the
accuracy or completeness of this information. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates
of Glori’s future performance and the future performance of the industry in which Glori operates
are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors,
including those described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the
estimates made by the independent parties and by Glori.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
Glori Energy Technology Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly Glori Energy Inc.) ("GETI"), was
incorporated in November 2005 (as successor in interest to Glori Oil LLC) to increase production
and recovery from mature oil wells using state of the art biotechnology solutions.
 
Glori Energy Inc., GETI, Glori Canada Ltd., Glori Holdings Inc., Glori California Inc., OOO Glori
Energy and Glori Energy Production Inc. ("GEP") are collectively referred to as the “Company” in
the condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation
 
We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information
and disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to these rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, these
condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly
the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and June 30,
2016 (unaudited), condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months
ending June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016 (unaudited), condensed consolidated statement of
stockholders’ equity for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (unaudited) and condensed
consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30,
2016 (unaudited). All such adjustments represent normal recurring items. The financial
information contained in this report for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and
June 30, 2016, and as of June 30, 2016, is unaudited. These condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes thereto.
 
Principles of Consolidation
 
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Glori
Energy Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In the first quarter of 2016, ASU No. 2015-03, "Interest--Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" became effective for the Company. The standard moved
the presentation of the Company's deferred loan costs from an asset to a contra-liability account
thus reducing the liability balance of loans by the amount of the deferred loan costs. The deferred
loan costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the loan. The standard was applied
retrospectively and accordingly the December 31, 2015 previously reported total current and non-
current loan principal balance of $10,525,000 is now shown net of total deferred loan costs of
$227,000 and the June 30, 2016 total current and non-current loan principal balance of
$10,260,000 is now shown net of total deferred loan costs of $156,000. The change did not have
an impact to net income.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Presentation of
Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 asserts that
management should evaluate whether there are relevant conditions or events that are known and
reasonably knowable that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be
issued when applicable. If conditions or events at the
8
Table of Contents
date the financial statements are issued raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosures are required which will enable users of the financial
statements to understand the conditions or events as well as management’s evaluation and plan.
ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual
and interim periods thereafter; early application is permitted. Glori adopted this standard during
the second quarter of 2016. Early adoption did not have an impact on the financial statements.
See NOTE 3 of this report for a discussion about liquidity considerations and Glori's ability to
continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 - LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING
CONCERN
As a small company with an emerging technology, the Company has generated negative cash
flows from operations since inception. The downturn in the oil market has resulted in a decrease
in oil revenues from Company-owned oil properties, and a decrease in AERO services revenues
as the exploration & production ("E&P") industry significantly reduced its capital expenditures. As
a result of these factors, the Company continues to generate negative cash flows from
operations. The significant decrease in oil prices has also made it difficult for the Company to
execute on its strategy of acquiring producing properties, which would contribute to its revenues
and cash flows, due to potential sellers' reluctance to sell at distressed prices. Additionally, the
current oil price environment has negatively affected the availability of capital to Glori and the
E&P industry in general. These factors have also resulted in a dramatic decrease in the
Company's share price, which also impacts the ability to raise new capital.
Cash has decreased from $8.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $3.1 million at June 30, 2016
due to the net cash used in operating activities of $3.3 million, the repayment of debt of $316
thousand, capital expenditures of $1.4 million and other uses of $300 thousand. As of August
2016, the Company does not have lines of credit available to it. As a result of the negative
operating cash flows, the Company will need to raise capital over the next six to nine months to
fund its operations and to repay or refinance the term note of $10.2 million, owed by GEP, which
matures March 2017. The Company may have difficulty obtaining such additional financing as a
result of the decrease in oil prices, its negative cash flows from operations and the significant
decrease in its share price.
In order to address this challenging environment, the Company made significant cost reductions,
both in its administrative and professional staff, and lease operating expenses. The Company
has limited its capital spending primarily to the implementation of its AERO technology at the
Coke field, most of which was completed in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Company is
actively pursuing alternatives to raise capital in order to funds its operations and position the
Company to take advantage of identified opportunities to acquire abandoned fields which the
Company believes have significant economic quantities of oil remaining and are compatible with
its AERO technology. In August 2015, the Company implemented the first phase of AERO at the
Coke field. In March 2016 it completed installation of phase II of AERO implementation. Phase II
incorporates the addition of two AERO injection wells to increase the proportion of the field that is
impacted by AERO technology. The Company now has three injection wells running in total.
Additionally, the Company applied to the United States Department of Energy’s Loan Programs
Office (“LPO”) for a $150 million loan guarantee in connection with a project applying AERO to
previously abandoned reservoirs in the U. S. Based on LPO’s evaluation of Part I of the
application, in March 2016, LPO invited the Company to submit Part II of its application. In May
2016, the Company submitted Part II of the application, however, the ultimate outcome of the
application and whether a loan guarantee will be issued cannot be predicted. It is currently
anticipated that the loan guarantee, if issued, will fund up to 75% of project costs. The balance
would need to be raised and contributed by the Company. If the loan guarantee is ultimately not
issued by the LPO, or if the final terms of the loan guarantee are not advantageous, the Company
plans to seek alternative financing to enable it to acquire and redevelop certain identified
abandoned fields which fit its criteria.
On March 18, 2016, GEP entered into an amendment to the credit agreement on the senior
secured term loan facility with its lender, Stellus Capital Investment Corporation, which had the
effect of removing the financial ratio covenants and the semi-annual collateral value
redeterminations until maturity in March 2017 (see NOTE 7).
On October 23, 2015, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department
of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC indicating that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days,
the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for
continued inclusion on The NASDAQ Capital Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).
The Company was afforded 180 calendar days, or until April 20, 2016, to regain compliance with
the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, shares of the Company’s
common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least $1.00 per share for a
minimum of ten consecutive business days, subject to NASDAQ's discretion to increase such
ten-day period. On April 25, 2016, the Company received a letter from NASDAQ granting the
Company an additional 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.
The Company has until October 17, 2016 to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. In
addition, the Company must continue to meet the
9
Table of Contents
continued listing criteria, including maintaining stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million. As a
result of its net losses, including the impairment of oil and gas properties incurred in 2014 and
2015 as a result of the decrease in oil prices, the Company's stockholders' equity was below the
required $2.5 million as of June 30, 2016. In order to maintain its NASDAQ listing, the Company
will need to raise equity in the near-term in amounts sufficient to satisfy the $2.5 million
stockholders' equity requirement. Additionally, based on the Company's recent share price, in
order to meet the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement, the Company would most
likely have to implement a reverse stock split which requires the approval of shareholders at a
shareholder meeting. In light of the Company's non-compliance with these continuing listing
requirements, the Company may elect to voluntarily delist from the NASDAQ. The Company is
currently evaluating its alternatives. If the Company's common stock is delisted, it would likely
trade in the over-the-counter market. In the event of termination of the Company's NASDAQ
listing, the Company may determine to re-apply to re-establish its NASDAQ listing at such later
date as the Company is able to meet the initial listing requirements. Such NASDAQ delisting or
further declines in our stock price could impair our ability to raise additional capital to finance our
operations and additional capital expenditures and could significantly increase the ownership
dilution to shareholders caused by our issuing equity or other transactions. Glori's listing does not
affect the Company’s business operations or its SEC reporting requirements and does not cause
a default under any material agreement.
The significant risks, uncertainties, significant working capital deficit, historical operating losses
and resulting cash used in operations described above raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of
operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments, in the normal
course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty.

On July 1, 2015 the Company sold its mineral interests in the "Etzold Field" located in Seward
County, Kansas. The Etzold Field was originally purchased in 2010 as a greenfield lab to
advance the development of the Company's AERO technology, and the operations have
historically been included in the Company's Oil and Gas Segment (see NOTE 12). With the
purchase of the larger Coke Field and with the Company's future acquisition plans, the Company
made the strategic decision to divest the Etzold Field. Prior to the sale the Company had
associated net assets of $89,000, which were composed primarily of the purchase and
development charges less accumulated depreciation and depletion and associated liabilities of
$435,000 related to the plugging and abandonment obligation associated with the Etzold Field.
In exchange for the leasehold interest in the field, the Company received $75,000 and the
purchaser's assumption of the related asset retirement obligation. The Company recognized a
gain on the sale of $422,000. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015, the
Company had revenues of $41 thousand and $57 thousand, respectively, and a net loss of $20
thousand and $104 thousand, respectively, associated with the Etzold Field.
On June 1, 2015, GEP executed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain proved oil
and gas mineral leases in Refugio County, Texas (the “Bonnie View Field”) from a third party
seller for $2,644,000. The carrying value of the Bonnie View Field assets is also increased by an
asset retirement obligation associated with plugging and abandoning the Bonnie View Field
assets of $432,000. The effective date of the purchase was May 1, 2015. The Bonnie View Field
does not meet the definition of a significant acquisition which would require pro forma financial
information.
NOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
FASB standards define fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The
standard also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The
standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
 
Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
 
Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
 
Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair
value requires significant judgment or estimation.
 
If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level
described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement of the instrument.
The following table summarizes the financial assets measured at fair value, on a recurring basis
as of December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016 (in thousands):

The Level 2 instruments presented in the table above consists of derivative instruments made up
of commodity price swaps at December 31, 2015 and commodity swaps and put and call options
at June 30, 2016. The fair values of the Company's commodity derivative instruments are based
upon the NYMEX futures prices of oil compared to the contracted per barrel rate to be received or
paid. For the swaps, the Company records a liability associated with the futures contracts when
the futures price of oil is greater than the contracted per barrel rate to be received and an asset
when the futures price of oil is less than the contracted per barrel rate to be received. For the oil
put and call options (collars), the Company records a liability when the futures price of oil is
greater than the contracted ceiling price to be received and an asset when the futures prices of oil
is lower than the contracted floor to be received.
NOTE 6 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage risks related to changes in oil
prices. The Company is currently engaged in oil commodity price swaps where a fixed price is
received from the counterparty for a portion of the Company's oil production. In return the
Company pays a floating price based upon NYMEX oil prices. In June 2016, Glori executed
option contracts including oil call agreements as well as oil put agreements covering certain
portions of our anticipated 2017 oil production. No net premiums were paid as a result of these
option agreements. Although these arrangements are designed to reduce the downside risk of a
decline in oil prices on the covered production, they conversely limit potential income from
increases in oil prices and expose the Company to the credit risk of counterparties. The
Company endeavors to manage the default risk of counterparties by engaging in these
agreements with only high credit quality companies and through the continuous monitoring of
their performance.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had the following open positions on outstanding commodity
derivative contracts:
Notional Amount (Bbl) Swap ($/Bbl) Floor ($/Bbl) Ceiling ($/Bbl)

$ 82.46
$ 42.50
$ 55.60
The derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheet
as assets or liabilities. Derivatives for oil are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they
are all contracts with the same counterparty. The following table presents the fair value and
balance sheet location of each classification of commodity derivative contracts on a gross basis

The Company has not elected to designate any of these as derivative contracts for hedge
accounting. Accordingly, for each reporting period the contracts are marked-to-market and the
resulting unrealized changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are recognized on the
condensed consolidated statements of operations. The settlements of the closed derivative

NOTE 7 - LONG-TERM DEBT
On June 11, 2012, the Company entered into a secured term promissory note in the amount of
$8.0 million. The note contained a 10.0% annual interest rate subject to increase based upon an
increase in the prime rate. The loan was secured by substantially all assets of the Company with
the exception of the Coke Field Assets. The lender also received a warrant to purchase shares of
the Company’s stock which was exchanged for 18,208 common shares upon consummation of
the Merger. Equal monthly principal payments were due over 27 months beginning in April 2013
through June 2015 plus an end of term charge of $280,000. The loan agreement contained
covenants which place restrictions on the incurrence of debt, liens and capital expenditures. On
March 2, 2015 the Company elected to prepay the entire remaining indebtedness. The payment
included remaining principal of $888,000 and the end of term charge of $280,000.
On March 14, 2014 in connection with the closing of the acquisition of the Coke Field, the
Company entered into a financing agreement of $18.0 million in order to fund a portion of the
$38.0 million in cash required for the acquisition.
 
The $18.0 million note is a senior secured term loan of GEP and is secured by the Coke Field
and shares of common stock of GEP. The loan has a three year term bearing interest at 11.0%
per annum, subject to increase upon a LIBOR rate increase above 1%. The credit agreement
required quarterly principal payments equal to 50% of the excess cash flows, as defined, from
GEP's oil properties during the first year and 75% thereafter subject to a minimum quarterly
principal payment of $112,500 plus interest. The loan was funded net of closing costs of 2%, or
$360,000, which is shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a reduction of
proceeds and amortized over the loan term. The loan agreement contains covenants which place
restrictions on GEP’s ability to incur additional debt, incur other liens, make other investments,
capital expenditures and the sale of assets.
On March 18, 2016, GEP entered into an amendment to the credit agreement on the senior
secured term loan facility with its lender, Stellus Capital Investment Corporation, which had the
effect of removing the previously required financial ratio covenants and semi-annual collateral
value redetermination until maturity in March 2017. In connection with the amendment, the
interest rate on the loan increased to 13.0% per annum from 11.0%. The additional 2.0% may be
“paid in kind”, and added to the principal amount, or paid in cash at the election of the Company.
In addition, principal of $37,500 plus interest is payable monthly compared to the minimum
principal payments of $112,500 plus interest which was previously payable quarterly. Without
this amendment we likely would not have been able to meet all of our financial covenants in the
future. For the three months ending June 30, 2016, the Company elected the additional 2.0%
interest to be paid in kind and debt increased by $52,000. As of December 31, 2015 and June 30,
2016 the outstanding loan balance was $10.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively.
Maturities on long-term debt during the next five years are as follows (in thousands).

NOTE 8 - LOSS PER SHARE
 
The Company follows current guidance for share-based payments which are considered as
participating securities. Share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to
dividends, whether paid or unpaid, are designated as participating securities and are included in
the computation of basic earnings per share. However, in periods of net loss, participating
securities other than common stock are not included in the calculation of basic loss per share
because there is not a contractual obligation for owners of these securities to share in the
Company’s losses, and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES
 
At December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2016, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately $64.3 million and $71.3 million,
respectively, which will begin to expire in the year 2025, and tax credits of approximately
$504,000, which will begin to expire in 2027. The NOL carry forward has been reduced by
approximately $5.4 million of loss carryforwards that management estimates will expire due to
limitations from changes in control.
The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets.
The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2016 varies from the
statutory rate primarily due to the effect of the valuation allowance. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015 the Company had an income tax benefit of $188,000 and $171,000,
respectively, due to a reduction in taxes payable on foreign income as the Company revised its
methodology for service fee applications charged to foreign subsidiaries. For the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 the Company had an income tax benefit of $6,000 due to the
utilization of net operating losses to recover previously paid foreign income taxes.
 
NOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
Litigation
 
From time to time, the Company may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the
ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any material litigation or
proceedings and is not aware of any material litigation or proceedings, pending or threatened
against it.
 
Commitments
 
The Company leases two buildings in Houston, Texas and a warehouse facility in Gull Lake,
Saskatchewan under operating leases. The Company entered into a two-year lease agreement
in October 2014, for 7,805 square feet of office space in Houston's Westchase District for
approximately $18,000 per month. The Company does not intend to renew this lease upon
expiration in October 2016. The Company's original Houston building lease, which contains
office space, warehouse space and a laboratory, expires in May 2017 and is leased for $11,000
per month. The Saskatchewan warehouse is a month-to-month lease which rents for C$1,000
per month and is cancelable with 30 days' notice.
 
Approximate minimum future rental payments under these noncancelable operating leases as of

NOTE 11 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
Stock Incentive Plan
 
In December 2014, the Company shareholders approved the adoption of the 2014 Long Term
Incentive Plan ("the 2014 Plan") which authorized 2,000,000 shares to be available for issuance
to officers, directors, employees, and consultants of the Company. Options are issued at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the grant date.
Generally, the options vest 25 percent after 1 year, and thereafter ratably each month over the
following 36 months, and may be exercised for a period of 10 years subject to vesting.
Stock-based compensation expense, included primarily in selling, general and administrative
expense, was $417,000 and $40,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30,
2016 and $838,000 and $273,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016,
respectively. The Company has future unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested
shares at June 30, 2016 of $1.1 million with a weighted average vesting period of 2.5 years.

NOTE 12 – SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
The Company generates revenues through the production and sale of oil and natural gas (the
“Oil and Gas Segment”) and through the Company’s AERO services provided to third party oil
companies (the “AERO Services Segment”). The Oil and Gas Segment produces and develops
the Company’s acquired oil and natural gas interests. The revenues derived from the segment
are from sales to the first purchaser. The Company uses two such arrangements for oil sales, one
for the Coke and Quitman fields located in Wood County, Texas and one for the Bonnie View
Field in Refugio County, Texas.
 
The AERO Services Segment derives revenues from external customers by providing the
Company’s biotechnology solution of enhanced oil recovery through a two-step process
consisting of (1) the Analysis Phase and (2) the Field Deployment Phase.
 
The Analysis Phase work is a reservoir screening process whereby the Company obtains field
samples and evaluates the Company’s potential for AERO Services Segment success. This
process is performed at the Company’s Houston laboratory facility. The science and technology
expenses shown on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations are the
expenses that are directly attributable to the Analysis Phase and expenses associated with the
Company’s on-going research and development of its technology and are included in the
"Corporate Segment".
 
In the Field Deployment Phase, the Company deploys skid mounted injection equipment used to
inject nutrient solution in the oil reservoir. The work in this phase is performed in oil fields of
customers located in the United States and internationally and in the Company’s own oil fields.
The service operations expense shown on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements
of operations are the expenses that are directly attributable to the Field Deployment Phase and
included in the AERO Services Segment.
 
Earnings of industry segments exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense and
unallocated corporate expenses.
Although the AERO Services Segment provides enhanced oil recovery services to the Oil and
Gas Segment, the Company does not utilize intercompany charges. The direct costs of the
services such as the injection solution, transportation of the solution and expenses associated
with the injection are charged directly to the Oil and Gas Segment. All of the AERO Services
Segment capital expenditures and depreciation expenses associated with injection equipment
are viewed as part of the AERO Services Segment.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should
be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
included elsewhere herein, and with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under
“Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our annual report and elsewhere in this quarterly report. See
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Overview
We are a Houston-based energy technology and oil production company that deploys its
proprietary AERO technology to increase the amount of oil that can be produced from
conventional fields at a substantially lower cost than traditional enhanced oil recovery methods
("AERO System"). Only about one-third of the oil discovered in a typical reservoir is recoverable
using conventional oil production technology, leaving the remaining two-thirds trapped in the
reservoir rock. Our AERO System technology stimulates the native microorganisms that reside in
the reservoir to improve the recoverability of this trapped oil. We believe the AERO System can
reverse production declines and significantly increase ultimate reserve recovery at a low
incremental cost per barrel. Glori owns and operates oil fields onshore in the U.S. where we
deploy our technology, and additionally provides the AERO System as a technology service to
exploration and production ("E&P") companies.
Glori's goal is also to acquire fields which may have no current production but have excellent
reservoir qualities, are compatible with our AERO technology, and have significant original oil in
place remaining. We believe there are significant opportunities onshore U.S. to acquire and
reconstitute such previously abandoned fields and capture significant economic quantities of oil
which have been left behind by the industry. Our focus is on sandstone reservoirs with good
permeability and clear potential for waterflooding, which are therefore are good candidates to
benefit from our AERO technology. We believe by introducing AERO at the initiation of a
waterflood, we can improve oil recovery and reduce water use over the life of a field. Additionally,
since these inactive fields may not have produced any oil for many years, they can be acquired
or leased at low prices, when compared to producing assets.
Our goal is also to acquire and redevelop mature oil fields with historically long-lived, predictable
production profiles that fit our criteria for the AERO System. We believe our acquisition strategy
can enhance the revenues, cash flows and returns from such oil fields through waterflood
optimization and implementation of our AERO System of enhanced oil recovery. The decrease in
oil prices over the past 18 to 20 months has made it difficult to acquire producing oil assets as
potential sellers are hesitant to sell at depressed prices. Additionally, lenders and investors have
tended to limit new financings for the E&P industry. Therefore, Glori's ability to execute on its
acquisition strategy depends on relative stability in oil prices and on our ability to raise capital.
In connection with this initiative to regenerate and enhance abandoned mature fields, we applied
to the United States Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) for a $150 million
loan guarantee in connection with projects to apply AERO technology to previously abandoned
reservoirs in the U.S. We have identified several attractive candidate reservoirs that fit our criteria
as potential projects. Based on LPO’s evaluation of Part I of our application, on March 1, 2016,
LPO invited Glori to submit Part II of its application. In May 2016 we submitted Part II of the
application. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate outcome of the application or whether a
loan guarantee eventually will be issued. If a loan guarantee is ultimately not approved, or if the
final terms of the loan guarantee are not advantageous, the Company plans to seek alternative
financing to enable it to acquire and redevelop certain identified abandoned fields which fit its
criteria.
Glori Energy Technology Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly Glori Energy Inc.) ("GETI"), was
incorporated in November 2005 (as successor in interest to Glori Oil LLC) to increase production
and recovery from mature oil wells using state of the art biotechnology solutions.
On January 8, 2014, GETI entered into a merger and share exchange agreement with Infinity
Cross Border Acquisition Corporation ("INXB") and certain of its affiliates, Glori Acquisition Corp.,
Glori Merger Subsidiary, Inc., and Infinity-C.S.V.C. Management Ltd., as INXB Representative
(such transaction, the "Merger"). On April 14, 2014, the Merger was consummated. We obtained
effective control of INXB subsequent to the Merger and thus the Merger was accounted for as a
reverse acquisition and recapitalization of the Company. Subsequent to the Merger, our
shareholders retained a substantial majority of voting interest and positions on the Board of
Directors. Additionally our management was retained and our operations comprise the ongoing
operations post-Merger. In connection with the Merger, we received approximately $24.7 million,
net of certain
20
Table of Contents
expenses and fees, and approximately $13.7 million in cash from the private placement of
common stock for total proceeds of $38.4 million.
On March 14, 2014, a subsidiary of the Company, Glori Energy Production Inc. ("GEP"), acquired
the Coke Field from Petro-Hunt for (i) $38.0 million in cash and a $2.0 million convertible note
payable to Petro-Hunt, and (ii) the assumption of the asset retirement obligation related to
plugging and abandoning the Coke Field. Subsequent to the Merger the note payable to Petro-
Hunt was converted into common stock.
On June 1, 2015, GEP executed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain proved oil
and gas mineral leases in Refugio County, Texas (the “Bonnie View Field”) from a third party
seller for $2.6 million. The carrying value of the Bonnie View Field assets is also increased by an
asset retirement obligation associated with plugging and abandoning the Bonnie View Field
assets of $432 thousand.
Net loss for the second quarter of 2016 was $3.2 million, or $0.10 per share. This compares to a
second quarter 2015 net loss of $4.9 million, or a loss of $0.15 per share.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 million, reflecting a decrease of $1.4 million
from the second quarter of 2015. Oil and gas revenues decreased 46% to $1.2 million from $2.1
million in the second quarter 2015 due to a 25% decrease in average oil prices received and a
26% decrease in oil volumes produced and sold in the second quarter of 2016. Revenues from
our AERO technology services segment decreased to $72 thousand in the second quarter of
2016 from $496 thousand, a decrease of 86% from the second quarter of 2015 due to a decline in
the number of new projects in the 2016 period. Although our AERO System is a low cost
enhanced oil recovery solution, our 2016 service revenues have been adversely affected by
continued low oil prices and decreased capital spending by the E&P industry.
During the second quarter of 2016, we produced 29,003 net barrels of oil equivalents ("BOE") or
approximately 319 net BOE per day, including 27,150 barrels of oil and 11,116 thousand cubic
feet of natural gas, and received an average realized oil price of $42.64 per barrel. We utilize
certain volumes of natural gas production in operations at the Bonnie View field each month.
After the effect of oil price swap settlements, our oil price per barrel for the quarter was
approximately $69.18 per barrel. Production from liquids (oil and condensate) represented
approximately 94% of total production. Total production in the second quarter of 2016 decreased
approximately 20% from the first quarter of 2016 production primarily due to shutting in certain
uneconomic wells in the Coke Field in order to reduce lease operating expenses. Second
quarter 2015 production was 441 net BOE per day with an average realized price of $57.06 per
barrel and $1.47 per thousand cubic foot. Including the effect of oil price swap settlements, the
average realized oil price per barrel was $73.99 in the second quarter of 2015.
We had price swap derivatives in place covering approximately 72% of our oil and condensate
production for the second quarter of 2016. We continue to maintain price swaps covering a
portion of our estimated future production through December 2016, and have added costless
collars (a combination of put and call options to sell and buy oil) to cover a portion of our
estimated future production in the first half of 2017. In the three months ended June 30, 2016, we
recorded a net loss on commodity derivatives of approximately $437 thousand, which was net of
a $724 thousand realized gain on cash settlements received. In the previous year's second
quarter, we recorded a loss on commodity derivatives of $980 thousand, which was net of a $625
thousand realized gain on cash settlements received. See NOTE 6 in the Notes to the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional
information regarding our commodity derivative activities.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2016
 
Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues decreased by $1.0 million, or 46%, from $2.1 million
in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.2 million in the three months ended June 30,
2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a 25% decrease in average oil prices received
and a 26% decrease in oil production sold. Production decreased primarily due to a cost
reduction plan to improve field profitability at the Coke Field by shutting in uneconomic wells in
the low price environment and by reducing overall field expenses. Production from the Bonnie
View field, acquired in June 2015, partially offset the overall decrease in revenues and resulted
in the inclusion of an additional 2,130 barrels of oil sold in the 2016 period.
 
Service revenues. Service revenues decreased by $424 thousand, or 86%, from $496 thousand
in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $72 thousand in the three months ended June 30,
2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $416 thousand in Field
Deployment Phase services due to two projects which concluded in July 2015 and one project
which concluded in February 2016. Analysis Phase revenues decreased $8 thousand from the
prior year period. Service revenues have continued to be adversely impacted by the decrease in
oil prices which resulted in significant decreases in spending by our exploration and production
customers and prospects.

Table of Contents
Oil and gas operations. Oil and gas operating expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 50%, from
$2.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.2 million in the three months ended
June 30, 2016. Overhead expenses decreased $361 thousand, or 53%, due to decreases in third
party consulting fees and a reduction in compensation and benefits as a result of decreased
headcount. Lease operating expenses ("LOE") decreased by a net $896 thousand primarily due
to a $925 thousand, or 59%, decrease in Coke Field expenses due to cost reduction efforts. LOE
also decreased by $59 thousand due to the sale of the Etzold Field in July 2015. These
decreases in LOE were partially offset by the addition of $88 thousand in expenses for the
Bonnie View Field, which was purchased in June 2015. The overall decrease in oil and gas
operating expenses also included a decrease of $45 thousand in severance taxes due to
sustained lower oil prices and revenues. Ad valorem tax expense increased $38 thousand due to
an adjustment to the annualized estimate of the 2015 period tax assessment.
Service operations. Service operations expense decreased by $321 thousand, or 60%, from
$534 thousand in the second quarter of 2015 to $213 thousand in the second quarter 2016.
Approximately $107 thousand of the decrease is attributable to reduced project costs related to a
domestic field project which concluded during July 2015. Compensation and benefits decreased
$97 thousand due to decreased headcount. The remaining decrease is attributable to reduced
project costs related to projects in Canada and Brazil, which concluded during July 2015 and first
quarter 2016, respectively.
Science and technology. Science and technology expenses decreased by $320 thousand, or
51%, from $629 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $309 thousand in the three
months ended June 30, 2016 mostly due to a decrease of $162 thousand in compensation and
benefits due to decreased headcount and a decrease of $85 thousand related to a core flood
research project in the prior year period. Supplies and travel expenses decreased $61 thousand
due to a decline in the number of Analysis Phase services projects and cost reduction efforts.
The remaining decrease is attributable to a reduction in fees for recurring third party research
consulting.
 
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A"). SG&A expenses decreased by $131 thousand, or
9%, from $1.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.4 million in the three months
ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $211 thousand
from cost cutting measures in salaries, benefits, travel and certain other back office expenses,
including a reduction in fees paid to the Board of Directors. Increases in consulting and other
third party professional fees expenses partially offset the overall decrease in SG&A. SG&A
decreased $457 thousand, or 30%, in the second quarter of 2016 from the second quarter of
2015, excluding the impact of severance compensation liability recognized in the three months
ended June 30, 2016.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A"). DD&A decreased from $1.0 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2015 to $496 thousand in the three months ended June 30, 2016.
The overall decrease was due to a decrease in depletion expense of $527 thousand related to
the December 2015 impairment of the Coke and Bonnie View Fields as a result of the oil price
decline. Depletion expense for the second quarter of 2016 was calculated based on lower asset
values as compared to the second quarter of 2015 as a result of impairment during the fourth
quarter of 2015, and on lower production as a result of shutting in or reducing flow rates for
certain uneconomic wells.
 
Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net, decreased $673 thousand from an expense of
$1.5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015 to an expense of $827 thousand in the
three months ended June 30, 2016. Our commodity derivatives, which include price swaps that
were entered into in connection with the acquisition of the Coke Field in March 2014 and 2017
costless collars that were entered into in June 2016, resulted in a net loss of $437 thousand in
the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $980 thousand in the prior year
period. In the 2016 period, the derivative loss consisted of a $1.2 million unrealized loss on the
change in fair value of future settlements due to an increase in NYMEX oil futures prices from the
beginning to the end of the quarter, which was partially offset by a $724 thousand realized gain
on price swap settlements. In the 2015 period, the commodity derivative loss consisted of a $1.6
million unrealized loss on the change in fair value of future settlements, which was partially offset
by a $625 thousand realized gain on price swap settlements. Interest expense also decreased
$138 thousand compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to the repayment of debt.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 and 2016
Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues decreased by $1.9 million from $4.1 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The
decrease was attributable to a 32% decrease in average oil prices received and a 21% decrease
in oil production sold. Production decreased due to a cost reduction plan to improve field
profitability at the Coke Field shutting in certain uneconomic wells and due to the July 1, 2015
sale of the Etzold Field. The decrease in production from the Coke and Etzold Fields was
partially offset by the purchase of the Bonnie View Field which closed on June 1, 2015 and
resulted in the inclusion of an additional 6,980 barrels of oil sold in the 2016 period.

Table of Contents
Service revenues. Service revenues decreased by $817 thousand, or 77%, from $1.1 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $246 thousand in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $808 thousand in Field
Deployment Phase services due to one project which concluded in February 2015, two projects
which concluded in July 2015, and one project which concluded in the first quarter 2016.
Analysis Phase revenues decreased $8 thousand from the prior year period. Service revenues
have continued to be adversely impacted by the decrease in oil prices which resulted in
significant decreases in spending by our exploration and production customers and prospects.
Oil and gas operations. Oil and gas operating expense decreased by $1.8 million, or 36%, from
$4.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $3.1 million in the six months ended June
30, 2016. Overhead expenses decreased by $585 thousand due to decreases in third party
consulting fees and a reduction in compensation and benefits as a result of decreased
headcount. LOE decreased by a net $1.0 million primarily due to a $1.2 million, or 41%, decrease
in Coke Field expenses due to cost reduction efforts. LOE also decreased by $155 thousand due
to the sale of the Etzold Field in July 2015. These decreases in LOE were partially offset by the
addition of $293 thousand in expenses for the Bonnie View Field, which was purchased in June
2015. The overall decrease in oil and gas operating expenses also included a decrease of $91
thousand in severance taxes due to sustained lower oil prices and revenues and a decrease of
$52 thousand in ad valorem tax expense due to a revised tax assessment.
Service operations. Service operations expense decreased by $569 thousand, or 54%, from $1.1
million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $486 thousand in the six months ended June
30, 2016. Approximately $244 thousand of the decrease is attributable to reduced project costs
such as trucking and nutrient solution related to two domestic field projects, which concluded
during February and July 2015, and $101 thousand of the decrease resulted from the conclusion
of a Canadian field project in July 2015. Compensation and benefits decreased $169 thousand
due to a decrease in service operations headcount resulting from the decreased number of
projects. The remaining decrease is attributable to the conclusion of a project in Brazil during the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Science and technology. Science and technology expenses decreased by $460 thousand, or
42%, from $1.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $643 thousand in the six months
ended June 30, 2016 mostly due to a decrease of $245 thousand in compensation and benefits
due to decreased headcount and a decrease of $85 thousand related to a core flood research
project in the prior year period. Supplies and travel expenses decreased $104 thousand due to a
decline in the number of Analysis Phase services projects and cost reduction efforts. The
remaining decrease is attributable to a reduction in fees for recurring third party research
consulting.
Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A"). SG&A expenses decreased by $431 thousand, or
13%, from $3.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.8 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $699 thousand
from cost cutting measures in salaries, benefits, travel and certain other back office expenses,
including a reduction in fees paid to the Board of Directors. Increases in consulting and other
third party professional fees expenses partially offset the overall decrease in SG&A. SG&A
decreased $757 thousand, or 23%, in the six months ended June 30, 2016 from the six months
ended June 30, 2015, excluding the impact of severance compensation liability, recognized in
June 2016.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A"). DD&A decreased from $2.1 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2015 to $1.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The overall
decrease was due to a decrease in depletion expense of $1.1 million related to the December
2015 impairment of the Coke and Bonnie View fields as a result of the oil price decline.
Depletion expense for the 2016 period was calculated based on lower asset values as compared
to the 2015 period as a result of impairment during the fourth quarter of 2015, and on lower
production as a result of shutting in or reducing flow rates for certain uneconomic wells.
Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net, increased $143 thousand from an expense of
$861 thousand in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to an expense of $1.0 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2016. Our commodity derivatives, which include price swaps that were
entered into in connection with the acquisition of the Coke Field in March 2014 and 2017
costless collars that were entered into in June 2016, resulted in a net loss of $282 thousand in
the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a net gain of $389 thousand in the prior year
period. In the 2016 period, the derivative loss consisted of a $2.2 million unrealized loss on the
change in fair value of future settlements due to an increase in NYMEX oil futures prices from the
beginning to the end of the quarter, which was partially offset by a $1.9 million realized gain on
price swap settlements. In the 2015 period, the derivative gain consisted of a $1.8 million
realized gain on price swap settlements, which was partially offset by a $1.4 million unrealized
loss on the change in fair value of future settlements. Interest expense decreased $510 thousand
compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to the repayment of debt, including debt used to
partially fund the Coke Field acquisition and the $8.0 million secured term promissory note which
was prepaid in March 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The significant risks, uncertainties, significant working capital deficit, historical operating losses
and resulting cash used in operations discussed in Item 1. Condensed Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, NOTE 3 - Liquidity Considerations and Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting,
which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments, in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty.
The Company cannot offer any assurance that it will be successful in executing the plans
described herein to continue as a going concern.
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital since our formation have been proceeds from equity
issuances and borrowings. To date, our primary use of capital has been to fund acquisitions,
principally the purchase of the Coke Field, to fund our operations and for payments on debt.
 
As of August 10, 2016, the Company does not have any lines of credit available to it. At June 30,
2016, we had a working capital deficit of $6.4 million, made up of current assets of $5.5 million
and current liabilities of $11.9 million. The current asset balance is comprised of cash and cash
equivalents of $3.1 million, accounts receivable of $792 thousand, commodity derivative
contracts receivable of $1.2 million, and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $297
thousand. Included in current liabilities is $644 thousand in accounts payable, $1.2 million in
accrued expenses, including $215 thousand in short-term asset retirement obligations, and $10.2
million in current portion of long-term debt, which is presented on the June 30, 2016 condensed
consolidated balance sheet net of debt issuance costs of $156 thousand.
 
Contingent on our ability to obtain financing, we intend to acquire and redevelop previously
abandoned fields and capture significant economic quantities of oil which have been left behind
by the industry. We target fields which may have no current production but have excellent
reservoir qualities and are compatible with our AERO technology. Since these inactive fields
may not have produced oil for many years, they can be leased at favorable prices, when
compared to producing assets. Planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months consist
of approximately $100 thousand for existing field operations, and depending on the availability of
capital, up to approximately $1.2 million for leasing acreage in specific abandoned oil fields we
have targeted. We will adjust the amount and timing of our capital spending dependent upon our
cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, and the availability of capital. As of June 30, 2016,
we did not have any commitments for the acquisition of oil properties or any other significant
capital commitments.
The price of oil increased 37% during the second quarter of 2016 based on the Cushing,
Oklahoma - West Texas Intermediate spot prices of $35.36 per barrel on April 1, 2016 and
$48.27 on June 30, 2016. Subsequent to June 2016, the oil price fell to $42.40 per barrel as of
July 25, 2016. A sustained lower oil price through September 2016 will negatively impact third
quarter oil revenues and profitability from our oil producing assets, which will be partially offset by
other income realized from oil price swap settlements. Using an assumed average oil price of
$40 per barrel, and assuming second quarter production volumes, oil and gas revenues would
have decreased from $1.2 to $1.1 million, and the realized gain on monthly oil price swap
settlements would have increased from $724 thousand in the second quarter to $834 thousand in
the third quarter of 2016. See ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk for discussion on the potential impact of an oil price decline.
Revenues and cash flows from our existing oil properties represent the principal source of our
cash from operating activities. Operating cash flow from our existing oil properties, after direct
operating expenses and related overhead costs, are principally dedicated to servicing the $10.2
million term note. We currently have oil price swaps in place totaling 6,550 barrels per month at
$82.46 per barrel for the remainder of 2016. In the three and six months periods ended June 30,
2016, we realized cash gains of $724 thousand and $1.9 million from our oil price swaps,
respectively. Since our oil price swaps expire in December 2016, we will not realize cash gains
from them after December 2016. However, we placed costless oil collars for the first six months of
2017 with a floor of $42.50 per barrel and a ceiling of $55.60 per barrel for 100 barrels of oil per
day. While we have entered into swaps for a portion of our oil production during 2016 and collars
for a portion of our oil production in the first half of 2017, revenues and cash flows from our oil
properties and AERO services have been adversely affected by the depressed oil prices. As a
small company with an emerging technology we have not historically generated positive cash
flows, and we do not currently generate positive cash flows from operations.
The rapid drop in oil prices has made it difficult to execute on our strategy of acquiring producing
properties which would contribute to our revenues and cash flows due to potential sellers’
reluctance to sell at depressed prices. Additionally, the current oil price environment has
negatively affected the availability of capital to Glori and the E&P industry in general, and has
also resulted in a dramatic decrease in our stock price, which also impacts our ability to raise
new equity capital.
26
Table of Contents
We have made significant cost reductions, both in our administrative and professional staff, and
our lease operating expenses. The cost reductions were implemented both in 2015 and in the
first quarter of 2016.
In August 2015, we implemented the first phase of AERO at the Coke field. In March 2016 we
completed installation of phase II of our AERO implementation. Phase II incorporates the addition
of two AERO injection wells to increase the proportion of the field that is impacted by AERO
technology. Glori now has three injection wells running in total. Phase II implementation
commenced after data from phase I limited trial demonstrated encouraging indication of AERO
performance. The wells are located on the periphery of the Coke field and are designed to
stimulate production from more of the field than was impacted by the first injector.
We will need to raise financing over the next six to nine months to fund our operations and to
repay or refinance the term note issued by GEP of $10.2 million which matures in March 2017,
and to enable us to take advantage of identified opportunities to acquire abandoned oil fields
which have a substantial amount of remaining oil in place. We have taken steps which, if
successful, we believe will facilitate raising additional financing. However, we may have difficulty
obtaining such financing as a result of the decrease in oil prices, our negative cash flows from
operations and the significant decrease in our share price.
The following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for the periods presented (in
thousands):

Operating Activities
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our operating activities used $3.3 million in cash.
Our net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $6.6 million. Non-cash items totaled an
expense of $3.7 million, consisting of $1.0 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization,
$2.2 million for an unrealized loss on the change in fair value of commodity derivatives, $273
thousand for stock based compensation expense, $110 thousand for amortization of deferred
loan costs, and $118 thousand for other non-cash expenses. Changes in operating assets and
liabilities reduced net cash by $287 thousand for the period. The cash decrease from changes in
operating assets and liabilities was caused by a decrease in accounts payable of $786 thousand
and a decrease in accrued expenses of $116 thousand. These uses of cash were partially offset
by a decrease in accounts receivable of $598 thousand and a decrease in prepaid expenses and
other current assets of $17 thousand. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses
were due to ad valorem taxes payable which are paid out during the first quarter, invoices related
to AERO phase II and a reduction in accrued interest as we had three months of accrued interest
for our long-term debt as of December 31, 2015 and only one month as of June 30, 2016.
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, our operating activities used $5.8 million in cash.
Our net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $7.9 million. Non-cash items totaled to
an expense of $4.6 million, consisting of $2.1 million of depreciation, depletion and amortization,
$1.4 million for an unrealized loss on commodity swaps, $838 thousand for stock based
compensation expense, $194 thousand for amortization of deferred loan costs and other non-
cash expenses totaling $104 thousand. Changes in operating assets and liabilities reduced net
cash by $2.6 million for the period. The cash decrease from changes in operating assets and
liabilities was caused by a decrease in accounts payable of $1.4 million, a decrease in deferred
revenues of $620 thousand and a decrease in accrued expenses of $587 thousand. These uses
of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $186 thousand. The
decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due to the timing of payments for
obligations which we recognized during our annual close, and the decrease in deferred revenue
is due to recognition of previously unearned revenues which was triggered as certain services
projects progressed through the Field Deployment Phase.
 
Our future cash flow from operations will depend on many factors including our ability to acquire
oil fields, successfully deploy our AERO System technology on such oil fields, oil prices and our
ability to reduce our expenses.

Investing Activities
Our capital expenditures were $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
$4.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, a
majority of the capital expenditures were associated with implementing phase II of our AERO
System technology at the Coke Field, including the drilling of a water source well and the re-entry
of two plugged wells for the injection of AERO nutrients. Phase II commenced during March 2016
with the injection of nutrients into two wells. Additional expenditures were made during the 2016
period for unproved property leasing efforts. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, capital
expenditures of $2.6 million were due to the June 1, 2015 purchase of the Bonnie View Field. A
majority of the remainder of the capital expenditures were efforts associated with implementing
our AERO System technology at the Coke Field, including unitization, drilling of a water source
well and an injection well. Additional expenditures were made for other unproved property
leasing efforts in East Texas.
 
Financing Activities
 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, cash used by financing activities was $584
thousand consisting of $316 thousand in principal payments on long-term debt, $228 thousand in
deferred charges related to our loan guarantee application to the United States Department of
Energy’s LPO, and $40 thousand in annual administrative fees related to our senior secured term
loan.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, cash used by financing activities was $2.1
million consisting of $2.2 million in payments on long-term debt and $40 thousand in payments
for deferred loan costs. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $130 thousand
from stock option exercises. Payments on long-term debt included $888 thousand for the
prepayment of the remaining principal balance on an $8.0 million secured term promissory note
originated in 2012.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard
that will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under United States generally
accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The issuance of this guidance completes the joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to
improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP
and IFRS.
The core principle of the new guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for
28
Table of Contents
those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step model that requires companies to
exercise judgment when considering the terms of a contract and all relevant facts and
circumstances. The standard allows for two transition methods: (a) a full retrospective adoption in
which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or (b) a modified retrospective
adoption in which the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the
financial statements, including additional disclosures of the standard’s application impact to
individual financial statement line items. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are
currently evaluating this standard and the impact it will have on our future revenue recognition
policies.
In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15: Presentation of
Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an
Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 asserts that
management should evaluate whether there are relevant conditions or events that are known and
reasonably knowable that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be
issued when applicable. If conditions or events at the date the financial statements are issued
raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosures are
required which will enable users of the financial statements to understand the conditions or
events as well as management’s evaluation and plan. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual
period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter; early
application is permitted. Glori adopted this standard during the second quarter of 2016. See Part
I, Item 1. Note 3 of this report for a discussion about liquidity considerations and Glori's ability to
continue as a going concern.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Interest—Imputation of Interest: Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (ASU 2015-03). ASU 2015-03 is effective for fiscal
years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and
early adoption is permitted. Prior GAAP guidance mandates recognizing debt issuance costs as
a deferred charge. Such treatment is different from the guidance in International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), which requires that transaction costs be deducted from the carrying
value of the financial liability and not recorded as separate assets. Additionally, the requirement
to recognize debt issuance costs as deferred charges conflicts with the guidance in FASB
Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, which states that debt issuance
costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby
increasing the effective interest rate. Concepts Statement 6 further states that debt issuance costs
cannot be an asset because they provide no future economic benefit. To simplify presentation of
debt issuance costs, the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this
Update. Glori adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2016. See Part I, Item 1. Note 2 of
this report for a discussion of the impact of ASU No. 2015-03.
In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17: Income Taxes
(Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). ASU 2015-17 is
part of an initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts
in a classified statement of financial position. However, this classification does not generally
align with the time period in which the recognized deferred tax amounts are expected to be
recovered or settled. To simplify the presentation of the deferred income taxes, ASU 2015-17
requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of
an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments of ASU
2015-17. For public entities, ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years; early
application is permitted. During the first quarter of 2016 Glori chose to adopt the standard.
Because the Company has applied a 100% valuation allowance to its net deferred tax asset,
there are no deferred tax accounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31,
2016. This Standard would have otherwise been effective for the Company’s fiscal year
beginning January 1, 2017, but Management believes that the revised presentation more
realistically reflects the Company’s financial position related to deferred income taxes. As
allowed by the Standard, the company has elected to apply the provisions prospectively, and
accordingly, has not adjusted deferred tax accounts retrospectively for any earlier periods.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02: Leases (Topic
842). The main objective of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and
disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous
GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those
leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to
recognize assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 requires
disclosures by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial
statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In
transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of
the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
29
Table of Contents
approach. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years;
early application is permitted. We are currently evaluating this standard and the impact it will
have on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which seeks to
simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions including income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of
cash flows. The new standard requires the Company to recognize the income tax effects of
awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted and if an entity
early adopts the guidance in an interim period, any adjustments must be reflected as of the
beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Commodities Risk
Our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our oil production. Our
results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices.
Realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to oil in the
region produced. Prices received for oil, condensate, and natural gas, none of which are for
trading purposes, are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control, none of which are
for trading purposes. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have
entered into derivative instruments. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, a 10% change in
the prices received for oil, condensate, and natural gas production would have had an
approximate $116 thousand impact on our revenues prior to commodity derivatives which
partially mitigate our commodity pricing risk. See NOTE 6 in the Notes to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information
regarding our commodity derivative activities.
Interest Rate Risk
Our floating rate loan facility exposes us to interest rate risk. Our credit facility is based on interest
at a floating rate that is subject to increase based upon certain increases in the prime rate or
LIBOR. Therefore upward fluctuations in interest rates expose us to additional interest payments.
As of June 30, 2016, our credit facility is a $10.2 million current liability which matures in March
2017. An increase of 100 basis points in both the prime and LIBOR interest rate will expose us to
a $26,000 quarterly increase in interest.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”),
as of June 30, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
