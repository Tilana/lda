1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX.
Listing  Rule  4.10.3  requires  an  entity  that  is  included  in  the official  list  as  an  ASX  Listing  to  include  in  its  annual  report 
either  a  corporate  governance statement  that  meets  the  requirements  of  that  rule  or  the  URL  of  the  page  on  its  website 
where such a statement is located. The corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has 
followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has 
not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate governance statement must separately 
identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not following the 
recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that 
period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its 
annual report, it must lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual 
report with ASX. The corporate governance statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement 
for the purposes of rule 4.10.3. 
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 
which  discloses  the  extent  to  which  an  entity  has  followed  the  recommendations  set  by  the  ASX  Corporate  Governance 
Council during a particular reporting period.
