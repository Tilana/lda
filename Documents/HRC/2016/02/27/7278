<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Eritrea &#8212; her third report under the mandate &#8212; is submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>in accordance with Council resolution 26/24.  
</p>
<p>2. In the same resolution the Human Rights Council established, for a period of one 
</p>
<p>year, a commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of human rights in 
</p>
<p>Eritrea, as outlined in the reports of the Special Rapporteur. The commission of inquiry is 
</p>
<p>composed of three members: Mike Smith (Chair), Victor Dankwa and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on providing an update on the 
</p>
<p>activities she has undertaken since her previous report and on salient human rights issues, 
</p>
<p>as the commission of inquiry will also be presenting its report to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>at its twenty-ninth session (A/HRC/29/42). She also discusses forced evictions and the 
</p>
<p>demolition of houses in Eritrea, while emphasizing that this is an area requiring further 
</p>
<p>scrutiny, and reflects on the achievements she has made since taking up the mandate on 
</p>
<p>1 November 2012. Lastly, she provides conclusions and recommendations on the situation 
</p>
<p>of human rights in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>4. Although the Special Rapporteur would have preferred to collect first-hand 
</p>
<p>information on the situation of human rights in country, she had no other option but to 
</p>
<p>gather material through alternative means, as she still does not have access to the country. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur conducted field visits, interviewed refugees, migrants and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and analysed the submissions that she received in the preparation for the 
</p>
<p>present report. 
</p>
<p>5. In the course of her work, the Special Rapporteur has come across numerous reports 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations committed along migration routes against Eritrean victims and 
</p>
<p>survivors who were on the move as migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. Those human 
</p>
<p>rights violations form part of a broader continuum of violations that are committed within 
</p>
<p>the country, as many Eritreans find themselves outside the country as a consequence of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations they suffered in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Challenges faced in the implementation of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur held two independent 
</p>
<p>mandates of the Human Rights Council simultaneously: the special rapporteurship and 
</p>
<p>membership in the commission of inquiry. In undertaking those mandates, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur sought to ensure that the integrity of both was maintained; while she 
</p>
<p>encountered practical challenges arising out of this delicate situation, nothing compromised 
</p>
<p>one or the other. Furthermore, the Human Rights Council&#8217;s decision on the coexistence of 
</p>
<p>both mandates ensured that a focus on the human rights situation in Eritrea was maintained 
</p>
<p>despite the taxing workload burden placed upon the mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>7. During the current reporting period, the Special Rapporteur had one opportunity to 
</p>
<p>meet with Eritrean diplomats for discussions. She would like to thank the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Representative of Eritrea to the United Nations in New York, Girma Asmerom, for the 
</p>
<p>exchanges they had on 29 October 2014. The Special Rapporteur agreed with Mr. 
</p>
<p>Asmerom that constructive dialogue was indeed required to advance the human rights 
</p>
<p>agenda in Eritrea. However, she stressed that Eritrea could not selectively pick and choose 
</p>
<p>which United Nations human rights mechanisms it would cooperate with. The Special </p>


<p>Rapporteur is still looking forward to an opportunity to visit Eritrea at the invitation of the 
</p>
<p>Government. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the numerous Eritreans who have 
</p>
<p>offered valuable information to enable her to prepare her reports and advocate for the 
</p>
<p>improvement of the human rights situation in the country. She appreciates their courage to 
</p>
<p>speak with her despite the real possibility of reprisals against themselves and their families 
</p>
<p>in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of the Special Rapporteur (July 2014</b>&#8211;<b>May 2015) 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Visit to Italy  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur conducted a five-day mission to Italy from 22 to 
</p>
<p>26 September 2014, to collect first-hand information from refugees and migrants, many of 
</p>
<p>them very young, about human rights violations in their home country. Several of those she 
</p>
<p>spoke with had arrived in Italy after braving unimaginable dangers along escape routes in 
</p>
<p>the desert and at sea. The Special Rapporteur met with government officials, 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians, members of civil society and other stakeholders in the diaspora. Her 
</p>
<p>findings and conclusions confirmed widespread and systematic human rights violations as a 
</p>
<p>trigger for the massive flight of Eritreans from all walks of life from their home country.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Briefing to the Third Committee  
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur presented a briefing to the Third Committee on 28 October 
</p>
<p>2014, at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, her second briefing to the 
</p>
<p>Committee since she took up the mandate. The Special Rapporteur informed the Committee 
</p>
<p>about the following: the persisting challenges in the implementation of her mandate; the 
</p>
<p>generally unchanged human rights situation in Eritrea, resulting in mass departures of 4,000 
</p>
<p>people per month, some very young, seeking refuge outside their country; the main driver 
</p>
<p>of the outflow, which remained the indefinite nature of national service and violations in 
</p>
<p>the context of that service; poor respect for civil and political rights; and the deterioration in 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by those who remain in Eritrea, many 
</p>
<p>of whom, according to several testimonies collected, are dependent on the support of 
</p>
<p>relatives and friends from the diaspora. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Visit to Belgium  
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur conducted an official visit to Belgium from 9 to 11 March 
</p>
<p>2015, where she met with Eritrean refugees, migrants and other actors in the diaspora. The 
</p>
<p>main aim was to collect first-hand and up-to-date information on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights in Eritrea and to corroborate allegations of human rights violations in the country as 
</p>
<p>contained in reports the Special Rapporteur received from different sources. She also met 
</p>
<p>with government officials and civil society interlocutors.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Address to the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur participated in an exchange of views on Eritrea at the 
</p>
<p>invitation of the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights on 17 March 2015. </p>


<p>As the main speaker, the Special Rapporteur briefed the members about the serious human 
</p>
<p>rights situation in Eritrea, which is causing a stream of refugees to leave the country. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Participation at the fifty-sixth ordinary session of the African 
</b></p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Human Rights Council has encouraged special procedures mandate holders to 
</p>
<p>establish and maintain contacts with regional human rights mechanisms working on issues 
</p>
<p>related to their mandate to ensure exchanges of information, coordination and mutual 
</p>
<p>support in common areas of work.1 In addition, in January 2012, the special procedures 
</p>
<p>mandate holders of the Council and of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights adopted a road map to enhance their collaboration following a meeting in Addis 
</p>
<p>Ababa. They agreed to regularly and systematically exchange information, consider joint 
</p>
<p>actions, including country visits, public statements, press releases and awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>occasions, and participate in each other&#8217;s events and thematic research.2 
</p>
<p>14. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur attended the opening ceremony 
</p>
<p>and the first three days of the fifty-sixth ordinary session of the Commission, which was 
</p>
<p>held in Banjul from 21 April to 7 May 2015.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur also participated in a panel discussion on freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression in Eritrea on 21 April 2015, during which the plights of the 18 journalists 
</p>
<p>arrested in September 2001 and other journalists were highlighted. Following the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion, the Commission&#8217;s Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to 
</p>
<p>Information in Africa launched a report entitled <i>The Erosion of the Rule of Law in Eritrea: 
</i></p>
<p><i>Silencing Freedom of Expression</i>.3 The authors of the report deplored the state of freedom 
</p>
<p>of expression specifically, and the rule of law generally, in Eritrea. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also took the opportunity to brief different special mechanisms of the Commission on the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in Eritrea.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Updates on the situation of human rights in Eritrea  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Coming into force of new laws 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur would like to commend the Government of Eritrea for the 
</p>
<p>coming into force of the following laws: the Civil Code, the Penal Code, the Code of Civil 
</p>
<p>Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure. Those laws had remained in &#8220;transitional 
</p>
<p>mode&#8221; since de facto independence in 1991.4  
</p>
<p>17. The Civil Code is the general law that governs persons and family relations, as well 
</p>
<p>as property rights, obligations and contracts, and extra-contractual liability in Eritrea. For 
</p>
<p>example, it regulates marriage, including the minimum age of marriage and the compulsory 
</p>
<p>nature of registering marriage contracts. The Code of Civil Procedure is a procedural law 
</p>
<p>that sets out the rules and standards that courts use in the adjudication of civil cases.

</p>
<p>associated-procedures. </p>


<p>18. The Penal Code governs all areas of law that fall under the broader categorization of 
</p>
<p>criminal law, containing definitions and elements of crimes, as well as prescribed 
</p>
<p>punishments. In the context of the human rights landscape in Eritrea, the Code of Criminal 
</p>
<p>Procedure perhaps bears extra significance. In addition to governing court proceedings 
</p>
<p>emanating from contraventions of the penal code, it provides safeguards for individual rights 
</p>
<p>and freedoms during criminal proceedings. Eritrean lawyers call it a &#8220;mini-constitution&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>19. Having documented and reported on arbitrariness, especially in relation to arrests 
</p>
<p>and detention in Eritrea, the Special Rapporteur had anticipated that the long overdue 
</p>
<p>coming into force of the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure would bring 
</p>
<p>consistency and uniformity to the application of the law and an element of certainty. 
</p>
<p>However, these crucial laws have come into force in a context of constitutional void, since 
</p>
<p>the 1997 Constitution, publicized as the supreme law of the land, remains unimplemented 
</p>
<p>and is now subject to a constitutional review process, the modalities of which remain 
</p>
<p>unclear.5 Additionally, the new codes were promulgated in the absence of a functioning 
legislature, the existence of which would support the achievement of a separation of powers 
</p>
<p>between the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. Under such separation of powers 
</p>
<p>&#8212; a basic tenet of the rule of law (see S/2004/616, para. 6) &#8212; distinction is made between 
</p>
<p>the functions of government, in particular with respect to the passing, interpretation, 
</p>
<p>adjudication and enforcement of laws.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Urgent appeal 
</b></p>
<p>20. On 18 June 2014, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
</p>
<p>rights in Eritrea, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment sent an urgent appeal 
</p>
<p>to the Government of Eritrea regarding the alleged arrest and arbitrary detention of the former 
</p>
<p>Ambassador of Eritrea to Nigeria, Mohammed Ali Omaro. According to the information 
</p>
<p>received (see A/HRC/28/85, p. 14), on 29 April 2014, security personnel in plain clothes 
</p>
<p>arrested Mr. Ali Omaro in Asmara and took him to an unknown location, where he is being 
</p>
<p>detained incommunicado. He has been denied family visits and access to a lawyer and to a 
</p>
<p>doctor, despite his serious heart condition and urgent need for regular medication and medical 
</p>
<p>care. It is reported that he has not been formally charged and has not been brought before a 
</p>
<p>judge. The reasons for his arrest and detention are unknown, but it is believed that his 
</p>
<p>detention is politically motivated. No response has been received to date. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Review of Eritrea by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Discrimination against Women 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women reviewed the 
</p>
<p>fourth and fifth periodic reports of Eritrea (CEDAW/C/ERI/5) at its sixtieth session, in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 The President of Eritrea announced in May 2014 that Eritrea would go through a constitution-drafting 
</p>
<p>process to adopt a new constitution. The Special Rapporteur holds the view that the 1997 Constitution 
</p>
<p>came out of a widely participative process; the immediate implementation of the Constitution would 
</p>
<p>not exclude a drafting process to align it with current international human rights standards, which may 
</p>
<p>take several years, but would, in the meantime, give constitutional protection to all Eritrean citizens, 
</p>
<p>eliminating the pervasive element of arbitrariness in the enjoyment of fundamental rights and 
</p>
<p>freedoms. </p>


<p>February 2015. Eritrea was commended for undertaking legislative reforms, in particular 
</p>
<p>the adoption of Proclamation No. 158/2007 to abolish female genital mutilation/cutting. On 
</p>
<p>the other hand, the Committee highlighted that it considered the indefinite period of 
</p>
<p>national service, the ineffective implementation of the Constitution of 1997 and the 
</p>
<p>suspension of the National Assembly as having contributed to the deterioration of the rule 
</p>
<p>of law and a serious refugee crisis, which posed a challenge to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. The Committee recommended, among other things, the discontinuation of the 
</p>
<p>indefinite period of national service and the forced enrolment at the Sawa Military Training 
</p>
<p>Centre, and recognition of the right to conscientious objection (see , paras. 4, 6 and 9). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Review of Eritrea by the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Committee on the Rights of the Child reviewed the fourth periodic report of 
</p>
<p>Eritrea (CRC/C/ERI/4) at its sixty-ninth session, in May 2015. The Committee welcomed 
</p>
<p>the adoption of the new civil procedure and penal procedure code, the formulation of a new 
</p>
<p>national policy on children and a comprehensive policy on disabilities, the criminalization 
</p>
<p>of female genital mutilation, and progress in achieving the health-related Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals. The Committee was, however, concerned about the absence of data 
</p>
<p>and systematic child impact assessments in the formulation of laws and policies, the 
</p>
<p>absence of an independent monitoring body, the prevalence of early child marriage and 
</p>
<p>teenage pregnancies as ways to avoid conscription into military service, the shoot-to-kill 
</p>
<p>policy at the border for persons, including children, who cross illegally, the torture and 
</p>
<p>detention faced by unsuccessful child asylum seekers and other child returnees, and the 
</p>
<p>impediments affecting access to birth registration. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Refugees and migrants 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
</p>
<p>reported that in the first 10 months of 2014, the number of Eritrean asylum seekers arriving 
</p>
<p>in Europe nearly tripled, from 13,000 the previous year to 37,000.6 It has also noted that in 
</p>
<p>2015, by April, 5,388 Eritreans, including 604 unaccompanied minors, 157 accompanied 
</p>
<p>minors and 1,105 women, had arrived in Italy by boat, surviving the dangerous journey 
</p>
<p>across the Sahara desert and then across the Mediterranean Sea. In 2014, Eritreans were the 
</p>
<p>second largest group, after Syrians, apprehended at European Union external borders trying 
</p>
<p>to enter in an irregular manner and the second largest group of asylum seekers in the 
</p>
<p>European Union.7 The number of Eritrean refugees in the Sudan and Ethiopia transiting 
</p>
<p>southwards towards South Sudan or westwards towards Libya has been increasing. 
</p>
<p>Fatalities in the Mediterranean continue, and UNHCR estimates that there have already 
</p>
<p>been over 1,800 fatalities in 2015. The deadliest incident recorded to date occurred on 
</p>
<p>19 April 2015, when more than 800 people died, including about 350 Eritrean migrants and 
</p>
<p>refugees;8 there was a total of 3,500 deaths in 2014.9 These figures have grown

<p>exponentially since the Special Rapporteur started presenting such data to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>24. To stem the exodus, a more holistic approach is required, which looks at long-term 
</p>
<p>solutions that place human rights as the nucleus while creating new opportunities for all, in 
</p>
<p>particular for young people. As the Special Rapporteur has indicated previously, the 
</p>
<p>international community needs to expand channels of legal migration to reduce irregular 
</p>
<p>migration in order to counter human smuggling and trafficking, while treating victims 
</p>
<p>humanely (see A/HRC/23/53, para. 108 (c)). 
</p>
<p><b> F. Unaccompanied minors 
</b></p>
<p>25. The plight of unaccompanied Eritrean minors crossing international borders is 
</p>
<p>becoming increasingly visible, revealing a population characterized by its heightened 
</p>
<p>vulnerability. Eritrean minors, usually males between 12 and 17 years of age, manage the 
</p>
<p>journey across the borders into neighbouring countries, and then through the desert and 
</p>
<p>across the Mediterranean Sea. On reaching Italy, many keep moving north.  
</p>
<p>26. In 2013, the Special Rapporteur met hundreds of those unaccompanied minors in a 
</p>
<p>refugee camp across the border from Eritrea; she met a few further afield in Tunisia, and 
</p>
<p>some in Milan, Italy, in September 2014. At risk of falling prey to many forms of abuse, 
</p>
<p>including sexual, economic and criminal, these minors represent a group with special 
</p>
<p>protection needs. Since her first encounter with children in such situations, she has 
</p>
<p>continued to bring their predicament to the attention of the international community.10  
</p>
<p>27. In conversations with unaccompanied Eritrean minors, the Special Rapporteur tried 
</p>
<p>to understand why they were on the move. The reasons they provided included the 
</p>
<p>following: (a) fear of forced conscription into the national service, with a high number of 
</p>
<p>children leaving before their recruitment, thus accounting for the majority of young males 
</p>
<p>between 12 and 17 years of age; (b) avoidance of the <i>giffas</i>, or round-ups, before forceful 
</p>
<p>recruitment into the military, especially in the cases of those who were less academically 
</p>
<p>able; (c) hopelessness, as they envisaged a life with no prospects other than the military, 
</p>
<p>since most of them had older siblings and even a parent or other family members serving; 
</p>
<p>(d) family disintegration; (e) difficulties faced by child-headed households in the long 
</p>
<p>absence of parents who were either away in the military service, incarcerated or in exile; (f) 
</p>
<p>fears of facing the same ordeal as their parents, in particular among those who witnessed 
</p>
<p>their parents being incarcerated on the basis of their religious affiliation; (g) lack of 
</p>
<p>educational opportunities; (h) desire to follow friends, and peer pressure, as their role 
</p>
<p>models had left already; and (i) desire to join family members already abroad.11  
</p>
<p>28. The consequences of these risky journeys across international borders, the desert and 
</p>
<p>the sea are too dire to bear and the impact on unaccompanied minors could be everlasting, 
</p>
<p>leaving them scarred for life. They are exposed to new threats along the way, which are 
even more horrendous than what they have already been subjected to.12

<p> 11 Parents who had left young children behind a few years before when they fled were making 
</p>
<p>arrangements, financial and other, for reunion with their children.  
</p>
<p> 12 The Special Rapporteur received reports that five Eritrean children, who had been held captive by the 
</p>
<p>Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant but managed to escape, were allegedly eyewitnesses to the recent 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> G. Trafficking in persons, including children 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur has been concerned about Eritrean refugees, asylum seekers 
</p>
<p>and migrants, and those whose fate are in the hands of smugglers and traffickers when they 
</p>
<p>escape or are coerced into fleeing from their country. She has consistently raised concerns 
</p>
<p>about their plight (see A/HRC/23/53, paras. 91&#8211;94), noting that the primary responsibility 
</p>
<p>of States is to ensure that all border governance measures protect the rights of all persons to 
</p>
<p>leave and enter their own country any time. Irregular migration, human smuggling and 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons should not adversely affect the dignity of the populations concerned 
</p>
<p>and their enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p>30. Furthermore, the best interests of the child should take precedence over migration 
</p>
<p>management objectives and other administrative considerations.13 The core obligations of 
</p>
<p>States with respect to the rights of victims of trafficking include the duties to identify 
</p>
<p>victims of trafficking, to provide immediate protection and support and to provide legal 
</p>
<p>assistance, including temporary residency and non-criminalization of victims.14 
</p>
<p>31. Children can easily fall prey to unscrupulous traffickers. In 2013, the case of two 
</p>
<p>boys, then aged between 12 and 14, who were kidnapped from Guluj, a town in Gash-
</p>
<p>Barka, Eritrea, and taken to the Sinai, was brought to the attention of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. Her follow-up investigations did not reveal much, until earlier in 2015, when 
</p>
<p>she met with a witness who had also been kidnapped from Eritrea and taken to the Sinai; 
</p>
<p>the latter reported having been held captive with two boys from Guluj who had also been 
</p>
<p>&#8220;taken and sold for ransom money&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Forced evictions and the right to housing  
</b></p>
<p>32. Threats to the right to adequate housing posed by forced evictions have been 
</p>
<p>amplified in Eritrea since the beginning of 2015.
15
</p>
<p> Forced evictions represent an ongoing 
</p>
<p>practice: the authorities have bulldozed scores of houses, directly affecting hundreds of 
</p>
<p>households. In this section of the report, the Special Rapporteur examines the international, 
</p>
<p>regional and national frameworks on the right to housing, which derives from the right to 
</p>
<p>an adequate standard of living, and their application in the current context of housing 
</p>
<p>demolitions in Eritrea and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>beheading of Christians by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Libya. If that were to be 
</p>
<p>confirmed, the protection needs of unaccompanied minors taking such death-defying journeys to 
</p>
<p>reach the shores of Europe would become a priority. For additional information, see

<p> 15 In the present document, forced eviction is understood as involving &#8220;the involuntary removal of 
</p>
<p>persons from their homes and land, directly or indirectly attributable to the State&#8221;. (OHCHR, 
</p>
<p>Factsheet No. 25: Forced Evictions and Human Rights, p. 4). Forced evictions can, under certain 
</p>
<p>circumstances and subject to specific conditions, be consistent with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards. Such evictions can be classified as &#8220;legal evictions&#8221;. This distinction, however, must be 
</p>
<p>interpreted in a very narrow sense, on a case-by-case basis. In all circumstances, the practice of 
</p>
<p>eviction without consultation or adequate alternatives and compensation is illegal under international 
</p>
<p>law.  </p>


<p><b> A. Relevant international obligations and national legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International human rights law and forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living, which includes the right to housing. Eritrea subscribes to the Declaration 
</p>
<p>by virtue of its membership in the United Nations. The right to adequate housing is of 
</p>
<p>central importance for the enjoyment of all economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>34. The right to adequate housing is also established in the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. In its general comment No. 4 (1991), the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provided further interpretation of that right. 
</p>
<p>Eritrea is a State party to the Covenant, bound by its provisions and subject to the 
</p>
<p>persuasive interpretation thereof by the Committee. The Committee has noted that forced 
</p>
<p>evictions represent violations of the right to adequate housing and shelter, and may result in 
</p>
<p>violations of other related rights, such as the rights to life, to security of the person, to non-
</p>
<p>interference with privacy, family and home, and to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions;
16
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>are prima facie incompatible with the Covenant; and can be justified only in the most 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances, and in accordance with the relevant principles of international 
</p>
<p>law,
17
</p>
<p> which include the general principles of reasonableness and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>35. In its general comment No. 7, the Committee also observed that States parties had a 
</p>
<p>duty to refrain from carrying out forced evictions and to enforce the law against their agents 
</p>
<p>and third parties who carry out forced evictions, noting that the fulfilment of that obligation 
</p>
<p>was not qualified by considerations relating to a State&#8217;s available resources. The Committee 
</p>
<p>also reiterated the need for consultation with affected communities and the exploration of 
</p>
<p>all feasible alternatives prior to any evictions. Adequate compensation and effective 
</p>
<p>remedies needed to be provided for those whose rights were violated. Appropriate 
</p>
<p>procedural protection and due process should be respected and guaranteed in practice when 
</p>
<p>forced evictions are carried out. In any event, forced evictions should not result in 
</p>
<p>individuals being rendered homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights. 
</p>
<p>The Committee underscored that the State had the duty to take all appropriate measures to 
</p>
<p>provide adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to productive land, where 
</p>
<p>necessary. 
</p>
<p>36. The basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions and 
</p>
<p>displacement is a comprehensive document developed by the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
</p>
<p>right to non-discrimination in this context (E/CN.4/2006/41, appendix). It covers general 
</p>
<p>obligations, including with respect to duty bearers and the nature of the obligations, basic 
</p>
<p>human rights principles, the implementation of State obligations, and preventative 
</p>
<p>strategies, policies and programmes. It sets out standards and procedures to be followed 
</p>
<p>prior to, during and after evictions, as well as remedies for forced evictions, including 
</p>
<p>compensation, restitution and return, and resettlement and rehabilitation. The guidelines 
</p>
<p>extend to all persons affected by evictions whether or not they hold title to the land they 
</p>
<p>occupy, and stipulates that it is immaterial whether persons evicted hold title to the land &#8212; 
</p>
<p>they must be compensated for their lost property. 
</p>
<p>37. In its communication 155/96,18 the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Rights incorporated the substance and jurisprudence of international human rights law on 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 See general comment No. 7 (1997), para. 4. 
</p>
<p> 17 See general comment No. 4, para. 18. 
</p>
<p> 18 <i>Social and Economic Rights Action Centre (SERAC) and Center for Economic and Social Rights 
</i></p>
<p><i>(CESR) v. Nigeria</i>. </p>


<p>the prohibition of forced eviction into the implied right to adequate housing set out in the 
</p>
<p>African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. In exercise of its mandate under 
</p>
<p>article 45 (3) to interpret the provisions of the Charter, the Commission has read the right to 
</p>
<p>shelter and housing into the Charter. The Commission held, in paragraph 60 of the 
</p>
<p>communication, that: 
</p>
<p>Although the right to housing or shelter is not explicitly provided for under the 
</p>
<p>African Charter, the corollary of the combination of the provision protecting the 
</p>
<p>right to enjoy the best attainable state of mental and physical health, cited under 
</p>
<p>Article 16 above, the right to property, and the protection accorded to the family 
</p>
<p>forbids the wanton destruction of shelter because when housing is destroyed, 
</p>
<p>property, health and family life are adversely affected. It is thus noted that the 
</p>
<p>combined effect of Articles 14, 16 and 18 (1) reads into the [African] Charter a right 
</p>
<p>to shelter or housing which the Nigerian Government has apparently violated. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National legislation 
</b></p>
<p>38. In the Eritrean context, the right to adequate housing, as provided for in 
</p>
<p>article 11 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, is 
</p>
<p>better understood against the backdrop of the country&#8217;s post-independence land law: the 
</p>
<p>Land Proclamation19 and Legal Notice 31/1997. In accordance with the Proclamation, land 
</p>
<p>is the exclusive property of the State; the sale, transfer and mortgaging of land is prohibited. 
</p>
<p>While an individual citizen has only usufruct rights over land, these land reform legislations 
</p>
<p>allowed the Government to allocate land through leaseholds. Thus, every Eritrean citizen 
</p>
<p>was given the right to be allocated a plot of land for housing in urban areas and ancestral 
</p>
<p>villages, once the necessary criteria were met, including national service duties. 
</p>
<p>39. The Proclamation stipulates that the Government or appropriate body shall have the 
</p>
<p>right and power to expropriate land from usufructuaries for the purposes of various 
</p>
<p>development and capital investment projects aimed at national reconstruction or other 
</p>
<p>similar purposes. The expropriation is subject to the approval of the Office of the President 
</p>
<p>or a body delegated by the President and cannot be appealed in court. However, without a 
</p>
<p>clear definition of the purposes, recognition of applicable human rights standards, reference 
</p>
<p>to prior notification, legal recourse for disputing land expropriation, recognition of the need 
</p>
<p>to find alternatives, especially in situations where people are rendered homeless or 
</p>
<p>vulnerable, and a process of transparency and participation,20 among other things, the 
</p>
<p>practice of land expropriation has been rampant and arbitrary in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>40. An unforeseen side effect of the above legislation was that it created obstacles in the 
</p>
<p>housing industry, with far-reaching consequences for the enjoyment of the right to housing. 
</p>
<p>One of the challenges was that the land delivery system was unable to respond speedily to 
</p>
<p>the need for housing land and the demand for housing by far exceeded supply.21 Thus, there 
</p>
<p>was a strain on the system, which according to reports, were interpreted as the Government 
</p>
<p>reneging on its promise to allocate land to every citizen. In situations where distribution of 
</p>
<p>land did take place, many thought that it happened through an opaque process, replete with 
</p>

<p>corrupt practices. One interviewee had the following to say, which reflects the views of 
</p>
<p>many: 
</p>
<p>The policy for allocating land and construction of houses is problematic and 
</p>
<p>inconsistent for the lay person. Government gives you land and you need to get 
</p>
<p>permission to build. After waiting for [a] long [time], some people try to build 
</p>
<p>without the permission of Government and at some point the Government will come 
</p>
<p>and tell them to discontinue construction or destroy the houses. On the other hand, 
</p>
<p>some officials are building houses without any Government intervention. It is not 
</p>
<p>clear what the process is for getting permission to build and when you ask, they 
</p>
<p>always blame it on the higher officials. It is only when you finish building that they 
</p>
<p>intervene.22 
</p>
<p>41. Other factors compounded the problem, including poor governance, mismanagement 
</p>
<p>and lack of clarity within institutional structures. In the mid-2000s, there was a major purge 
</p>
<p>in the construction industry, with architects, building contractors and other skilled workers 
</p>
<p>arrested and tried for corruption. This preceded a takeover of the construction industry by 
</p>
<p>construction companies owned by the People&#8217;s Front for Democracy and Justice, the ruling 
</p>
<p>party in Eritrea. Those companies remain the sole providers of cheap labour, sourced from 
</p>
<p>the national service, and the most important marketers of building materials, sold at 
</p>
<p>prohibitive prices. 
</p>
<p>42. Added to this, the significant backlog of applications for land to build houses is 
</p>
<p>creating a deep crisis, particularly in the capital and other major towns. While Eritrean 
</p>
<p>citizens who have complied with their national service obligations could be allocated a plot 
</p>
<p>of land, the land law imposed on them a requirement to develop the land and erect a 
</p>
<p>building within a strict time frame, after obtaining a building permit, at the risk of 
</p>
<p>repossession if the requirements were not strictly complied with. And yet, since the mid-
</p>
<p>2000s, the authorities have delivered very few building permits, putting many of those who 
</p>
<p>obtained a plot of land to build a home in a situation where it was impossible to comply 
</p>
<p>with the law. People found themselves in a paradoxical situation where they had a plot of 
</p>
<p>land, no building permit, with repossession hanging like a sword of Damocles over their 
</p>
<p>heads.  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, many private individuals who were given access to land on the basis of 
</p>
<p>usufruct rights did not have the requisite resources to construct residential houses within the 
</p>
<p>required time frame. One issue identified as problematic was that existing land-use 
</p>
<p>standards were high; it has been suggested that those standards could be lowered to increase 
</p>
<p>the number of plots delivered, thus bringing down the costs of development, which are 
</p>
<p>linked to plot size, and consequently making a house more affordable to low-income 
</p>
<p>households.23  
</p>
<p>44. While a limited number of households were able to get bank loans, a significant 
</p>
<p>percentage of individuals financed their homes themselves, built incrementally or built with 
</p>
<p>remittances from Eritreans living abroad.24 To alleviate their housing problem, many 
</p>
<p>individuals resorted to the practice of &#8220;selling&#8221; some part of the land allocated to them. The 
</p>
<p>main motive was that, using the proceeds of such a &#8220;sale&#8221;, they could build a house for 
</p>
<p>themselves in the remaining &#8220;unsold&#8221; part of the land originally allocated to them. Many 
</p>
<p>argue that building a house would not otherwise have been possible, given the economic

<p>context created by a depressed economy with limited avenues for income generation and 
</p>
<p>the prohibitively high cost of building materials. The practice became widespread, since, 
</p>
<p>for many, other means of financing the construction of a house were limited, given that they 
</p>
<p>could not offer the land as collateral to obtain a loan. One of the problems generated by this 
</p>
<p>practice, was that, while it was frowned upon, individuals could &#8220;sell&#8221; to people who had 
</p>
<p>not completed their national service duties or paid their 2 per cent diaspora tax.  
</p>
<p>45. Many private houses built in Eritrea in the past 20 years were financed as described 
</p>
<p>above. The Government, considering the practice to be &#8220;illegal sale of land&#8221;, threatened for 
</p>
<p>several years to demolish houses built in such a manner. While none of those houses were 
</p>
<p>built without the knowledge of the authorities, bulldozers were sent to raze the dwellings. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to housing and the impact of forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>46. The lack of availability of adequate and affordable social housing continues to be 
</p>
<p>problematic in Eritrea, a country facing a grave housing and urban development challenge. 
</p>
<p>The successive movements of refugees and internally displaced persons over the years have 
</p>
<p>caused severe housing shortages. Following the achievement of de facto independence, 
</p>
<p>after 30 years of liberation struggle, Eritreans returning from refugee camps and other 
</p>
<p>locations faced a severe scarcity of houses, particularly in urban areas. During the Eritrea-
</p>
<p>Ethiopia border conflict, from July 1998, the Ethiopian authorities summarily arrested, and 
</p>
<p>left at the border, an estimated 70,000 ethnic Eritreans almost overnight, forcibly returning 
</p>
<p>them to Eritrea. Eritrea drove out an almost equal number of Ethiopians who had been 
</p>
<p>residing on its territory. An estimated 100,000 homes were destroyed and 450,000 Eritreans 
</p>
<p>displaced. These movements and influxes of people and destruction of houses compounded 
</p>
<p>the problem, thus affecting negatively the exercise of the right to adequate housing in 
</p>
<p>Eritrea. 
</p>
<p>47. The housing problem persisted, as the recent demolition of houses and forced 
</p>
<p>evictions confirmed. In 2005 it was estimated that by 2015 about 5,000 new dwelling units 
</p>
<p>would be required annually in Asmara alone, in sharp contrast to the estimated 1,500 
</p>
<p>houses that were being built annually at the time of the estimate.25 The shortage is 
</p>
<p>concentrated in the low-income housing market, affecting the majority of the population, 
</p>
<p>especially those in the national service. The high cost of construction is a major impediment 
</p>
<p>generally, but more particularly in the social housing market. 
</p>
<p>48. By resorting to evictions and demolitions, the Eritrean authorities demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>they were reluctant to create the necessary conditions to expand access to adequate social 
</p>
<p>housing, while prioritizing the construction of higher end residential complexes.26 
</p>
<p>Additionally, many reports allege that the demolitions were in part a form of retribution for 
</p>
<p>several popular actions, including against groups that recently resisted the call for military 
</p>
<p>training within the national service and the people&#8217;s militia.27 
</p>
<p>49. The official reasons provided for the demolitions were that the houses had been built 
</p>
<p>in contravention of the rights attached to plots allocated for the purpose of building a 
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>square metres. The prices range from US$ 22,744 for a 20 m2 apartment to US$ 142,742 for a 200 m2 
</p>

</p>
<p>permit, or that the land had been reassigned, which had rendered the individual&#8217;s use 
</p>
<p>illegal. 
</p>
<p>50. In many instances, the homes had been built over many years and had cost the entire 
</p>
<p>life savings of those who had invested in them on the assumption that matters would be 
</p>
<p>formalized at a later point, for example, after the payment of fines imposed by the relevant 
</p>
<p>authorities, given that authorities had delivered only a few building permits since 2006. 
</p>
<p>Even in situations where renovations were undertaken due to wear and tear, residents faced 
</p>
<p>problems, as pointed out by one interlocutor:28 
</p>
<p>If part of an old building needs to be renovated or to be fixed, they consider that you 
</p>
<p>are building afresh and punish you as if you are building a new house. If they think 
</p>
<p>you have built without permission, you don&#8217;t get any warning, your house gets 
</p>
<p>marked with a sign and they send military personnel to destroy your house without 
</p>
<p>any warning. They also can also ask you to demolish your own house and if you 
</p>
<p>don&#8217;t they do it themselves and ask you to pay for the cost of demolition.

<p>51. The Special Rapporteur has received information concerning recent demolitions of 
</p>
<p>approximately 800 houses in Asmara, in several other villages in the vicinity of Asmara and 
</p>
<p>in other towns, such as Adi Keyh, in the southern part of the country. About 3,000 people 
</p>
<p>were made homeless owing to the forced evictions and demolitions.29 With relatives and 
</p>
<p>friends giving refuge to those evicted, an already serious problem of overcrowded housing 
</p>
<p>with limited access to affordable water and safe sanitation has been exacerbated. Many of 
</p>
<p>those evicted have gone back to their villages or to the outskirts of their towns, in the hope 
</p>
<p>of being able to afford shelter.  
</p>
<p>52. Residents protested that the evictions had been carried out without appropriate and 
</p>
<p>adequate notice. After threatening to demolish the dwellings, the authorities simply moved 
</p>
<p>in and residents were left in a state of fear as officials marked their houses with crosses 
</p>
<p>before pulling the structures down. Military personnel carried out the evictions with heavy 
</p>
<p>equipment (bulldozers and other construction equipment), engaging in egregious brutality 
</p>
<p>and violence against anyone who stood in the way of the demolition, thus forcing many of 
</p>
<p>those affected to become bystanders as their homes were demolished.  
</p>
<p>53. In the case of Adi Keyh, town residents opposed the demolition and eviction plan 
</p>
<p>fiercely, leading to physical confrontations between high-school children and the military. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur received reports that at least two people who stood in the way of 
</p>
<p>the military to save their homes were allegedly killed on 5 March 2015.30 A dozen high 
</p>
<p>school students were taken into custody when they tried to stop the demolitions and 
</p>
<p>because of their participation in the protests. In other cases, residents were forced to 
</p>
<p>scramble to protect their few possessions as the bulldozers relentlessly crushed everything 
</p>
<p>in their path. There is little evidence that the State authorities took any proactive measures 
</p>
<p>to inform those facing eviction of the demolitions. The impact has been greater on more 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups of society, including women, children and the elderly.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 Ibid.  
</p>
<p> 29 The figures represent conservative estimates collated from different sources provided by human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, as the authorities have not made any official statistics available regarding the number of 
</p>
<p>houses torn down, the number of people displaced, the number of people injured and the number of 
</p>
<p>those who lost their lives during the evictions.  
</p>
<p> 30 There are conflicting reports regarding the number of people who were killed or injured in the process 
</p>
<p>of demolition by the military. The authorities have not published any official statistics.  </p>


<p>54. The houses demolished in Adi Keyh were considered easy targets, because at the 
</p>
<p>time the evictions took place, a larger proportion of women were at home and in charge of 
</p>
<p>the property and well-being of their families, as most of the men were away on national 
</p>
<p>service duties or in exile. In one instance, a victim who was diabetic collapsed and was 
</p>
<p>almost incapacitated after watching her house be demolished. The military was brutal while 
</p>
<p>carrying out the demolitions, magnifying the terrible shock suffered by the women. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the women&#8217;s precarious situation was exacerbated through depressing news 
</p>
<p>about their family members and loved ones undertaking death-defying journeys across the 
</p>
<p>desert and the sea.31 
</p>
<p>55. Those who were evicted had to move far away from their sources of livelihood. For 
</p>
<p>many, the idea of having to rebuild their homes is distressing, because of the precarious 
</p>
<p>security of tenure. The destruction of housing and shelter through forced evictions has a 
</p>
<p>chain effect on other rights, which end up being violated in the process and aftermath of 
</p>
<p>forced evictions, including the rights to life, to security of the person, to privacy and to 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and association, among others.  
</p>
<p>56. The harrowing reports of victims of the forced evictions reveal distressing tales of 
</p>
<p>serious violations of the fundamental human rights. Many of those evicted have been left 
</p>
<p>homeless and destitute and have been pushed further into poverty, with little or no recourse 
</p>
<p>to any remedy. The evictions were carried out without court orders, due process, legal 
</p>
<p>protection or redress and people were hesitant to contemplate legal action, because of their 
</p>
<p>lack of confidence in the justice system. In addition, children&#8217;s education has been 
</p>
<p>disrupted.  
</p>
<p>57. In summary, the testimonies collected by the Special Rapporteur point to a situation 
</p>
<p>in which: there was little or no dialogue with those affected by the forced evictions; the 
</p>
<p>authorities demonstrated a lack of respect for the fundamental rights of those who were 
</p>
<p>evicted, which in the town of Adi Keyh caused loss of life; there was a lack of any attempt 
</p>
<p>to develop solutions that minimized the scale of evictions and the disruption caused to those 
</p>
<p>who were forced from their homes; excessive military force was used during the evictions 
</p>
<p>and to repress protests, flouting the principle of proportionality in relation to such actions; 
</p>
<p>and the authorities ignored the gendered aspect of the evictions, with women disparately 
</p>
<p>affected. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Forced evictions and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>58. The forced evictions described above are in contradiction with and an obstacle to the 
</p>
<p>realization of the Millennium Development Goals, especially since an assessment of those 
</p>
<p>goals and targets is under way.32 First, forced evictions render the most insecure 
</p>
<p>households, particularly slum dwellers, even more impoverished, contrary to target 7 (d), 
</p>
<p>which is to achieve, by 2020, a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million 
</p>
<p>slum dwellers. Consequently, forced evictions significantly hamper the realization of 
</p>
<p>Goal 1, which focuses broadly on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, including target 
</p>
<p>1 (a), namely, to halve the proportion of people living on less than one dollar a day. Forced 
</p>
<p>evictions also curtail access to employment, which impedes the achievement of target 1 (b), 
</p>
<p>aimed at achieving full and productive employment and work for all, including women and 
</p>
<p>young people. Children&#8217;s education is also affected as a result of forced evictions, 
</p>
<p>hampering the achievement of Goal 2 on achieving universal primary education.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 Interviews conducted by the Special Rapporteur during the period 9 March to 25 May 2015.  
</p>
<p> 32 See UN-HABITAT, <i>Forced Evictions, Global Crisis, Global Solutions</i>, pp. 26&#8211;27.  </p>


<p>59. Another serious effect of forced evictions is that they often increase or exacerbate 
</p>
<p>gender inequality, whereas Millennium Development Goal 3 is aimed at promoting gender 
</p>
<p>equality and empowering women. Forced evictions also lead to poor health, as they 
</p>
<p>negatively affect the underlying determinants of health, which include adequate housing; 
</p>
<p>this hampers the achievement of Goals 5 and 6, namely, to improve maternal health and to 
</p>
<p>combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. Eritrea is generally noted as being on target 
</p>
<p>to achieving Goal 4, on reducing child mortality, and Goals 5 and 6.33 
</p>
<p>60. Significantly, for target 7 (d), in respect of improving the lives of slum dwellers, the 
</p>
<p>indicator was the proportion of households worldwide with access to secure tenure.34 
</p>
<p>Simply put, security of tenure acts as a legal protection against forced evictions for tenants 
</p>
<p>or leaseholders. The importance of secure tenure in the realization of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals was also highlighted by the Millennium Project Task Force on 
</p>
<p>Improving the Lives of Slum Dwellers when it declared that &#8220;meeting this challenge 
</p>
<p>requires a plan for security of tenure, affordable access to land, basic services, and housing 
</p>
<p>finance&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Achievements since the establishment of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>61. The present report is the third submitted by the Special Rapporteur while delivering 
</p>
<p>on her mandate. It is therefore timely to look back in order to move forward, especially at 
</p>
<p>this current juncture, given the recent submission to the Human Rights Council of the report 
</p>
<p>of the commission of inquiry on Eritrea.  
</p>
<p>62. In her first report, the Special Rapporteur indicated that her approach to the mandate 
</p>
<p>would be prudently optimistic, firm and bold, and that it would be incremental: she would 
</p>
<p>first lay the foundation and then the building blocks for the full respect of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law by the Government of Eritrea and the enjoyment of all human rights by 
</p>
<p>all Eritreans.  
</p>
<p>63. Over the past three years the Special Rapporteur has devoted considerable time and 
</p>
<p>effort to open up channels of communication with the Government of Eritrea. There has 
</p>
<p>been no progress regarding her access to the country to conduct human rights-related 
</p>
<p>investigations. Additionally, very little progress was recorded regarding dialogue on 
</p>
<p>substantive human rights issues. Notwithstanding her inability to visit Eritrea, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur has had sporadic opportunities for contact with the Eritrean representatives, and 
</p>
<p>has continued to seek collaboration with the authorities to identify issues relating to human 
</p>
<p>rights violations and mutually work on long-lasting remedial solutions. 
</p>
<p>64. To deliver on the mandate entrusted to her, the Special Rapporteur has concentrated 
</p>
<p>on three priority areas and related action points that can serve as benchmarks to evaluate 
</p>
<p>progress in the medium term. 
</p>
<p>65. The first priority area is focused on respecting, protecting and fulfilling 
</p>
<p>internationally recognized human rights standards. The first action point identified was to 
</p>
<p>have the &#8220;shoot to kill&#8221; policy at the borders revoked. Eritrea has consistently denied the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>(September 2014). Available from www.er.undp.org.

</p>
<p>complete.pdf. </p>


<p>existence of such a policy;36 however, the Special Rapporteur has interviewed former 
</p>
<p>military personnel posted at the border who confirmed its existence.37 While the policy 
</p>
<p>might have been relaxed over the past two years, the Special Rapporteur learned that 13 
children (7 boys and 6 girls) were reportedly shot while trying to cross the border into a 
</p>
<p>neighbouring country on board a pick-up truck in September 2014.  
</p>
<p>66. One action point under the first priority area concentrates on the release of all 
</p>
<p>prisoners detained without charge or trial, including those detained because of their political 
</p>
<p>or religious beliefs. The Special Rapporteur was indeed encouraged when Eritrean 
</p>
<p>authorities released eight detainees in April 201438 and six journalists in January 2015. 
</p>
<p>However, in the meantime, she received several communications, documented cases and 
</p>
<p>conducted interviews relating to the arbitrary arrest and detention of scores of soldiers and 
</p>
<p>members of their immediate family, as well as more distant relatives, in the aftermath of the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forto incident&#8221; of 21 January 2013.39 All of this begs the question: for those few who have 
</p>
<p>been released, how many more have been put or remain in jail incommunicado?40 Further 
</p>
<p>action points under this priority area were to strengthen democratic governance institutions, 
</p>
<p>guarantee the independence and impartiality of the justice system to combat impunity, and 
</p>
<p>take legislative, administrative, institutional and practical measures to give effect to the rule 
</p>
<p>of law. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the entry into force of the different codes, as 
</p>
<p>mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>67. Further action points relate to putting a stop to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment and ratifying the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Special Rapporteur congratulated the 
</p>
<p>Government of Eritrea for its accession to the Convention in September 2014. While 
</p>
<p>considering this accession as an indication of the willingness of Eritrea to comply with the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture under international law, the Special Rapporteur was looking forward 
</p>
<p>to seeing the State implement the Convention by taking the required effective legislative, 
</p>
<p>administrative, judicial and other measures to prevent acts of torture in the country. She 
</p>
<p>would like clarification from the authorities as to whether the Criminal Code that has just 
</p>
<p>come into force provides for the criminalization of torture in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>stipulations of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>68. Regretfully, Eritrea has not accepted the inquiry procedure under article 20 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture, which provides for an investigation when the Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture obtains reliable information containing well-founded indications that torture 
</p>
<p>is being systematically practised in the territory of a State party. Article 20 (3) stipulates 
</p>
<p>that such an inquiry may include a visit to the State party&#8217;s territory. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would like to urge Eritrea to accept the inquiry procedure and to remove the 
</p>
<p>reservation it entered on accession to that effect. Additionally, she encourages Eritrea to 
</p>
<p>accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which, in article 1, 
</p>
<p>provides for a system of regular visits undertaken by independent international and national 
</p>
<p>bodies to places where people are deprived of their liberty, in order to prevent torture and 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Special Rapporteur hopes

</p>
<p> 39 Arbitrary arrests and incommunicado detentions were carried out in the aftermath of the attempted 
</p>
<p>coup d&#8217;&#233;tat on 21 January 2013, known as the &#8220;Forto incident&#8221;. Over 50 people, including public 
</p>
<p>figures, were arrested and detained, with no information as to their whereabouts, nor have they 
</p>
<p>appeared before any court of law.  
</p>
<p> 40 The situation of Mr. Ali Omaro is a case in point (see A/HRC/28/85, p. 14).  </p>


<p>that Eritrea will announce that it has attended to these two outstanding steps to reinforce its 
</p>
<p>commitment to eradicate torture when submitting its initial report to the Committee against 
</p>
<p>Torture, due on 25 October 2015. Eritrea should also accede to the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance, as well as all 
</p>
<p>other remaining human rights treaties.41 
</p>
<p>69. Another action point falling under the first priority area concerns putting an 
</p>
<p>immediate end to the indefinite national service. The Special Rapporteur dealt with this 
</p>
<p>matter in her previous report (A/HRC/26/45), informing the Human Rights Council that the 
</p>
<p>unlimited national service in effect amounted to forced labour. While she has taken note of 
</p>
<p>informal announcements that the twenty-eighth round of national service would last for 18 
</p>
<p>months, she obtained information that this notice has reportedly not been communicated to 
</p>
<p>the recruits or to their parents. It would appear that the conscripts, their families and the 
</p>
<p>world at large will have to wait 18 months before getting any confirmation as to whether 
</p>
<p>the Government will comply with the 18-month duration of the national service. 
</p>
<p>70. In the light of the present report and the report of the commission of inquiry 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/29/42), the Special Rapporteur would suggest the following follow-up action 
</p>
<p>points: 
</p>
<p>(a) Determine new priority areas and action points, and review outstanding ones 
</p>
<p>to ensure that they respond to the situation on the ground, incorporating elements such as 
</p>
<p>the exodus of people, including unaccompanied children; 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensure that the mandate is maintained and remains a safe space where 
</p>
<p>information on human rights situation in Eritrea can be channelled; 
</p>
<p>(c) Follow up on any recommendations deemed appropriate by the commission 
</p>
<p>of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the signs, although still few, that 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrea is increasing its engagement with the international community, and welcomed 
</b></p>
<p><b>such an outward-looking step as an unequivocal measure by the State to abide fully by 
</b></p>
<p><b>its human rights obligations.</b>  
</p>
<p>72. <b>However, she would like to remind Eritrea and the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>that trading human rights for short-term political or economic gains would 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermine the long-term enjoyment of all human rights by all in Eritrea. Overtures to 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 41 As at 26 May 2015, pending ratifications include the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, the Optional Protocol to the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
</p>
<p>Their Families, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol.  </p>


<p><b>engage with Eritrea should give due weight and emphasis to human rights, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>continued efforts are required to address the root causes of human rights violations in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country.</b>  
</p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to urge the Government of Eritrea to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthen efforts to increase the participation of all citizens in public life, in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustain fruitful and durable change in the human rights landscape. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>would gain if it accorded priority to making participation open to all and 
</b></p>
<p><b>guaranteeing that the human rights of all stakeholders, including women, children 
</b></p>
<p><b>and other vulnerable groups, such as minorities, will not be violated in processes of 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation. Public participation should be ensured at all levels; in particular, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement of those potentially affected by or interested in a decision should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>sought and facilitated in such a way that their participation is valued and can have an 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact. Those affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making process, and not only at the implementation phase; additionally, participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be voluntary, with no element of coercion. When people participate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>express their views, their right to freedom of expression should be respected, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>fear of reprisals.  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>With regard to the forced evictions, deprivation of shelter can have drastic 
</b></p>
<p><b>impacts on individuals, families and communities, leading to the denial of multiple 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights in addition to the right to housing, and to obstacles in the achievement of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Millennium Development Goals. While asserting that evictions should be the 
</b></p>
<p><b>exception rather than the rule, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Eritrea to abide by its human rights obligations by prioritizing the requirement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>engage in consultation with those facing eviction with a view to exploring alternatives, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should evictions be inevitable. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The bulk of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in her two 
</b></p>
<p><b>previous reports remain valid,
42
</b></p>
<p><b> as Eritrea has implemented only two of them, namely 
</b></p>
<p><b>those urging Eritrea to ratify the Convention against Torture and to seek technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights. She therefore reiterates the recommendations in her two previous reports. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>addition, she would like to make the recommendations below.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to adequate housing and protection from forced evictions 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Government of Eritrea should:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Put an immediate stop to the practice of forced evictions and demolition 
</b></p>
<p><b>of houses by agreeing to a moratorium, to be maintained until the Government sets up 
</b></p>
<p><b>an independent mechanism to assess the reasonableness and legality of any eviction, 
</b></p>
<p><b>bearing in mind international human rights law and practice in this field;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that existing legislation and policies are aligned adequately with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law to prohibit forced evictions, and adopt legal provisions against 
</b></p>
<p><b>forced evictions in conformity with international law and the relevant general 
</b></p>
<p><b>comments of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 See A/HRC/23/53, paras. 107&#8211;108 and A/HRC/26/45, paras. 103&#8211;105.  </p>


<p><b>(c) Fulfil human rights treaty obligations that provide security of tenure to 
</b></p>
<p><b>occupants of homes and land and that strictly limit the circumstances under which 
</b></p>
<p><b>evictions may be effected; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Prioritize the provision of social housing by expanding the low-cost 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing supply to match the huge unmet demand for such housing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that public order officials, including the military and the police, 
</b></p>
<p><b>receive appropriate professional training for carrying out their public security duties, 
</b></p>
<p><b>especially in relation to the use of force and firearms. Review rules of engagement to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure their compliance with international law enforcement standards, such as the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Force and Firearms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Investigate and prosecute public order officials, including the military 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the police, responsible for killings, violence, unlawful arrests and arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>destruction of personal property during evictions. This includes investigating the loss 
</b></p>
<p><b>of life during the Adi Keyh evictions and bringing perpetrators to justice;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that future evictions, when necessary and justified, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasonable and proportional and proceed only following authorization after an open, 
</b></p>
<p><b>fair and transparent public participatory process with reasonable notice for all 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected persons. Such a process should: include the determination of an objective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>justified need for the eviction; ensure genuine consultation with the affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities and individuals; limit the disruption in the daily lives of affected persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>(for example, avoiding evictions during the school year, which would interrupt a 
</b></p>
<p>child&#8217;s<b> exercise of his or her right to education); provide affected parties with a say in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the process, which should include an assessment of alternative measures to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>eviction; provide legal remedies; and give special consideration to persons in 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations of vulnerability, such as women, children, the elderly, persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities and children in child-headed households; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Uphold the rights to the freedoms of expression, assembly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>association of all those affected by any proposed eviction. All affected persons and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their supporters should be able to exercise their right to speak out publicly on 
</b></p>
<p><b>evictions, the legal framework and any other matter of concern to them; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)</b> <b>Bear in mind the disparate impact that forced evictions have on women 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, given the experiences of violence during such actions, show sensitivity to the 
</b></p>
