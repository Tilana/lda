OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2016
1. General
In these unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements, "Occidental" means Occidental
Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which
it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Occidental has made its disclosures in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as they apply to interim
reporting, and condensed or omitted, as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and regulations, certain information and disclosures normally included in consolidated
financial statements and the notes. These unaudited consolidated condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto in Occidental’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.
In the opinion of Occidental’s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary to fairly present Occidental’s consolidated financial position as of
June 30, 2016, and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash
flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable. The income
and cash flows for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of
the income or cash flows to be expected for the full year.
2. Asset Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other
In the second quarter of 2016, Occidental received $330 million as final payment from the
settlement with the Republic of Ecuador. In January 2016, Occidental reached an understanding
on the terms of payment for the approximate $1.0 billion payable to Occidental by the Republic of
Ecuador under a November 2015 International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
arbitration award. This award relates to Ecuador's 2006 expropriation of Occidental's
Participation Contract for Block 15. Occidental recorded a pre-tax gain of $681 million in the first
quarter of 2016. The results related to Ecuador were presented as discontinued operations.
In May and June 2016, respectively, Occidental utilized part of the proceeds from the April 2016
senior note offering (described below) to exercise the early redemption option on $1.25 billion of
1.75-percent senior notes due in the first quarter of 2017 and to retire all $750 million of 4.125-
percent senior notes that matured in June 2016.
In April 2016, Occidental issued $2.75 billion of senior notes, comprised of $0.4 billion of 2.6-
percent senior notes due 2022, $1.15 billion of 3.4-percent senior notes due 2026 and $1.2
billion of 4.4-percent senior notes due 2046. Occidental received net proceeds of approximately
$2.72 billion. Interest on the senior notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears in April and
October of each year for each series of senior notes, beginning on October 15, 2016. Occidental
used a portion of the proceeds to retire debt in May and June 2016, and will use the remaining
proceeds for general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, Occidental distributed its remaining shares of California Resources Corporation
(California Resources) through a special stock dividend to stockholders of record as of February
29, 2016. Upon distribution, Occidental recorded a $78 million loss to reduce the investment to its
fair market value, and Occidental no longer owns any shares of California Resources common
stock.
In March 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Piceance Basin operations in Colorado for
$153 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of $121 million. The assets and liabilities related to these
operations were presented as held for sale at December 31, 2015, and primarily included
property, plant and equipment and current accrued liabilities and asset retirement obligations.
In February 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million of 2.5-percent senior notes that matured.
In January 2016, Occidental completed the sale of its Occidental Tower building in Dallas,
Texas, for net proceeds of approximately $85 million. The building was classified as held for sale
as of December 31, 2015.
7
3. Accounting and Disclosure Changes
In March, April, and May of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended
revenue recognition rules clarifying several aspects of the new revenue recognition standard,
previously issued in May 2014. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued rules affecting entities that issue share-based payment awards
to their employees. These rules are designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-
based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting and cash flow classification for
excess tax benefits and deficiencies, (2) forfeitures, and (3) tax withholding requirements and
cash flow classification. The rules were adopted for the second quarter of 2016 and did not have
a material impact on Occidental's financial statements upon adoption.
In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to eliminate the requirement to retrospectively adopt
the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result
of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The update requires that the
equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest and adopt the equity
method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method
accounting. The rules become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016. The rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial
statements upon adoption.
In March 2016, the FASB issued rules clarifying that a change in one of the parties to a derivative
contract that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require dedesignation
of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The rules
become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued rules in which lessees will recognize most leases, including
operating leases, on-balance sheet. These new rules will significantly increase reported assets
and liabilities. The rules become effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2018. Occidental is currently evaluating the impact of these rules on its financial
statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued rules simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. The
new rules require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in
the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent
with debt discounts. Occidental adopted these rules retrospectively as of January 1, 2016. The
rules do not have a material impact on Occidental's financial statements.
4. Supplemental Cash Flow Information
Occidental paid foreign, state and federal income taxes of $288 million and $638 million during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016,
Occidental received federal income tax refunds of $302 million as a result of the carryback of net
operating losses generated in 2015. Interest paid totaled $154 million and $108 million in each of
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
8
5. Inventories
A portion of inventories is valued under the LIFO method.  The valuation of LIFO inventory for
interim periods is based on Occidental’s estimates of year-end inventory levels and
costs. Inventories as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, consisted of the following (in
millions):

Total

6. Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures
Occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.
The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state,
local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality of the original
activities or the current ownership or control of sites.  OPC or certain of its subsidiaries participate
in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or private proceedings under
these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed and third-party
sites.  Remedial activities may include one or more of the following: investigation involving
sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including removal,
treatment or disposal of hazardous substances; or operation and maintenance of remedial
systems.  These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in
some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties,
injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
As of June 30, 2016, Occidental participated in or monitored remedial activities or proceedings at
145 sites.  The following table presents Occidental’s environmental remediation reserves as of
June 30, 2016, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($70 million) and the
remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities — other ($309 million).  The reserves are
grouped as environmental remediation sites listed or proposed for listing by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL sites) and three
categories of non-NPL sites — third-party sites, Occidental-operated sites and closed or non-
operated Occidental sites.

As of June 30, 2016, Occidental’s environmental reserves exceeded $10 million each at 11 of the
145 sites described above, and 94 of the sites each had reserves of $1 million or less.  Based on
current estimates, Occidental expects to expend funds corresponding to approximately half of the
current environmental reserves at the sites described above over the next three to four years and
the balance at these sites over the subsequent 10 or more years.
Due to the uncertainties surrounding the Maxus-indemnified sites described further under Note 7,
Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies, Occidental is currently unable to estimate
an amount of reasonably possible losses
9
associated with these sites. For all other sites, Occidental believes its estimable range of
reasonably possible additional losses beyond those liabilities recorded for environmental
remediation at these sites could be up to $370 million.  For additional information regarding
environmental matters, refer to Note 7.
7. Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies
OPC or certain of its subsidiaries are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits,
claims and other legal proceedings that seek, among other things, compensation for alleged
personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses, punitive damages, civil
penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC or certain of its subsidiaries also are involved in
proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws.
These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some
cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties and
injunctive relief. Usually OPC or such subsidiaries are among many companies in these
environmental proceedings and have to date been successful in sharing response costs with
other financially sound companies. Further, some lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings involve
acquired or disposed assets with respect to which a third party or Occidental retains liability or
indemnifies the other party for conditions that existed prior to the transaction.
During 2014, a New Jersey state court approved Occidental's settlement with the State of New
Jersey (the State) to resolve claims asserted by the State against Occidental arising from
Occidental’s acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Chemicals Company (DSCC) in 1986. Pursuant
to the settlement agreement (the State Settlement), Occidental paid the State $190 million in
2015. As part of the State Settlement, Occidental agreed, under certain circumstances, to perform
or fund future work on behalf of the State along a portion of the Passaic River. The State
Settlement does not cover any potential Occidental share of costs associated with the EPA’s
proposed clean-up plan of the Passaic River as set out in its March 4, 2016 Record of Decision
(ROD). During the second quarter of 2016, the EPA sent Occidental a draft Administrative Order
on Consent to complete the design of the proposed clean-up plan outlined in the ROD.
Negotiations with the EPA are ongoing.
When Occidental acquired DSCC, Maxus Energy Corporation (Maxus), currently a subsidiary of
YPF S.A. (YPF), agreed to a broad indemnity for a number of environmental sites, including the
Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, which is at issue in the State Settlement and the ROD. As a
result, Occidental has been pursuing Maxus and its parent company, YPF, as the alter ego of
Maxus, to recover the costs paid by Occidental under the State Settlement and other indemnified
costs. Trial on Occidental’s claims against Maxus and YPF was scheduled to begin on June 21,
2016. On June 17, 2016, Maxus and several affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
in Federal District Court in the State of Delaware. Occidental is continuing to pursue claims
against Maxus and YPF in the bankruptcy court and other appropriate forums. Prior to filing for
bankruptcy, Maxus defended and indemnified Occidental in connection with federal clean-up and
other costs associated with the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site and other sites.
Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters that satisfy this criteria.
Reserve balances for other non-environmental matters that satisfy this criteria as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to Occidental's consolidated balance sheets.
Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible losses that it could incur as a result
of outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings and has disclosed its estimable range of
reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental
remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses for non-environmental
matters that it could incur in excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be
material to its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Occidental's potential
obligations for the Maxus-indemnified sites described above, including any potential share of
costs associated with the ROD for the Passaic River, are not currently included in such
estimates, as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time for several reasons,
including, but not limited to, the existence of other potentially responsible parties, the presence of
contaminants of concern that are not associated with DSCC or Occidental's operations, the
inherent uncertainties in estimating clean-up costs and the Maxus bankruptcy filing.
During the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying
periods in various federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. Although taxable years
through 2009 for United States federal income tax purposes have been audited by the United
States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) pursuant to its Compliance Assurance Program,
subsequent taxable years are currently under review. Additionally, in December 2012,
Occidental
10
filed United States federal refund claims for tax years 2008 and 2009 that are subject to IRS
review. Taxable years from 2002 through the current year remain subject to examination by
foreign and state government tax authorities in certain jurisdictions. In certain of these
jurisdictions, tax authorities are in various stages of auditing Occidental’s income taxes. During
the course of tax audits, disputes have arisen and other disputes may arise as to facts and
matters of law. Occidental believes that the resolution of outstanding tax matters would not have
a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
OPC, its subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specified liabilities those
parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they
have entered into with Occidental.  These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party
incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds.  As of June 30, 2016, Occidental is not aware
of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to indemnity claims that
would result in payments materially in excess of reserves.

Occidental contributed approximately $1 million and zero in the three months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and approximately $2 million and $5 million in the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to its defined benefit plans.
9. Fair Value Measurements
Occidental has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a three-
level fair value hierarchy, based on the inputs to the valuation techniques: Level 1 — using
quoted prices in active markets for the assets or liabilities; Level 2 — using observable inputs
other than quoted prices for the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 — using unobservable
inputs.  Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the end of each reporting period.
Fair Values — Recurring
11
Occidental primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements,
maximizes its use of observable inputs and minimizes its use of unobservable inputs. Occidental
utilizes the mid-point between bid and ask prices for valuing the majority of its assets and
liabilities measured and reported at fair value. In addition to using market data, Occidental makes
assumptions in valuing its assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risks inherent in
the inputs to the valuation technique.  For assets and liabilities carried at fair value, Occidental
measures fair value using the following methods:
Ø
Ø
Ø
Occidental values exchange-cleared commodity derivatives using closing prices provided by
the exchange as of the balance sheet date. Occidental values its available for sale investment
based on the common stock closing share price as of the balance sheet date. These
derivatives and investments are classified as Level 1.
Over-the-Counter (OTC) bilateral financial commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts,
options and physical commodity forward purchase and sale contracts are generally classified
as Level 2 and are generally valued using quotations provided by brokers or industry-standard
models that consider various inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time
value, volatility factors, credit risk and current market and contractual prices for the underlying
instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are
observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, and can be derived
from observable data or are supported by observable prices at which transactions are executed
in the marketplace.
Occidental values commodity derivatives based on a market approach that considers various
assumptions, including quoted forward commodity prices and market yield curves. The
assumptions used include inputs that are generally unobservable in the marketplace or are
observable but have been adjusted based upon various assumptions, and the fair value is
designated as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy.
Occidental generally uses an income approach to measure fair value when observable inputs
are unavailable. This approach utilizes management’s judgments regarding expectations of
projected cash flows, and discounts those cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The following tables provide fair value measurement information for such assets and liabilities
that are measured on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):

Fair Values — Nonrecurring
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, Occidental did not have any assets or
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The following table provides fair value
measurement for such proved domestic and international oil and gas properties that are
measured on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2015. The impairment tests, including the
fair value estimation, incorporated a number of assumptions involving expectations of future cash
flows. These assumptions included estimates of future product prices, which Occidental based
on forward price curves as of balance sheet date and, where applicable, contractual prices,
estimates of oil and gas reserves, estimates of future expected operating and development costs,
and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8 to 20 percent. These properties were impacted by
persistently low worldwide oil and natural gas prices and changing development plans.
Occidental used the income approach to measure the fair value of these properties, using inputs
categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and other on-balance-sheet financial
instruments, other than long-term fixed-rate debt, approximate fair value.  The cost, if any, to
terminate Occidental's off-balance-sheet financial instruments is not significant.  Occidental
estimates the fair value of fixed-rate debt based on the quoted market prices for those instruments
or on quoted market yields for similarly rated debt instruments, taking into account such
instruments’ maturities.  The estimated fair value of Occidental’s debt as of June 30, 2016,and
December 31, 2015, was $9.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, and its carrying value net of
unamortized discount as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $8.3 billion. The
majority of Occidental's debt is classified as Level 1, with $273 million classified as Level 2.
10. Derivatives
Derivatives are carried at fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the
same counterparty.  Occidental applies hedge accounting when transactions meet specified
criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment and management elects and documents such
treatment.  Otherwise, any fair value gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the current
period.
Occidental uses a variety of derivative instruments, including cash-flow hedges and derivative
instruments not designated as hedging instruments, to obtain average prices for the relevant
production month and to improve realized prices for oil and gas. Occidental only occasionally
hedges its oil and gas production, and, when it does, the volumes are usually insignificant.
13
Cash-Flow Hedges
Occidental's marketing and trading operations, from time to time, store natural gas purchased
from third parties at Occidental's North American leased storage facilities. Derivative instruments
are used to fix margins on the future sales of the stored volumes through March 2017. As of June
30, 2016, Occidental had approximately 6 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and
had cash-flow hedges for the forecast sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 6
billion cubic feet of stored natural gas. As of December 31, 2015, Occidental had approximately
13 billion cubic feet of natural gas held in storage, and had cash-flow hedges for the forecast
sale, to be settled by physical delivery, of approximately 14 billion cubic feet of stored natural
gas. The following table summarizes Occidental’s other comprehensive income related to
derivatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015:

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
The following table summarizes Occidental’s net volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives
contracts not designated as hedging instruments, including both financial and physical derivative
contracts as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

)   (58
  603
)
The volumes in the table above exclude contracts tied to index prices, for which the fair value, if
any, is minimal at any point in time. These excluded contracts do not expose Occidental to price
risk because the contract prices fluctuate with index prices.
 
Occidental fulfills short positions through its own production or by third-party purchase contracts.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, Occidental entered into purchase contracts for a substantial
portion of the short positions outstanding at quarter end and has sufficient production capacity
and the ability to enter into additional purchase contracts to satisfy the remaining positions.
Approximately $38 million and $45 million of net gains from derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Approximately $26 million of net gains and $44 million of net losses from
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments were recognized in net sales for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As of June 30, 2016, collateral received of zero has been netted against the derivative assets,
and collateral paid of $15 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
As of December 31, 2015, collateral received of $14 million has been netted against derivative
assets, and collateral paid of $4 million has been netted against derivative liabilities.
Select clearinghouses and brokers require Occidental to post an initial margin deposit.
Collateral, mainly for initial margin, of $44 million and $3 million deposited by Occidental has
not been reflected in these derivative fair value tables as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. This collateral is included in other current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
(c)
(d)
See Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurement disclosures on derivatives.
15
Credit Risk
The majority of Occidental's counterparty credit risk is related to the physical delivery of energy
commodities to its customers and their inability to meet their settlement commitments. Occidental
manages this credit risk by selecting counterparties that it believes to be financially strong, by
entering into master netting arrangements with counterparties and by requiring collateral, as
appropriate. Occidental actively reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties and monitors
credit exposures against assigned credit limits by adjusting credit limits to reflect counterparty
risk, if necessary. Occidental also enters into future contracts through regulated exchanges with
select clearinghouses and brokers, which are subject to minimal credit risk as a significant
portion of these transactions settle on a daily margin basis.
Certain of Occidental's OTC derivative instruments contain credit-risk-contingent features,
primarily tied to credit ratings for Occidental or its counterparties, which may affect the amount of
collateral that each would need to post. Occidental believes that if it had received a one-notch
reduction in its credit ratings, it would not have resulted in a material change in its collateral-
posting requirements as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
11. Industry Segments
Occidental conducts its operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and (3)
midstream and marketing. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and
condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.  The chemical segment mainly
manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.  The midstream and marketing segment
gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural
gas, CO2 and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage
capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct
similar activities.
Results of industry segments generally exclude income taxes, interest income, interest expense,
environmental remediation expenses, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued
operations, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area
assets and income from the segments' equity investments. Intersegment sales eliminate upon
consolidation and are generally made at prices approximating those that the selling entity would
be able to obtain in third-party transactions.

12. Earnings Per Share
Occidental’s instruments containing rights to nonforfeitable dividends granted in stock-based
awards are considered participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, net income
allocated to these participating securities has been deducted from earnings in computing basic
and diluted EPS under the two-class method.
Basic EPS was computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock, net of income
allocated to participating securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during each period, net of treasury shares and including vested but unissued shares
and share units.  The computation of diluted EPS reflects the additional dilutive effect of stock
options and unvested stock awards.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
In this report, “Occidental” means Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or
more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries). Portions of this report contain
forward-looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect
expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows and business prospects. Actual results may
differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially, and reported results should not be
considered an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause results to differ include,
but are not limited to: global commodity pricing fluctuations; supply and demand considerations
for Occidental’s products; higher-than-expected costs; the regulatory approval environment;
reorganization or restructuring of Occidental’s operations; not successfully completing, or any
material delay of, field developments, expansion projects, capital expenditures, efficiency
projects, acquisitions or dispositions; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and
natural gas reserves; lower-than-expected production from development projects or acquisitions;
exploration risks; general economic slowdowns domestically or internationally; political
conditions and events; liability under environmental regulations including remedial actions;
litigation; disruption or interruption of production or manufacturing or facility damage due to
accidents, chemical releases, labor unrest, weather, natural disasters, cyber attacks or insurgent
activity; failure of risk management; changes in law or regulations; or changes in tax rates. Words
such as “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “may,” “might,” “anticipate,”
“plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “aim,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “likely” or similar
expressions that convey the prospective nature of events or outcomes generally indicate forward-
looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this report. Unless legally required, Occidental does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, as a result of new
information, future events or otherwise. Material risks that may affect Occidental’s results of
operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Occidental's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the 2015 Form 10-K).
Consolidated Results of Operations
 
Occidental reported a net loss from continuing operations of $136 million for the second quarter
of 2016 on net sales of $2.5 billion, compared to net income from continuing operations of $180
million on net sales of $3.5 billion for the second quarter of 2015. Diluted loss per share from
continuing operations was $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016, compared to diluted earnings of
$0.23 per share for the second quarter of 2015.
Occidental reported a net loss from continuing operations of $496 million for the first six months
of 2016 on net sales of $4.7 billion, compared to a net loss of $35 million on net sales of $6.6
billion for the same period in 2015. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.65
per share for the first six months of 2016, compared to a loss per share of $0.04 for the same
period of 2015. Income from discontinued operations was $435 million or $0.57 per share for the
first six months of 2016, compared with a loss of $7 million or $0.01 per share for the same period
of 2015.
The net losses from continuing operations in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
when compared to the same periods in 2015, reflect the impact of lower realized commodity
prices in the oil and gas and chemical segments and lower marketing margins due to
unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials. The lower prices were partially offset by lower
per-barrel operating costs and lower chemical raw material and energy costs. Income from
discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016, resulted from the settlement
from the Republic of Ecuador under a November 2015 arbitration award.
Selected Statements of Operations Items
Net sales decreased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same
periods in 2015, due to lower realized commodity prices. Gain (loss) on sale of assets, net, for the
six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected a gain on the sale of the Piceance Basin
operations in Colorado of $121 million and a gain on the sale of the Occidental Tower building in
Dallas of $57 million.
Compared to the same periods in 2015, cost of sales for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 reflected lower oil and gas production costs, mainly from maintenance and support
activities and lower raw material and energy costs for the chemical business.
Asset impairments and related items for the six months ended June 30, 2016, reflected
impairment charges of $78 million related to the special stock dividend of California Resources
shares. Asset impairments and related items
19
for the six months ended June 30, 2015, reflected impairment charges for Occidental's South
Texas Eagle Ford non-operated properties, investments in Yemen, mark-to-market losses on a
CO2 purchase contract and rig idling and termination fees.
Lower taxes other than on income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared
to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower production and ad valorem taxes, which are mostly
tied to oil and gas prices.
Higher interest and debt expense, net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same periods of 2015, reflected lower capitalized interest as well as additional
interest accrued for senior notes issued in April 2016 and a premium on the early retirement in
May 2016 of the $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due February 2017.
The domestic and foreign income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to income tax provisions in the same periods of 2015, are due to higher pre-tax
operating losses in 2016 compared to 2015 and the relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks.
Selected Analysis of Financial Position
 
See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion about the changes in cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash.
 
The increase in trade receivables, net, at June 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015, was
due to an increase in oil and gas realized prices. The decrease in assets held for sale and
available for sale investment reflect the sale of Piceance operations in Colorado and the
Occidental Tower in Dallas, and the distribution of Occidental's remaining California Resources
common stock to its shareholders. The increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is
primarily a result of capital contributions associated with the joint venture for the ethylene cracker
at the OxyChem Ingleside facility. The decrease in property, plant and equipment, net, is
primarily the result of DD&A, offset partially by Occidental's capital spending of $1.2 billion in the
first half of 2016.
Current maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2016, decreased from December 31, 2015, due
to the payments of $700 million 2.5-percent senior notes due February 2016 and $750 million
4.125-percent senior notes due June 2016. The increase in long-term debt, net since December
31, 2015 is the result of the issuance of $2.75 billion of senior notes in April 2016, partially offset
by the early redemption in May 2016 of $1.25 billion 1.75-percent senior notes due February
2017.
The decrease in accrued liabilities at June 30, 2016, is due to first quarter payments of ad-
valorem taxes. Liabilities of assets held for sale as of June 30, 2016, decreased due to the sale of
Piceance operations in Colorado.
Segment Operations
 
Occidental conducts its operations through three segments: (1) oil and gas; (2) chemical; and
(3) midstream and marketing. The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil
and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. The chemical segment mainly manufactures and
markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes,
transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, CO2 and power. It
also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the
midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.

Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate of 38 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is
lower than the comparative period of 2015 due to the mix of domestic operating losses and
foreign operating income, as well as the current year domestic tax benefit associated with the
relinquishment of foreign exploration blocks. Excluding the impact of asset sales and other
nonrecurring items, Occidental's worldwide effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30,
2016 would be 32 percent.

2015
Oil and gas segment losses were $117 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared with
segment earnings of $355 million for the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in earnings was
mainly due to lower commodity prices for all products, partially offset by lower operating costs.
Total average daily production volumes were 653,000 BOE for the second quarter of 2016
compared to 658,000 BOE for the second quarter of 2015. Occidental completed the sale of the
Piceance Basin assets on March 1, 2016, and continues to reduce its exposure to non-core
operations in the Middle East/North Africa, including Bahrain, Iraq and Yemen. These domestic
and international operations produced average daily volumes of 44,000 BOE and 106,000 BOE
in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the second quarter of 2016, total
company average daily oil and gas production volumes for ongoing operations increased by
57,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 609,000 BOE from 552,000 BOE in the second quarter
of 2015. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, domestic average daily production for ongoing
operations increased by 4,000 BOE to 302,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2016 with Permian
Resources increasing by 17,000 BOE, which was partially offset by lower natural gas and NGL
production in South Texas. International average daily production for ongoing operations
increased to 307,000 BOE in the second quarter of 2016 from 254,000 BOE in the second
quarter of 2015. The increase in international production is primarily attributable to Al Hosn,
which was not fully operational in the second quarter of 2015, in addition to Oman's Block 62
production which commenced in 2016.
Worldwide commodity prices for the second quarter of 2016 were lower than the second quarter
of 2015. The average quarterly WTI and Brent prices decreased to $45.59 per barrel and $46.97
per barrel, respectively, for the second
25
quarter of 2016, compared to $57.94 per barrel and $63.50 per barrel, respectively, for the
second quarter of 2015. Worldwide realized crude oil prices declined by 27 percent to $39.66 per
barrel for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $54.55 per barrel in the second quarter of
2015. Worldwide realized NGL prices decreased by 19 percent to $14.59 per barrel in the
second quarter of 2016, compared to $18.06 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. Domestic
realized natural gas prices decreased by 30 percent in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.46 per
MCF, compared to $2.09 per MCF in the second quarter of 2015.
Oil and gas segment losses were $602 million for the first six months of 2016, compared with
segment earnings of $89 million for the same period of 2015. The decrease in earnings was
mainly due to lower commodity prices, partially offset by lower operating costs.
Total average daily production volumes for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 were 655,000
BOE and 652,000 BOE, respectively. For the first six months of 2016 and 2015, non-core
operations produced average daily volumes of 56,000 BOE and 110,000 BOE, respectively. For
the first six months of 2016, total company average daily oil and gas production volumes for
ongoing operations increased by 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) to 599,000 BOE from
542,000 BOE for the first six months of 2015. Domestic average daily production for ongoing
operations increased by 9,000 BOE for the first six months of 2016 as compared to the first six
months of 2015 with Permian Resources increasing by 23,000 BOE, which was partially offset by
lower natural gas and NGL production in South Texas. International average daily production
increased to 295,000 BOE for the first six months of 2016 from 247,000 BOE for the first six
months 2015. The increase in international production mainly comes from Al Hosn, which was
not fully operational in the first half of 2015.
Worldwide commodity prices for the first six months of 2016 were lower than the same period of
2015. Worldwide realized crude oil prices declined by 33 percent to $34.46 per barrel for the first
six months of 2016, compared to $51.60 per barrel for the same period of 2015. Worldwide
realized NGL prices decreased by 29 percent to $12.80 per barrel for the first six months of 2016,
compared to $18.01 per barrel for the same period of 2015. Domestic realized natural gas prices
decreased by 35 percent for the first six months of 2016 to $1.48 per MCF, compared to $2.29 per
MCF for the same period of 2015.
Occidental’s financial results correlate closely to the prices it obtains for its products. The weak
price environment continues to significantly impact earnings as compared to the same period in
2015. Further declines in these commodity prices may result in additional impairments to reduce
the carrying value of Occidental’s oil and gas properties as well as reducing the amount of these
commodities that can be produced economically and the quantity and present value of proved
reserves.
The calculated average first-day-of-the-month West Texas Intermediate oil price and Henry Hub
natural gas price were $40.54 per barrel and $2.25 per MMBtu, respectively, for the first seven
months of 2016 as compared to $50.28 per barrel and $2.66 per MMBtu for the twelve months of
2015. To the extent that commodity prices remain at current or lower levels throughout 2016, a
portion of proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer classified as proved.
Chemical Segment
 
Chemical segment earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, were $88 million
and $302 million, respectively, compared to $136 million and $275 million for the same period of
2015. Excluding gains of $88 million for the sale of chemical assets in the first six months of
2016, the lower earnings in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 reflected lower average
sales prices for most product lines and lower demand for calcium chloride, partially offset with
lower ethylene and energy costs.
Midstream and Marketing Segment
Midstream and marketing losses were $58 million and $153 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to segment earnings of $87 million and $72 million
for the same periods of 2015. The lower results reflected lower marketing margins due to
unfavorable Permian to Gulf Coast differentials.
26
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
At June 30, 2016, Occidental had $3.8 billion in cash. Income and cash flows are largely
dependent on the oil and gas segment's realized prices, sales volumes and operating costs. In
the first six months of 2016, Occidental significantly reduced its capital expenditures compared to
the prior year period. With a continued reduction in capital expenditures and forecasted
operational improvements, Occidental expects to fund its liquidity needs, including future
dividend payments, through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, monetization of non-
core assets or investments and, if necessary, through future borrowings or proceeds from other
forms of capital issuance.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 amount includes $0.9 billion in operating
cash flows from discontinued operations related to the Ecuador settlement. Cash flows were
negatively impacted by significantly lower realized prices for all oil and natural gas commodities
in the first half of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015; however, operating cost
reductions as well as cash receipts of $882 million for the Ecuador settlement and $302 million of
federal income tax refunds more than offset the effect of lower commodity prices. The impact of
the chemical and the midstream and marketing segments on overall cash flows is typically less
significant than the impact of the oil and gas segment because the chemical and midstream and
marketing segments are significantly smaller. The $0.5 billion decrease of working capital was
related to the cyclical payments of property taxes and employee costs, payment of liabilities
accrued at year-end related to exited or exiting international operations, and decreases in
inventory and receivables.
 
Occidental’s net cash used by investing activities was $1.3 billion for the first six months of 2016,
compared to $3.9 billion for the same period of 2015. Capital expenditures for the first six months
of 2016 were $1.2 billion of which $0.9 billion was for the oil and gas segment, compared to $3.1
billion for the first six months of 2015 of which $2.7 billion was for the oil and gas segment. The
change in capital accrual for both periods reflected amounts paid in the first half of the current
year related to capital expenditures incurred and accrued in the fourth quarter of the preceding
year. Capital expenditures have been significantly reduced in response to the current commodity
price environment.
Occidental’s net cash provided by financing activities was $66 million for the first six months of
2016, compared to $1.5 billion for the same period of 2015. Restricted cash of $1.2 billion and
$1.6 billion was used to pay dividends and repay debt in the first six months of 2016 and 2015,
respectively. In the first six months of 2016 and 2015, Occidental issued $2.75 billion and $1.5
billion of senior notes, respectively. In the first six months of 2016, Occidental repaid $700 million
of 2.5-percent senior notes due February 2016 and $750 million of 4.125-percent senior notes
due June 2016, and early redeemed $1.25 billion of 1.75-percent senior notes due February
2017.
As of June 30, 2016, Occidental was in compliance with all covenants of its financing
agreements and had substantial capacity for additional unsecured borrowings, the payment of
cash dividends and other distributions on, or acquisitions of, Occidental stock.
Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures
 
Occidental’s operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations related to improving or maintaining environmental quality.  Occidental’s
environmental compliance costs have generally increased over time and are expected to rise in
the future.  Occidental factors environmental expenditures for its operations into its business
planning process as an integral part of producing quality products responsive to market demand.
 
The laws that require or address environmental remediation, including CERCLA and similar
federal, state, local and foreign laws, may apply retroactively and regardless of fault, the legality
of the original activities or the current ownership or control of sites.  OPC or certain of its
subsidiaries participate in or actively monitor a range of remedial activities and government or
private proceedings under these laws with respect to alleged past practices at operating, closed
and third-party sites.  Remedial activities may include one or more of the following:  investigation
involving sampling, modeling, risk assessment or monitoring; cleanup measures including
removal, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances; or operation and maintenance of
remedial systems.   These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of
remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages,
civil penalties, injunctive relief and government oversight costs.
Refer to Note 6, Environmental Liabilities and Expenditures, in the Notes to the Consolidated
Condensed Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and to the Environmental
Liabilities and Expenditures section of
27
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the
2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding Occidental’s environmental expenditures.
Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments and Contingencies
 
Occidental accrues reserves for outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Occidental has disclosed its reserve balances for environmental matters. Reserve balances for
other matters as of June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were not material to Occidental's
consolidated balance sheets. Occidental also evaluates the amount of reasonably possible
losses that it could incur as a result of the matters mentioned above. Occidental has disclosed its
range of reasonably possible additional losses for sites where it is a participant in environmental
remediation. Occidental believes that other reasonably possible losses which it could incur in
excess of reserves accrued on the balance sheet would not be material to its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. For further information, see Note 7, Lawsuits, Claims,
Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial
Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Recently Adopted Accounting and Disclosure Changes
See Note 3, Accounting and Disclosure Changes, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Item 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no material changes in the
information required to be provided under Item 305 of Regulation S-K included under Item 7A,
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the 2015 Form 10-K.
Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and its Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer supervised and participated in Occidental's evaluation of its disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation,
Occidental's President and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that Occidental's disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of June 30, 2016.
 
There has been no change in Occidental's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the first six
months of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
Occidental's internal control over financial reporting.
