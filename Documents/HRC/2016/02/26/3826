<p><b>  Switzerland: draft decision

<p><b>  17/&#8230; Promotion and protection of human rights in the context of 
 peaceful protests  
</b></p>
<p> At its &#8230; meeting, on &#8230; June 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt the 
following text: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, 
including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 7/36 of 28 March 2008, 12/16 of 2 
October 2009 and 16/4 of 24 March 2011, on freedom of opinion and expression, as well as 
Council resolution 15/21 of 30 September 2010, on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and of association, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
States Members of the United Nations have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation 
with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or 
religion,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming also</i> that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> that the rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of expression and 
association are human rights guaranteed to all,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that no one shall be subjected to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that everyone must be able to express their grievances through public and 
peaceful protests without fear of being injured, beaten, detained, tortured or killed,  
</p>

<p>2 
</p>
<p><i> Deploring</i> the deaths, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, harassment, 
intimidation, violence and injuries inflicted on individuals in the context of the peaceful 
exercise of their fundamental rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that peaceful protests should not be viewed as a threat and therefore 
encouraging States to engage in an open, inclusive and meaningful national dialogue, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>that States faced with peaceful protests should make their utmost effort to 
prevent human rights violations, in particular extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>the need for long-term and sustainable assistance from the international 
community, upon request of the States concerned, in order to address the root causes and 
grievances of peaceful protests, which are in some instances linked to socio-economic 
inequalities and undue limitations on civil and political rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> therefore the need to reflect on the promotion and protection of human 
rights in the context of peaceful protests,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its eighteenth session, a 
panel discussion on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of peaceful 
protests, with a particular focus on the legal obligations, under international law, incumbent 
upon States when they respond to such protests, and on the ways and means to improve the 
protection of human rights in times of peaceful protests;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to liaise with the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and of association, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, States and other stakeholders, including relevant United 
Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to ensuring their participation in the panel 
discussion; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.&#8221; 
</p>
