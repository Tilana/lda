<p><b>   
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>          In the present report, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means 
of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination provides an overview of activities undertaken during the reporting 
period, including a summary of its missions to Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and 
Iraq, and the participation of the members as resource persons in the 
intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights Council at its 
fifteenth session. The Working Group reviews the activities and achievements of the 
mandate since its establishment by the Commission on Human Rights in 2005, 
including its progress in the elaboration of a possible draft convention on private 
military and security companies (private military and security companies), the 
consultations held in each of the five geographic regions pursuant to General 
Assembly resolution 62/145, and the communications and country missions of the 
Working Group in the past six years.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>          The Working Group subsequently identifies the key challenges for the 
mandate. It discusses new forms of mercenary activities that have emerged in recent 
years and demonstrate that mercenarism continues to pose a threat to human rights 
and the right of peoples to self-determination. It then discusses the need for an 
international regulatory framework for private military and security companies. In 
particular, it analyses the relationship between the draft convention elaborated by the 
Working Group, the Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations 
and good practices for States related to operations of private military and security 
companies during armed conflict, which clarifies the responsibilities of States with 
regard to private military and security companies and lists good practices, and the 
International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers for those 
companies. Furthermore, the Working Group discusses the need for the adoption of 
national legislation regulating private military and security companies and the 
difficulties encountered to date in ensuring accountability for human rights violations 
and violations of national laws by private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>          Lastly, the Working Group makes a number of recommendations for Member 
States in order to address the challenges identified in its report. The Working Group 
recommends, inter alia, that Member States adopt legislation to regulate private 
military and security companies, take measures to ensure their accountability for 
human rights violations, and provide victims of human rights violations with an 
effective remedy. The Working Group also recommends that Member States consider 
the possibility of elaborating a binding international instrument for the regulation of 
private military and security companies and participate in international efforts, such 
as the intergovernmental working group established by the Human Rights Council.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination describes its activities its previous report submitted to the Human Rights 
Council (A/HRC/15/25). It covers the communications sent between 18 April 2010 and 30 
April 2011. As the present report is the last one for a majority of the initial members of the 
Working Group who are ending their second term in 2011, it focuses on the activities and 
achievements of the Working Group over the past six years. 
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to resolution 2005/2 of the Commission on Human 
Rights, in which the Commission established the mandate of the Working Group, and 
Human Rights Council resolutions 7/21 and 15/12, in which the Council extended that 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their 
personal capacities: Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain), Chairperson-Rapporteur; Amada 
Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia); Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya); Faiza Patel 
(Pakistan); and Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation). In April 2010, the Working Group 
decided to operate under a three-monthly rotating chair until the end of the year. 
Accordingly, Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez was Chairperson from July to September 2010. Mr. 
Nikitin followed, from October to December 2010. At its eleventh session, the Working 
Group decided that Mr. Gomez del Prado would act as Chairperson-Rapporteur until 
August 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group over the past year 
</b></p>
<p>4. In accordance with its usual practice, the Working Group continued to hold three 
regular sessions each year, two in Geneva and one at Headquarters. The Working Group 
held its eleventh session from 29 November to 3 December 2010, and its twelfth session 
from 4 to 8 April 2011, in Geneva. At the sessions, the Working Group met with 
representatives of several Governments and regional organizations, United Nations officials 
and non-governmental organizations in order to discuss, inter alia, recent activities of 
mercenaries and private military and security companies, and preparations for the 
intergovernmental working group.  
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group continued to monitor the activities of mercenaries and private 
military and security companies around the world and their impact on human rights. It also 
carried out three country visits, held regular meetings with representatives of Member 
States, non-governmental organizations and experts, reviewed allegations regarding the 
activities of mercenaries and private military and security companies and their impact on 
human rights, and decided on appropriate action. Members of the Working Group were also 
invited to participate as resource persons in the first session of the open-ended 
intergovernmental working group on the regulation of private military and security 
companies, which was held in May 2011. 
</p>
<p><b>  A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>6. The present report covers communications sent from 18 April 2010 to 30 April 2011 
and replies received from 1 June 2010 to 30 April 2011.  </p>


<p>7. A total of seven communications were sent to seven countries, one1 relating to 
alleged involvement of country nationals in mercenary activities in a foreign country and to 
activities of private military and security companies and their impact on the enjoyment of 
human rights. The Working Group also sent two reminder letters and a follow-up letter 
requesting further information. In some cases, the Working Group sent similar 
communications to several Governments whose nationals were allegedly involved in the 
same activities. For three of the communications sent, the Working Group received a 
complete or partial response from the Government concerned. The Working Group 
expresses its appreciation to those Governments that provided substantive replies to its 
communications and invites those that have not done so to cooperate with its mandate by 
providing the information requested. 
</p>
<p><b>  B. Press releases 
</b></p>
<p>8. In addition to its media advisories or press releases issued in connection to country 
visits and the holding of its regular sessions, the Working Group issued two press releases 
in connection with alleged mercenary activities in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya. On 22 February 2011, the Working Group issued a press release on the 
situation in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya together with a number of other special procedures 
mandate holders, in which it expressed its grave concerns at allegations that mercenaries 
had been involved in the killing of protesters. On 1 April 2011, the Working Group, again 
with a number of other special procedures mandate holders, issued a press release on the 
situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in which it expressed its concerns about numerous reports 
regarding the involvement of English-speaking mercenaries in attacks against civilians, and 
recalled that the recruitment of mercenaries was prohibited under international law.  
</p>
<p>9. On 19 October 2010, the Working Group issued a statement following a report 
issued by the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on the role and oversight 
of American private security contractors in Afghanistan. It recommended stronger oversight 
of American private security contractors in Afghanistan and elsewhere and noted that the 
findings in the Senate report were consistent with those of the Working Group following its 
visit to Afghanistan in 2009. The Working Group also recalled its findings that, owing to 
the lack of effective vetting procedures, in particular, some private military and security 
companies employed individuals who may have been involved in human rights abuses in 
the past and continued to be involved in human rights violations while employed by these 
companies. In this regard, it recommended once again that the Government of the United 
States of America should establish a more vigorous vetting procedure before awarding 
contracts. 
</p>
<p>10. In addition, on 21 October 2010, following the reports of the death of a passenger 
being deported from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a flight 
to Angola, while in the custody of the private security company G4S, the Working Group, 
together with the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, issued a statement 
expressing their deep concern over the incident. Jimmy Mubenga, a national from Angola, 
who was being deported from the United Kingdom after losing his appeal to remain in the 
country, died 50 minutes after boarding a British Airways flight at Heathrow airport on 13 
October 2010. Mr. Mubenga was sitting at the rear of the aircraft, surrounded by three 
guards working for G4S, which has been contracted by the British border agency to escort 
deportees. Passengers reported that the guards restrained heavily Mr. Mubenga, who 
consistently complained about his breathing and begged for help from other passengers. 
</p>
<p>  
1Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Honduras, Israel, Liberia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>


<p>11. In its statement, the Working Group noted that although G4S employees were not 
law enforcement officials, they had been contracted by the Government of Great Britain to 
carry out governmental functions and, as such, the Government should ensure that they 
were subject to the same rules as the law enforcement officials who would normally carry 
out such functions. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur and the Working Group recalled 
the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,2 
which provides that such officials, in carrying out their duty, should, as far as possible, 
apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force, and questioned the 
outsourcing of the public use of force to private security companies. 
</p>
<p><b>  C. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Working Group undertook three country visits during the reporting period, to 
Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and Iraq.  
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group&#8217;s visit to Equatorial Guinea, from 16 to 20 August 2010, 
focused on the investigations and prosecutions relating to the attempted coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 
March 2004 and to the armed attack on the presidential palace by alleged mercenaries on 17 
February 2009. The coup attempt of March 2004 was the most widely reported incident that 
clearly involved mercenaries, some of whom were current or former employees of private 
military and security companies from several other countries. The Working Group found 
that the attempt illustrated disturbing links between mercenaries and some private military 
and security companies, making the monitoring of such links all the more necessary.  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to the armed attack on the presidential palace by alleged mercenaries on 
17 February 2009, the Working Group regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the 
authorities and the lack of cooperation extended to the Working Group during its visit. In 
this regard, the Working Group recommended that the Government should provide full 
information regarding the attack on the presidential palace and, in particular, that all 
judgements rendered in the criminal cases relating to the attack be rendered public. In 
addition, the Working Group urged the Government to provide explanations as to how the 
four men on trial for their alleged involvement in the attack had been brought back from 
Benin to Equatorial Guinea. The Working Group strongly condemned their execution on 21 
August 2010, which followed a summary trial that was lacking in fundamental due process 
and was carried out so quickly that the four men were denied all possibility of appeal. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group recommended that the Government should consider developing 
national legislation to criminalize mercenarism and mercenary-related acts. In this context, 
it suggested that the Penal Code be revised and updated to bring it into line with the State&#8217;s 
international human rights obligations. It also urged the Government to consider acceding 
to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries as a matter of priority. Since all mercenaries should be held accountable for 
their actions, the Working Group advised that anyone accused of involvement in a 
mercenary-related incident should be tried by a competent, independent and impartial 
tribunal. It also recommended that anyone accused of involvement in a mercenary-related 
incident should be treated in accordance with international human rights standards, in 
particular the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. The full report and recommendations are contained in an addendum to the 
present report (A/HRC/18/32/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>  
2 Adopted at the eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders, Havana, held from 27 August to 7 September 1990. </p>


<p>16. From 10 to 19 November 2010, the Working Group visited South Africa to examine 
the country&#8217;s legislation on mercenaries and private military and security companies and its 
impact on human rights.  
</p>
<p>17. Since the end of apartheid in 1994, many South Africans with extensive military 
skills and experience have been unwilling or unable to find employment in South Africa. 
As a result, they have offered their services abroad and many have been employed by 
international private military and security companies. Some have become involved in 
mercenary activities. In order to address these developments, South Africa was one of the 
first countries to adopt legislation on the provision of &#8220;foreign military assistance&#8221; in 1998. 
However, the Working Group found that there were a number of challenges in the 
implementation of this legislation, some of which relating to the functioning of the National 
Conventional Arms Control Committee, the entity charged with reviewing requests for 
authorization to provide security services in areas of armed conflict. Others are linked to 
difficulties with prosecutions. Overall, it was clear to the Working Group that the 1998 
legislation has not had a significant impact on the private military and security industry. 
</p>
<p>18. Following the coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 in which several South 
African mercenaries were involved, South Africa adopted new legislation in 2006 to 
address some of the gaps in the 1998 legislation. This more recent legislation is not yet in 
force and it remains to be seen whether it will effectively regulate the provision of security 
services in areas of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group and the authorities also discussed the framework for regulating 
the domestic private security industry in South Africa. Since there are some potential areas 
of overlap between the regulatory rules covering those private security companies working 
in South Africa and those working abroad, the Working Group encouraged the authorities 
to coordinate and harmonize the two regulatory frameworks.  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group recalled that the establishment of a regulatory and monitoring 
regime for private military and security companies was only a first step towards ensuring 
accountability in cases of human rights violations. It recommended that the authorities 
should consider the establishment of accountability mechanisms for private military and 
security companies at the domestic level. The Working Group also recommended that 
effective remedies should be offered to potential victims of human rights violations 
involving private military and security companies. The full report and recommendations are 
contained in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/18/32/Add.3). 
</p>
<p>21. The Working Group undertook a visit to Iraq from 12 to 16 June 2011. During the 
visit, the Working Group examined the measures taken by the Government to regulate the 
activities of private military and security companies operating in the country and their 
impact on the enjoyment of human rights. The Working Group learned that the number of 
incidents involving private military and security companies had decreased in recent years. 
This could be attributed to several factors: the decrease in their military-related activities in 
Iraq (especially in mobile protection); stricter regulation by the Iraqi authorities; and efforts 
by the United States to tighten oversight of its private security contractors operating in Iraq. 
The Working Group commended the efforts of the Iraqi and United States authorities in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>22. Despite this decrease in incidents, Iraq continues to grapple with the granting of 
legal immunity extended to private security contractors under order 17 issued by the 
Coalition Provisional Authority. The immunity prevented prosecutions in Iraqi courts. Nor 
have prosecutions in the home countries of such companies been successful. Four years 
after the Nissour Square incident, the case against the alleged perpetrators is still pending in 
United States courts.  
</p>
<p>23. In a welcome development, the 2009 Status of Forces Agreement reached between 
Iraq and the United States contains a provision removing the immunity of some private 
foreign security contractors in Iraq. It is not clear, however, whether this removal of </p>


<p>immunity covers all contractors employed by the Government of the United States and 
whether it is fully applied in Iraqi courts. In any case, the removal of immunity fails to 
provide justice to those who were victims of serious human rights violations prior to 2009.  
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>24. Coalition Provisional Authority order 17 remains the legal basis for the regulation of 
private military and security companies by the Government of Iraq. In the view of the 
Working Group, this is not a firm basis for regulation. Iraq has introduced legislation 
regulating security companies, which has been pending since 2008. The Working Group 
urged the Government to adopt this legislation as a matter of priority. It also urged the 
Government to remain vigilant and devote the necessary resources to ensure that security 
companies &#8211; whether international or Iraqi &#8211; were stringently regulated and that they 
respect the human rights of the Iraqi people. The full report and recommendations are 
contained in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/18/32/Add.4). 
</p>
<p><b>  D. Participation in the intergovernmental working group on the 
regulation of private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 15/26, established an open-ended 
intergovernmental working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an international 
regulatory framework, including, inter alia, the option of elaborating a legally binding 
instrument on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the activities of private military 
and security companies, including their accountability, taking into consideration the 
principles, main elements and draft text as proposed by the Working Group. In the 
resolution, the Council also provides that members of the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries who were involved in the elaboration of the principles, main elements and 
draft text for a possible convention should participate in the open-ended intergovernmental 
working group as resource persons. 
</p>
<p>26. Accordingly, the members of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries 
participated as resource persons in the first session of the intergovernmental working group, 
which was held in Geneva from 23 to 27 May 2011. Members of the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries made presentations on the law and practice in relation to private military 
and security companies, national legislation and practices, the elements of an international 
regulatory framework and accountability and the right to an effective remedy for victims. 
</p>
<p><b>  E. Other activities of the Working Group members 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group, Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado, and Ms. 
Benavides de P&#233;rez participated in Forum 2010, an international cultural gathering, which 
was held in Santiago de Compostela (Spain) from 4 to 15 December 2010. Ms. Benavides 
de P&#233;rez made a presentation at the World Forum on Education, Research and Culture of 
Peace on the theme &#8220;Threats and challenges posed to the international community by the 
privatization of security&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>28. On 18 January 2011, the Chairperson-Rapporteur made a statement to the Advisory 
Committee of the Human Rights Council on the occasion of the consideration of the 
progress report on the right of peoples to peace. The drafting group of the Advisory 
Committee proposed several provisions in the progress report regarding private military and 
security companies, namely that (a) States should refrain from outsourcing inherently State 
military and security functions to private contractors; and that (b) States should ensure that 
private military and security companies, their personnel and any structures related to their 
activities perform their respective functions under officially enacted laws consistent with 
international human rights and humanitarian law. </p>


<p>29. On 22 February 2011, the Chairperson-Rapporteur  delivered a joint statement of 
special procedures mandate holders to the Human Rights Council at its fifteenth special 
session. 
</p>
<p>30. On 22 March 2011, the Chairperson-Rapporteur attended a conference at the Catalan 
International Institute for Peace in Barcelona<b> </b>on the theme &#8220;The new private providers of 
the physical use of force in the twenty-first century&#8221;, which was organized in conjunction 
with the launching of the book <i>Hacia la regulaci&#243;n internacional de las empresas militares 
y de seguridad privadas</i>, authored by Mr. G&#243;mez del Prado and Helena Torroja. Mr. 
G&#243;mez del Prado also authored additional articles, including &#8220;Privatising security and war&#8221;, 
in <i>Forced Migration Review,</i> in March 2011; &#8220;A UN instrument to regulate and monitor 
private military and security contractors&#8221;, in the <i>Notre Dame Journal of International, 
Comparative, &amp; Human Rights Law</i>, in April 2011; &#8220;Privatizing and commercializing the 
use of force: accountability and implications for local communities&#8221;, in <i>Rethinking 
Transitions</i>; and &#8220;Impact on human rights of a new non-State actor: private military and 
security companies&#8221;, in <i>The Brown Journal of World Affairs </i>(Fall/winter 2011). He was 
also requested to endorse <i>The</i> <i>Small Arms Survey 2011: States of Security</i>, which provides 
an insight into key trends in security provision around the world. 
</p>
<p>31. On 28 April 2011, the Chairperson-Rapporteur gave a presentation on the draft 
convention elaborated by the Working Group at the Final Conference in Brussels of the 
PRIV-WAR Project, an academic project funded by the European Commission on private 
military and security companies, human rights, humanitarian law and the role of the 
European Union. On 17 May 2011, he discussed the draft convention elaborated by the 
Working Group at the conference &#8220;Arm&#233;es priv&#233;es: situation en Suisse et dans le monde&#8221;, 
sponsored by Centre Europe-Tiers Monde and Groupe pour une Suisse sans arm&#233;e. 
</p>
<p>32. From 23 to 25 March 2011, Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez participated in the thirteenth 
Congress of the Latin-American Association of Asia and Africa Studies, held in Bogota, 
which focused on the theme, &#8220;The new south: theories and practices about Asia, Africa and 
Latin America in the twenty-first century&#8221;. She delivered a presentation on the use of 
mercenaries and contractors in Equatorial Guinea, Afghanistan and Colombia. On 12 and 
13 May 2011, she participated in a regional consultation on the Montreux Document in 
Santiago. Ms. Benavides de P&#233;rez presented as part of a panel on international initiatives.  
</p>
<p>33. The activities of the Working Group on mercenaries were widely covered by the 
international media, including BBC World News, TVE (Spain), TV3 of Barcelona, Radio 
Catalunya, US National Public Radio Talk of the Nation, <i>El Mundo</i>, <i>P&#250;blico</i>, <i>Le Courrier</i> 
(Geneva), <i>Foreign Policy</i> (Spanish edition), <i>L&#8217;Humanit&#233;</i>, <i>El Pa&#237;s</i> and <i>Mainichi Shimbun</i>. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities and achievements of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>34. In the past six years, the Working Group (a) undertook country visits; (b) sent and 
received communications; (c) organized regional consultations with Member States; and (d) 
elaborated elements of a possible draft convention on private military and security 
companies. Each of the above activities is described in detail below. 
</p>
<p><b>  A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>35. Since the Working Group was established, it has undertaken 11 country visits to 
examine the situations in countries regarding mercenaries and/or private military and 
security companies. In the course of its visits, it engaged in a constructive dialogue with 
Governments, international organizations, representatives of civil society, private military 
and security companies and other relevant stakeholders. In particular, the Working Group 
examined the national legislative and policy frameworks in these countries and their </p>


<p>effectiveness in protecting human rights and ensuring accountability for human rights 
violations involving mercenaries and private military and security companies.   
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group has undertaken visits to a broad range of countries in which the 
activities of private military and security companies or mercenaries are reported, including 
Afghanistan, Chile, Ecuador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Honduras, Iraq, Peru, South Africa, 
the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The Working Group wishes to 
express its sincere gratitude to these Governments for having extended invitations and for 
their cooperation during these country missions.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group&#8217;s country visits were designed to examine the broadest possible 
range of activities conducted by private military and security companies and mercenaries, 
as well as the effects of these activities across most geographical regions. In its 
investigation of mercenary activities, the Working Group visited Equatorial Guinea in 2010 
to understand the circumstances surrounding the attempted coup by mercenaries in 2004 
and the Government response. In its efforts to collect information and better understand 
activities of private military and security companies and their impact on human rights, the 
Working Group conducted country visits to Afghanistan and Iraq, in which companies of 
this type operate. The Working Group also visited the United Kingdom, the United States 
and South Africa, in which many private military and security companies are established, to 
exchange views regarding the regulation of their activities and to discuss the need to ensure 
accountability for human rights violations. Lastly, the Working Group conducted country 
visits to Chile, Fiji, Honduras, Peru and South Africa, where private military and security 
companies recruit personnel, to study the human rights impact of these activities.  
</p>
<p>38. During its country visits, the Working Group made several important findings. With 
regard to mercenaries, the Working Group found that national legislation and judicial 
processes were not always effective in ensuring accountability for mercenary activities and 
were not always conducted in line with international human rights standards. The Working 
Group recommended that accused mercenaries should be tried by a competent, independent 
and impartial tribunal and in compliance with international human rights standards. It also 
found evidence of disturbing links between mercenaries and some private military and 
security companies, making the monitoring of the activities of these companies and their 
employees all the more necessary. The Working Group urged Governments to consider 
acceding to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and 
Training of Mercenaries as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to private military and security companies, the Working Group found 
that many States did not have national legislation regulating the activities of such 
companies and their employees. In countries with national legislation in place regulating 
the private military and security industry, the Working Group found gaps in regulatory 
frameworks and discussed the importance of revising legislation or adopting new 
legislation to clarify and strengthen domestic regulations to ensure accountability for 
human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>40. In countries where private military and security companies operate, the Working 
Group found several challenges in holding the companies accountable for possible human 
rights violations. The Working Group discussed various approaches to ensuring 
accountability and protecting human rights in connection with the activities of such 
companies. It exchanged views with the Governments concerned in an effort to identify 
gaps in national legislation and recommended continuing efforts to develop national legal 
frameworks to ensure accountability for private military and security companies and an 
effective remedy for victims of human rights violations. Where such companies are 
required to obtain licenses, the Working Group discussed the need for oversight 
mechanisms to continue monitoring their activities even after they have received the 
appropriate licenses. The Working Group recommended the establishment of an 
independent mechanism to which the local population could submit complaints about 
violations of human rights by private military and security companies as a step towards </p>


<p>eliminating impunity. The Working Group suggested that Governments in countries where 
private military and security companies operate investigate, disarm and prosecute any such 
companies operating without the necessary licenses, and investigate all reported cases of 
incidents involving casualties committed by them, to prosecute perpetrators and provide 
victims with an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>41. The Working Group found that countries in which private military and security 
companies were established also faced significant challenges in their efforts to ensure 
accountability and to protect human rights in relation to the activities of such companies. 
The Working Group found that some Governments had engaged with professional 
associations representing the private military and security industry to develop good 
practices. The Working Group exchanged views with these Governments regarding such 
industry initiatives as codes of conduct. It shared ideas with the Governments regarding 
means of improving the compliance of private military and security companies with 
international humanitarian law and human rights norms. The Working Group highlighted 
gaps in oversight and accountability and recommended the adoption of comprehensive 
national legislation to ensure accountability for human rights violations and an effective 
remedy for victims.  
</p>
<p>42. During its visits to countries where private military and security companies 
recruited, the Working Group found that recruitment of personnel by such companies took 
several different forms. Governments shared their experiences of transnational private 
military and security companies recruiting nationals to work abroad, as well as domestic 
security companies hiring personnel to operate locally. The Working Group found that even 
Governments with broad legislative frameworks addressing the domestic private security 
industry fell short of similarly comprehensive regulation regarding the recruitment of their 
nationals by private military and security companies to work abroad. The Working Group 
noted with concern that countries where private military and security companies recruited, 
contracted and trained nationals to work in conflict areas abroad lacked protections against 
both contractual irregularities and the poor working conditions that their citizens often 
encountered. In addition to strengthening and clarifying regulatory frameworks governing 
the conduct of private military and security companies abroad, the Working Group 
recommended the establishment of a complaint mechanism and urgent measures to protect 
the human rights of company employees currently working in conflict areas. 
</p>
<p>43. A number of requests for country visits did not receive a favourable response. The 
Working Group encourages Governments to accept its requests to conduct country visits.  
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group has attempted to hold follow-up consultations during its 
sessions with the countries visited to discuss the implementation of its recommendations. It 
held follow-up meetings with the permanent missions of Afghanistan, Ecuador, Fiji, 
Honduras, Peru and the United States on its missions to these countries.  
</p>
<p><b>  B.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>45. Since the Working Group was established, it has received a number of reports 
alleging human rights violations involving mercenaries and private military and security 
companies. The Working Group regularly sends communications to Governments 
concerning individual allegations of human rights violations involving mercenaries and 
private military and security companies.  </p>


<p>46. Over the past six years, the Working Group sent a total of 35 allegation letters to 25 
Governments3 and three urgent appeals to two Governments.4 The Working Group has also 
sent five reminder letters and three follow-up letters to request further information.  
</p>
<p>47. Communications concerned many issues arising in connection with the activities of 
mercenaries and private military and security companies. Some addressed serious human 
rights violations, including the alleged unlawful killings of civilians. Others addressed 
registration and licensing procedures, the use of third-country nationals by private military 
and security companies abroad, the recruitment and training of such personnel, and their 
conditions of employment and treatment by the companies. The Working Group also noted 
alleged threats and violence against human rights defenders by private security companies 
and the use of private security companies to carry out deportations. 
</p>
<p>48. Although the Working Group regularly sends reminder letters when a Government 
does not reply to a specific allegation letter or urgent appeal, 11 Governments failed to 
respond to any of the Working Group&#8217;s communications.5 
</p>
<p>49. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to those Governments that have 
provided substantive replies to its communications and invites those that have not done so 
to cooperate with its mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>  C. Regional consultations 
</b></p>
<p>50. In its resolution 62/145, the General Assembly requested the Working Group to hold 
regional consultations on traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as a means of 
violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination, in particular regarding the effects of the activities of private military and 
security companies on the enjoyment of human rights.6  
</p><p>51. Pursuant to the above-mentioned resolutions, the Working Group held regional 
consultations in all five regions from 2007 to 2009. The consultation for Latin America and 
the Caribbean were held in Panama, in December 2007. It was followed by the consultation 
for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in Moscow, in October 2008; the consultation for 
Asia and the Pacific, in Bangkok, in October 2009; the consultation for Africa, in Addis 
Ababa, in March 2010; and the consultation for the Western European and Others Group, in 
Geneva, in April 2010. 
</p>
<p>52. Participants in the regional consultations noted that the enjoyment and exercise of 
human rights were increasingly impeded by the emergence of several new challenges and 
trends relating to mercenaries or their activities and by the role played by private military 
and security companies registered, operating or recruiting personnel in each region. 
Participants discussed the expansion of the operations of such companies in each region and 
the use in some places of private security guards instead of national police or security 
forces. They exchanged views regarding such companies&#8217; practices and the implications of 
</p>

<p>  6 See also Human Rights Council resolution 10/11. </p>


<p>the transfer of certain functions to private, non-State actors as part of the growing 
international trend to outsource traditional State functions to private military and security 
firms. Participants shared information regarding the potential repercussions of this practice 
on national sovereignty and discussed the regulations and other measures that States have 
adopted to ensure that private military and security companies respect international human 
rights standards.  
</p>
<p>53. The Working Group and participants discussed general guidelines, norms and basic 
principles for the regulation and oversight of the activities of private companies offering 
military assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market. The 
Working Group also took the opportunity to report on its work towards a possible new 
binding international legal instrument on the regulation of private military and security 
companies to encourage the further protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>  D. Elaborating a draft convention on private military and security 
companies 
</b></p>
<p>54. In its resolution 2005/2, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Working 
Group to monitor and study the effects of the activities of private companies offering 
military assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the 
enjoyment of human rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination, and to 
prepare draft international basic principles that encourage respect for human rights on the 
part of those companies in their activities. The Human Rights Council reiterated this 
request in its resolution 7/21. 
</p>
<p>55. In March 2009, in its resolution 10/11, the Human Rights Council requested the 
Working Group to consult with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, 
academic institutions and experts on the content and scope of a possible draft convention on 
private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and other military security-
related services on the international market, and an accompanying model law, and other 
legal instruments, and to share with Member States, through the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, elements for a possible draft convention on 
private military and security companies, to request their input on the content and scope of 
such a convention and to transmit their replies to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>56. Pursuant to the request of the Human Rights Council, the Working Group, on the 
basis of extensive consultations with Governments, academics and non-governmental 
organizations, prepared the text of a possible new draft convention to regulate the activities 
of private military and security companies. The Working Group circulated a draft of such a 
convention in July 2009 to more than 250 experts, academics and non-governmental 
organizations. As a result of comments received and discussions with various stakeholders, 
the Working Group prepared a note on the elements for a possible draft convention on 
private military and security companies, which was transmitted in January 2010 to all 
Member States for comment. The Working Group also received input regarding elements of 
a possible draft convention during the regional consultations referred to earlier. 
</p>
<p>57. In total, the Working Group received more than 400 suggestions, amendments, 
proposals and formulations from a wide variety of stakeholders, including Member States, 
international organizations and private military and security companies. At the conclusion 
of this broad and inclusive consultative process, the Working Group presented a draft text 
of a possible convention on private military and security companies to the Human Rights 
Council at its fifteenth session (A/HRC/15/25). The proposed convention is a 
comprehensive text consisting of more than 40 articles. It elaborates not only general 
principles, but further proposes the elements, including definitions and detailed provisions, 
for a legally binding instrument. </p>


<p><b>  IV. Key challenges 
</b></p>
<p>58. Since its establishment in 2005, the Working Group has gained a deeper 
understanding of the impact of mercenary activities on the enjoyment of human rights. It 
has also been able to undertake significant research and analysis to address the rising 
phenomenon of private military and security companies operating around the world. In 
many cases, the question of accountability for human rights violations was the most 
prominent concern. In this regard, the Working Group&#8217;s research and consultations with 
various stakeholders demonstrate that several key challenges remain.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A. Mercenaries: a recurring and evolving phenomenon 
</b></p>
<p>59. As the attempted coup by mercenaries in Equatorial Guinea in 2004 made clear,7 
mercenaries remain active in many parts of the world, with devastating effects on human 
rights and the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>60. Recently, the phenomenon of mercenarism has seen a trend whereby rather than 
being hired to overthrow or undermine Governments, mercenaries have been employed by 
some Governments to suppress opposition movements. For instance, in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, the Government allegedly recruited African and other mercenaries to violently 
suppress peaceful demonstrations. As Government efforts to quash political protests have 
become an armed campaign to put down an opposition movement, it could be argued that 
mercenaries used by the Government and implicated in human rights violations are 
impeding the exercise of the right of the people to self-determination. Such mercenary 
activities to support Government action against civilians demonstrate that mercenarism 
remains a significant threat to human rights.  
</p>
<p>61. In C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, there have been reports of the use of mercenaries by the 
Government to protect itself from opposition movements and to suppress dissent. After 
losing the presidential election of 28 November 2010, the former President refused to leave 
office and allegedly hired Liberian mercenaries to maintain control of the country and to 
attack supporters of the newly-elected President. These mercenaries are reported to have 
been implicated in the killings of hundreds of civilians and, insofar as they were involved in 
supporting Government efforts to bypass the results of democratic elections, impeded the 
right of the people to self-determination.  
</p>
<p>62. The above recent examples highlight the importance of combating mercenarism and 
mercenary-related activities. In this regard, the Working Group urges States to adopt 
national legislation to combat mercenarism and to ratify the International Convention 
against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries. 
</p>
<p><b>  B. Developing an international regulatory framework for private 
military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>63. Owing to the increasing use of private military and security companies by some 
Governments, a number of States are of the opinion that it is necessary to develop an 
international regulatory framework to regulate these companies and have begun discussions 
on the subject in the above-mentioned intergovernmental working group.  
</p>
<p>64. In the process of consulting with various stakeholders with regard to private military 
and security companies, the Working Group has identified the existence of a regulatory gap 
</p>
<p>  
  7 See A/HRC/18/32/Add. 2.<b> </b></p>


<p>and the corresponding need for an international legal instrument to regulate private military 
and security companies. The Working Group remains of the opinion that an international 
regulatory framework should take the form of a new binding international convention on 
private military and security companies, including improved registration, licensing and 
vetting procedures, strengthened national legislation and accountability, and oversight 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group is of the view that international law does not sufficiently 
regulate the activities of private military and security companies. As non-State actors, these 
companies are not directly subject to international human rights obligations. Furthermore, 
company employees cannot usually be considered mercenaries according to the definition 
set out in article 47 of the first Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 
relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, and article 1 of the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries. It is therefore necessary to strengthen and clarify the accountability 
mechanisms for private military and security companies that violate human rights and to 
elaborate more explicitly the obligations of States with regard to them. 
</p>
<p>66. Similarly, the Working Group ascertained that national regulation is insufficient to 
ensure that all private military and security companies are subject to adequate registration, 
monitoring and oversight procedures. The transnational nature of their activities raises 
jurisdictional obstacles as well as practical difficulties for the prosecution of human rights 
abuses at the national level in that a State&#8217;s ability to locate witnesses and collect the 
necessary evidence in another State in order to ensure successful prosecution is limited. 
Only an international convention could sufficiently counter the problem of impunity for 
private military and security companies that violate international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>67. In countries with weak judicial systems or without sufficient national legislative 
mechanisms for prosecuting private military and security companies, an international 
convention would reaffirm the right of victims to an effective remedy, create an obligation 
of mutual legal assistance, and provide an alternative international recourse for those who 
cannot exercise their rights at the national level. 
</p>
<p>68. In addition to analysing the use of private military and security companies by 
Governments, the Working Group examined their use  by international organizations, such 
as the United Nations, which sometimes employs such  companies to facilitate operations in 
conflict areas. The Working Group has requested information from several United Nations 
departments with a view to assessing the extent of the use of private military and security 
companies, the types of activities the United Nations outsources to private contractors, and 
the strength of United Nations regulatory policies and monitoring of private military and 
security companies.8 Drawing on this information and discussions with the Department of 
Safety and Security, the Working Group determined that the United Nations currently lacks 
a firm system-wide policy governing the hiring of such companies. Furthermore, the 
problem of accountability for their conduct becomes more complex in cases where 
international organizations rather than States employ private military and security 
companies. While the United Nations is in the process of developing its policy regarding 
the use of private military and security companies and has sought the guidance of the 
Working Group, the Working Group considers that an international convention would be 
invaluable in strengthening and clarifying the institutional responsibility of international 
organizations, such as the United Nations, for the conduct of private military and security 
companies. An international convention would ensure the establishment of formal, system-
wide policies for registration and oversight of companies and vetting and human rights 
training requirements for employees. 
</p>
<p>  
  8 A/65/325, paras. 30-37. </p>


<p>69. The Working Group is aware of a joint initiative of the Government of Switzerland 
and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The result of this initiative, the 
Montreux Document on pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for 
States related to operations of private military and security companies during armed 
conflict, was finalized in September 2008 and has been endorsed by 36 States.9 The 
Montreux Document underlines the existing international legal framework that applies to 
private military and security companies in armed conflict. It also lists good practices, 
including transparent registration and licensing procedures and mechanisms to improve 
accountability and oversight. It also makes clear, however, that these good practices are in 
no way binding obligations. 
</p>
<p>70. The Working Group has welcomed this effort to clarify States&#8217; commitments to 
international law and good practices, and considers the Montreux Document useful in 
recalling existing obligations of States under international human rights and international 
humanitarian law. In particular, the Working Group agrees with the principle, highlighted 
in the document, that although Governments may choose to outsource certain functions to 
private military and security companies, States retain their obligations under international 
human rights and humanitarian law. the Working Group believes, however, that the 
Montreux Document fails to address the regulatory gap in the responsibility of States vis-&#224;-
vis the conduct of such companies and their employees as it presents no assurance of 
enforceability of its good practices or the accountability of the endorsing States for the 
companies&#8217; conduct.10 
</p>
<p>71. Building on the foundations of the Montreux Document, which clarified the 
responsibilities of States in relation to the use of private military and security companies in 
armed conflict, the private military and security industry, with the support of the 
Government of Switzerland, developed the International Code of Conduct for Private 
Security Service Providers in November 2010.11 The Code establishes a common set of 
principles for private military and security companies that commits signatory companies to 
provide security services in accordance with the rule of law, respect for human rights and 
the interests of their clients.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group has supported fully these efforts to clarify good practices and 
improve and formalize industry self-regulation as a means of protecting human rights. The 
Working Group recognizes the valuable contributions of the Montreux Document and the 
International Code of Conduct to the efforts to develop an international regulatory 
framework for private military and security companies.  However, the Working Group 
disputes assertions by some States and companies that these efforts, and the existing 
national and international legislative frameworks cited therein, are sufficient to ensure the 
accountability of these companies for human rights violations. Rather, the Working Group 
believes that these voluntary, non-binding instruments cannot provide the full extent of 
regulation and oversight necessary to comprehensively protect human rights in the context 
of private military and security activities. Nonetheless, it envisions that these initiatives will 
effectively complement a binding international legal instrument, such as the proposed draft 
convention discussed at the first session of the intergovernmental working group in May 
</p><p>2011.

<p> </p>


<p><b>  C.  Encouraging States to adopt national legislation on private 
military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>73. Although an international regulatory framework is to be developed over the next few 
years, national measures will be critical to ensure effective regulation of private military 
and security companies. This is envisaged in the draft convention, which provides that 
States parties should establish a comprehensive domestic regime of regulation and 
oversight over the activities in its territory of private military and security companies and 
their personnel, including all foreign personnel, in order to prohibit and investigate illegal 
activities as defined by the convention and by relevant national laws. 
</p>
<p>74. Very few States have adopted national legislation on private military and security 
companies; some States have even excluded the possibility of adoption of national 
legislation and favoured self-regulation by the industry instead. For instance, the 
Government of the United Kingdom announced in Parliament in March 2011 that it would 
seek to establish a code of conduct setting out national standards derived from the 
International Code of Conduct, and to monitor and audit compliance of private military and 
security companies based in the United Kingdom. However, the Government does not 
consider it necessary to pass legislation to regulate private military and security companies. 
</p>
<p>75. While there is currently no specific international requirement that States should 
adopt national legislation on private military and security companies, the Working Group 
recommends that States adopt such legislation, particularly when they are contracting 
States, States on whose territory such companies operate or States on whose territory these 
companies are established. It recalls that States have international legal obligations relating 
to private military and security companies and that the most effective way for States to 
implement such obligations is through the adoption of legislation. 
</p>
<p>76. Drawing from the experience of its many country visits, the Working Group reached 
the conclusion that it is only through comprehensive national legislation that States can 
ensure adequate monitoring and oversight over the activities of private military and security 
companies. Such legislation should address such specific issues as vetting of companies and 
employees, licensing, training requirements, regular reporting and monitoring, regular 
audits and/or inspections, complaints mechanisms and so on.  
</p>
<p>77. The adoption of national legislation is of course only a first step towards the 
establishment of a comprehensive domestic regime of regulation and oversight over the 
activities of private military and security companies. Even where States have adopted 
specific legislation to address the phenomenon of private military and security companies, 
they have encountered challenges in the implementation of such legislation. As is discussed 
below, prosecutions under the legislation have proved especially difficult for a variety of 
reasons. 
</p>
<p><b>  D.  Holding private military and security companies accountable for 
human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>78. The purpose of efforts to develop an international regulatory framework for private 
military and security companies and national regimes of regulation is ultimately to prevent 
human rights violations and ensure the accountability of the companies and individuals 
involved in such violations when they occur. The Working Group has noted, however, that 
prosecutions of these companies and their employees remain rare. Prosecutions have 
proved difficult for a variety of reasons, such as jurisdictional issues when the company 
was operating as part of, or in the context of, the military forces deployed to a country, lack 
of detailed and consistent reporting of incidents involving the companies, and difficulties in 
the collection of evidence, compounded by the fact that incidents often occur in conflict 
areas. In States where private military and security companies are operating, issues such as </p>


<p>claims by the companies that their employees are immune from jurisdiction and the general 
weakness in capacity and rule of law in the countries where they  operate further 
compromise accountability. 
</p>
<p>79. As a first step towards resolving these issues, States should adopt national 
legislation that would allow their courts to exercise jurisdiction over their own nationals 
and companies established in their territory and operating abroad. States should develop 
mechanisms to facilitate reporting of human rights violations involving private military and 
security companies by various stakeholders, including Governments, non-governmental 
organizations, companies and victims. This information should be shared with the 
Governments of home States and territorial States. Drawing from its experience of 
conducting country missions, the Working Group believes it may be useful to establish 
specific units responsible for the investigation and prosecution of violations of national law 
by private military and security companies. Such units should be staffed by experienced 
prosecutors and investigators and be adequately resourced. 
</p>
<p>80. As evidence and witnesses are often located in a different jurisdiction, prosecutors 
and investigators should have access to them or at least be able to benefit from the 
cooperation of their counterparts in the relevant country. To this end, States could explore 
means of international cooperation with a view to setting up coordination and cooperation 
mechanisms for the investigation of alleged violations of human rights. States should 
ensure that such cooperative investigations are conducted so that any evidence and 
testimony acquired is admissible in national courts. 
</p>
<p>81. While it is important that private military and security companies be held 
accountable for their actions, it is equally important that victims be able to exercise their 
right to an effective remedy; this would include the right to access to mechanisms to 
provide compensation for wrongful deaths or injuries caused by private military and 
security companies, as well as rehabilitation for injuries sustained. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>82.</b> <b>From its country visits, communications and consultations with Governments, 
non-governmental organizations, industry representatives and academic experts, the 
Working Group found that mercenary activities continue to have an adverse impact 
on the enjoyment of human rights. The increasing use of private military and security 
companies around the world and the lack of accountability for human rights 
violations in connection with their activities is of significant concern. In this regard, 
the Working Group is of the opinion that a binding international regulatory 
instrument, such as an international convention, is essential to ensure accountability 
for human rights and an effective remedy for victims.  
</b></p>
<p><b>83. The problem of mercenaries remains a relevant and important consideration. 
Recent events have proven that, whether they are utilized to overthrow Governments 
or employed by Governments to suppress dissent, mercenaries continue to pose a risk 
to human rights and to the right of peoples to self-determination. In this regard, the 
Working Group is concerned by the fact that only 32 States are parties to the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries, and therefore makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  All States should condemn and take steps to combat the use of 
mercenaries on their territories and to prevent the recruitment of their nationals as 
mercenaries, including through the adoption of appropriate legislation and policies;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  Those States that have signed but not ratified the International 
Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries </b></p>


<p><b>should do so as soon as possible, and those countries which are not yet party to the 
Convention should consider acceding to it.  
</b></p>
<p><b>84. The trend towards the privatization of many functions traditionally performed 
by States, including military assistance operations, domestic security and policing, 
poses an increasing risk to human rights. During its country visits, sessions and expert 
meetings, the Working Group engaged in consultations with a range of stakeholders 
to exchange views regarding the impact on human rights of private military and 
security companies and approaches to effective regulation of their activities. The 
Working Group found that insufficient attention is paid to the problems raised by the 
activities of private military and security companies and that further research is 
needed into the impact on human rights of their activities and effective regulatory 
strategies. In this regard, the Working Group makes the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  The Working Group welcomes efforts to clarify obligations under 
international law and identify good practices, such as the Montreux Document</b> <b>on 
pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for States related to 
operations of private military and security companies during armed conflict, and 
industry self-regulation initiatives such as the International Code of Conduct for 
Private Security Service Providers. However, the Working Group reiterates its view 
that a comprehensive, legally binding international regulatory instrument is necessary 
to ensure adequate protection of human rights. The Working Group therefore 
encourages all States to study carefully the draft convention that it proposes and to 
participate actively in the work of the intergovernmental working group established 
by the Human Rights Council with a view to supporting the drafting of an 
international instrument for the regulation of private military and security 
companies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  States should adopt national legislation regulating private military and 
security companies and should ensure its effective implementation. Such legislation 
should, at a minimum, require licensing, registration, vetting, human rights training, 
Government oversight and regular monitoring, and provide for civil and criminal 
responsibility in the event of human rights violations;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  States that contract private military and security companies should 
ensure investigation and prosecution of violations of international human rights law 
involving private military and security companies to guarantee accountability for 
human rights violations and provide an effective remedy for victims. 
</b></p>
<p><b>85. The Working Group makes the following general recommendations to States 
regarding the performance of its mandate: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  All States should continue to cooperate with the Working Group in the 
fulfilment of its mandate by, inter alia, extending invitations to the Working Group to
