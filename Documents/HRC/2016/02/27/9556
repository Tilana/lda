<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, Walter K&#228;lin, visited C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 17 to 24 April 2006 at the invitation of the 
Ivorian authorities. 
</p>
<p> The main purpose of the mission was to gain a better understanding of the situation of 
internally displaced persons in that country with a view to improving the protection of their 
human rights.  During his stay, the Representative of the Secretary-General met with the 
President, the Minister of National Reconciliation and Relations with Institutions, the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Solidarity and War Victims, and the Minister of 
Reconstruction and Reintegration.  He also met with representatives of specialized agencies and 
other bodies of the United Nations system and with those of many other organizations working 
with internally displaced persons.  The Representative of the Secretary-General visited 
Yamoussoukro, Guiglo, Daloa, San-P&#233;dro, Tabou and Bouak&#233;. 
</p>
<p> The main causes of population displacements in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire today are related to the 
conflict that broke out in September 2002.  The population not only fled the areas of conflict but 
also fled from inter-community conflicts, mostly in the &#8220;zone of confidence&#8221;.  In addition to a 
general sense of insecurity in relation to political developments, fear of reprisals from one of the 
two parties to the conflict, the dismantling of the public administration and the destruction of 
infrastructure in the area controlled by the Forces Nouvelles and in the zone of confidence, the 
economic consequences of the conflict have also led to displacement.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General was told about displacements that took place between October 2002 and 
March 2003 in Abidjan following the destruction of some poor districts.  He is concerned about 
the continuing displacement of people in the west and south of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire as a result of 
persisting conflicts over land. 
</p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General estimates the number of internally displaced 
persons at between half a million and 1 million people.  It is interesting to note that only a small 
number of displaced persons are housed in camps or shelters:  most of them have been taken in 
by families, which shows the generosity and solidarity of the Ivorian people. 
</p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General welcomes the fact that the authorities are 
taking the plight of internally displaced persons seriously, but notes that the protection of the 
human rights of this particularly vulnerable group in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is in crisis.  Everyone he met 
described the dire poverty in which they were living.  The information received is particularly 
alarming in that it confirms how difficult it is for displaced persons to fully enjoy their rights to 
food, health care and education.  Their lack of resources and, often, of identity papers limits their 
access to social and educational services.  The people questioned also said that some displaced 
persons, especially single women, turned to prostitution to escape encroaching poverty.  
Displaced persons were also the victims of racketeering and corruption and were unable to fully 
exercise their right to freedom of movement.  The Representative of the Secretary-General 
believes there is a risk that the dire poverty in which many internally displaced persons find 
themselves will get worse unless a proper government policy is put in place, particularly as the 
host families, who have been dealing with the situation for the last three years, begin to show 
signs of fatigue. </p>

</p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General calls on the Government and all the parties 
concerned to assume their responsibilities with a view to finding just and lasting solutions to the 
problems faced by internally displaced persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in accordance with their 
obligations under international human rights law and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>Main recommendations 
</b></p>
<p> The Representative of the Secretary-General believes there is an urgent need to address 
the problems facing internally displaced persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and recommends that the 
Government, in cooperation with the international community, should: 
</p>
<p> (a) Draw up a political strategy and national plan of action on internal displacement, 
covering all categories of displaced persons without discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (b) Establish a mechanism to coordinate the work of the various institutions dealing 
with displacement-related issues, which could also serve as a focal point for, and interface with, 
the international community; 
</p>
<p> (c) Take the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of displaced persons, particularly 
in the west of the country, by assigning the necessary military personnel to the task, making sure 
that those responsible for violating the rights of displaced persons are brought to justice, and 
helping those displaced persons who so wish to settle, even temporarily, in areas where their 
safety can be guaranteed; 
</p>
<p> (d) Ensure that displaced persons have access to humanitarian assistance, particularly 
health care and education services, without discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (e) Take the necessary steps to help internally displaced persons to recover their 
property and possessions, or compensate them appropriately; 
</p>
<p> (f) Ensure the full participation of displaced persons at every stage of the electoral 
process now under way; 
</p>
<p> (g) Pay special attention, as a matter of urgency, to the land issue, particularly in the 
west and south of the country; 
</p>
<p> (h) Organize campaigns to raise awareness of the human rights of internally displaced 
persons, and provide training in those rights for, in particular, the defence and security forces and 
local officials, on the basis of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons made an official visit to 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 17 to 24 April 2006.  In accordance with his mandate, the purpose of the visit 
was to engage in dialogue with the Government, civil society and all other relevant actors with a 
view to improving the protection of the human rights of internally displaced persons.  The main 
aim of the Representative of the Secretary-General was to gain a better understanding of the 
situation and the challenges facing displaced persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and to explore with the 
government authorities sustainable rights-based solutions to the problem of internal displacement 
in the country.  He also tried to strengthen the partnerships between the various actors concerned 
with this issue so that they could take coordinated and effective action.  At the end of his 
mission, the Representative of the Secretary-General shared his preliminary conclusions and 
recommendations with the government authorities and members of the United Nations country 
team. 
</p>
<p>2. During his stay in Abidjan, the Representative of the Secretary-General met with 
President Gbagbo and other government officials, including the Minister of National 
Reconciliation and Relations with Institutions, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of 
Solidarity and War Victims and the Minister of Reconstruction and Reintegration.  He also met 
with representatives of specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system and 
with those of many other organizations working with displaced persons.  He also visited the 
interior of the country to get a better idea of the difficulties facing internally displaced persons.  
He also visited Yamoussoukro, Guiglo, Daloa, San-P&#233;dro, Tabou and Bouak&#233;.  In the course of 
these visits he met with representatives of the civil service, officials from the specialized 
agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system working on displacement-related issues, 
civil society organizations and internally displaced persons themselves. 
</p>
<p>3. The Representative of the Secretary-General would like to express his deep gratitude to 
the Ivorian Government for its invitation and for organizing the official part of the mission at 
very short notice.  He would also like to thank the members of the United Nations Operation in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI), particularly its Human Rights Division, and the Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), for their help in organizing the mission.  Lastly, 
he would like to express his deep gratitude to all the displaced persons who were kind enough to 
share their experiences with him. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative of the Secretary-General would like to remind the Ivorian State of its 
duty to protect all the rights of displaced persons in accordance with the provisions of treaties 
and customary law and the guarantees that are applicable to them and to everyone else living in 
its territory.  Displaced persons do not lose the rights enjoyed by the rest of the population just 
because they have been displaced.  Such rights are set out in detail in the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement (&#8220;the Guiding Principles&#8221;), which have been recognized by States as an 
important international framework for the protection of internally displaced persons.  States have 
undertaken to apply them when dealing with situations of internal displacement.<b>1</b>  The 
conclusions and recommendations contained in this report are based on the Guiding Principles 
and the guarantees under international law from which they are derived. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>5. In accordance with Principle 3, national authorities have the primary duty and 
responsibility to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons 
within their jurisdiction, and such persons have the right to request and to receive protection and 
humanitarian assistance.  The Representative of the Secretary-General would like to stress that in 
cases where the authorities do not have the means to fulfil their obligations towards displaced 
persons, either for lack of resources or because they do not control the entire territory, they have 
a responsibility to call on others, especially the specialized agencies and other bodies of the 
United Nations system, for assistance. 
</p>
<p>6. At the same time, the principles also apply to non-State actors who effectively control 
part of the territory, when the rights of displaced persons are affected by this situation.  
Principle 2 stipulates that the Principles are to be observed by all groups, irrespective of the 
latter&#8217;s legal status, and are to be applied without any discrimination.  As the Forces Nouvelles 
exercise de facto authority over the northern part of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, they must avoid doing 
anything that might lead to population displacement.  They must, moreover, provide protection 
and assistance to displaced persons in the area under their control and allow people who have 
been displaced from the north of the country to return home if they wish and to do so in safety 
and with dignity. 
</p>
<p>7. The Representative of the Secretary-General would like to stress, as he did in his initial 
report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/84), that the concept of protection is 
not limited to ensuring the survival and physical integrity of displaced persons, but covers all the 
guarantees set out in international human rights law and, where applicable, in international 
humanitarian law, including civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  GENERAL CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  History, causes and extent of internal displacement in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p>8. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is a country with many immigrants, thanks to its economic importance in 
the region and its tradition of immigration.  Indeed, the country&#8217;s first President, 
Houphou&#235;t-Boigny, made welcoming African population groups from the subregion one of his 
flagship policies. 
</p>
<p>9. As far as internal migration is concerned, both foreigners - mainly from 
Burkina Faso - and people of Ivorian origin have often moved around the country in pursuit of 
economic development, particularly to the south-west, where coffee and cocoa cultivation is 
especially well developed. 
</p>
<p>10.  The Representative of the Secretary-General concludes from various discussions he had 
that the causes of population displacement today are basically related to the conflict that broke 
out in September 2002.  According to the information he received, displacement has many 
complex causes.  First, people have fled areas of conflict following attacks on military facilities 
in Abidjan, Bouak&#233; and Korhogo.  The Representative of the Secretary-General was also 
informed about displacements that occurred between October 2002 and March 2003 in Abidjan 
after the destruction of some of the poorest districts there.<b>2</b>  In the west of the country and in the 
&#8220;zone of confidence&#8221;, which are under the control of the neutral forces of Operation Licorne and 
UNOCI, inter-community conflicts are also a cause of population displacement.  The </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 7 
 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General notes, moreover, that a general sense of insecurity with 
regard to political developments, fear of reprisals from one of the two parties to the conflict, the 
dismantling of the public administration and the destruction of infrastructure in the area 
controlled by the Forces Nouvelles and in the zone of confidence, as well as the economic 
consequences of the conflict, are at the root of some of the more recent cases of displacement. 
</p>
<p>11. Many observers have drawn attention to the land-related conflicts that have given rise to 
a large number of displacements, especially in the west, a highly agricultural area.  Many people 
are reported to have been chased from their homes in the Moyen Cavally region since 2003, 
often by gangs of youths or by village or ethnic-based self-defence committees.  Recent events in 
late 2004 and in 2005 have also given rise to displacements in the regions of Guiglo, Blolequin 
and Du&#233;kou&#233;.  In this region, the land issue continues to give rise to further displacements 
following inter-community clashes and criminal attacks.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General also observed that, while the recent crisis in the country has had an impact on 
internal displacement, especially as a result of political groups exploiting the problem for 
political ends, the land issue and subsequent inter-community conflicts predate the crisis. 
</p>
<p>12. The Representative of the Secretary-General shares the view of many experts that it is 
difficult to establish precisely how many internally displaced persons there are in the country.  
The estimates he received range from half a million to 1 million people.  A study carried out 
recently by the National School of Statistics and Applied Economics, in cooperation with the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), is a useful starting point for estimating the number 
of displaced persons and their needs in terms of assistance and protection.  According to the 
study, which is based on a survey in only five departments (Abidjan, Daloa, Du&#233;kou&#233;, Toul&#233;pleu 
and Yamoussoukro), the number of people displaced in these departments is 709,377, of whom 
52 per cent are women.<b>3</b>  The Representative of the Secretary-General has received no 
information that would enable him to estimate the number of displaced persons in the areas 
under the control of the Forces Nouvelles. 
</p>
<p>13. The Representative of the Secretary-General notes with interest that only a small number 
of displaced persons are housed in camps or shelters; most of them are in Guiglo, where there are 
two centres that hold about 7,100 people.  Most of the displaced persons - about 98 per cent of 
them - have been taken in by families, which shows the generosity and solidarity of the Ivorian 
people.  However, their social integration complicates the job of monitoring and assisting 
displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human rights overview 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Ivorian Constitution of 1 August 2000 gives great prominence to the protection of 
human rights and public freedoms.  The preamble recognizes C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s ethnic, cultural and 
religious diversity and states that the Ivorian people is &#8220;persuaded that unity with respect for 
diversity will ensure economic progress and social well-being&#8221;.  The principle of the equality of 
persons is established in article 2 of the Constitution, which also stipulates that human rights are 
inviolate and that the authorities have the obligation to ensure that they are respected, protected 
and promoted.  This article echoes Principle 5, according to which all authorities must respect 
their obligations under international law, including human rights and humanitarian law. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>15. Under article 87 of the Constitution of 1 August 2000, international treaties or 
agreements take precedence over domestic law.  Under article 86, in the event of a conflict 
between a provision of international law and the Constitution, the Constitution must be revised 
before the agreement in question can be ratified. 
</p>
<p>16. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has ratified the main international human rights instruments, namely, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1992), the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1992), the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1973), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (1996), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1996), and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child (1991).  Although C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire hosts more immigrants than any other country in the 
subregion, it has not yet ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  It has signed but not yet ratified the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>17. At the regional level, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has ratified the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights and has signed the protocol thereto concerning the establishment of the African 
Court on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (2003). 
</p>
<p>18. As to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire&#8217;s obligations towards the bodies responsible for monitoring 
implementation of the conventions it has ratified, it appears that it has not yet submitted its initial 
reports to the Committee against Torture, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women or the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights; nor has it submitted its second and third periodic reports to the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child.  C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire did submit a report to the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination in 2002. 
</p>
<p>19. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has not issued any open invitation to the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights.  In 2004, the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited the country and submitted their 
reports to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session.  In 2005, the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture submitted a request for a visit, but the authorities have not 
yet replied. 
</p>
<p>20. As for its obligations under humanitarian law, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is a party to the four 
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the additional protocols thereto of 8 June 1977. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p>21. Since the beginning of the crisis in 2002, the political situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been 
marked by instability, insecurity and human rights violations.  The peace process that got under 
way in January 2003 was supposed to lead to elections in October 2005, but it proved impossible 
to organize the elections as planned.  According to the UNOCI report on the human rights 
situation covering the period between August and December 2005,<b>4</b> the political environment 
was particularly tense in the area under government control because of uncertainty over </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>President Gbagbo&#8217;s mandate, which was due to end on 30 October 2005.<b>5</b>  It is reported that the 
defence and security forces have often used excessive force, sometimes leading to the death of 
suspected bandits.  Individuals considered to be &#8220;rebels&#8221;, or suspected of collaborating with 
&#8220;rebels&#8221;, have been tortured, and both the defence and security forces and armed groups have 
carried out summary executions.  The action of self-defence groups and militias has also helped 
sustain a climate of fear and insecurity. 
</p>
<p>22. There have been reports of violations of the right to life and physical integrity, 
particularly in the form of torture or ill-treatment, in the area under the control of the Forces 
Nouvelles.  The UNOCI report refers to a fall in the number of arrests for infiltration during this 
period, but notes the resurgence of inter-community conflicts and an increase in the number of 
rapes of minors and forced marriages. 
</p>
<p>23. The UNOCI report gives no specific information about the zone of confidence, but the 
Representative of the Secretary-General was told about security problems and particular 
difficulties linked to the absence of State bodies, particularly the judiciary. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Future prospects 
</b></p>
<p>24. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is today at a crossroads, and some recent developments suggest there is 
hope for an early end to the crisis.  This hope rests mainly on the holding of elections in the 
coming months and on the implementation of identification programmes and the National 
Programme for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration. 
</p>
<p>25. The Representative of the Secretary-General is nevertheless concerned about certain 
points, particularly the simultaneous organization of the disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration process and the identification process, on which positions are firmly entrenched.  In 
addition, the proliferation of weapons - especially weapons of war - the growing number of 
militias, especially in the west, and the gangs of youths espousing hate speech and violence pose 
challenges that must be met if a lasting solution is to be found. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RESPONSES TO INTERNAL DISPLACEMENT IN C&#212;TE D&#8217;IVOIRE 
A.  Response by the national authorities 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Representative of the Secretary-General welcomes the fact that the authorities are 
taking the situation of internally displaced persons and the problems they face seriously, but is 
concerned that their attitude is not matched by adequate measures. 
</p>
<p>27. The assistance provided after the events in 2002 and the establishment of the Ministry of 
Solidarity and War Victims and the Ministry of National Reconciliation demonstrate the 
Government&#8217;s willingness to tackle the problems of this particularly vulnerable population 
group.  The Ministry of Solidarity and War Victims has planned to set up the following bodies to 
implement its policy: 
</p>
<p> (a) A solidarity and humanitarian action unit, whose mission is to provide emergency 
relief to those rendered vulnerable by the war; </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> (b) The Reintegration Assistance Guarantee Fund, which is supposed to fund 
income-generating activities for war victims; 
</p>
<p> (c) The National Commission on War Victims, which would advise the Government 
and make proposals; 
</p>
<p> (d) The National Commission on Compensation for War Victims, which would be 
responsible for implementing an as yet unadopted law on compensation. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the information sent to the Representative of the Secretary-General, these 
commissions have not yet been able to start work because the Ministry lacks the necessary 
resources.  Moreover, as the law on compensation has not yet been adopted, it has not been 
possible to implement government policy in this area. 
</p>
<p>29. The Ministry of Reconstruction and Reintegration is responsible for a number of tasks 
that might have an impact on displaced population groups, particularly when they return to their 
place of origin.  The Representative of the Secretary-General is in favour of programmes that 
encourage communities to live side by side in peace, and stresses that for them to be effective 
they need to be implemented in cooperation with the other parties concerned, including the 
Ministry of Solidarity. 
</p>
<p>30. The Representative of the Secretary-General was told that the Government had recently 
set up a forum for consultations on humanitarian issues, including the question of internal 
displacement, under the auspices of the Office of the Prime Minister, but he was also told that 
the forum rarely meets. 
</p>
<p>31. The Representative of the Secretary-General notes that, despite the seriousness with 
which the authorities view the situation of internally displaced persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and the 
difficulties facing them, and despite the Government&#8217;s willingness to tackle the problems of this 
particularly vulnerable population group, this determination is not backed up by adequate 
measures.  He is particularly concerned about the lack of a comprehensive strategy and action 
plan for dealing with these issues and about the failure to provide the funding needed to improve 
the situation of displaced persons.  The Representative of the Secretary-General also notes the 
central Government&#8217;s lack of support for local authorities, which are sometimes barely aware of 
the situation of displaced persons in their locality. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Response by the international community 
</b></p>
<p>32. From the beginning of the Ivorian crisis, the international community, and particularly 
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has made a determined effort to 
find a lasting solution to the crisis.  Following the May 2003 ceasefire agreement between the 
Ivorian armed forces and rebel forces, the Security Council adopted resolution 1479 (2003) 
establishing the United Nations Mission in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (MINUCI), with a mandate to facilitate 
the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, and including a military component 
complementing the operations of the French and ECOWAS forces.  In February 2004, MINUCI 
was replaced by a United Nations peacekeeping mission, UNOCI, whose mandate in the area of 
humanitarian assistance is &#8220;to facilitate the free flow of people, goods and humanitarian 
assistance, inter alia, by helping to establish the necessary security conditions&#8221;.<b>6</b> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>33. The main international agreements adopted since the beginning of the crisis do not refer 
specifically to the issue of internally displaced persons.<b>7</b>  The same is true of the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, except for resolution 1479 (2003), which stresses the importance of 
the return of internally displaced persons for the process of reconstruction. 
</p>
<p>34. At the level of the humanitarian agencies, the Representative of the Secretary-General 
was informed that the humanitarian organizations present in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire have provided 
emergency assistance to displaced persons, mostly to those in camps and shelters, since the 
beginning of the crisis.  In July 2005, they set up a protection network that brought together the 
members of the United Nations country team and other specialized agencies and 
non-governmental organizations, under the leadership of the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).<b>8</b>  The aim of the protection network is to provide a more 
coherent response to the civilian population&#8217;s need for protection.  The issue of displaced 
persons is one of the protection network&#8217;s priorities.  The network has also drawn up a strategy 
and action plan for international organizations for the protection of displaced persons.  The 
Representative of the Secretary-General notes that members of the protection network are aware 
of the need to adapt their strategy to the specific needs of displaced persons and that a number of 
actions have been planned for this purpose, including a survey of the needs of displaced persons, 
the dissemination of the Guiding Principles and consultation with displaced persons.  However, 
the Representative of the Secretary-General considers that, apart from the assistance provided for 
the people housed in camps and shelters, these actions are not very coherent, and that there are 
major gaps in protection and assistance for the most vulnerable displaced persons, who, even if 
they are living with host families, are in real need of assistance.  He encourages members of the 
protection network to produce a specific strategy covering every phase of displacement - 
prevention, protection during displacement, and lasting solutions for displacement - and defining 
clear objectives and practical actions. 
35. During the visit by the Representative of the Secretary-General, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was given a protection mandate for 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire as part of the reform of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.  In this capacity, 
UNHCR will coordinate the protection of displaced persons.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General fully supports UNHCR in its implementation of this new task.  He would 
suggest that, as a first step, UNHCR should conduct a needs-assessment mission before taking 
any action.  A greater knowledge of the situation of displaced persons will make it possible 
subsequently to draw up a coherent and comprehensive strategy to meet the challenges posed by 
the internal displacement of the population in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p>36. The particularly volatile political situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire makes it difficult for the 
humanitarian organizations in the field to work effectively.  The events of January 2006, when 
United Nations agencies were attacked by young patriots demonstrating against what they saw as 
a decision by the International Working Group on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to &#8220;dissolve&#8221; the National 
Assembly, clearly demonstrate the unsafe environment in which humanitarian agencies have to 
work.  The Representative of the Secretary-General notes with satisfaction, therefore, 
President Gbagbo&#8217;s announcement that he intends to take the necessary steps to enable 
humanitarian organizations to do their job of providing assistance to the population, particularly </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>in the Guiglo region, which was hardest hit by the events in January.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General is concerned, however, that the authorities do not seem to be taking adequate 
measures to prosecute those responsible for the above-mentioned attacks and to compensate the 
organizations concerned for the damage suffered. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  PROTECTION OF DISPLACED PERSONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Protection against displacement 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Representative of the Secretary-General observed during his mission that people 
continue to be displaced in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, particularly in the south-west, which is under 
government control, and in the west of the zone of confidence, which is under the control of 
neutral UNOCI and Licorne forces.  These areas are characterized by high levels of insecurity 
that lead to displacements.  The land issue, which is sometimes related to inter-community 
conflicts, is also a source of insecurity for inhabitants.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General observed that displacements occur in series in these areas, when one 
population group chases away another and is then itself chased away.  In the district of Zouan, 
for example, the people chased out of Zou occupied villages belonging to communities that had 
to flee their homes.  Shortly after the visit by the Representative of the Secretary-General, the 
new arrivals were themselves attacked. 
</p>
<p>38. The lack of resources, both human and material, makes it difficult - especially for 
UNOCI - to deploy troops throughout the 800 km of the zone of confidence.  It is therefore 
recommended that the number of troops be increased so that they can provide effective 
protection for the civilian population in critical areas.  In this respect, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General welcomes the Security Council&#8217;s readiness, in its resolutions 1657 (2006) and 
1667 (2006), to authorize the Secretary-General to deploy additional troops.  The need for a 
police presence and a system for bringing those responsible for criminal acts to justice in the 
absence of a State administration should be the subject of an in-depth analysis.  Lastly, the 
presence of units from the UNOCI Human Rights Division in these areas, particularly in Tabou, 
would make it possible to systematically follow up on cases of human rights violations and 
prevent situations from degenerating to the point where the population is displaced. 
</p>
<p>39. The Representative of the Secretary-General recalls that, under Principle 6, every human 
being has the right to be protected against being arbitrarily displaced from his or her home or 
place of habitual residence, and he calls on the government authorities and neutral forces to do 
everything in their power to avoid further displacements in the areas under their control. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Protection during displacement 
</b></p>
<p>40. Having completed his mission, the Representative of the Secretary-General notes that the 
crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is not a classic humanitarian crisis, although some groups of displaced 
persons are in urgent need of assistance.  According to the information he has collected, 
displaced persons are mainly suffering from problems related to the exercise of their economic 
and social rights.  Everyone he met highlighted the dire poverty in which most of them were 
living.  Although there is little information on the true situation of the 98 per cent of displaced 
persons living in host families, it is clear that these persons and the families that have taken them </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>in are bound to have been affected disproportionately by the problems affecting the Ivorian 
population as a whole.  The information received on the difficulties faced by displaced persons 
with regard to the full enjoyment of their rights to food, health care and education is particularly 
alarming.  Representatives of displaced persons also mentioned that they have already been 
living off their host families in overcrowded houses for several years and that this situation has 
impoverished the families and led to tension between individuals, and is having a negative effect 
on the psychological and social development of children.  Without an adequate government 
policy, the dire circumstances in which a large proportion of displaced persons find themselves 
could get even worse, especially as the host families begin to show signs of fatigue after three 
years of living in this way. 
</p>
<p>41. In this respect, Principle 18 states that all internally displaced persons have the right to an 
adequate standard of living and that, at the minimum, the authorities should provide them with or 
give them access to essential food and potable water, housing, appropriate clothing, and essential 
medical services and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>42. Moreover, the lack of identity papers limits displaced persons&#8217; access to social and 
educational services.  For example, mothers describe how difficult it is to enrol their children in 
school without a birth certificate.  Their lack of identity papers also makes them particularly 
vulnerable to racketeering and corruption. 
</p>
<p>43. With the exception of civil servants who left the north of the country to go to the area 
under government control, many people no longer have access to their job or any 
income-generating activity as a result of their displacement.  The Representative of the 
Secretary-General is sorry to see that few measures have been taken to enable displaced persons 
to look after themselves and at the same time lighten the burden on their host families. 
</p>
<p>44. Infringements of the freedom of movement have also been reported to the Representative 
of the Secretary-General.  Roadblocks are common, and displaced persons without identity 
papers are particularly susceptible to harassment and racketeering when they reach one.  As a 
result, people facing serious economic difficulties cannot always afford to move around. 
</p>
<p>45. With regard to children, over and above the difficulties related to the lack of birth 
certificates, the Representative of the Secretary-General was informed about the problems 
caused by the closure of schools and overcrowding in classes in reception areas.  Cases in which 
displaced children are exploited both for their labour (agriculture, domestic work, night work, 
portering, etc.) and for sexual purposes have been reported.  There have also been reports that 
some of them have been enlisted in armed groups.  In this connection, the Representative of the 
Secretary-General would like to draw the attention of all parties involved in the crisis in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire to the fact that displaced children may in no circumstances be recruited into an 
armed force (Principle 13). 
</p>
<p>46. The people questioned also said that some displaced persons, especially single women, 
turned to prostitution to escape encroaching poverty.  This situation has led to an increasing 
number of gender-related acts of violence.  Some young women told the Representative of the 
Secretary-General that they were reduced to offering sex on credit and that sometimes the men 
refused to pay them what they were owed and hit them when they complained.  Cases of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>domestic violence have also been reported.  The Representative of the Secretary-General wishes 
to draw attention to the heightened risk of sexual abuse as a result of the presence throughout the 
country of large numbers of armed combatants, whether from national forces, the Forces 
Nouvelles or neutral forces. 
</p>
<p>47. The Representative of the Secretary-General is also concerned about the persistence of 
problems related to the physical protection of displaced persons, particularly in regions in the 
west and south of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  Throughout the crisis, in fact, displaced persons who have had 
to flee their regions of origin for, basically, security reasons have been the victims of serious 
human rights violations committed both by the defence and security forces and by rebel or youth 
groups, who often go unpunished.  According to the information received by the Representative 
of the Secretary-General, displaced persons continue to be the victims of numerous violations, 
and cases of targeted assassination, torture and sexual abuse have also been reported.  There have 
also been reports of atrocities during the coffee and cocoa harvest.  It is alleged that displaced 
persons are frequently the victims of extortion and racketeering. 
</p>
<p>48. Like any other human being, displaced persons have an inherent right to life.  According 
to Principle 10, attacks or other acts of violence against internally displaced persons who are not 
participating in hostilities are prohibited in all circumstances.  Moreover, displaced persons must 
be protected in particular against rape, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, and other outrages upon personal dignity, such as acts of gender-specific violence 
(Principle 11). 
</p>
<p>49. The complete absence of State bodies in the zone of confidence and the absence of the 
public administration in the zone under the control of the Forces Nouvelles also have very 
negative consequences for the situation of internally displaced persons, particularly in relation to 
the forthcoming elections. 
</p>
<p>50. In this respect, the Representative of the Secretary-General stresses that displaced 
persons who are citizens of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire must be able to participate fully in the current electoral 
process.  Principle 22 specifies that internally displaced persons have the right to vote and to 
participate in governmental and public affairs, including the right to have access to the means 
necessary to exercise this right.  The Representative of the Secretary-General therefore invites 
the authorities responsible for the elections to take the necessary steps to eliminate the obstacles 
to the participation of displaced persons in the electoral process (documentation, insecurity, 
regulations on where they are entitled to vote, etc.), to provide them with clear, timely 
information, and to ensure that they vote when the time comes. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Protection of internally displaced persons and the search for lasting solutions 
</b></p>
<p>51. According to Principle 28, internally displaced persons have the right to return 
voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, to their home area or to settle in the place to which they 
were displaced or in another part of the country.  Moreover, Principle 29 states that internally 
displaced persons who have returned to their place of habitual residence must be protected 
against any discrimination, and that they have the right to recover their property or else obtain 
compensation. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>52. Experience has shown that the degree of compliance with these provisions has a direct 
impact on the return of displaced persons to their place of habitual residence.  A successful 
return depends basically on three elements:  security, recovery of property and reconstruction of 
homes.  These elements help create a favourable environment for sustainable reintegration, that 
is, one in which living conditions are adequate, including with regard to income-generating 
activities, non-discrimination and participation in community life. 
</p>
<p>53. Everyone who spoke to the Representative of the Secretary-General, particularly 
displaced persons themselves, stressed that all displaced persons would like to return to their 
region of origin.  The Representative of the Secretary-General was unable, however, to collect 
reliable information on the number of people who had already returned to their place of origin.  
In most cases, displaced persons believe that the conditions for their return are not in place, 
especially with regard to security.  Many of the individuals questioned spoke of material 
problems related to their possible return - basically their increasing poverty and problems related 
to the destruction or occupation of their homes in their place of origin.  The total absence of State 
organizations in the zone of confidence and the absence of the government administration in the 
north of the country are also obstacles to return. 
</p>
<p>54. Nevertheless, the Representative of the Secretary-General believes that in some cases 
voluntary return is possible and should be assisted by the authorities, in cooperation with 
humanitarian agencies.  The example of Fengolo, in the district of Du&#233;kou&#233;, demonstrates how, 
in certain situations, arrangements can be made for the return of displaced persons.  In 
March 2005, the Gu&#233;r&#233; inhabitants of the village of Fengolo fled inter-community clashes and 
took refuge in Du&#233;kou&#233;.  Under the Common Humanitarian Action Plan, the humanitarian 
organizations of the national team of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, led by the 
Humanitarian Coordinator, encouraged the deployment of neutral forces in the village to 
stabilize the situation.  They then proceeded to repair the houses and set up an emergency 
agricultural programme and a social cohesion programme, and provided food assistance and 
medical support for the population, which enabled about 975 people to return.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Security 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Representative of the Secretary-General stresses that security is an essential 
component of any lasting solution and is crucial to the return of displaced persons, and that it is 
for the Government to establish the conditions that will allow the voluntary return of displaced 
persons (Principle 28). 
</p>
<p>56. The Representative of the Secretary-General noted during his visit that many of the 
people he talked to linked the security issue with the disarmament of not only the 
Forces Nouvelles but also the militias.  He believes that, although a general solution has yet to be 
found, certain areas are already safe enough for voluntary return.  In some cases, neutral forces 
could help stabilize the situation so as to enable displaced persons to consider returning.  
Generally speaking, the Representative of the Secretary-General recommends a flexible 
case-by-case approach. 
</p>
<p>57. In addition, the problem of reconciling communities should be considered very carefully 
to ensure that the solutions chosen - be they return or something else - are long-term solutions.  
The Representative of the Secretary-General would like to draw attention here to a number of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, concerning the need to &#8220;rebuild community 
coexistence&#8221;, including his recommendations on the possible role of the media in this area.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The land issue and the return of property belonging to displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>58. The problems related to land in rural areas are one of the major challenges facing the 
Ivorian authorities.  This is a complex issue and raises questions about the scarcity of arable 
land, demographic pressures, the economic crisis that dates from the beginning of the 1980s 
following the collapse of coffee and cocoa prices on the world market, and the exploitation of the 
issue for political ends. 
</p>
<p>59. Rural land is governed by the 1998 Rural Land Act,<b>11</b> the prime purpose of which was to 
clarify land rights by providing a legal framework for them and to modernize customary land 
rights.  Under article 1 of the Act, only the State, public authorities and individual C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
nationals can own rural land.  This provision represents a break with the past policy of 
President Houphou&#235;t-Boigny, under which the land belonged to the person cultivating it.  
Against a background of political tension linked to the power struggle, the Act aroused a sense of 
injustice in many non-Ivorian owners, some of whom had been cultivating the land for several 
generations.  They were especially worried that their non-Ivorian descendants would not be able 
to become owners of the land.  In response to their fears, and in implementation of the 
Linas-Marcoussis Agreement, the 1998 Act was modified by a law dated 14 August 2004, under 
which rights to rural land ownership acquired before 2004 can be transmitted to descendants.  
The owners concerned by this derogation must be on a list drawn up by the Council of Ministers.  
At a time when the question of identifying Ivorian citizens is at the heart of the discussions, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General is concerned about the risks that the law will either not 
be applied or will be applied in a discriminatory fashion. 
</p>
<p>60. The authorities have a responsibility to help displaced persons recover their property and 
possessions and, where possible, to provide appropriate compensation or another form of just 
reparation (Principle 29).  The process of adopting legislation to provide a framework for the 
provision of such compensation should be speeded up.  In cases where the property of displaced 
persons is occupied by unauthorized individuals - especially in the north - the necessary steps 
should be taken to enable the property to be returned to them.  In this connection, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General has taken note of the communiqu&#233; from the 
secretary-general of the Forces Nouvelles announcing the establishment of a special committee 
to address this question in territory under the control of the Forces Nouvelles.  All these matters, 
like every other issue related to the situation of displaced people, should be addressed in 
consultation with the people most affected - displaced persons themselves. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Conditions for sustainable return 
</b></p>
<p>61. Although the Representative of the Secretary-General finds that the conditions in certain 
regions are in place for selected returns, he stresses the need for the redeployment of the 
administration throughout the country so that the return of the population to those regions will be 
sustainable. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>62. In addition, there is a need for balanced development in all regions of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
including those from which the population has fled.  The international community should 
provide support for the government authorities to ensure that the return of displaced persons is 
accompanied by ambitious development programmes that will allow their economic 
reintegration. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Although the crisis facing C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire may not be a classic humanitarian crisis, 
the Representative of the Secretary-General considers that the people displaced by the war 
or the conflicts over land in the west of the country are in urgent need of assistance.  He 
calls on the government authorities and all parties concerned to assume their 
responsibilities, in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law 
and humanitarian law, with a view to finding just and lasting solutions to the problems 
faced by internally displaced persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General encourages the parties concerned to 
pursue, with the help of the international community, efforts to find a political solution to 
the Ivorian crisis and invites all the actors involved to take into account the issue of 
displaced persons in this process and to come up with solutions that safeguard their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General welcomes the fact that displaced 
persons in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire are taken in for the most part by host families, which 
demonstrates the solidarity of the Ivorian people.  However, he notes that this situation 
makes it difficult to identify displaced persons, and may thus hamper efforts to provide 
them with assistance and support.  Moreover, after three years of conflict, the 
Representative of the Secretary-General has observed a certain fatigue affecting host 
families. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General believes that a proper policy on 
displaced persons that takes into account all phases of displacement needs to be 
implemented as a matter of urgency, and that a plan of action should be adopted to that 
end. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General recommends that the government 
authorities should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Draw up a political strategy and national plan of action on internal 
displacement that are in conformity with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement 
and that cover all categories of displaced persons without discrimination.  This policy and 
plan of action should cover all phases of displacement, from preventive measures to the 
return and reintegration of displaced persons.  The strategy should be drawn up in 
agreement with all the actors concerned, including displaced persons themselves, and 
should clearly set out institutional and administrative responsibilities.  If necessary, the 
adoption of legislative measures in line with the Guiding Principles should be considered as 
a way of ensuring the implementation of the strategy.  The implementation of the plan of 
action should go hand-in-hand with the mobilization of the resources needed to meet the 
needs identified; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b> (b) Establish a mechanism to coordinate the work of the various institutions 
dealing with displacement-related issues, which could also serve as a focal point for, and 
interface with, the international community; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Cooperate with the international community in efforts to protect the rights of 
displaced persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Act as quickly as possible to identify displaced persons and assess their 
needs, to produce an overview of their situation and enable the appropriate policies to be 
adopted.  In particular, the Representative of the Secretary-General suggests that a study 
should be made of the displaced population in the north and east of the country, to 
complement the study carried out by government authorities in cooperation with the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); 
 (e) Take the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of displaced persons, 
particularly in the west of the country, by assigning the necessary military personnel to the 
task, making sure that those responsible for violating the rights of displaced persons are 
brought to justice, and helping those displaced persons who so wish to settle, even 
temporarily, in areas where their safety can be guaranteed.  A particular effort should be 
made at harvest time, as experience has shown that many attacks on individuals and 
property take place at this time.  Illegal roadblocks should be dismantled as quickly as 
possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Ensure that displaced persons have access to humanitarian assistance, 
particularly health care and education services, without discrimination.  The authorities 
are encouraged to give priority, as far as possible, to displaced persons when allocating 
budget resources, to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers and to consider 
adopting provisional measures, particularly for individuals without identity papers and 
children without birth certificates; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Take the necessary steps to help internally displaced persons to recover their 
property and possessions, or compensate them appropriately.  The process of adopting and 
implementing the law on compensation for war victims, in accordance with the Guiding 
Principles, should be speeded up, so as to provide a legal framework for such 
compensation.  In addition, information campaigns should be organized to publicize the 
measures taken to facilitate the return of property; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure the full participation of displaced persons at every stage of the 
electoral process now under way, including by making a concerted effort to identify people.  
The attention of the Independent Electoral Commission should be drawn to this question; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Pay special attention, as a matter of urgency, to the land issue, particularly in 
the west and south of the country.  In addition to legislative steps, information campaigns 
on, for example, ways to resolve conflicts over property should be organized; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Pay particular attention to the situation of women and children, who are a 
particularly vulnerable group within the displaced population, on the basis of, among other </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>things, the UNHCR May 2003 guidelines for the prevention of and response to sexual and 
gender-based violence against refugees, returnees and internally displaced persons; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Organize campaigns to raise awareness of the human rights of internally 
displaced persons, and provide training in those rights for, in particular, the defence and 
security forces and local authorities, on the basis of the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Facilitate, in cooperation with the international community, the return, in 
safety and with dignity, of displaced persons who so wish to their home area. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General recommends that the Forces Nouvelles 
should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Take steps to identify the displaced persons and/or returnees in the areas 
under their control; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Take the necessary measures to create a climate conducive to the return of 
displaced persons to the areas under their control.  In this respect, the Representative of 
the Secretary-General encourages the Forces Nouvelles to take the necessary measures to 
return the property belonging to displaced persons.  A campaign to inform displaced 
persons about the measures taken could be organized in cooperation with the Ministry of 
Solidarity and with international partners. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Representative of the Secretary-General recommends that the United Nations, 
humanitarian and development organizations and donors should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Support the government authorities in formulating and implementing a 
political strategy and plan of action to address the needs of displaced persons from both a 
humanitarian and a human rights perspective; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen protection activities for displaced persons, particularly in the 
context of the mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees in the field of protection, by strengthening the protection network and 
establishing an office of the UNOCI Human Rights Division in San-P&#233;dro and in Tabou; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Take the appropriate steps to improve the physical safety of displaced 
persons, particularly in the zone of confidence, by deploying more personnel.  A 
broadening of the mandate of UNOCI should also be considered; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Improve coordination between humanitarian organizations in order to 
respond in a more comprehensive and effective way to the identified needs of displaced 
persons, and particularly the most vulnerable among them, including those lodging with 
host families;

<p><b> (e) Provide suitable financial support for protection and humanitarian 
assistance for the most vulnerable categories of displaced persons; </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/38/Add.2

</p>
<p><b> (f) Provide substantial support for efforts to find a lasting solution to conflicts 
over land. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> Lastly, the Representative of the Secretary-General calls on the Government, the 
United Nations and all donors to cooperate with civil society organizations working on 
internal displacement issues and with displaced persons themselves, to ensure that their 
voices can be heard.</b>
