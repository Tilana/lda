<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Guinea was held at the 3rd meeting on 20 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Guinea was headed by Khalifa Gassama Diaby, Minister 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights and Civil Liberties. At its 10th meeting, held on 23 January 2015, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group adopted the report on Guinea. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guinea: Albania, Bangladesh and the Congo. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Guinea: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/GIN/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GIN/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GIN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, 
</p>
<p>Slovenia, Spain and the United States of America was transmitted to Guinea through the 
</p>
<p>troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of the Republic of Guinea began by saying that, while committed to 
</p>
<p>the democratization process and building a society that respected human rights, the country 
</p>
<p>lacked a democratic tradition and truly democratic institutional experience. It went on to 
</p>
<p>say that the matter of basing institutions on democratic principles so as to allow the State to 
</p>
<p>better address its obligation to promote and protect human rights remained an absolute 
</p>
<p>necessity and priority.  
</p>
<p>6. Noting that the universal periodic review (UPR) provided an excellent opportunity 
</p>
<p>to objectively analyse human rights developments, the delegation thanked all the countries 
</p>
<p>that had helped it to make progress in that area through the recommendations made in 2010. 
</p>
<p>Noting that those recommendations had been made at a time of political instability and 
</p>
<p>transition to democracy, the delegation said that, since the inauguration of the third 
</p>
<p>republic, the Government had made considerable efforts with regard to the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, especially in terms of implementing UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>Thus, for the first time in the country&#8217;s history, a ministry responsible for the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and public liberties had been appointed in Guinea. 
</p>
<p>7. In the areas of justice and defence, the delegation said that reforms had been 
</p>
<p>undertaken, including the creation of a national committee to manage the reform of the 
</p>
<p>justice sector; the establishment of the Supreme Council of Justice; the promulgation of the 
</p>
<p>law on the status of judges; the ongoing review of the Code of Military Justice, the Code of </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.15-07505 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure, the Criminal Code and the Civil Code; the forthcoming entry into 
</p>
<p>service of the military court; and the establishment of an independent national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution. 
</p>
<p>8. With regard to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups, the delegation noted that significant reforms had been made by the 
</p>
<p>Government in order to allow them full enjoyment of their rights. In that context, it 
</p>
<p>mentioned the preparation of a national strategy to combat violence against women; the 
</p>
<p>implementation of a project providing legal assistance to victims of violence; the adoption 
</p>
<p>of a law on reproductive health, along with its implementing orders, that prohibited and 
</p>
<p>criminalized female genital mutilation; the inauguration of a national committee to combat 
</p>
<p>trafficking in persons; and the ratification of all conventions relating to the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the fight against torture, the delegation said that Guinea was 
</p>
<p>committed to banning torture, in particular by penalizing perpetrators. In that respect, it 
</p>
<p>pointed out that a chief of the gendarmerie had been sentenced; a commanding officer and 
</p>
<p>two senior officers of the armed forces had been charged, and three high-ranking 
</p>
<p>gendarmerie officers had been suspended. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the events of 28 September 2009, the delegation said that the 
</p>
<p>Government had undertaken to conduct fair and equitable proceedings. It was worth noting 
</p>
<p>that a pool of investigating magistrates had been established; more than 400 victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses had given statements; six persons had been charged, one of whom was subject to 
</p>
<p>a detention order, and persons outside the country had given statements by letters rogatory. 
</p>
<p>The delegation added, however, that the next stages in the proceedings would be more 
</p>
<p>aggressive in order to achieve faster progress. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation also mentioned the unprecedented health crisis Guinea was 
</p>
<p>experiencing on account of the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease. It said that the ordeal 
</p>
<p>had been accompanied by excessive and irrational panic, which had led to unjustifiable 
</p>
<p>situations, such as the stigmatization of nationals of the countries affected by the epidemic, 
</p>
<p>and of persons who had recovered in relation to their families, places of work and society in 
</p>
<p>general. The delegation thanked the United Nations and other partners for the solidarity 
</p>
<p>they had shown towards Guinea. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation said that the Government&#8217;s commitment to eradicating the human 
</p>
<p>rights violations that still occurred in Guinea was irrevocable. It said that the authorities 
</p>
<p>were quite prepared to take on all partnerships, even critical, that worked towards the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights, while being mindful of the sociocultural and 
</p>
<p>political context of the country. In that regard, the delegation requested support, aid and 
</p>
<p>political, technical and institutional assistance for Guinea in all human rights matters. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>

</p>

</p>
<p>the lives of women and girls. 
</p>
<p>15. Turkey expressed solidarity with Guinea in its fight against Ebola. It encouraged the 
</p>

<p>GE.15-07505 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>16. The United Arab Emirates commended efforts to implement commitments made 
</p>
<p>under the previous UPR. It asked for information regarding the observatory for women and 
</p>
<p>children set up under the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Liberties. 
</p>
<p>17. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Guinea to 
</p>
<p>ensure that female genital mutilation (FGM) continued to decline; and to make progress in 
</p>
<p>holding accountable State actors responsible for human rights violations, ensuring that 
</p>
<p>members of the security forces responded to judicial summons.  
</p>
<p>18. The United States of America called on the Government to hold accountable 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of the 2009 stadium massacre. It encouraged Guinea to continue cooperating 
</p>
<p>with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence 
</p>
<p>in Conflict.  
</p>
<p>19. Uruguay highlighted steps taken to implement UPR recommendations from the first

</p>
<p>the process needed to enable that institution to fully exercise its mandate. 
</p>
<p>20. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that, despite a lack of resources, 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by Ebola, Guinea had continued to implement its human rights programmes. It 
</p>
<p>highlighted work at the interministerial level to develop policies for the family and against 
</p>
<p>gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>21. Zimbabwe noted with appreciation the establishment of the Ministry of Human

</p>
<p>22. Albania commended the establishment of a department for the promotion of human 
</p>

</p>
<p>23. Algeria noted the ratification of international instruments and the submission of 
</p>

</p>
<p>particular FGM, and initiatives for the protection of the rights of the child and to fight 
</p>
<p>poverty. 
</p>
<p>24. Angola noted the persistence of FGM, particularly in rural areas, and called on 
</p>
<p>Guinea to continue efforts to eradicate that practice. It urged the international community to 
</p>
<p>continue to help Guinea to ensure stability and progress in socioeconomic areas.  
</p>
<p>25. Argentina commended the establishment of Ministry of Human Rights and Civil 
</p>
<p>Liberties and urged Guinea to strengthen cooperation with the OHCHR, highlighting the

</p>
<p>reduce maternal mortality.  
</p>

<p><b>6</b> GE.15-07505 
</p>

</p>
<p>reforms to establish constitutional order and reform of the judiciary and security system.  
</p>
<p>30. Brazil noted efforts to combat discrimination and violence against women. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the process to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and encouraged further progress in that 
</p>
<p>regard. It commended the commitment to acceding to the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment (OP-CAT) and extending a standing invitation to special procedures.  
</p>
<p>31. Brunei Darussalam recognized progress on the rights of vulnerable groups, 
</p>
<p>especially women and children. It highlighted initiatives on children, particularly the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Children&#8217;s Code, which brought legislation into line with the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>32. Burundi welcomed the establishment of the Supreme Council of Justice and the 
</p>
<p>increase in judges&#8217; salaries, which were important measures to guarantee the independence 
</p>
<p>of the judiciary. It highlighted measures to prohibit the dismissal of women for reasons 
</p>
<p>related to pregnancy.  
</p>
<p>33. Cabo Verde welcomed efforts made, highlighting broad legislative reform and 
</p>
<p>reform of the judiciary, the law on health and procreation in the context of the fight against

</p>
<p>36. Chad commended Guinea for the follow-up and implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations from its previous review, notwithstanding the challenges, in particular 
</p>
<p>the fight against the Ebola outbreak. It urged the international community to assist Guinea 
</p>
<p>in its efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>37. Aware of the challenges and complex realities that Guinea faced, Chile took note of 
</p>
<p>efforts made by Guinea to advance human rights, through the strengthening of its legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework. 
</p>
<p>38. Returning to a subject mentioned in the opening statement, namely the structural 
</p>
<p>problem, the delegation of Guinea explained that the country&#8217;s institutional and structural 
</p>
<p>past was very complex, and that it currently faced two major challenges: building the State 
</p>
<p>and democracy at the same time. It added that it was worth bearing in mind the fragility of 
</p>
<p>public institutions and democratic and institutional culture, as well as a certain in-built 
</p>
<p>cultural and sociological resistance. However, that did not mean that the public authorities 
</p>
<p>did not accept responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the ratification of a number of optional protocols, the delegation said 
</p>
<p>that the Government was willing to make sure that Guinea ratified them and that the 
</p>
<p>necessary mechanisms to do so were in place.  
</p>
<p>40. With regard to the death penalty, the delegation recalled that a de facto moratorium 
</p>
<p>had been in place for several years. It added that the reform of the Criminal Code has begun 
</p>
<p>and that the Ministry of Human Rights and Public Liberties planned to launch an 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising campaign on the abolition of the death penalty. </p>


<p>GE.15-07505 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>41. On the question of fair trials, the delegation said that the matter was related to the 
</p>
<p>massacres of 28 September 2009 and to the difficulties faced by fragile societies that had 
</p>
<p>experienced such tragedies in terms of human resources, expertise and political challenges. 
</p>
<p>The delegation said that trials relating to the events of 28 September would go ahead and 
</p>
<p>would be thorough and rigorous. They had to be held for the sake of the honour of Guinea 
</p>
<p>and of the victims, particularly the women who had been savagely attacked and assaulted. 
</p>
<p>42. Regarding the registration of children at birth, the delegation said that the 
</p>
<p>Government was making considerable efforts to deal with the issue, in particular by 
</p>
<p>decentralizing the civil registry to the communal level and by making the issue of civil 
</p>
<p>status certificates free of charge. 
</p>
<p>43. As far as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
</p>
<p>involvement of children in armed conflict was concerned, the delegation confirmed that the 
</p>
<p>instruments of ratification were currently being transmitted to the depositary of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to violence against women, particularly female genital mutilation, the 
</p>
<p>delegation admitted that it was a real problem and that the Government was tackling it with 
</p>
<p>determination, although it ran up against a certain cultural resistance and a number of 
</p>
<p>traditional institutions, which often influenced society more than the State. The 
</p>
<p>Government had undertaken an awareness-raising campaign and had initiated some 
</p>
<p>legislative changes and innovations, but they had not produced the expected results. The 
</p>
<p>delegation explained that financial aspects needed to be considered, as well as the problem 
</p>
<p>of retraining the people who performed female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>45. The delegation recalled that it had extended an invitation to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>special rapporteurs, which had been delayed by the health crisis due to the Ebola virus. 
</p>
<p>46. The delegation said that the Government was committed to continuing its efforts to 
</p>
<p>defend the principle of equality between men and women, women&#8217;s access to education, the 
</p>
<p>place of women in the world of work and the rights of women in the family. In order to deal 
</p>
<p>with those issues, Guinea would appreciate the support of the international community and 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>47. With regard to the violence that occurred during demonstrations, the delegation 
</p>
<p>agreed that law-enforcement agencies needed to be trained and to have a clear idea of their 
</p>
<p>duties, besides mastering the appropriate techniques of maintaining order. It was also 
</p>
<p>necessary to train demonstrators and activists from political parties. The delegation 
</p>
<p>confirmed that the role of the State was to send out strong signals regarding sanctions in 
</p>
<p>order to remind all parties that all rights were enshrined in law and should not prejudice 
</p>
<p>others. Furthermore, the delegation added that Guinea was still considering and seeking the 
</p>
<p>means of bringing an end to the culture of impunity.  
</p>
<p>48. The delegation said that the Government was working to ensure that violations 
</p>
<p>committed by security forces that did not fall within the competence of the military courts 
</p>
<p>were dealt with by the ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>49. Regarding the forthcoming elections, the delegation said that the Government was 
</p>
<p>determined to make every effort to ensure that they took place peacefully and in line with 
</p>
<p>democratic principles. 
</p>
<p>50. The delegation thanked all those who were assisting Guinea in the health crisis it 
</p>
<p>was undergoing, but said that the crisis would not prevent the Government from 
</p>
<p>undertaking reforms for the promotion and protection of human rights. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.15-07505 
</p>
<p>51. China appreciated progress made by Guinea since the last review and noted the 
</p>
<p>formulation of numerous laws and regulations, the strengthening of institutional building 
</p>
<p>and efforts in eliminating traditional harmful practices to women and children.  
</p>
<p>52. Comoros highlighted the results achieved by Guinea, in the context of the crisis 
</p>
<p>faced in recent years. It hoped that, with the support of the international community, Guinea 
</p>
<p>would be able to meet its objectives as reflected in its national report and the 
</p>
<p>recommendations received. 
</p>
<p>53. The Congo welcomed Guinean efforts, including to combat traditional practices that 
</p>
<p>were harmful to women and children, the ratification of the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the process to 
</p>
<p>address the events that occurred in 2009. It encouraged Guinea to strengthen its cooperation 
</p>
<p>with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>54. Costa Rica welcomed efforts to consolidate democracy through elections and 
</p>
<p>encouraged Guinea to continue promoting participation. It noted the importance of 
</p>
<p>establishing independent State mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including the establishment of guarantees to prohibit torture. 
</p>
<p>55. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire welcomed the adoption of a national plan of action to ensure follow-up 
</p>
<p>to recommendations from the UPR, the treaty bodies and the International Fact-Finding 
</p>
<p>Commission, in the areas of institutional strengthening and human rights policies. 
</p>
<p>56. Cuba highlighted the importance of international cooperation in the fight against the 
</p>
<p>Ebola outbreak and urged the international community to step up cooperation and financial 
</p>
<p>assistance to Guinea, including for strengthening of its health infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>57. The Czech Republic appreciated the information provided on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the previous UPR recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. While welcoming significant efforts made by Guinea to address the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation and the implementation of UPR recommendations, the Democratic Republic of the 
</p>
<p>Congo took note of remaining challenges. 
</p>
<p>59. Denmark commended Guinea for its constructive engagement with the UPR and for 
</p>
<p>its progress made in the promotion and protection of human rights. It hoped that concrete 
</p>
<p>steps were being undertaken to honour commitments made to ratify OP-CAT. Denmark 
</p>
<p>offered assistance from the CAT Initiative, if deemed helpful. 
</p>
<p>60. Djibouti appreciated the various actions undertaken by Guinea, notably the measures 
</p>
<p>undertaken to meet its due reporting obligations to treaty bodies. It wished Guinea success 
</p>
<p>in meeting its objectives for the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>61. Egypt recognized important measures to promote human rights in Guinea, in 
</p>
<p>particular reform programmes in the areas of justice, defence, security and administration. 
</p>
<p>It highlighted the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Liberties with 
</p>
<p>the task of implementing and monitoring human rights policies. 
</p>
<p>62. Equatorial Guinea welcomed efforts made by Guinea to reinforce the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, in particular in the areas of education, work and equality.

</p>
<p>to education for women and girls at all levels. 
</p>
<p>63. Ethiopia commended Guinea for identifying priority areas in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, and enhancing the legal framework. It encouraged Guinea to 
</p>
<p>continue working on the political, economic and social development areas. </p>

</p>
<p>65. Gabon welcomed the cooperation of Guinea with international human rights 
</p>
<p>protection mechanisms and efforts to implement the UPR recommendations. It appreciated 
</p>
<p>measures undertaken to fight violence against women and girls, as well as with regard to 
</p>

<p>national human rights institution and intensify efforts to fight more effectively against 
</p>
<p>torture. It welcomed the establishment of a country office by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>102. The delegation of Guinea said that the establishment of the Ministry of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and Public Liberties was an important step as far as the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>was concerned, although it was not enough to solve all problems relating to the violation of 
</p>
<p>those rights. According to the delegation, the Government was endeavouring to improve the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation, despite the burden of its political past and sociocultural attitudes.  
</p>
<p>103. The delegation announced that the following month national consultations on human 
</p>
<p>rights would be held in order to take stock of the main problems that existing not only at the 
</p>
<p>civil and political, but also at the economic and sociocultural levels.  
</p>
<p>104. The delegation said that the Government had decided to include human rights 
</p>
<p>education in school curricula, ranging from primary school to university. 
</p>
<p>105. Regarding the problem of violence against women, the delegation said that an 
</p>
<p>observatory had been set up in that respect. It added that such violence was intolerable for 
</p>
<p>all those who valued human rights and those fighting for gender equality.  
</p>
<p>106. The delegation also announced the forthcoming opening of a national workshop on 
</p>
<p>impunity, a problem that should not be confined to the will of public authorities, which 
</p>
<p>were still in gestation in Guinea. 
</p>
<p>107. The delegation announced the establishment of an interministerial committee 
</p>
<p>responsible for drafting periodic reports for submission to treaty bodies, with the support of 
</p>
<p>the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Another committee had been put 
</p>
<p>in charge of following up the recommendations made during the UPR.  
</p>
<p>108. On the question of national reconciliation, the delegation noted that Guinea had 
</p>
<p>expressed its political will by instituting an interim committee for national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Human Rights and Public Liberties was the Government&#8217;s focal point for 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, and the fund gathering effort continued in order to 
</p>
<p>support the work of that committee. 
</p>
<p>109. As far as torture was concerned, the delegation pointed out that Guinea had made 
</p>
<p>considerable progress. It explained that only quite recently, the practice had been 
</p>
<p>widespread in Guinean society but had come to be seen as a shameful act. It added that all 
</p>
<p>those responsible for acts of torture should be punished severely, and it was planned to add 
</p>
<p>a definition of torture in the Criminal Code that was in line with the provisions of article 1 
</p>
<p>of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment. The delegation confirmed that it was also necessary to train the defence and 
</p>
<p>security services in that respect so that they were more respectful of citizens&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>110. With regard to parity, the delegation noted that according to Guinean legislation at 
</p>
<p>least 30 per cent of those included on lists of candidates had to be women. It added, 
</p>
<p>however, that the aim was not merely to mention women on the lists, but also to ensure that 
</p>
<p>they were duly elected. 
</p>
<p>111. With regard to the rights of assembly and demonstration, the delegation said that 
</p>
<p>Guinea was working to strengthen its legal framework with a view to improving the 
</p>
<p>exercise of those rights. Measures included, in particular, training political party activists in 
</p>
<p>civil participation and citizenship. The delegation indicated that the State intended to punish 
</p>
<p>all those responsible for violence, agents of the defence and security forces and 
</p>
<p>demonstrators alike.  
</p>
<p>112. With regard to prisons, the delegation said that the Ministry of Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>Public Liberties had been able to visit all the prisons in the country and that the main 
</p>
<p>problem was prison overcrowding, due to the fact that the existing prisons dated back to </p>


<p>GE.15-07505 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>before independence. The delegation confirmed that there were plans to build a new central 
</p>
<p>prison that would meet the relevant international standards. It also mentioned that a new 
</p>
<p>prison observatory had been placed under the Ministry of Human Rights and Public 
</p>
<p>Liberties. 
</p>
<p>113. Regarding the independent national human rights institution, the delegation said that 
</p>
<p>legislation already existed in that respect and that the aim was to bring the institution 
</p>
<p>legally into line with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>114. Regarding the problem of female genital mutilation, the delegation explained that 
</p>
<p>the practice was deeply rooted in Guinean society. It noted that a strict and firm approach 
</p>
<p>was needed, together with exemplary punishments, as had been the case with the recent 
</p>
<p>sentencing of three women that practiced excision. The delegation pointed out that some 
</p>
<p>inventiveness would also be required, however, to find alternative solutions for the persons 
</p>
<p>that engaged in the practice, such as offering support for their occupational retraining. 
</p>
<p>115. Regarding employment for young people and women, the delegation said that a 
</p>
<p>partnership had been set up with the Peacebuilding Fund aimed at implementing projects 
</p>
<p>that favoured their independence. It considered that it would also be necessary to improve 
</p>
<p>the education system by facilitating the enrolment of young girls in school so as to provide 
</p>
<p>them with the skills they needed to prepare for employment. 
</p>
<p>116. Returning to the question of female genital mutilation, the delegation said that 
</p>
<p>regulatory and legislative measures had been adopted to combat the practice, and that a new 
</p>
<p>complementary law on the subject would soon be adopted. Similarly, the delegation 
</p>
<p>mentioned that a community observatory on access to health care and services for those 
</p>
<p>suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria had been established. 
</p>
<p>117. In conclusion, the delegation asserted that Guinea was strongly committed to the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. It added that the country at the same time had to work on 
</p>
<p>consolidating the rule of law and managing the situation without compromising 
</p>
<p>institutional reforms and the protection of rights. Lastly, the delegation appealed for the 
</p>
<p>support of the United Nations and Member States to ensure that the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights became a reality in Guinea. 
</p>
