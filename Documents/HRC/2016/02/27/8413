<p><b>  Follow-up to country recommendations: Afghanistan</b>* **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions analyses the progress made by Afghanistan in implementing the 
recommendations made by the previous mandate holder following his visit to the country 
from 4 to 15 May 2008 (A/HRC/11/2/Add.4). In that report, the Special Rapporteur 
referred to widespread killings within the context of the armed conflict. He held the view 
that many of these killings were preventable, and made recommendations directed at 
reducing civilian casualties, however or by whomever they were caused. He also made 
recommendations regarding the responses of international military forces to civilian 
casualties, compensation for victims, the Afghan National Police, the criminal justice 
system, transitional justice and the preservation of evidence of past crimes. While 
extrajudicial executions committed in the context of the armed conflict were the primary 
focus of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report, independent causes of unlawful killings rooted in 
the systems of policing and criminal justice were also addressed.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur invites the Government of Afghanistan to engage more 
actively in following up on the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder to 
improve the human rights situation and to reduce the unacceptable numbers of civilian 
casualties as a result of the armed conflict, and deeply regrets the fact that no concrete 
action has been taken on many recommendations. Extrajudicial killings remain widespread,

</p>
<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 8/3, the Human Rights Council urged States to, inter alia, cooperate 
with and assist the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions in 
the performance of his task, supply all necessary information requested by him and ensure 
appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the Special Rapporteur, 
including by providing information to the Special Rapporteur on the actions taken on those 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Christof 
Heyns, concurs with the previous mandate holder on the importance of follow-up reports as 
a critical component of country visits to investigate allegations of violations of the right to 
life, which is one of his principal working methods. Country visits are an essential means to 
obtain direct and first-hand information on human rights violations. They allow for direct 
observation of the human rights situation and facilitate an intensive dialogue with all 
relevant interlocutors in the country concerned. The main purpose of country visits is to 
assess the actual situation in the country concerned, including the examination of relevant 
institutional, legal, judicial and administrative aspects, and to make recommendations 
thereon. Country visits by mandate holders provide an opportunity to raise awareness at the 
national, regional and international levels of the specific problems under consideration. 
This is done through, inter alia, meetings, briefings, press coverage of the visit and 
dissemination of the report.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with established practice,1 the present follow-up report concerns the 
recommendations made by the previous mandate holder on his visit to Afghanistan 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.4) and was prepared on the basis of all available information.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur requested information from the Government and from other 
actors on the steps that had been taken to implement the recommendations formulated 
following the country visit. Information on the non-implementation of recommendations 
was also sought. In addition, information was sought on the current situation concerning 
extrajudicial executions in the country, and particularly on whether and how the situation 
had improved, deteriorated or remained static.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that the Government of Afghanistan did not 
provide information on progress made. The Special Rapporteur is especially grateful to the 
United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) as well as to all stakeholders 
that provided information for the preparation of the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>6. The previous mandate holder visited Afghanistan from 4 to 15 May 2008. In his 
report, the Special Rapporteur described the conflict in Afghanistan, referred to in legal 
terms as a non-international armed conflict that involved the Government, supported by 
</p>
<p>  
 1 In order to assess the extent to which States had implemented recommendations, in 2006, the previous 
</p>
<p>mandate holder initiated follow-up reports on country visits. The first follow-up report 
(E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.2) concerned recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, Asma 
Jahangir, on her visits to Brazil, Honduras, Jamaica and the Sudan. Subsequent follow-up reports 
were issued by the previous mandate holder, Philip Alston, in 2008, on missions conducted to Sri 
Lanka and Nigeria (A/HRC/8/3/Add.3); in 2009, on visits to Guatemala (A/HRC/11/2/Add.7) and the 
Philippines (A/HRC/11/2/Add.8); and in 2010, on visits to the Central African Republic 
(A/HRC/14/24/Add.5) and Brazil (A/HRC/14/24/Add.4). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6  
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>international military forces,2 and various armed groups, widely referred to as &#8220;the 
Taliban&#8221;3 and sometimes as &#8220;anti-Government elements&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>7. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder highlighted widespread killings 
within the context of the armed conflict, and made recommendations aimed at reducing the 
number of civilians killed. He held the view that many of these killings were avoidable, and 
made recommendations directed at reducing civilian casualties, however or by whomever 
they were caused. He also made recommendations regarding responses by the international 
military forces to civilian casualties, the compensation of victims, the Afghan National 
Police, the criminal justice system, transitional justice and the preservation of evidence of 
past crimes. While extrajudicial executions committed in the context of the armed conflict 
were the primary focus of the report, independent causes of unlawful killings rooted in the 
systems of policing and criminal justice were also addressed. 
</p>
<p>8. Afghanistan continues to experience a non-international armed conflict with the 
same major actors across the majority of its territory. Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions appear to remain widespread, and in unacceptably high numbers. While some 
progress has been made, such as the adoption of non-binding guidelines on civilian 
compensation for all troop-contributing nations in Afghanistan by the North Atlantic 
Council in June 2010, the Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the fact that no concrete action 
has been taken on many recommendations regarding threats to the right to life, killings of 
civilians as &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; and other extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
The Special Rapporteur also regrets the fact that the Government of Afghanistan did not 
provide a response to his request of information on the implementation of recommendations 
made by the previous mandate holder in his mission report. He invites the Government, 
together with international military forces and troop-contributing countries, to engage more 
actively in following up on the recommendations made to improve the human rights 
situation and take all necessary steps to prevent extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary 
executions, within and outside the context of the armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conflict-related killings 
</b></p>
<p>9. In his mission report, the Special Rapporteur held the view that efforts to protect the 
civilian population should be strengthened. He reported that, in conflict areas, Afghan 
civilians experienced violence and pressure from the insurgents, the Government forces and 
international military forces, while expatriates were targeted largely by insurgents 
regardless of their individual conduct, but were generally protected or at least left alone by 
the Government and international forces. He also reported that indiscriminate killings of the 
civilian population were usually regarded as &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; or resulting from attacks 
carried out on the basis of false information (for example, identifying the civilian 
population as combatants or insurgents). 
</p>
<p>10. Developments in 2010 and in the first trimester of 2011 suggest that the situation has 
not substantially improved since August 2009, which saw the release of information 
indicating that the impact of the armed conflict, which continually intensified and affected 
</p>
<p>  
 2 The Government&#8217;s forces include the Afghan National Army, the Afghan National Police and the 
</p>
<p>National Directorate of Security. The international military forces are divided into the International 
Security Assistance Force and Operation Enduring Freedom. See A/HRC/11/2/Add.4, para. 1. 
</p>
<p> 3 While acknowledging that the relationships and affiliations between the wide range of armed 
opposition groups are not always clear, the Special Rapporteur will refer to them collectively as &#8220;the 
Taliban&#8221;, as this is the expression commonly used by locals and foreigners alike as well as by the 
previous mandate holder in his mission report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>more areas of the country,4 remained a major concern. A survey carried out by the 
International Committee of the Red Cross published in June 2009 indicated that 96 per cent 
of all Afghans had been directly or indirectly affected by the armed conflict (including both 
immediate and wider consequences);5 45 per cent had seen a family member killed;6 and 35 
per cent have been wounded as a result of the armed conflict.7  
</p>
<p>11. In the report, the Special Rapporteur will analyse issues related to adopting a 
civilian-centric perspective, military operations, transparency and accountability in 
international force operations, compensation for victims and influencing the Taliban, all of 
which were also addressed by the previous mandate holder in his mission report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Adopting a civilian-centric perspective 
</b></p>
<p>12. In his mission report, the Special Rapporteur insisted on the importance of adopting 
a civilian-centric perspective, which implied a change in the conduct of all parties to the 
conflict in order to reduce the insecurity posed by the armed conflict to the civilian 
population.8 
</p>
<p>13. In May 2010, the Taliban issued an updated <i>Laiha</i>, a code of conduct and 
regulations for its members, containing a provision calling on fighters to &#8220;deal gently with 
civilians&#8221;. The provision is reportedly similar to previous provisions contained in former 
versions of the <i>Laiha</i>. However, no information was available to the Special Rapporteur on 
concerted efforts by the Taliban to follow their recently adopted code of conduct and to 
adhere to international humanitarian law standards. In their 2010 report, the Afghanistan 
Independent Human Rights Commission and the UNAMA Human Rights Unit highlighted 
that they had not observed any concerted effort by the Taliban to implement these orders or 
to take action against those commanders or members who disobeyed them.9 
</p>
<p>14. In August 2010, the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
Commander adopted an updated tactical directive,10 which clarified and reaffirmed 
&#8220;population-centric counterinsurgency principles&#8221;.11 However, no information was made 
available to the Special Rapporteur on substantial changes made in the procedures applied 
on the ground for ensuring that strikes targeting Taliban fighters were based on reliable 
information and did not cause unnecessary suffering and damage to the civilian population.

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendation that the international military forces 
redouble their efforts to adopt a civilian-centric perspective in the conduct of operations 
with a view to comply with human rights law and, when applicable, with international 
humanitarian law standards.  
</p>
<p>15. In the light of the foregoing, the Special Rapporteur remains very concerned about 
indiscriminate killings and the need to take further steps to ensure the protection of the 
civilian population. He calls upon all parties to take further steps to verify the reliability of 
the information used to launch attacks. He deeply regrets that the use of unreliable 
information by the international military forces render civilians vulnerable to attack and 
push individuals pursuing personal grudges into opportunistic participation in the armed 
conflict. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, adopting a civilian-centred perspective on the 
ground continues to be of paramount importance in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Military operations 
</b></p>
<p>16. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder referred to military tactics 
employed by each side that could lead directly to civilian deaths; the behaviours or methods 
of warfare adopted by one side that could affect the behaviour of the other side, and 
exacerbate civilian killings; and the competition for civilian support.12 Information released 
in 2009 following the publication of the mission report indicated that military operations by 
international forces involved aerial bombardments and night raid operations in the south, 
west and east; fighting between armed groups and national and international forces took 
place regularly in more than half of Afghani territory, and even provinces not directly 
affected by the fighting endured roadside bombings, targeted killings, suicide bombings and 
deliberate intimidation of civilians.13 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Civilian casualties  
</b></p>
<p>17. Information received suggested that both Afghan and international (including the 
United Nations) civilian casualties and violent attacks against the civilian population 
increased significantly in 2010.14 The number of civilians assassinated and executed surged 
by more than 95 per cent compared with 2009, with more than half occurring in the south, 
where more than 100 Afghan civilians were killed, including teachers, nurses, doctors, 
tribal elders, community leaders, Government officials, other civilians (including children) 
and civilians working for international military forces and international organizations.15 The 
spread of the conflict to more stable provinces in the north-west and the west has resulted in 
a further reduction of humanitarian space as well as resultant loss of livelihood, destruction 
of property and personal assets of civilians.16 
</p>
<p>18. The safety and security of both civilians and humanitarian aid workers remains a 
high concern in Afghanistan. Public information and data trends based on information 
gathered by UNAMA and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
indicate that, between January and June 2010 civilian casualties (deaths and injuries) 
increased by 31 per cent compared to the same period in 2009. The number of civilians

<p>assassinated and executed surged by more than 95 per cent as compared to 2009 with more 
than half occurring in the south, killing more than 100 Afghan civilians.17 
</p>
<p>19. From 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, the UNAMA Human Rights Unit 
recorded a total of 2,412 civilian casualties, which represented an increase of 14 per cent 
over the same period in 2008. Furthermore, in the first six months of 2010, the number of 
civilian casualties (both deaths and injuries) increased by 31 per cent over the same period 
in 2009.18 According to the United Nations Department of Safety and Security, security 
incidents that affected the United Nations directly were 133 per cent higher in September 
2010 than for the same period in 2009. Attacks predominantly occurred in or near anti-
Government strongholds in the southern, northern and eastern regions of the country. 
However, several attacks showed that no area in Afghanistan was immune to violence: 
examples include the 28 October 2009 attack on the Baktar guesthouse in Kabul on 28 
October 2009, the assault on the UNAMA compound in Herat Province on 26 October 
2010 and the attack on United Nations personnel and others in Mazar-i-Sharif city in north-
west Afghanistan on 1 April 2011. Other examples in the past two years include the 
targeted killing of 10 local and international workers of an organization in Badakhshan 
province, formerly considered a more peaceful part of Afghanistan19 and the recent attack 
on one of the main supermarkets in Kabul frequented largely by the expatriate community, 
but also by the upwardly mobile Afghan civilian population, including the former 
Commissioner for Children of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, 
who was killed alongside her husband (a medical doctor) and all four of their children in 
the attack.20 
</p>
<p>20. The conflict appears to be intensifying and spreading, as is evident from the trend 
analysis indicating that, in 2010, violent attacks affecting civilians and the aid community 
spread to areas that were traditionally relatively calm, resulting in the loss of livelihood, 
destruction of property and personal assets of civilians. In their report for 2010, the 
UNAMA Human Rights Unit and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
documented a total of 2,777 civilians killed in the conflict in 2010, reflecting an increase of 
15 per cent over the number of civilian casualties in 2009.21 
</p>
<p>21. According to UNAMA and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights 
Commission, the most alarming trend in 2010 was the huge number of civilians 
assassinated by anti-Government elements.22 Of the total number of 2,777 civilians killed in 
2010, 2,080 deaths, some 75 per cent of total civilian deaths, were attributed to anti-
Government elements, up 28 per cent from 2009. A total of 462 civilians were killed, an 
increase of more than 105 per cent over the figures for 2009. Half of all civilian killings 
were reported in southern Afghanistan. National security and international military forces 
(pro-Government forces) were linked to 440 deaths or 16 per cent of all civilian deaths, a 
reduction of 26 per cent compared with 2009. Aerial attacks claimed the largest percentage 
of civilian deaths caused by pro-Government forces in 2010, causing 171 deaths (39 per

<p> 22 Anti-Government elements include armed opposition groups and individuals of diverse backgrounds, 
motivations and command structures, characterized as the Taliban, the Haqqani network, Hezb-e-
Islami and al-Qaida affiliates, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Islamic Jihad Union, 
Lashkari Tayyiba and Jaysh Muhammad engaged in hostilities with the Government of Afghanistan 
and its international military partners. See ibid., footnote 7. </p>

<p>cent of the total number of civilian deaths attributed to pro-Government forces in 2010). 
Notably, there was a 52 per cent decline in civilian deaths from air attacks compared with 
</p><p>2009. Some 9 per cent of civilian deaths in 2010 could not be attributed to any party to the 
conflict.23 
</p>
<p>22. Although overall civilian deaths from air attacks by pro-Government forces 
decreased in 2010 from 2009, the number of Afghan civilians killed in air strikes increased 
in 2010: in the first half of the year, 69 civilians were killed in air attacks; in the second 
half, 102 civilians died from air strikes &#8211; a 48 per cent increase. This is linked to significant 
increases in the use of air assets in combat in the latter half of 2010.24 
</p>
<p>23. The number of civilian casualties attributed to pro-Government forces reportedly 
dropped in 2010, but continue to be unacceptably high. The decrease in casualties was 
reportedly primarily as the result of new tactical directives, standard operating procedures 
and reinforced counter-insurgency guidelines by ISAF. Nonetheless, it appears that the 
tactical directives are not being fully and consistently implemented at all levels, and that 
procedures on the ground have not changed. 
</p>
<p>24. In the light of the above, continued efforts should be made to avoid civilian 
casualties, the number of which continue to be unacceptably high. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to recall that, under international humanitarian law, all parties to a conflict are 
obliged to comply with article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions. He also recalls 
that the indiscriminate killing of civilians amounts to a grave breach of international 
humanitarian law and should therefore be investigated, prosecuted and sanctioned under 
national and international criminal law.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Raids 
</b></p>
<p>25. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder highlighted the fact that night-
time raids on housing compounds were routinely used by the international military forces as 
a strategy to capture individuals suspected of links to the Taliban. He described the two 
common methods used for such raids,25 and expressed concern at the potentially devastating 
consequences of their use, particularly because Afghans commonly sleep with guns owing 
to their fear of intruders and local attackers. He also expressed deep concern over the fact 
that no Government or military command appeared ready to acknowledge responsibility for 
night raids. He regretted that, in the name of restoring rule of law, heavily-armed 
internationals and their Afghan counterparts were wandering around conducting raids that 
too often resulted in killings for which no one was held accountable.26 
</p>
<p>26. In February 2011, it was reported that, in a period of three months, night raids had 
resulted in approximately 600 people being killed; it was also alleged that shots were fired 
in 80 per cent of recent raids.27 The high number of deaths in this regard is disconcerting. 
The Special Rapporteur thus reiterates the words of his predecessor, that &#8220;raids must be 
conducted in accordance with the stringent safeguards required by international human 
rights and humanitarian law&#8221;.28

</p>
<p>27. On 7 December 2010, the ISAF Commander issued a night raids tactical directive, 
superseding a previous tactical directive adopted on 23 January 2010. Few changes were 
introduced. While the previous directive mentioned that collected data supported the view 
that night raids reduced the potential for civilian casualties, the revised one underlined the 
fact that night operations could actually reduce the number of civilian casualties. 
Information received suggested, however, that the two documents were virtually identical 
and that the fundamental rules for the conduct of night raids remain very similar.29 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the classified nature of the night raid 
tactical directive as a &#8220;high security&#8221; document. It was indeed difficult for UNAMA and the 
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission to provide timely advice in order to 
improve night raid procedures with the aim of protecting civilians and further minimizing 
civilian casualties. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur strongly advocates for a change in 
the classification of the directive so that it may be accessible to UNAMA, which would 
thus be able to comment on or even to contribute to its provisions. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, such reclassification would facilitate efforts to minimize the negative 
effects of night raid operations and would be beneficial for upholding the rule of law in 
Afghanistan and adherence to international humanitarian law and human rights law. It 
would also be beneficial to the protection of the Afghan people and help ensure appropriate 
conduct of operations by the Government and the international military forces, in full 
compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Intelligence gathering and false tips 
</b></p>
<p>29. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder documented unacceptable killings 
of civilians by the Government or by international military forces on the basis of hasty 
conclusions (for example, based on suspicious activity and civilians mistaken for 
combatants). No information was received on whether attacks continued to be undertaken 
on the basis of fabricated information.  
</p>
<p>30. In 2009, the previous mandate holder also described testimonies of witnesses and 
victims&#8217; next of kin alleging that civilians were sometimes targeted on the basis of 
superficially suspicious conduct as a result of the ignorance of the international forces of 
local practices.30 No information was received by the Special Rapporteur on any efforts 
made by international military forces to develop knowledge of local practices and take 
measures to ensure that civilians were not being targeted by ground forces and air strikes. 
Adopting a civilian-centred perspective on the ground therefore continues to be of 
paramount importance. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Suicide attacks  
</b></p>
<p>31. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder expressed concern at the use of 
suicide attacks in a disproportionate or indiscriminate manner, having as a consequence the 
killing or injuring of large numbers of civilians.31 According to public information obtained 
</p>
<p>  
 29 Similarities include measures to actively involve the battle space owner, Government officials, tribal 
</p>
<p>elders or religious leaders in the pre-phase to resolve issues peacefully; promoting an Afghan-led 
(wherever possible) ISAF to support coordination among the Government of Afghanistan, Afghan 
national security forces and local elders; ensuring post-operation engagement with local leaders to 
counter misinformation and propaganda; the use of soft knocking prior to entering a residence; 
restrictions on the use of military dogs during raids; regulations for the treatment of detainees, 
property seizure, property damage, documentation, post-operation mitigation, storyboards and 
reporting; and compliance with international humanitarian law.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6

</b></p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur,32 the use of improvised explosive devices, suicide attacks, rocket 
and mortar fire increased in 2010. Even where targets were legitimate military objects, such 
as military installations and combatants (pro-Government forces), these attacks and tactics 
often disproportionately harmed civilians. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights 
Commission and the UNAMA Human Rights Unit found that many attacks were carried 
out in civilian areas where the military target was not clear or was unknown. An increase in 
the use of improvised explosive devices and of suicide attacks, including some defined as 
&#8220;complex&#8221;,33 was reported in places such as bazaars, ministries or commercial areas, or 
alongside roads busy with civilian traffic.34 
</p>
<p>32. In 2010, anti-Government elements used unlawful means of warfare, including 
asymmetric tactics,35 in particular improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks, which 
appeared to target military objects but in fact caused increased numbers of civilian deaths 
and injuries, systematically terrorized the civilian population and restricted access to 
essential services in many areas affected by the conflict.36 There was a substantial increase 
in the use of larger and more sophisticated improvised explosive devices. Information 
provided by UNAMA and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission 
indicated that 21 per cent of improvised explosive device detonations and 46 per cent of 
suicide attacks resulted in civilian deaths and injuries. Furthermore, suicide attacks 
accounted for 11 per cent of all deaths attributed to anti-Government elements and 8 per 
cent of all civilian deaths in 2010. This represented a decrease of 15 per cent over 2009. 
Although the number of suicide attacks remained at the same level in 2009 and 2010 
(approximately 140 attacks per year), it appears that suicide attacks caused fewer civilian 
deaths in 2010 than in 2009.37 
</p>
<p>33. Suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices caused the most civilian deaths, 
totalling 1,141 deaths, and 55 per cent of civilian deaths attributed to anti-Government 
elements.38 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transparency and accountability in international force operations 
</b></p>
<p>34. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder called upon the international 
forces in Afghanistan to take the principles of accountability and transparency seriously and 
to cooperate more fully with outside efforts to investigate alleged abuses. He concluded that 
proper tracking of civilian casualties was critical to improving the current system of

<p>

</p>

 33 Stakeholders described complex suicide attacks as those perpetrated by well-funded, better trained 
</p>
<p>insurgents. These usually involve multiple perpetrators using more than one form of weapon, such as 
firing weapons before entering a building, shooting people and then detonating a suicide vest.

</p>
<p>accountability for civilian protection and compensation to the civilian population for the 
harm caused.39 
</p>
<p>35. ISAF established a civilian casualty tracking cell in 2008; reportedly, however, it 
has not accurately recorded civilian casualties or ensured that ISAF troops adequately take 
responsibility for harm caused. In December 2010, NATO members agreed to review the 
tracking cell with the aim of highlighting shortfalls in effectiveness and inadequacies in 
resourcing. Despite these efforts, the current tracking cell appears not to have investigatory 
capacity and lacks empowerment from the military leadership.40 The tracking cell is based 
at ISAF headquarters in Kabul and relies on forces on the ground to report incidents on 
their own initiative rather than through a strong directive.41 Incidents, 
investigations, compensation and apologies are reportedly not closely tracked, therefore 
there is no mechanism in place to ensure that all allegations are adequately addressed, nor is 
there a mechanism to record lessons learned so that they can be used to address remaining 
challenges, including the reduction of military activity on the basis of false information.  
</p>
<p>36. Despite the progress made, several concerns remain regarding the lack of sufficient 
investigative resources by the tracking cell and the reduced scope of its mandate, given that 
it appears not to cover &#8220;other Government agencies&#8221; such as the numerous intelligence 
agencies, special forces units and private contractors operating in Afghanistan. The Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that the ISAF directive should ensure the adoption and 
application of tactical directives emphasizing the importance of properly addressing civilian 
harm when it occurs and offering practical, detailed procedures for, inter alia, recording 
casualties, receiving claims, conducting investigations and providing reparations in 
conformity with international standards.  
</p>
<p>37. In the Special Rapporteur's view, efforts should be strengthened to ensure a system 
for the assistance of civilians injured in the context of the armed conflict. The need for such 
a unified system is highlighted by the alleged refusal of several NATO countries to offer 
any assistance to civilians injured by their actions.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Compensation for victims 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of non-binding guidelines on 
civilian compensation for all troop-contributing nations in Afghanistan by the North 
Atlantic Council in June 2010 and the creation of the NATO civilian casualties tracking cell 
to investigate claims of civilian casualties. The guidelines focus on prompt 
acknowledgement by ISAF of combat-related civilian harm, proper investigations and the 
proactive offering of assistance to survivors.  
</p>
<p>39. Despite the progress made, compensation for victims remains a concern in 
Afghanistan. According to information received, the ISAF Commander forwarded these 
guidelines to commanders without any detailed implementation instructions, leaving a gap 
between political will and practice on the ground.  
</p>
<p>40. ISAF member countries thus continue to offer compensation in their own specific 
way, with variations from one State to the other or even within a single command. The 
various international forces have implemented different programmes for compensating 
civilian victims of military operations, and some information has been diffused through the

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>media on such payments.42 However, it appears that publicly available records are 
insufficient for an estimate of the number of victims who receive payments and the 
proportion of compensations to be made.  
</p>
<p>41. According to information received, compensation is mainly financial, leaving aside 
a holistic approach to compensation, which would include, for example, dignifying civilian 
losses by upholding the right to the truth. Moreover, the procedures to determine when 
compensation should be paid remain unclear and lack transparency. For example, 
information received suggested that, in some regions of Afghanistan, some monetary 
compensation was distributed to victims of night raids and air strikes. In the first quarter of 
2010, this included 60 families in Kapisa province, who were mostly victims of night raids 
and air strikes. In a separate incident, on 21 March 2010, international military forces 
reportedly left 50,000 Afs (approximately $1,000) in a house following a night raid, during 
which a 92 year-old man was reportedly killed. However, the victim&#8217;s son returned the 
money to ISAF on the grounds that it could not put a price on his father&#8217;s life. 
</p>
<p>42. The Afghan National Army and related security forces have neither 
a systematic compensation mechanism nor are they trained to address civilian harm. 
President Discretionary Fund 99, a small ad hoc fund, is administered by the President's 
executive office. The Government programme that provides a form of monetary 
compensation to civilians killed by anti-Government elements appears to be inadequate. 
Furthermore, the President Discretionary Fund appears to be disconnected from the 
activities of the Afghan National Security Forces, which have no civilian casualty tracking 
capabilities and thus are unable to assess best practices, pitfalls and lessons learned. With 
more combat responsibility being transferred to the Afghan National Army by ISAF, the 
need for a nationally owned, coordinated and unified compensation system (including 
recordkeeping, evidence protection, investigations and holistic compensations) is evident. 
</p>
<p>43. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur concurs with the stakeholders&#8217; opinion on the 
need to create an effective system for recording civilian casualty incidents, analyse lessons 
learned to minimize harm, properly recognize civilian losses and provide immediate and 
appropriate redress and compensation.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the support provided by the international 
community to help Afghanistan to move towards the creation of such a system. In his view, 
international and Afghan security forces should redouble efforts to ensure accountability for 
violations to international humanitarian law and human rights abuses.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Influencing the Taliban 
</b></p>
<p>45. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder concluded that there was a need 
to find ways to influence the conduct of the Taliban so that they adopt a population-centred 
approach and put a halt to indiscriminate attacks, which severely affect the civilian 
population.43 
</p>
<p>46. In 2010, the Taliban and other armed groups (some anti-Government, and others 
ostensibly supporting the Government) targeted, abducted, indiscriminately attacked and 
unlawfully killed civilians, committing human rights abuses and gross violations of 
international humanitarian law.44 In this regard, the UNAMA Human Rights Unit and the

<p>Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission documented numerous indiscriminate 
or disproportionate attacks that resulted in civilian casualties for which the Taliban claimed 
responsibility.45 
</p>
<p>47. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder also proposed several possible 
approaches that could be explored on the basis of testimonies and information gathered in 
situ.46 No information was available to the Special Rapporteur on the consideration given, if 
any, to the possible approaches he proposed. However, information available suggested 
that, following the issue of the UNAMA mid-2010 report on civilian casualties, the Taliban 
had proposed the formation of a joint commission to investigate civilian deaths.47 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Police reform and militias 
</b></p>
<p>48. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder highlighted the fact that 
Afghanistan needed a police force that could play both a law enforcement and paramilitary 
role.48 He strongly advocated for reform to the national police, while recognizing that 
training and raising awareness on human rights standards were also important tools.49 
</p>
<p>49. Information provided by stakeholders during the universal periodic review of 
Afghanistan indicated that the police were frequently cited by Afghans as the most corrupt 
institution in the country,50 which highlighted the importance of tackling police reform in 
earnest. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur did not receive information on whether the Government had 
stopped establishing and legitimizing more militias and whether lessons learned had been 
gathered by the programme on the &#8220;auxiliary police&#8221;. He did not receive information on the 
implementation of the Afghanistan Social Outreach Programme, which was a major 
concern of the previous mandate holder during his visit in 2008. The Programme sought to 
mobilize the local population for its own protection, but it was feared that it would also 
increase their risks and lead to the empowerment of favoured groups within a community to 
extort, intimidate and kill their opponents. 
</p>
<p>51. Assessments provided by stakeholders in 201151 indicate that the Afghan National 
Police continue to be poorly trained and managed, and remain notorious for corrupt and 
abusive practices. In certain parts of the country, the police are said to be perceived as a 
greater source of insecurity than the Taliban, thereby undermining the authority and 
legitimacy of the central Government. Information received also suggested that there were 
links between some police officials and criminal gangs involved in violent crime (such as 
kidnappings and armed robbery). 
</p>
<p>52. In August 2010, the Government of Afghanistan launched the Afghan Local Police 
programme as a Ministry of Interior-led rural security programme aimed to protect 
communities from anti-Government elements through the recruitment of local individuals 
into an armed force with limited security functions. The programme currently allows for

<p>15,700 recruits in 61 districts, and has a ceiling of 30,000 recruits in 100 districts. At the 
district level, the Afghan Local Police report to the district chief of police. Special forces 
from the United States of America play a mentoring role, without any official supervisory 
role, by providing training and working with the Afghan Local Police units for a limited 
duration before handing over responsibilities to conventional forces for further mentoring.52 
</p>
<p>53. While the programme will require a thorough impact assessment, concerns have 
already been raised at weak oversight, recruitment, vetting and command and control 
mechanisms, limited training for recruits and effectiveness of reporting through district 
police chiefs. These issues were observed by UNAMA and the Afghanistan Independent 
Human Rights Commission in Kunduz and Baghlan provinces, in Khas Uruzgan district in 
Uruzgan province and in Kirjan district in Dai Kundi province. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur shares the concern expressed by UNAMA and the 
Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission regarding law enforcement and the 
mandate of the Afghan Local Police with regard to its obligations and role in detention are 
not clearly defined or instructive on issues of arbitrary detention, the handover process of 
detained persons, conditions of detention and the prevention of abuse. He also shares the 
call made by UNAMA and the Commission to the Government of Afghanistan on the need 
to establish rigorous oversight and monitoring of all elements of the Police programme, 
together with accountability for abusive or criminal acts of Police members to ensure that 
the programme does not result in less protection for the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>55. Despite the many challenges ahead, the Special Rapporteur commends the support 
provided by the international community for the Government of Afghanistan in the training 
of the Afghan National Police. The Special Rapporteur encourages continuous training 
efforts to cover all regions of Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the preparation of tools and materials by 
UNAMA for training by ISAF of newly recruited members of the Afghan National Police 
in other regions. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that ISAF 
ensure a rights-based approach and mainstream civilian-protection and gender-sensitive 
approaches in their training activities.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>57. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder referred to impunity, weaknesses 
in the judicial system and corruption as major obstacles for the investigation or prosecution 
of many criminal cases of murder, including extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
He stressed the need to establish efficient mechanisms of cooperation at the early stages of 
crime detection and investigation; the system established at the time in the Constitution, 
where the police were in charge of crime detection and the prosecutors of crime 
investigation, appeared not to work adequately in practice.53 
</p>
<p>58. Despite some progress made, the formal justice system continues to suffer from 
severe and systemic problems. These include the lack of detailed strategies regarding 
continuing legal education; the lack of adequate judicial training facilities; limited numbers 
of competent judicial personnel in service; lack of communications and coordination among 
institutions; rampant corruption; and the influence that money derived from narcotics and

</p>
<p>warlords exert on the country&#8217;s structures. In its 2010 assessment, the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted the fact that the conflict had a negative effect not 
only on the judicial system, but on the culture of the rule of law as well.54 
</p>
<p><b> B. Corruption and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>59. In his mission report, the previous mandate holder reported on high levels of 
corruption based on information received in situ and testimonies from Afghan officials, 
civilians and other stakeholders.55 The Special Rapporteur regrets that the situation appears 
not to have improved substantially since the time that the mission took place. 
</p>
<p>60. In 2009, information provided by stakeholders in the context of the universal 
periodic review mechanism indicated that the Action Plan on Peace, Justice and 
Reconciliation adopted in December 2005, which sought to address past abuses and 
promote national reconciliation, was not fully supported by the Government, which failed 
to set up an advisory panel to help the President to vet senior political appointments. The 
stakeholders also noted that efforts to counter impunity and seek redress for victims were 
consistently marginalized throughout the State-building process, and regretted the fact that 
important criminal justice issues were systematically excluded from the policymaking 
agenda.56 
</p>
<p>61. During the universal periodic review of Afghanistan in 2009, stakeholders also 
underscored the fact that the judiciary&#8217;s lack of power and difficulty in interpreting laws 
had resulted in a &#8220;climate of impunity&#8221;. They expressed concern that judicial shortcomings 
had resulted in citizens&#8217; lack of confidence in the formal justice institutions, which they 
regarded as slow, ineffective and often corrupt. They reported that most Afghans, and 
particularly women, had difficulty in gaining access to courts and legal assistance; most 
could not afford court fees or the transportation costs for attending often distant courts. 
Traditional male-dominated community-based assemblies handled an estimated 80 per cent 
of all disputes in Afghanistan, but they operated in isolation from State courts and without 
the benefit of minimal standards of due process or evidence. Moreover, the challenging 
security situation was compounded by a lack of substantive progress in security sector and 
rule of law reform.57 In this regard, the need to strengthen the judicial system, in particular 
the enforcement of judicial decisions, is to be emphasized.58 
</p>
<p>62. Stakeholders also highlighted that the Afghan National Police and justice sector 
institutions were considered corrupt and enjoyed limited public confidence. Although 
reform initiatives had been directed towards both the security forces and the justice sector, 
the focus has been centred on capacity-building and infrastructure rather than on coming to 
terms with the culture of corruption and impunity that undermines security and justice 
institutions.59

<p>63. In this regard, the 2010 corruption perception index ranked Afghanistan, after 
Somalia and Myanmar, as the third country where corruption was most perceived as a 
factor severely affecting institutions in charge of the administration of justice.60 
</p>
<p>64. Assessments provided by stakeholders in 201161 also suggest that Afghan judicial 
and security sectors lack the necessary personnel, infrastructure, training and political will 
to respect, protect and promote human rights. The justice sector comprises three institutions 
&#8211; the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and the Attorney General&#8217;s Office &#8211; all of 
which have been affected by the phenomenon of corruption and by a lack of qualified 
personnel. The constitutionally mandated independence of the courts and the prosecutorial 
service are reportedly used to prevent administrative oversight, while being quite 
permissive of interference by the executive. Judicial and prosecutorial personnel are said to 
be susceptible to pressure by public office holders and armed groups. Trials are marked by 
procedures that fail to meet international standards of fairness, including violations of the 
right to call and examine witnesses and the denial of defendants&#8217; rights to legal counsel and 
equal access to information. Verdicts, even if they can be obtained, are difficult or 
impossible to enforce owing to the absence of effective State coercive institutions.

<p>65. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has a constitutional mandate 
for the implementation and mainstreaming of human rights, but suffers from insufficient 
political support and collaboration by the other branches of the administration. 
</p>
<p>66. In 2011, the Special Rapporteur was informed about a number of cases of alleged 
corruption, some of which are still under investigation. Although he welcomes measures 
taken to combat impunity, serious concerns have been raised to the Special Rapporteur 
regarding corruption in the judiciary, particularly in the central highlands region, including 
undue pressure and inducement to dismiss cases in the formal criminal justice system so 
that they can be settled in a <i>jirga</i> (tribal council) when they involve influential individuals 
or persons with a link to the authorities (for example, working for the National Directorate 
of Security, the State intelligence service). In the southern region, concern was raised over 
interference by local tribal leaders and independent bodies in proceedings regarding five 
conflict-related trials in Uruzgan province, the hearings of which were held from 21 to 26 
February 2011. While all five defendants were convicted of offences relating to the conflict 
and two received custodial sentences, inconsistencies in judicial procedural standards and 
basic fair trial standards, such as the presumption of innocence and the right to defence and 
to have legal representation, were highlighted.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government of Afghanistan to continue to 
work towards the elimination of corruption and impunity and welcomes efforts by, inter 
alia, UNAMA and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime62 to help Afghanistan in 
these areas critical to strengthening the rule of law. He also wishes to recall, as did his 
predecessor, the importance of the role played by an independent Attorney General&#8217;s office, 
and stresses the need to establish an effective mechanism with the power to subpoena 
witnesses and evidence and to launch prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>68. The High Office of Oversight, established in July 2008 in response to very 
considerable persuasive efforts by the international donor community to ensure oversight 
and coordination of national activities to combat corruption, has remained ineffective, 
understaffed and endowed with insufficient forensic capacity, legal authority and political

<p>will. The intimate personal and institutional relationship maintained by the Office with the 
presidency and the willingness of its leadership to blame corruption primarily on foreigners 
rather than address its indigenous causes, coupled with high-profile cases of political 
interference in its investigations, raise considerable concern that the Government of 
Afghanistan may not be sufficiently earnest in its endeavours to address corruption.63 
</p>
<p><b> C. Women and the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>69. The armed conflict continues to have a detrimental impact on women;64 the criminal 
justice system is yet to develop a gender-sensitive approach.65 Information received 
suggested that both informal and formal justice systems handle cases relating to gender-
based violence, such as multiple revenge killings and intra-family murder. Nevertheless, 
women often lack access to justice in Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>70. Traditional <i>jirgas</i> and <i>shura</i> (informal communal councils), which operate outside 
the formal justice system, reportedly disregard fair trial rights and often discriminate 
against women, and continue to handle an estimated 80 per cent (some stakeholders 
estimate up to 95 per cent) of all disputes in Afghanistan, particularly in rural areas.66 A 
study released in 2009 documented deficiencies of the criminal justice system in connection 
with women. This has had an adverse impact on the right to life, as official figures indicate 
that, every year, approximately 2,400 women self-immolate owing to the hardships caused 
by gender-based violence. It is reported that self-immolation is often a cry for help to 
escape an abusive, violent family life and that, although not all women and girls who take 
such action intend to kill themselves, most die from their injuries. Common causes of self-
immolation include child and forced marriages, the handing over of girls to settle <i>baad</i> 
(disputes) and sexual and domestic violence.67 
</p>
<p>71. Cases of self-immolation are usually not investigated. Information received 
suggested that the authorities investigate very few cases where family members of women 
who self-immolate are alleged to have caused the act. This is reportedly due to the lack of 
evidence, but also to reluctance on the part of State authorities to investigate or prosecute 
such cases. This practice is contrary to the Law on the Elimination of Violence against 
Women, which outlaws the act of forcing another person to commit self-immolation. 
Similarly, under sharia law, a person who forces another person to commit suicide or harm 
themselves may be criminally responsible for the act.68

<p> 64 In 2010, women casualties increased by 6 per cent in comparison with 2009. Some 40 per cent of 
female deaths were caused by improvised explosive device explosions and suicide attacks. These 
figures represent a 31 per cent increase in female deaths and a 66 per cent increase in child deaths 
over 2009. Eight children were executed by anti-Government elements. Out of the total civilian 
deaths linked to pro-Government forces, 37 per cent were female. These figures represent a 62 per 
cent decrease respectively over 2009. Eight females and nine children were killed as a result of search 
and seizure/night raids across the country. More women were killed in the south-east than any other 
region as a result of such operations. See United Nations in Afghanistan, <i>Afghan women and the 
United Nations</i>, 2011, p. 2.

</b></p>
<p><b> D. Honour killings 
</b></p>
<p>72. Honour killings are crimes committed frequently in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221;, on 
suspicion of engagement in actions deemed dishonourable for the family as a whole. The 
motives of these crimes range from mere association with the opposite sex to sexual 
relations or running away from home, as highlighted by the previous mandate holder in his 
mission report. 
</p>
<p>73. Honour killings imply the killing of a family member, usually women, and need to 
be adequately addressed in the criminal justice system in Afghanistan. The Special 
Rapporteur recalls that, under international law and human rights standards, States are 
obliged to protect women from violence, such violence being a violation of human rights.69 
They also should ensure that mechanisms for prosecuting and punishing its perpetrators are 
available, effective and gender-sensitive.70 Such practices originate in entrenched 
discriminatory views and beliefs about the role and position of women and girls in society. 
In Afghanistan, harmful traditional practices have been further reinforced by the 
widespread poverty and insecurity that Afghans have experienced over the past 30 years.71 
</p>
<p>74. Afghan men and women interviewed by the UNAMA Human Rights Unit reported 
that many believed that practices subordinating women to the will of men and sharply 
limiting their realms of activity originated in the Holy Koran. Most harmful traditional 
practices are, however, without basis in religious principles or, in some cases, actually 
contradict religious teachings. Culture and tradition, sometimes viewed and used as a 
refuge during violent conflict, can be persuasive arguments for perpetuating practices that 
harm women, but should be distinguished from religious precepts.72 
</p>
<p>75. In response to the above and related concerns, the Government enacted the Law on 
the Elimination of Violence against Women in August 2009. The Law refers to &#8220;fighting 
against customs, traditions and practices that cause violence against women contrary to the 
religion of Islam&#8221; and preventing and prosecuting violence against women. Article 5 of the 
Law lists 22 acts, the commission of which constitutes violence against women. The Law 
itself, however, has been criticized because it requires a victim or her relative to file a 
complaint before State institutions for it to take action. This implies that, when a victim 
withdraws a complaint or fails to file one owing to family pressure or fear of reprisal, the 
State is not required to investigate or prosecute a crime of violence against women. 
Furthermore, women&#8217;s rights activists have criticized the law for failing to criminalize 
honour crimes and for not defining crimes clearly. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls the recommendations made by UNAMA in 2010 and urges the Government of 
Afghanistan to take all necessary steps to repeal article 398 of the Penal Code reducing 
punishment for killings perpetrated in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221; and to ensure that no law 
within Afghanistan is contrary to international law and human rights standards, by virtue of 
which the State is obliged to protect women from violence, which is a violation of human 
rights.73  
</p>
<p>76. The Law on the Elimination of Violence against Women obliges the Government to 
take protective and supportive measures in favour of victims and to educate and raise 
awareness about harmful traditional practices and other forms of violence against women. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>Prosecution offices must treat cases of violence against women as a priority and act 
expeditiously. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur shares the opinion expressed by 
stakeholders to UNAMA about the importance of raising awareness about the law&#8217;s 
existence and the acts it criminalizes, and of ensuring its immediate implementation, in 
particular of provisions aimed at eradicating harmful traditional practices and bringing 
perpetrators to justice. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>77. From February 2009 to April 2010, approximately 200 people were sentenced to 
death. No execution orders were, however, approved by the President of the Republic, 
whose signature is required to enforce them, according to the Supreme Court.74 During the 
first trimester of 2011, few cases were reported by the media concerning the carrying out of 
death penalties in Afghanistan.75 Additional information received by the Special Rapporteur 
in 2011 indicates that a number of death penalty convictions have been passed in 
Afghanistan, some of which would be subjected to <i>Qesas</i> (sharia punishment). 
</p>
<p>78. While welcoming the unofficial moratorium on capital punishment, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to impose a formal moratorium on executions and to 
consider abolishing the death penalty in Afghanistan. This call takes on importance in the 
light of the reported weaknesses of the justice system, including corruption, lack of due 
process guarantees and legal errors. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Transitional justice and the preservation of evidence from 
past crimes 
</b></p>
<p>79. In 2008, the previous mandate holder visited the site of the Dasht-e Leili mass 
graves in the north of the country,76 one of reportedly more than 118 mass graves that have 
been found in different parts of Afghanistan since 2002.  
</p>
<p>80. The Government is said to have attempted to take steps to investigate some of the 
mass graves sites, including the site in the Chimtala plains at the north of Kabul city. 
However, no reports or public information are available on such or similar endeavours.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, in November 2009, UNAMA visited the 
Dasht-e Leili mass grave in Jawzjan province, one of four sites of mass graves in the 
northern region of Afghanistan, and was able to confirm information received, highlighting 
irregularities. These included wheel tracks and evidence of excavation work in the mass 
grave, which could indicate that the bodies may have been moved or that the grave site may 
have been tampered with by governmental authorities and ISAF, which were supposed to 
guard and protect the site. Information received suggested, however, that the Government 
had not taken any measures to protect mass graves sites. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls the importance of evidence in the prosecutions of crimes and appeals to

</b></p>
<p>the Government, with the support of the international community, to take all necessary 
steps to address impunity by, inter alia, facilitating the investigation of human rights 
violations, including mass killings, which may be documented through the protection of 
criminal evidence available in mass grave sites.  
</p>
<p>82. In the light of the above, stakeholders have further highlighted the continued virtual 
absence of any judicial or truth commission-type accounting mechanisms for past atrocities, 
and alleged the presence of severely compromised individuals in Government institutions, 
creating a clear impression that no credible intent exists within the Government to ensure 
transitional justice.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Afghanistan continues to experience a non-international armed conflict across 
the majority of its territory, with detrimental consequences for the civilian population. 
All perpetrators of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions should be held 
accountable and all the parties in the conflict, be they Taliban, Afghan forces or 
international military forces, bear responsibility for unlawful killings and for 
reducing the number of civilians killed in the conflict.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made by Afghanistan, with the 
help of the international community, to address major issues of concern, such as 
impunity, corruption and a deficient criminal justice system. He also welcomes the 
moderate progress made in the area of legal reform. However, many challenges 
remain before the recommendations made by the previous mandate holder in his 
mission report can be implemented.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Extrajudicial killings remain widespread, and the numbers of killings continue 
at an unacceptably high level. The armed conflict continues to affect severely the 
country and its population, leading to continued violence and deaths.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the fact that no concrete action has been 
taken on many recommendations regarding threats to the right to life and on 
extrajudicial killings, and that the Government of Afghanistan did not respond to his 
request for information on the implementation of recommendations made in the 
mission report. He therefore encourages the Government to engage more actively in 
the follow-up to the recommendations made to improve the human rights situation 
and to reduce the unacceptably high number of civilian casualties caused by the 
armed conflict. </b></p>

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up action to recommendations made by 
the previous mandate holder 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Killing by the international and Afghan military forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The international forces should review procedures to ensure that air strikes 
and close air support are delivered only when sufficient measures have been taken to 
verify the identity of the target and that the incidental loss of civilian life would not be 
excessive in relation to the anticipated concrete and direct military advantage. 
</b></p>
<p><i> This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>2. The international and Afghan forces should review the circumstances in which 
they conduct unannounced night-time raids, to identify situations in which alternative 
measures, less dangerous to other residents, might be employed. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>3. Air strikes, raids and other attacks should never be based solely on conduct 
considered &#8220;suspicious&#8221; or on unverified &#8220;tips&#8221;. Rather, the Government and 
International Military Forces should review intelligence sharing arrangements, 
develop procedures for more reliably vetting targets, and ensure that attacks are only 
conducted based on adequately verified information. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> B. Killings by the Taliban 
</b></p>
<p><b>4. The Taliban should cease employing means and methods of warfare that violate 
international humanitarian law, and result in the unlawful killing of civilians. The 
Taliban leadership should issue clear orders to those carrying out attacks to abide by 
international law. This particularly includes the following: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> <b>To stop threatening and assassinating civilians in all circumstances, 
including for their alleged failure to cooperate with the Taliban or for their decision to 
cooperate with the Government</b>; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>(b)</b> <b>To cease using civilians as &#8220;human shields&#8221; to deter attacks by 
international and Afghan military forces</b>; 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</i></p>
<p><b>(c)</b> <b>To stop targeting civilians in suicide attacks, and cease engaging in 
perfidy (unlawful deception) during such attacks, including by disguising themselves 
as civilians, soldiers or police.</b> 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented. </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6  
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p><b>5. A serious effort should be made - including by human rights groups and 
inter-governmental institutions - to pressure and persuade the Taliban and other 
armed groups to respect human rights and humanitarian law. This effort should 
include developing contacts with them for the sole, dedicated purpose of promoting 
respect for human rights. Such efforts should be undertaken subject to security 
feasibility and in conformity with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1267.</b> 
</p>
<p><i>No information is available to assess any consideration given to this 
recommendation. 
</i></p>
<p><b> C. International Military Forces&#8217; responses to civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p><b>6. The international forces should ensure that allegations that soldiers have 
committed unlawful killings are fully investigated, and ensure that soldiers who have 
committed unlawful killings are prosecuted. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.</i> 
</p>
<p><b>7. The international military forces should cooperate more fully with outside 
efforts - especially those of UNAMA and of the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission - to investigate killings. This should include the expedited 
declassification and more comprehensive sharing of relevant information, including 
video footage and mission story-boards</b> 
</p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented and further steps are required 
to expedite declassification and more comprehensive sharing of relevant 
information by the international forces.</i> 
</p>
<p><b>8. At the conclusion of military investigations into killings of civilians, information 
on the findings and reasoning should be made public. Such information should be 
provided to the families of the victims. In particular, the reasoning of the US Court of 
Inquiry decision on the 4 March 2007 Nangarhar incident should be made public.  
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented  
</i></p>
<p><b>9. The international forces should ensure that, despite the complexity of multiple 
mandates and disparate national criminal justice systems, any directly affected person 
can go to a military base and promptly receive information on who was responsible 
for a particular operation, or what the status is of any investigation or prosecution. To 
this end: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Where the actions of soldiers are investigated or prosecuted within the 
troop-sending country, the progress of national processes of investigation, discipline 
and prosecution should be reported back to ISAF headquarters in Afghanistan; 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation. 
</i></p>
<p><b>(b) The progress and outcomes of national processes of investigation or 
prosecution should be centrally tracked by ISAF; 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation 
</i></p>
<p><b>(c) This information should be made available to the various regional 
commands, to the Provincial Reconstruction Teams under their command, and 
provided to directly affected persons when requested. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation </i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p><b>10. When a raid is conducted by foreign intelligence personnel and Afghan forces 
outside the ANA&#8217;s chain-of-command, the responsible Government should publicly 
clarify its involvement when allegations of abuse are made. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation. 
</i></p>
<p><b>11.  The international military forces should provide public information on the 
estimated numbers of civilians killed and wounded in air strikes, raids, and other 
military operations. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b> D. Compensation for victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>12. The various domestic and international compensation programs should be 
better coordinated. This might usefully involve a high-level policy body that would 
help the various programs to operate in a complementary fashion and an operational, 
information-sharing body that would allow for greater consistency and that would 
help prevent individual cases from falling through the cracks. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. <b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>13. Even where compensation programs involve <i>ex gratia</i> payments that carry no 
admission of legal liability, the discretion of commanders in deciding whether to grant 
compensation should be more limited, and general guidelines for making payments 
should be clearly set out. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b>14. Commanders should seek out victims and their families rather than waiting to 
receive a complaint or request. In particular, the obstacles women face in accessing 
compensation and other payments should be taken into account in implementing such 
programs. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation.  
</i></p>
<p><b> E. Afghan National Police 
</b></p>
<p><b>15. Ending unlawful killings by the police should be a priority. To that end, there 
should be a concerted effort to reform the police: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Human rights training, while important, will not be sufficient to prevent 
abuses that are driven by the links between police officers and particular tribes, 
commanders, and politicians. These links must be broken in order to establish a 
national police force that serves and protects the entire community; 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.<b></b></i><b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Continued efforts to reconstruct the police force as a truly national and 
professional force are vital. The &#8220;focused district development&#8221; training should be 
strongly supported; 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.<b></b></i><b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) All efforts to supplement the police by establishing or legitimizing local 
militias should be abandoned. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation.<b>  </b></i></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/28/Add.6  
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p><b>16. Hospitals should be required to report, to police precincts and police internal 
affairs, all cases where the police bring a deceased criminal suspect to hospital.  
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation.<b>  
</b></i></p>
<p><b>17. State Institutes of Forensic Medicine should be made fully independent from 
public security secretariats, and expert staff should receive employment guarantees 
that ensure the impartiality of their investigations. Additional resources and technical 
training should also be provided.  
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation.  
</i></p>
<p><b>18. The debate over whether the police force should play a primarily &#8220;law 
enforcement&#8221; or &#8220;paramilitary&#8221; role is unhelpful. At this stage the police are clearly 
obliged to play both roles and should be structured and trained accordingly so that 
they can provide security to the populations they serve. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation. <b> 
</b></i></p>
<p><b> F. Criminal Justice System 
</b></p>
<p><b>19. The proper investigation of crimes is hampered by poor coordination between 
police and prosecutors. The relationship between police and prosecutors needs to be 
improved: The Minister of Interior and the Attorney General should agree on how to 
cooperate on the combined process of detection and investigation of crimes, and 
simultaneously issue the appropriate orders to police and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><i>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess progress, if 
at all, on the implementation of this recommendation. 
</i></p>
<p><b>20. Impunity for killings by police must be urgently addressed: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The interminable dragging out of government investigations and 
inquiries into alleged police killings until such episodes are effectively forgotten 
reinforces impunity. Instead of setting up <i>ad hoc</i> inquiries that go nowhere, a national 
police investigative task force is needed; 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented <b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In addition, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission&#8217;s 
investigative powers should be strengthened and the Government should have a time 
limit within which to respond to its findings. 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b>21. The situation of women in relation to killings is largely ignored. The criminal 
justice system must be made accessible to them: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Initiatives such as women&#8217;s referral centres should be supported and

<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p><b>22. So-called &#8220;honour killings&#8221;, which occur in very large numbers, must be 
treated as the murders that they so clearly are. Police should investigate such cases 
whether or not the family has made a specific complaint to the police.

<p><i>This recommendation has been partially implemented. <b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>23. Measures should be taken to address the corruption that obstructs justice at all 
levels of the criminal justice system: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) An independent anti-corruption agency should be established by the 
Government, with international support, and endowed with the necessary powers and 
resources to prosecute important cases at all levels of government and the judiciary; 
</b></p>
<p><i>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</i></p>
<p><b>(b) Insofar as international aid money provides the resources on which 
much corruption thrives, the international community has a responsibility to assist the 
Government with anti-corruption efforts through a range of mechanisms, including 
the use of high-level appointment review boards.

<p><b> G. Transitional Justice and Preservation of evidence of past crimes 
</b></p>
<p><b>24. Mass grave sites, including the site at Dasht-e-Laili, must be secured and 
preserved by the Government of Afghanistan with international assistance. 
Investigations into the cause of death of persons whose bodies are buried there, as well 
as investigations into any allegations of attempts to remove such evidence, are 
necessary. Failures to do so will result in continued impunity for those responsible for 
past abuses, and will undermine the ability of Afghans to obtain an accurate historical 
record of past crimes that is so necessary to facilitate reconciliation in Afghanistan.
