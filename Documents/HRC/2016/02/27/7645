</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In early 2011, prior to the Human Rights Council&#8217;s decision to endorse the Guiding 
Principles and establish a new independent expert working group and annual forum on 
business and human rights, the Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Representative on business and 
human rights recommended that the Council give consideration to establishing a voluntary 
fund for business and human rights, with the primary purpose of addressing the capacity 
building needs of relevant actors for implementation of the Framework and the Guiding 
Principles.1 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Representative recommended at the time that the activities of such a 
fund should be overseen by a multi-stakeholder steering committee appointed by the High 
Commissioner or the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Human Rights Council. 
The Special Representative also proposed that a new fund would provide a mechanism for 
supporting a wide range of projects designed to increase the capacity of governments, 
national human rights institutions, business enterprises and groups, trade unions, non-
governmental organizations and others seeking to advance implementation of the Guiding 
Principles. It was also suggested that proposals might be submitted and filtered through 
United Nations Country Teams, which could help identify those with maximum likely 
impact and assist in monitoring their results. Finally, the Special Representative proposed 
that a fund steering committee should be able to call on external research and expertise and 
be serviced by a secretariat, administered by the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) and funded by contributions to the fund, which could come from 
both governmental and private sources. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution2 endorsing the Guiding Principles, the Council requested the 
Secretary-General to prepare a report on how the United Nations system as a whole could 
contribute to advancing the business and human rights agenda and the dissemination and 
implementation of the Guiding Principles, &#8220;addressing in particular how capacity-building 
of all relevant actors to this end can best be addressed within the United Nations system&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to that request, the Secretary-General submitted a report4 in 2012, which 
provided an overview of current activities by the United Nations system of relevance to 
business and human rights and explored how the Guiding Principles could be effectively 
integrated into specific areas of work, including by ensuring alignment of United Nations 
policies and procedures. The Secretary-General&#8217;s report noted that supporting efforts to 
promote capacity-building among relevant actors is one of the tasks assigned to the 
Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises, but clearly it alone cannot carry out the necessary activities given the 
scale of the task.  
</p>
<p>5. In terms of the wider United Nations system, the Secretary-General&#8217;s report 
highlighted that while a range of ongoing implementation initiatives by United Nations 
actors are important, they remain limited in scope and there was as yet no overarching 
organizational strategy in this respect, thus risking incoherence and fragmentation of efforts

</p>
<p>to embed the business and human rights agenda more broadly. The Secretary-General 
expressed the concern that in the absence of a coordinated strategic effort to integrate the 
Guiding Principles into existing policy and coordination bodies across the United Nations 
system, this agenda may not reach the necessary scale nor realize its full potential for 
impact.5 
</p>
<p>6. In addition to the need for greater capacity and alignment on the business and human 
rights agenda within the United Nations system itself, the Secretary-General&#8217;s report 
discussed the range of capacity-building challenges facing Governments, small and medium 
size enterprises, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations, trade 
unions, human rights defenders and other stakeholders, including individuals and groups 
that may be adversely affected by business activity. The report stressed that a core focus of 
capacity-building efforts should be to support groups that are particularly vulnerable to 
discrimination or to adverse effects arising from business activities, including indigenous 
peoples, migrants, women and children. It also highlighted the need to strengthen the 
capacity of human rights defenders, in particular with regard to access to effective 
remedies.6 
</p>
<p>7. The Secretary-General&#8217;s report made clear that the scale of the capacity-building 
challenge in this area is immense and cannot be carried out by the United Nations system 
alone. The report suggested that the need to create a significant capacity and funding base 
to enable large-scale interventions in this area would require the involvement and support 
of stakeholders outside the United Nations. The Secretary-General pointed out that a 
public-private partnership, modeled on efforts to address other global challenges, might be 
relevant for the design of a strategic response to address capacity-building needs in the area 
of business and human rights.7  
</p>
<p>8. The Secretary-General recommended that, given the scale of the challenge and the 
resource implications of meeting it: &#8220;&#8230;the feasibility of establishing a global fund on 
business and human rights linked to the United Nations, with multi-stakeholder 
engagement, should be considered. The primary purpose of such a fund would be, both 
within and outside of the United Nations system, to enhance the capacity of stakeholders 
seeking to advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. In its resolution 21/58, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
prepare a study to explore the feasibility of establishing a global fund to enhance the 
capacity of stakeholders to advance the implementation of the Guiding Principles. The 
Council requested that the study should explore relevant issues including how to secure 
multi-stakeholder engagement, governance models and funding options and that 
stakeholders should be involved in the study&#8217;s preparation through a consultative process 
using existing channels.9 
</p>
<p>10. This report has been prepared pursuant to Council resolution 21/5. In preparation of 
the report, the OHCHR requested10 all States and United Nations mechanisms, bodies, 
specialized agencies, funds and programmes and other relevant stakeholders to submit their 
views and recommendations. In addition to the call for written submissions, OHCHR

<p>organized a consultation session on the potential for a fund during the second annual United 
Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in December 2013.  
</p>
<p>11. In the present report, the Secretary-General seeks to advance multi-stakeholder 
dialogue and action concerning a new fund in this area, first by providing a brief contextual 
and illustrative overview of existing models of United Nations funds relating to human 
rights, as well as independently established funds with links to the United Nations system. 
A section summarizing the perspectives of stakeholders who participated in the consultation 
process follows this. The report concludes by offering a number of proposed next steps for 
consideration by the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of existing United Nations voluntary funds 
addressing human rights issues 
</b></p>
<p>12. The United Nations human rights system has extensive experience in establishing 
and administering voluntary funds on specific issues. Some of the voluntary funds 
administered by OHCHR focus on providing financial support to civil society actors who 
assist the victims of human rights violations, such as the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Victims of Torture and the Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. 
The Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations facilitates the participation of individuals 
and organizations in the activities of United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms. 
Each of these funds is administrated by the Secretary-General with the advice of a Board of 
Trustees, composed of five experts  (a Chairperson and four other members from the five 
regional groups). The OHCHR Secretariat of the Funds prescreens applications received, 
monitors and evaluates the use of grants and provides support to the Funds&#8217; Board of 
Trustees during their annual sessions. 
</p>
<p>13. Voluntary contributions to support OHCHR activities at headquarters and in the 
field are managed through other funds including: the United Nations Trust Fund for the 
Support of the Activities of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights; the United 
Nations Trust Fund for a Human Rights Education Programme in Cambodia; the United 
Nations Trust Fund for the Programme of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and 
Racial Discrimination; the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Participation in the 
Universal Periodic Review mechanism; the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Financial 
and Technical Assistance for the Implementation of the Universal Periodic Review; and a 
fund to respond to human rights emergencies through the rapid deployment of human rights 
personnel and the provision of necessary logistical support.  
</p>
<p>14. Most recently, a Special Fund of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against 
Torture11 was established pursuant to article 26 of the Optional Protocol to the United 
Nations Convention Against Torture, to assist States parties to the Optional Protocol with 
implementation of recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. As is the case with all of 
the funds administered by OHCHR, the Special Fund is governed in accordance with the 
Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and may receive voluntary

<p><b>A/HRC/26/20/Add.1 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>contributions from Governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 
and other private or public entities.12  
</p>
<p>15. In addition to the Voluntary Funds managed by OHCHR, a significant number of 
other United Nations Funds have been established in recent years which also support 
human rights objectives. For example, following the United Nations World Summit in 
2005, the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF)13 was established to strengthen the 
voice of civil societies, promote human rights, and encourage participation in democratic 
processes. Preference under UNDEF is given to projects implemented directly by civil 
society organizations. However, projects implemented, as appropriate, by government 
bodies, national constitutional bodies, regional entities, intergovernmental bodies and 
United Nations entities are also eligible for funding.  
</p>
<p>16. UNDEF is administered in accordance with United Nations Financial Regulations 
and Rules. The United Nations Office for Partnerships (UNOP) provides all financial 
management and administrative services on a reimbursable basis. An Advisory Board 
established by the Secretary-General provides policy guidance for the development of 
programme frameworks and funding guidelines, considers proposals for funding and makes 
recommendations on funding for approval by the Secretary-General. The UNDEF Advisory 
Board includes the seven largest Member State contributors as well as the Executive 
Director of UNOP, who serves in an ex officio capacity. Six other Member States are also 
appointed to reflect diverse geographical representation, including one Small Island 
Developing State; three individual members; and two representatives of civil society 
organizations. A Programme Consultative Group (PCG) provides advice to the Advisory 
Board on programme funding criteria and on project proposals, through the Executive Head 
of the Office of the UNDEF. Senior representatives from up to seven relevant United 
Nations system organizations, including OHCHR, appointed by the Secretary-General, 
serve on the PCG.  
</p>
<p>17. The United Nations also manages a number of Multi-Partner Trust Funds (MPTFs), 
managed by the United Nations Development Programme&#8217;s Multi Partner Trust Fund 
Office, which are increasingly set up to enhance coherence and efficiency at the country- 
and global levels and to increase joint United Nations activities.14 MPTFs are designed to fit 
the realities of a specific country or global situations. Nevertheless, they tend to have 
features in common, including involvement of a broad range of stakeholders, including 
national authorities, contributors/partners, and participating United Nations agencies in the 
decision-making process, as appropriate. MPTFs typically have the following governance 
elements: a policy body, comprising national authorities, the United Nations (and the World 
Bank where it is involved), which sets the policy for the fund;;  a  technical secretariat  that 
reviews programmes and projects submitted for funding; and a multi-stakeholder or similar 
entity (steering committee) that makes funding decisions. 
</p><p>18. One example of such a fund is the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund15, which was 
launched in 2006 to support activities, actions, programmes and organizations that seek to 
build a lasting peace in countries emerging from conflict. The Fund is currently supporting 
more than 200 projects in over 25 countries. Overall management responsibility for the 
Peacebuilding Fund rests with the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office, which

<p>approves projects and programs and monitors implementation. The United Nations 
Development Programme&#8217;s Multi Partner Trust Fund Office administers the Fund. An 
independent Advisory Group made up of 10 eminent persons appointed by the Secretary-
General, all with peacebuilding experience, provides advice and oversight.  
</p>
<p>19. The Peacebuilding Fund supports a range of projects including those addressing 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, as well as strengthening prisons, police 
forces and peacetime militaries. Other priorities for the Fund include projects that support 
good governance and promote national dialogue and reconciliation, as well as those that 
foster economic revitalization through the promotion of partnerships with the private sector, 
the development of micro-enterprises, youth employment schemes and the management of 
natural resources. The Peacebuilding Fund also supports projects that rebuild basic 
infrastructure, such as energy, transportation, safe drinking water and proper sanitation.  
</p>
<p>20. The approach taken by the Peacebuilding Fund is to provide resources to the United 
Nations Secretariat and agencies for implementation of projects developed in identified 
priority countries. Civil society organizations cannot access the Fund directly, but may 
implement projects through partnership arrangements with eligible United Nations agencies 
and organizations. All proposals must be submitted and endorsed by the office of the senior 
United Nations representative in the respective eligible countries, irrespective of the 
proposed recipient agencies. The Peacebuilding Fund does not seek to enhance the capacity 
of the United Nations to undertake peacebuilding activities but instead focuses on 
responding to country identified peacebuilding priorities, (via United Nations-sponsored 
programming) to deliver assistance.  
</p><p>21. Another model can be seen in the Fund for Gender Equality, which was established 
in 2009 alongside the existing United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women. 
Both of these funds are managed by the secretariat of UN Women. Since its launch, the 
Fund for Gender Equality has awarded USD $56.5 million to 96 grantee programmes in 72 
countries.16 The Secretariat of the Fund for Gender Equality is guided by a high-level 
Steering Committee composed of a rotating group of representatives from donor and 
programme countries, civil society organizations and multilateral agencies. The Steering 
Committee, co-chaired by the Executive Director of UN Women, advises on the Fund&#8217;s 
overall design, policies and vision and ratifies grant awards.  
</p>
<p>22. The Fund for Gender Equality supports women&#8217;s community-based, national or 
regional non-governmental organizations. Local or national governmental entities such as 
ministries of gender equality, finance, labour and justice; human rights and electoral 
commissions; local governments; and parliamentary caucuses are also eligible to apply 
under the Fund. Partnerships between a women-led non-governmental organization and a 
government entity or agency, as well as partnerships between two non-governmental or 
governmental entities are also permitted. The Fund supports multi-country as well as 
regional programmes. However, because the Fund for Gender Equality focuses on 
supporting local efforts and partnerships, international or inter-governmental agencies, 
United Nations and international financial institutions, private enterprises, large 
international non-governmental organizations, research institutions, think tanks or academic 
institutions are not eligible for support under this Fund.  
</p>
<p>23. Another example of a recently established fund is the United Nations Voluntary 
Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.17 This 
Fund, established by the General Assembly in 2010 as part of the United Nations Global

</p>
<p>Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, is similar in approach to OHCHR funds 
discussed above that support victims of human rights violations. It provides humanitarian, 
legal and financial aid to victims of trafficking through established channels of assistance, 
such as governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The Fund 
operates as a subsidiary fund of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 
Fund managed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and is administered in 
accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. This Fund also 
includes as part of its governance structure a cross-regional five-person group of experts 
appointed by the Secretary-General who serve as the Board of Trustees. 
</p>
<p>24. A final example, of direct relevance to the business and human rights agenda, is the 
Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund18, which was established in January 2014 in response to the 
Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh in April 2013. This fund has been established to 
pay the losses of the hundreds of victims of the Rana Plaza collapse, both injured workers 
and dependents of the deceased. The International Labour Organization is serving as the 
chair of the multi-stakeholder Coordinating Committee that will oversee the fund. The 
Committee is made up of Bangladeshi government officials and the Bangladeshi 
Employers&#8217; Federation as well as trade unions, civil society representatives and academic 
experts. International brands and retailers are making voluntary contributions into the fund, 
which is also open to contributions from all interested stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>25. As all of these illustrative examples make clear, an expanding number of human 
rights relevant United Nations voluntary funds now exist with diverse mandates. The 
experience of these and other United Nations trust funds should inform further dialogue 
amongst member States and other actors concerning the potential for a new dedicated fund 
to advance implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>26 In concluding this section, it should be noted as well that in addition to established 
voluntary trust fund mechanisms, the United Nations has continued to expand the reach and 
impact of its work through the creation of new public-private partnerships aimed at 
advancing key international objectives. For example, in the area of public health, the initial 
leadership of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank and other actors 
was critical to the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria19 and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).20 Both of these 
initiatives have now become independent organizations with international status and 
headquarters in Switzerland. Although United Nations representatives continue to be 
directly involved in various aspects of their governance and operational activities, these 
organizations have independent and fully multi-stakeholder governance arrangements. The 
approach of developing new independent entities of this kind should be considered as well 
as part of further discussion concerning the feasibility of a new fund in the area of business 
and human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of stakeholder views  
</b>27. This section provides a summary of stakeholder submissions concerning the 
potential for a new fund to support implementation of the Guiding Principles. The views of 
stakeholders are summarized around three central issues: a) the possible mandate for a new 
fund; b) how a fund of this kind could be most effectively governed, and; c) what issues 
should be considered with respect to sources of funding.

</b></p>
<p>28. It is noteworthy that in all of the written submissions received by OHCHR as well as 
in comments made at the consultation session held during the 2013 Annual Forum on 
Business and Human Rights, there has been universal support for the proposal that a new 
fund in this area would be a potentially useful mechanism. However, as the sections below 
make clear, there is also an understandable diversity of views concerning potential priorities 
and governance arrangements for a new fund that will require careful consideration and 
further dialogue involving all stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Stakeholder views on the mandate of a new Fund 
</b></p>
<p>29. Stakeholders hold a wide range of views concerning the most appropriate mandate 
for a potential fund to address capacity building needs with respect to the Guiding 
Principles. Most stakeholders who participated in the consultation process favour a mandate 
that would support a broad range of capacity building activities at local, national and 
international levels across all stakeholder groups. One submission suggested that a fund 
should prioritize multi-year capacity building projects rather than shorter term, one-off, 
projects or activities.  
</p><p>30. With respect to the types of activities such a fund could support, while nearly all 
submissions noted the value of awareness raising and training activities on the Guiding 
Principles for different stakeholders, there was less agreement in other areas as discussed 
below. Some submissions stressed the importance of a fund&#8217;s mandate addressing equally 
all three pillars of the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework which the Guiding 
Principles operationalise. Others proposed that a fund in this area would need to set clear 
priorities and therefore focus, for example, on supporting activities relating to the second 
pillar on the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, while still others stressed the 
importance of prioritizing third pillar issues relating to access to effective remedies for 
victims of abuses.  
</p>
<p>31. Some stakeholders suggested that a new fund in this area could be mandated in part 
to support the ongoing activities of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises (hereinafter, &#8216;the Working 
Group&#8217;). Others noted that a fund could usefully facilitate greater access to key documents 
relating to business and human rights in multiple languages as well as provide travel grants 
for stakeholders otherwise unable to attend United Nations meetings relating to business 
and human rights such as the Annual Forum. It was also suggested that the mandate should 
encourage projects that contribute to the development of good practice globally, are 
replicable and could be scaled up in the future. In this context, it was proposed that a fund 
should consider sponsoring expert meetings, and exchanges of experiences among 
stakeholders as well as diagnostic activities that build understanding of how to apply the 
Guiding Principles to greatest effect in a given country, business sector or on other clearly 
identified issues.  
</p>
<p>32. With respect to what actors should be eligible for support, submissions varied 
considerably. Some suggested that all stakeholder groups should benefit equally from a new 
fund. Others noted that the Secretary-General and the Working Group have previously 
stressed the need to assist human rights defenders as well as organizations that work 
directly with victims of rights violations involving non-state actors and that a new fund 
should therefore prioritize support for such actors. It was suggested in this context that 
priority should be given to projects and initiatives centered on those that are affected or 
likely to be affected negatively as a result of business activities. The potential for a fund to 
enable rights-holders and civil society organizations to play a watchdog role and perform 
research to monitor the implementation of the Guiding Principles was also noted. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/20/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>33. Prioritizing the empowerment of human rights defenders such as those addressing 
land and environmental related issues was proposed as well, in particular with regard to 
their efforts to ensure access to remedies for victims. It was suggested that the fund could 
also support projects that would build the capacity of affected workers and communities to 
use and test the effectiveness of grievance mechanisms consistent with the Guiding 
Principles. Still others stressed the importance of projects at the local and national level 
aimed at increasing the capacity of indigenous peoples and other marginalized stakeholders 
as well as activities directly proposed and implemented by these groups. It was noted in this 
context that organizations and groups, in particular indigenous peoples, should not be 
required to be legally registered in their countries of origin in order to obtain funds. 
</p>
<p>34. Some stakeholder submissions suggested that priority should be given to supporting 
activities, which increase the capacity of small and medium size enterprises, especially 
those operating in developing countries. A significant number of stakeholders also 
highlighted the importance of activities that would encourage multi-stakeholder cooperation 
such as worker/employer dialogue on specific human rights issues and new public-private 
partnerships focused on implementing the Guiding Principles in specific industry sectors or 
countries. It was also suggested that capacity building activities, designed in partnership 
with indigenous peoples, for State and private sector actors in relation to indigenous 
peoples' rights in the context of business activities impacting on them, should be 
considered.  
</p>
<p>35. A few stakeholders also emphasized the potential for a fund to assist governments 
with limited capacities to fulfill their duty to protect as set out in the Guiding Principles. 
The role of national human rights institutions in this area should also be considered.  
</p>
<p>36. With respect to the aim of mainstreaming the Guiding Principles throughout the 
United Nations system, most submissions noted that while OHCHR and other United 
Nations actors would be critical partners in ensuring the effective implementation of a fund 
in this area, priority should not be given to building United Nations capacities through the 
fund&#8217;s mandate as this would draw resources away from other actors with limited ability to 
access funding through other means. It was noted however that engagement by United 
Nations  Country Teams and all other components of the United Nations in capacity-
building efforts relating to business and human rights, especially in developing countries, 
was of importance and that grants administered by a fund should wherever possible 
coordinate with and encourage such engagement.  
</p>
<p>37. Finally, on the potential of a fund to include in its mandate evaluation and 
dissemination of good practices in this field, stakeholder submissions provided a number of 
possible areas for further study and dialogue. For example, it was suggested that a key role 
for a fund could be to build and host a global database containing good practices as well as 
identification of outstanding needs and opportunities for further implementation of the 
Guiding Principles around the world. It was also proposed that over time a new fund could 
potentially serve as a focal point for information and expertise and complement existing 
efforts by the  Working Group, OHCHR and other actors within and outside the United 
Nations system. In this context, it was noted that potential links between a fund and the 
Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, the work of the United Nations Global 
Compact and other United Nations partnership initiatives involving the private sector 
should be considered further as well.  
</p>
<p>38. The importance of ensuring effective coordination of any activities of a fund with 
the Working Group was also stressed, given its critical mandate to identify, exchange, and 
promote good practices and lessons learned on the implementation of the Guiding 
Principles as well as its role in providing support for efforts to promote capacity building 
and the use of the Guiding Principles by all actors. As the Working Group&#8217;s own </p>

</b></p>
<p>submission to the consultation process stresses, a new fund in this area should contribute to 
advancing the creation of a robust global regime on business and human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Stakeholder views on the governance of a new fund 
</b></p>
<p>39. Stakeholder views concerning the most effective and appropriate governance 
mechanism for a proposed new fund varied considerably. A large majority of submissions 
did indicate that OHCHR should be a key actor in administering a fund in this area. Some 
stakeholders also stated that the Working Group should play a central role in shaping a 
fund&#8217;s strategic approach. A number of submissions also stressed the importance of 
ensuring an efficient governance structure and limiting administrative costs. 
</p>
<p>40. There is less agreement amongst stakeholders concerning the extent to which a fund 
in this area should follow established United Nations voluntary trust fund models. Some 
submissions indicated that multi-stakeholder governance, with special emphasis on the 
participation of business in deliberations, was of importance in engaging a significant 
number of businesses as financial contributors to a fund and to ensuring its long-term 
impact. In this context, it was suggested that a multi-stakeholder governance structure could 
be another important way of ensuring that all stakeholders in the business and human rights 
agenda continue to work together to advance implementation of the Guiding Principles. 
Additional research and consultation was proposed in order to more fully consider the 
experience of funds and entities operating in other areas governed by multi-stakeholder 
structures, and to explore appropriate due diligence safeguards. 
</p>
<p>41. Other submissions stressed that any governance model should not only include 
representation of international civil society organizations, but also grassroots organizations 
which could contribute to integrating the perspectives of rights holders and local 
communities into decisions taken by a fund. It was also suggested that an outside 
organization with experience administering multi-stakeholder processes could be tasked 
with administering a fund assuming that necessary integrity and transparency measures 
were assured. A possible role for the United Nations Global Compact in the governance of 
a fund was also suggested.  
</p>
<p>42. A number of submissions indicated that some form of multi-stakeholder 
participation in administering a fund, consistent with United Nations Financial Rules and 
Regulations, should be explored further. For example, it was suggested that a multi-
stakeholder advisory board could be established to provide overall strategic guidance but 
should not have authority with respect to decision-making on individual projects to be 
supported or on matters relating to who can contribute or benefit from funding. Others 
proposed a Board of Trustees model based on established OHCHR administered voluntary 
trust funds. The importance of selecting members for a Board who are familiar with all of 
the relevant constituencies while ensuring independence of the collective decision-making 
in the approval of grants was stressed. It was also proposed that donors to a fund, public 
and private, should not have a direct role in governance mechanisms to avoid any conflict 
of interest.  
</p>
<p>43. Finally, with respect to monitoring and evaluation, some submissions suggested that 
grants could potentially be effectively administered and evaluated through existing United 
Nations agencies, including at national level, in order to minimize overhead costs. It was 
also suggested that an external evaluation of a fund after five years of operations should be 
planned from the outset. </p>

</p>
<p><b> C. Stakeholder views on sources of support for a new fund 
</b></p>
<p>44. On the subject of funding sources, stakeholder submissions were largely in 
agreement that a new fund in this area should be able to accept financial contributions from 
any actor, including States, businesses, philanthropic organizations and individuals. The 
importance of ensuring full transparency of donors and allocation of resources to individual 
projects was also widely highlighted as being key to establishing and maintaining a fund&#8217;s 
legitimacy and independence. A number of submissions stressed that securing broad based 
financial support from a range of governments, major businesses, foundations and other 
actors was also a key determinant of the independence and credibility of any fund in this 
area.  
</p>
<p>45. There was less agreement among stakeholder submissions on the most desirable 
level of donor involvement in the strategic direction and governance of a fund. Some 
submissions stressed that the most effective means to avoid potential conflicts of interest 
involving individual donors would be through developing a transparent governance system, 
and by ensuring that individual donors do not have direct influence over the criteria to 
select eligible recipients, funding priorities, or the allocation of funds. This view essentially 
favors governance and resource allocation being completely independent from donors to a 
fund.  
</p>
<p>46. In contrast, other stakeholders suggested that involving donors more directly was 
necessary both in order to attract donations, in particular from the private sector, but also to 
ensure effective decision-making and long-term impact. Some suggested that businesses 
would potentially be interested in making non-earmarked contributions to the fund in 
exchange for public acknowledgement of their support. From this perspective, ensuring that 
all contributions are non-earmarked is viewed as preventing the necessity of limiting the 
percentage of overall funding from any individual donor. Others suggested that further 
consideration should be given to the possibility of earmarked funding given the potential 
for attracting more donors to specific aspects of a fund&#8217;s mandated activities. 
</p>
<p>47. One suggestion proposed that further consideration should be given to requiring 
applicants to secure at least one other donor in addition to the fund, or to make their own 
financial contribution to a proposed project (consistent with the size and financial resources 
of the applicant organization), in order to be eligible for funding. This approach is seen, by 
those proposing it, to be one way of avoiding exclusive dependence on a United Nations 
fund, as well as encouraging more sustainable projects with the potential of becoming 
increasingly financially independent over time. 
</p>
<p>48. Finally, with respect to the issue of donors providing resources for a fund in addition 
to their commitments in other areas, some stakeholders suggested that competition between 
different projects, funds, agencies and institutions for limited resources was inevitable and 
therefore not a matter for further discussion. Others proposed that more consultation was 
needed in order to determine the extent to which significant additional financial resources 
could be secured to support a new fund. From this viewpoint, it was stressed that resources 
for a fund focused on implementation of the Guiding Principles should not jeopardize the 
maintenance of existing funding levels for ongoing human rights activities in other areas. 
The diversity of views of stakeholders on this issue indicates that more consultation is 
clearly needed to clarify a number of outstanding questions relating to funding sources.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>49.<b> As the Human Rights Council moves forward in its deliberations on the issue of 
enhancing the capacity of all stakeholders to implement the Guiding Principles, it is </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/20/Add.1

</b></p>
<p><b>noteworthy that there appears to be broad agreement amongst all stakeholders that a 
new fund would be a useful mechanism to advance implementation, and that such a 
fund should be able to accept financial contributions from any actor, including States, 
businesses, philanthropic organizations and individuals. There is also broad 
agreement on the importance of appropriate safeguards for legitimacy and 
independence, including by ensuring full transparency of donors and allocation of 
resources to individual projects as key to establishing and maintaining a fund&#8217;s 
legitimacy and independence.  
</b></p>
<p>50<b>. Given the importance that all actors have placed on the interrelated nature of 
the three pillars of the Protect, Respect and Remedy framework, it seems evident that 
the mandate for such a fund should be broad, with the ability to support projects to 
advance implementation and capacity building needs concerning the Guiding 
Principles at all levels of governance and across all relevant stakeholder groups. It 
also appears to be a widely shared view that a new fund should be designed in a way 
that will encourage further multi-stakeholder cooperation.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b> However, as the consultation process has indicated, there remains a diversity of 
views on a number of core issues such as the desirable scope of a potential fund&#8217;s 
mandate, criteria for eligibility and governance models that can only be resolved 
through further study and multi-stakeholder dialogue.  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> With these broad points in mind, more focused dialogue involving all actors is 
needed in order to make further progress and develop concrete recommendations for 
the mandate, governance structure and funding sources for a future fund. To this end, 
it is recommended that the High Commissioner for Human Rights leads a multi-
stakeholder consultation process to develop concrete fund model recommendations. 
The consultation should involve all relevant stakeholder groups, including 
representatives of governments, the private sector, civil society and grass roots 
organizations, the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises as well as other relevant experts from 
within and outside the United Nations system.  
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The experience of existing United Nations trust funds, public-private 
partnerships and other funding models administered through multi-stakeholder 
governance structures should inform these deliberations.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> OHCHR should, through the consultative process, develop concrete 
recommendations of model funds for wide discussion, using the third annual Forum 
on Business and Human Rights as a venue for garnering a broad-based stakeholder 
perspective. Following feedback at the Forum, OHCHR could  organize an expert-
level consultation in early 2015 with a view to developing a recommended structure 
and mandate for the fund, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council for their 
consideration in June 2015.
