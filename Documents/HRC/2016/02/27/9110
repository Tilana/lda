<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has developed this framework for communications into an online 
digest, which illustrates the international standards with pertinent excerpts of the mandate 
holders&#8217; findings since 1986 according to the categories of the framework for communications. 
The online digest is available on the website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/standards.htm).  
</p>
<p>3. Owing to restrictions on the length of documents, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged 
to summarize in this report the communications sent and received. As a result, replies from 
Governments could not be published in their entirety. The names of alleged victims are reflected 
in this report, although exceptions may be made in relation to children and other victims of 
violence in relation to whom publication would be problematic. </p>

</p>
<p><b>II.  SUMMARY OF CASES TRANSMITTED AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 January 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</b>4. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding Mr. <b>Sayed Perwiz Kambaksh</b>, a student and journalist at a local newspaper 
in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. According to the information received, Mr. Kambaksh was 
sentenced to death on blasphemy charges by the city court of Mazar-i-Sharif on 22 January 2008 
in a trial reportedly conducted in camera and without the presence of a defence lawyer. The 
blasphemy charges are related to a report that Mr. Kambaksh printed off the Internet and 
distributed to other journalism students at Balkh University, which was considered by the judges 
as having &#8220;distorted Quran verses&#8221; and &#8220;humiliated Islam&#8221;. According to reports, 
Mr. Kambaksh&#8217;s condemnation may be related to articles written by his brother and published by 
the Institute of War and Peace Reporting criticizing Balkh provincial authorities for corruption 
and abuse of power. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Afghanistan concerning the above mentioned allegations. Reportedly, the Appeal Court of Kabul 
overturned Mr. Kambaksh&#8217;s death sentence on 21 October 2008, but sentenced him to 20 years&#8217; 
imprisonment. The Special Rapporteur would like to take this opportunity to refer to her report 
to the 62nd session of the General Assembly (A/62/280), which discusses issues of concern with 
regard to blasphemy laws. In paragraph 75, she notices that there are worrying trends towards 
applying blasphemy laws in a discriminatory manner and that they often disproportionately 
punish members of religious minorities, dissenting believers and non-theists or atheists. In 
paragraph 77, she reiterates that criminalizing &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; can be 
counterproductive, since it may create an atmosphere of intolerance and fear and may even 
increase the chances of a backlash. Her predecessor, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, already emphasized 
in his report to the 56th session of the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/65, 
para. 111) that &#8220;several communications from the Special Rapporteur illustrate the danger that 
efforts to combat defamation (particularly blasphemy) may be manipulated for purposes contrary 
to human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Australia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 1 November 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the possible imminent destruction of a <b>sacred indigenous rock art 
complex</b> situated in the Burrup Peninsula, Dampier Archipelago. The summary of this 
communication is already reproduced in A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 4-8. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 23 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>7. Having submitted a preliminary response on 30 January 2008 (see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, 
para. 9), the Government of Australia sent another letter to the Special Rapporteurs on 
23 June 2008. This response letter is summarized in the communications report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people (see 
A/HRC/9/9/Add.1, paras. 21-31). 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Australia for the detailed 
response to the questions and concerns raised. 
</p>
<p><b>Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 18 January 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding <b>Shaker Mohammed Abdul-Hussein Abdul-Aal, Majid Salman Ibrahim 
Al-Haddad</b> and <b>Nader Ali Ahmad Al-Salatna</b>, members of the Unemployment Committee and 
human rights defenders who were released on 16 January 2008. Also in relation to the following 
eight remaining detainees: <b>Naji Ali Fateel</b>, member of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human 
Rights (BYSHR); <b>Mohammed Abdullah Al Sengais</b>, head of the Committee to Combat High 
Prices; <b>Maytham Bader Jassim Al-Sheikh, Ahmad Jaffar Mohammed Ali, Hassan 
Abdulnabi, Hassan Abdelnabi Hassan</b> and <b>Abdullah Mohsen Abdulah Saleh</b>, all members of 
the Unemployment Committee; and <b>Ebrahim Mohamed Amin-Al-Arab</b>, founding member of 
the Martyrs and Victims of Torture. All of the remaining detainees are being held at the Criminal 
Investigations Department in Adliya. 
</p>
<p>10. Reportedly, all of the aforementioned were detained after a series of arrests from 21 
to 28 December 2007 following unrest and protests. They did not have access to their lawyers 
until approximately ten days after they were detained. Some of the detainees were continually 
handcuffed for one to two weeks, including while they ate and slept. They were refused access to 
washing facilities and were forced to lie on a cold floor and beaten and kicked as soon as they 
fell asleep. Some were forced to stand for three days. They were not permitted to speak to the 
other detainees and remained blindfolded for most of the time. The detainees were also not 
allowed to pray.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Bahrain concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer to the general 
comment No. 22 of the Human Rights Committee which states &#8220;persons already subject to 
certain legitimate constraints, such as prisoners, continue to enjoy their rights to manifest their 
religion or belief to the fullest extent compatible with the specific nature of the constraint&#8221;. In </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>this context, she has addressed the freedom of religion or belief of detainees in her 2005 report to 
the General Assembly (see A/60/399, paras. 69-91). She would like to emphasize that persons 
deprived of their liberty are in a particularly vulnerable situation, also with regard to freedom of 
religion or belief. It is crucial to provide the personnel of detention facilities with adequate 
training, raising awareness and enhancing their sensitivity about their duty to promote and 
respect international human rights standards for the treatment of prisoners, in particular the right 
to freedom of religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 4 October 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding <b>Kunkhen</b>, an artist, and Mr. <b>Lobsang Phuntsok</b>, a 
30-year-old monk of the Lithang Monastery. According to the information received, 
Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok was arrested on 15 September 2007 following a raid carried out at his 
residence in the monastery by officials from the Lithang County Public Bureau Security. He was 
arrested on allegations of having established close ties with an artist named Kunkhen. Kunkhen 
was arrested on 22 August 2007 by Lithang County Public Bureau Security officials for having 
taken pictures of Mr. Runggye Adak on 1 August 2007 when he was addressing a large Tibetan 
crowd gathered for the annual Lithang horse-race festival (see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 69-74). 
The exact whereabouts of Kunkhen and Mr. Lobsang Phuntsok and the charges held against 
them remain unknown. In view of their incommunicado detention concern was expressed as 
regards their physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 21 December 2007 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Government of China indicated that it had carefully examined the matters referred to 
in the communication and wished to submit the following response. On 22 August 2007, 
Kunkhen was taken into criminal custody, in accordance with the law, by the Garz&#234; prefecture 
public security bureau, on suspicion of espionage and unlawfully supplying intelligence to 
bodies outside the country. On 12 September 2007, his arrest was approved by the Garz&#234; 
prefecture people&#8217;s procuratorate. On the same day, Lobsang Phuntsok was taken into criminal 
custody, in accordance with the law, by the Lithang county public security bureau, on suspicion 
of conducting activities designed to foment division of the State. Because the circumstances of 
his case involved only slight danger to State security they were not deemed sufficient to warrant 
a criminal penalty. On 10 October 2007, the labour re-education management committee of the 
Sichuan provincial people&#8217;s government, acting pursuant to the relevant provisions of the State 
Council resolution on labour re-education issues, ratified by the Standing Committee of the 
National People&#8217;s Council, ordered him to serve a term of one year and six months&#8217; labour 
re-education. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government of China emphasized that it abided by the law in protecting the freedom 
of religion or belief and the freedom of expression of citizens. Furthermore, it referred to the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and other international human rights instruments which contain provisions to the effect that 
rights and freedoms must be subject to the restrictions prescribed by law.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would like to take 
the opportunity to refer to General Assembly resolution 63/181 which emphasizes that 
&#8220;restrictions on the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief are permitted only if limitations 
are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of others, are non-discriminatory and are applied in a manner 
that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion&#8221;. In addition, she 
would like to reiterate (see A/HRC/6/5, para. 45) that the burden of justifying a limitation upon 
the freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief lies with the State and that the chosen measures 
should promote religious tolerance and avoid stigmatizing any particular religious community. 
Furthermore, the principles of appropriateness and proportionality need to be thoroughly 
respected both by the administration and during possible legal review.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 30 November 2007 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding Ms. <b>Jin Meihua</b>, 48 years old, from Hangzhou who was sentenced, on 
15 November 2007, to five years of prison for practicing Falun Dafa. She had been arrested 
by 17 police officers from Hangzhou City Xiacheng District Police Sub-Bureau on 5 June 2007. 
Subsequently, her family members were not allowed to visit her in detention. Furthermore, the 
police refused to meet with her lawyer and did not file his complaint. On 18 June 2001, 
Ms. Meihua had already been sentenced to 4 years in jail because of distributing Falun Dafa 
literature. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 13 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Government of China indicated that it had carefully examined the matters referred 
to in the communication and wished to submit the following response. On 18 June 2001, 
Jin Meihua was sentenced by the Xihu district people&#8217;s court in Hangzhou to four years&#8217; 
fixed-term imprisonment for the offence of organizing and using a heretical organization to 
conduct unlawful activities. She was released on completion of her term on 9 December 2004. 
</p>
<p>18. On 5 June 2007, Jin was taken into criminal custody on suspicion of the offence of using a 
heretical organization to conduct unlawful activities and, on 6 July 2007, her arrest was 
authorized. The Xiacheng district people&#8217;s procurator&#8217;s office in the city of Hangzhou laid 
charges against Jin for the offence of using a heretical organization to conduct unlawful activities 
and criminal proceedings were instituted against her on 30 September 2007 with the Xiacheng 
district people&#8217;s court. Hearing the case in open proceedings, the Xiacheng district people&#8217;s court 
established the following: Jin had been responsible for producing various materials propagating 
the heretical &#8220;Falun Gong&#8221; cult and, in September and October 2006, had distributed such 
materials in Wushan Square and other places in Hangzhou. On 5 June 2007, Jin had been 
apprehended by public security officers and, acting in accordance with the law, these officers 
had searched her home and seized large quantities of materials propagating the heretical 
&#8220;Falun Gong&#8221; cult.  
</p>
<p>19. The Xiacheng district people&#8217;s court established the following: in contravention of the laws 
and regulations, Jin had produced and distributed materials propagating a heretical cult, which </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>was a criminal offence, and then she had repeated the offence of producing and distributing 
materials propagating a religious cult and had used the cult to conduct unlawful activities. The 
court found that her conduct had constituted the act of using a heretical cult to break the law and, 
on 12 November 2007, it sentenced her at first instance to five years&#8217; fixed-term imprisonment 
for the offence of using a heretical organization to conduct unlawful activities.  
</p>
<p>20. Following her sentencing at first instance, Jin refused to accept the court&#8217;s verdict and 
lodged an appeal. Hearing the case at second instance, the Hangzhou intermediate people&#8217;s 
court determined that Jin had knowingly produced materials propagating a heretical cult and 
had distributed these materials; that she had breached the country&#8217;s laws and regulations; and 
that her conduct had been in violation of the relevant provisions of criminal law; that her 
actions had posed a danger to society; and that she should be held liable for the offence that 
she had committed. It found that the original determination of the offence had been accurate, 
the sentence commensurate with the offence and due process had been observed. 
On 22 December 2007, her appeal was overturned and the original judgement upheld.  
</p><p>21. The Government of China emphasized that throughout the investigations in this case the 
Chinese public security authorities at all times abided strictly by the law and enforced the law 
with utmost fairness and that there was no question of her being deprived of her lawful rights. 
During the conduct of these proceedings, Jin appointed two lawyers to act as her defence 
counsel, the lawyers conducted face-to-face meetings with her and the courts at both instances 
fully protected Jin&#8217;s rights in litigation. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. With regard to the 
question of &#8220;cults&#8221; or &#8220;sects&#8221;, she would like to refer to the chapter on &#8220;Religious minorities and 
new religious movements&#8221; in her report to the fourth session of the Human Rights Council (see 
A/HRC/4/21, paras. 43-47). The Special Rapporteur is very concerned by the continued 
violations of freedom of religion or belief suffered by Falun Gong practitioners (see 
E/CN.4/2005/61, paras. 37-38; E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1, para. 109; A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, para. 88; 
A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, para. 32). 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 20 March 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding reports of violence during demonstrations in the Tibet Autonomous Region 
and surrounding areas in China, killings of an unconfirmed number of people and arrests of 
hundreds of demonstrators. According to allegations received, demonstrations led by monks 
were organised on 10 March 2008 demanding greater freedom of religion and the release of 
monks detained since October 2007. It is reported that 300 monks from Drepung Monastery, 
near Lhasa, proceeded with a peaceful march towards the Potala Palace when they were stopped 
by the police. It is believed that around 60 monks suspected to be the leaders of the protest were 
arrested by the Public Security Bureau (PSB). </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1

</p>
<p>24. Sixteen people, including 15 visiting students monks in Sera Monastery, identified as 
<b>Lobsang</b>, aged 15, <b>Lobsang Thukjey</b>, aged 19, <b>Tsultrim Palden</b>, aged 20, <b>Lobsher</b>, aged 20, 
<b>Phurdan</b>, aged 22, <b>Thubdron</b>, aged 24, <b>Lodroe</b>, aged 30, and <b>Lobsang Ngodrub</b>, aged 29, 
from Onpo Monastery, Sichuan Province; <b>Zoepa</b>, aged 30, from Mangye Monastery; <b>Trulku 
Tenpa Rigsang</b>, aged 26, <b>Gelek Pel</b>, aged 32, and <b>Samten</b>, aged 17 from Lungkar Monastery, 
Qinghai Province; <b>Pema Karwang</b>, aged 30 and <b>Thubwang</b>, aged 30, from Darthang 
Monastery; and <b>Tsegyam</b>, aged 22, from Kashi Monastery led a march on Barkhor Street in 
Lhasa, distributing pamphlets and raising Tibetan flags. It is reported that they were arrested by 
the People&#8217;s Armed Police. Additional contingents of armed forces were then stationed in the 
area, and the police blocked roads and encircled Drepung and Sera monasteries around Lhasa to 
prevent further protests from taking place.  
</p>
<p>25. On the same day, about 350 people, including 137 monks from Lhutsang Monastery in the 
Tibetan area of Amdo in Mangra County, organised a protest in front of the Mangra County 
Assembly Hall where a government-sponsored show was taking place. The protest was stopped 
by the People&#8217;s Armed Police. A number of arrests took place during the disruption of the 
protest, but no information on the whereabouts of the arrested monks has been received.  
</p>
<p>26. Reports indicate that on 11 March 2008, 500 to 600 monks from the Sera Monastery called 
for the release of the monks arrested the day before and began a march towards Lhasa, but were 
met on the way by approximately 2,000 armed police. The crowd was reportedly dispersed with 
tear-gas. A number of monks were detained and then released. On 11 March 2008, the police 
surrounded and sealed off Ditsa Monastery in Hualong County in Qinghai Province after the 
monks held a protest. 
</p>
<p>27. On 14 March 2008, violent incidents were reported in Lhasa as tension escalated between 
hundreds of demonstrators and police forces. Gunfire was heard in the streets, and shops and cars 
were set on fire. Allegations that a significant number of Tibetans and Han and Hui Chinese have 
been killed during the demonstrations have been received. Monks from Ganden and Reting 
monasteries joined the demonstrations and the two monasteries were later sealed off by police. A 
number of monks from Sera Monastery started a hunger strike to protest against the sealing off 
of monasteries and the detention of monks.  
</p>
<p>28. Reports indicate that, in particular since 14 March 2008, the wave of demonstrations by 
monks and lay people has spread in the whole Tibet Autonomous Region and in neighbouring 
provinces. These demonstrations have reportedly sometimes been violently repressed, in 
many cases leading to arrests of demonstrators. Allegations were received that subsequent 
to 14 March 2008, the People&#8217;s Liberation Army had been patrolling the streets of Lhasa. 
</p>
<p>29. On 15 March 2008, shooting was reported inside the compound of Tashi Lhunpo 
Monastery in Shigatse, and at least 40 lay people demonstrating around the monastery were 
arrested. The next day, monks trying to escape the Kirti Monastery in Amdo in the Sichuan 
Province, which had been sealed off by the military, have allegedly been shot at; tear-gas was 
reportedly used on the demonstrators supporting the monks outside the monastery, and many 
demonstrators were severely beaten by the police. The police is then alleged to have shot into 
the crowd, killing and injuring a considerable but unconfirmed number of people. </p>

</p>
<p>30. On 17 March 2008, students of Marthang Nationality Middle School in Hongyuan Xian 
County, Aba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, aged between 14 and 20, started a protest inside the 
school. PSB officials blocked the entrance and beat the students while they were trying to come 
out of the school. Approximately 40 students are said to have been arrested. Around 700 students 
then staged a demonstration outside the Hongyuan Xian County PSB office to protest against the 
detention of fellow students. 
</p>
<p>31. Subsequent to 10 March 2008, it is reported that raids in the homes of people formerly 
imprisoned for their political opinions have taken place. Since 15 March 2008, house-to-house 
searches were allegedly being carried out in Lhasa, with CDs and printed material being 
confiscated, and people being taken in custody. It is reported that on 15 March 2008, at least 
600 people had been arrested in Lhasa, either as a result of a house search or during 
demonstrations. Three hundred additional people were reportedly arrested on 16 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>32. Reports indicate that on 13 March 2008, the Lhasa Foreign Bureau Office has issued a 
warning to non-governmental organisations that any information given to foreigners regarding 
the protests could result in strict legal action against the concerned individuals and organisations, 
including the closing down of the latter. On 17 March 2008, the authorities deported 
approximately 15 journalists from at least six Hong Kong television, radio and print 
organisations, accusing them of &#8220;illegal reporting&#8221; and of illegally shooting films of People&#8217;s 
Liberation Army soldiers. The journalists were escorted to the airport and put on a plane to 
Chengdu in Sichuan Province, and the police is alleged to have looked into the journalists 
computers and video footages. The authorities allegedly refused to grant permits to allow foreign 
journalists to travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region as from 12 March 2008, and are reported to 
have ordered them out of the Tibetan parts of Gansu and Qinghai provinces on 16 March 2008, 
the police reportedly saying that it was for their safety. Further reports indicate that within the 
country, video-sharing websites as well as news websites are inaccessible and that international 
news broadcasts are being cut when showing reports of the events in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region and surrounding areas in China.  
</p>
<p>33. On 15 March 2008, the Tibet Autonomous Region High People&#8217;s Court, Tibet 
Autonomous Region High People&#8217;s Procuratorate and Tibet Autonomous Region Public Security 
Department issued a notice, asking that: &#8220;1. Those who on their own volition submit themselves 
to police or judicial offices prior to midnight on 17 March 2008 shall be punished lightly or dealt 
mitigated punishment; those who surrender themselves and report on other criminal elements 
will be performing meritorious acts and may escape punishment. Criminal elements who do not 
submit themselves in time shall be punished severely according to law. 2. Those who harbour or 
hide criminal elements shall be punished severely according to law upon completion of 
investigations. 3. Those citizens who actively report and expose the criminal behaviour of 
criminal elements shall receive personal protection, and granted commendations and awards.&#8221;

</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 9 April 2008 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the

Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

</b></p>
<p>36. Subsequent to their urgent appeal of 20 March 2008, the Special Procedures mandate 
holders brought to the attention of the Government information they had received in relation to 
reports of killings, injuries and arrests of protestors in Gan Zi Xian, Sichuan Province, and the 
arrests of over <b>570 Tibetan monks</b>, including children, in Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige 
Xian in the Tibet Autonomous Region.  
</p>
<p>37. According to information received, at least eight protestors were killed on 3 April 2008 
and several injured when security forces opened fire during a peaceful protest in Zithang 
Township in Gan Zi Xian, Sichuan Province, calling for the release of two monks previously 
arrested. Several protestors were also arrested. 
</p>
<p>38. On 28 and 29 March 2008, over 570 Tibetan monks, including some children, were 
arrested following raids by security forces of the Chinese People&#8217;s Armed Police and the Public 
Security Bureau on monasteries in Aba Xian and in Ruanggui/Zoige Xian in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region. Arrests were made of those suspected of participating in protests and those 
suspected of communicating with the exiled Tibetan communities. 
</p>
<p>39. Serious concerns were expressed over the aforementioned arrests and detention of, and the 
excessive use of force against, the above mentioned persons, including reportedly peaceful 
protestors. Further concerns were expressed that independent observers and foreign journalists 
have been restricted from accessing regions in which protests have taken place and that 
limitations have been imposed on the media, including Internet websites, to prohibit the 
dissemination of information throughout China concerning the events in the Tibet Autonomous 
Region and abroad.

</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of China replied to the joint urgent 
appeal of 9 April 2008 and she hopes to be able to make observations on the response in the next 
report summarizing the cases transmitted to Governments and replies received. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 May 2008 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received in relation to Mr. <b>Lou Yuanqi</b>, a pastor and house church leader 
in Qingshuihe Town, Huocheng County in Xinjiang province, detained on a charge relating to 
separatism. Reportedly, Mr. Lou Yuanqi was summoned by the State Security Bureau to 
Qingshuihe Township Police Station at 1.00 p.m. on Friday 16 May 2008, and interrogated for 
an hour. At 11.30 p.m. he was transferred to Huocheng County Detention Centre on a charge 
relating to separatism. 
</p>
<p>43. Mr. Lou Yuanqi had been previously arrested on several occasions. On 20 October 2006, 
Mr. Lou Yuanqi and three other pastors were detained for organising a house church and 
held for 32 days, during which time they were allegedly beaten by guards and inmates. 
Mr. Lou Yuanqi&#8217;s 16 year-old daughter was detained on 28 February 2008 for a day, together 
with ten other minors, when they were attending a Bible study for children. This is the latest in a 
series of ongoing targeted actions against the small Christian minority in Xinjiang. It was 
reported in the previous month that Chinese Government officials had supposedly launched a 
strategic campaign, allegedly called the &#8220;Anti-illegal Christian Activities Campaign&#8221;. Pastor 
Lou&#8217;s case seems to be the second time the Chinese Government is using separatist charges 
against a house church leader, as the organization Uyghur Christian Alimujiang Yimiti faces trial 
the following week on charges of endangering national security. Concern was expressed that the 
detention of Mr. Lou Yuanqi may be directly related to his peaceful religious activities.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
China concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer to General Assembly 
resolution 63/181 which urges States to &#8220;step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of 
thought, conscience, religion and belief, and to this end to ensure that no one within their 
jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of religion or 
belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment or arbitrary arrest or detention&#8221;. Similarly, the Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/37 urges States to take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with 
international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities. </p>

<p><b>India 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 29 August 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning <b>attacks on the Christian community in the Kandhamal district of the 
state of Orissa </b>since 24 August 2008. Reportedly, the context of violence has been triggered by 
the murder of Swami Lakhmananda Saraswati, a local leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad 
(VHP), as well as four other VHP members, who were shot dead on the night of the 
23 August 2008. Before his death, Swami Lakhmananda Saraswati was reportedly active in 
opposing conversions away from Hinduism and negatively portraying the Christian minority. On 
24 August 2008, the State VHP General Secretary Gouri Prasad Radh told the Hindustan Times 
that &#8220;this attack is the handiwork of Christians. There were four home guards at the ashram. Had 
the attackers been Maoists, they would have first attacked these cops. Swami was fighting the 
missionaries for four decades. We see a clear Christian conspiracy behind this attack&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>46. Although the Christian leadership condemned the killing of the VHP leader and his four 
associates, attacks on Christians and their places of worship, as well as Christian-ran orphanages 
and businesses, began on 24 August 2008. The incidents have been focused on Kandhamal 
district, but other districts reported to have been affected include Angul, Bargarh, Baudh, 
Debagarh, Gajapati, Jajapur, Koraput, Rayagada, Sambalpur and Sundargarh. Many mobs 
reportedly carried out their attacks while chanting slogans in the Oriya language, translating as 
&#8220;Kill the Christians&#8221;. At least ten people have been killed so far, and the violence is continuing, 
putting many others in danger.  
</p>
<p>47. Among the victims, a nun was burnt to death on 25 August 2008, after a mob set fire to an 
orphanage in Phutpali in Bargarh district. Twenty children, who were at the orphanage, managed 
to escape but a priest suffered serious burn injuries in the attack. Pastors were also murdered on 
25 August 2008. They include Mr. <b>Nayak Samuel</b>, a Seventh Day Adventist pastor from 
Bakingia, and Mr. <b>Nayak Akbar</b>, a Pentecostal pastor from Mandakia. 
</p>
<p>48. Allegedly, the police delayed taking action and did not enough to protect the district 
population. Further, though the State Government announced on 25 August 2008 that a special 
team had been constituted to investigate the murder of the Hindu leader and his associates, this 
appeared to have had little effect on the violence.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
India concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to recall that the General 
Assembly resolution 63/181 urged States to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and 
discrimination based on religion or belief, notably by taking all necessary and appropriate action, 
in conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, 
intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on 
religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility or violence, with particular regard to members 
of religious minorities in all parts of the world. She also would like to refer to the press statement 
released at the end of her country visit to India on 20 March 2008, which had already referred to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>the widespread violence in December 2007 targeting primarily Christian communities in the 
State of Orissa. In the press statement, she had expressed concern about organized groups based 
on religious ideologies which had unleashed the fear of mob violence in many parts of the 
country and noted that law enforcement was often reluctant to take any action against individuals 
or groups that perpetuate violence in the name of religion or belief. She emphasized that this 
institutionalized impunity for those who exploit religion and impose their religious intolerance 
on others had made peaceful citizens, particularly the minorities, vulnerable and fearful. In her 
mission report, the Special Rapporteur also analyzes the vulnerable situation of members of 
religious communities, including Christians (A/HRC/10/8/Add.3, paras. 17-19), as well as the 
negative impact of laws on religious conversion in several states, including in Orissa 
(A/HRC/10/8/Add.3, paras. 47-52). 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 5 November 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the 
Independent Expert on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received concerning the eruption of <b>violence between the Bodo tribal and 
the Muslim communities in the Indian state of Assam</b>. Reportedly, the violence between 
members of the Muslim community and members of Bodo tribal groups in the Indian state of 
Assam started on 3 October 2008. The incidents that sparked this wave of violence remain 
unclear, yet there have been long running tensions between the two communities. Despite the 
large number of paramilitary officers deployed by the Government and the imposition of a 
curfew, mobs from both communities armed with machetes and knives fuelled violence between 
the two communities in the districts of Udalguri, Darrang and Baksa.  
</p>
<p>51. As a result of the communal violence, reportedly more than 50 people were killed, more 
than 500 houses were burnt and more than 80,000 people, both from the Bodo and the Muslim 
communities, have been forced to flee from their village and to seek shelter in camps set up by 
the Government. To counteract the communal violence, the government of the Indian state of 
Assam has allegedly issued &#8220;shoot on sight&#8221; orders to the security forces. Indeed, 25 of the more 
than 50 victims mentioned above were reportedly killed by police fire. 
</p>
<p>52. In addition to the above, coordinated bombings that killed 77 people and wounded more 
than 320 took place in the Indian State of Assam on 30 October 2008. Prime Minister 
Dr. Manmohan Singh strongly condemned the blasts and said that the Government would take 
all possible steps to bring the perpetrators of terror attack to justice. While responsibility still 
needs to be determined by the authorities, the Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen 
reportedly claimed to have committed the bombings. 
</p>
<p>53. As far as the inter-communal violence and the attacks of 30 October 2008 are concerned, 
the Special Procedures mandate holders urged the Government of India to take all necessary 
measures to ensure the accountability of persons responsible for the violence. They also 
requested that the Government adopts effective measures to prevent the aggravation of 
inter-communal tensions and to effectively protect individuals against further violence. </p>

<p><b>Observations

<p>54. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
India concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to recall that Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/37 urges States to take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity 
with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities. The Special 
Rapporteur would also like to refer to her recent country report on India, in which she analyzes 
the vulnerable situation of members of religious communities and of victims or survivors of 
communal violence (A/HRC/10/8/Add.3, paras. 17-41).  
</p>
<p><b>Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 April 2008  
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding an impending ban of the <b>Ahmadiyya community in Indonesia </b>and the 
potential risk of violence in this context. Reportedly, the Government advisory board Bakor 
Pakem (Coordinating Body for the Monitoring of Mystical Beliefs) on 16 April 2008 asserted 
that the Ahmadiyya faith was deviant to Islam and issued a recommendation that the 
organization and its activities be banned by the President. In a press conference on 
16 April 2008, the Assistant Attorney-General reportedly stated that &#8220;Bakor Pakem believes 
Ahmadiyya has continued to follow activities and interpretations that deviate from Islamic 
teachings&#8221; and that &#8220;all Ahmadiyya followers must cease their religious activities with 
immediate effect&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that an official ban of the Ahmadiyya organization 
would unduly restrict their believers&#8217; religious freedom. In addition, she stressed that a ban 
might increase the risk of attacks on Ahmadiyya followers by vigilante groups. There had been 
several reports of attacks against the Ahmadiyya community and of destruction of places of 
worship or homes of its members, for example in the villages of Manis Lor and Sadasari in 
West-Java. The violence had allegedly been spurred by a fatwa of December 2007 which the 
Indonesian Ulema Council submitted to the Office of the Attorney-General, calling for a ban of 
the Ahmadiyya community. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur stressed that restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or 
belief are only permitted if limitations are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public 
safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. In instances 
where one religious community might be subject to attacks, the appropriate state response must 
be to ensure their physical safety and to protect their freedom to worship. Limitations have to be 
strictly interpreted and must be directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which 
they are predicated. In addition, she referred to the criteria with regard to registration as outlined 
in her report to the Commission on Human Rights (see UN Doc. E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58): 
</p>
<p> (a) Registration should not be compulsory, i.e. it should not be a precondition for 
practising one&#8217;s religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal personality and related benefits;  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p> (b) In the latter case, registration procedures should be easy and quick and not depend on 
extensive formal requirements in terms of the number of members or the time a particular 
religious group has existed;  
</p>
<p> (c) Registration should not depend on reviews of the substantive content of the belief, 
the structure, the clergy, etc.;  
</p>
<p> (d) No religious group should be empowered to decide about the registration of another 
religious group. 
</p>
<p>58. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur urged the Government of Indonesia to refrain from 
issuing the ban of the Ahmadiyya community and to ensure the safety of all its members in 
Indonesia, not least since there have been credible allegations, including in the recent past, of 
violence against them. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 27 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 27 June 2008, the Government of Indonesia submitted a joint response to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s communications dated 21 April 2008 and 12 June 2008. The Government&#8217;s 
response is summarized below in paras. 62-66.  
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 June 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the promotion 
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning a joint ministerial decree with regard to members of the <b>Ahmadiyya 
community in Indonesia</b>. On 9 June 2008, a joint ministerial decree by the Religious Affairs 
Minister, the Home Minister and the Attorney General reportedly warned and instructed 
adherents, members and/or board members of the Indonesian Ahmadiyya Congregation 
(Jemaat Ahmadiyya Indonesia), as long as they claim to be Muslims, to stop the spreading of the 
belief that there is another prophet with his own teachings after the Prophet Muhammad. 
Members who disobey this instruction of the decree or who spread interpretations that deviate 
from the principal teachings of the religions in Indonesia are warned that they and their 
associated organizations will face legal action. Furthermore, the decree appeals to society to 
refrain from violent acts against Ahmadiyya followers. 
</p>
<p>61. On 1 June 2008, more than 500 people from the Islam Troop Command attacked 
about 100 activists of the National Alliance for the Freedom of Faith and Religion who were 
holding a peaceful rally for religious tolerance at Jakarta&#8217;s National Monument. 75 people were 
injured in the attack and several Ahmadiyya followers had to be hospitalised. Although police 
were in the area they reportedly did little to stop the violence and some police officers allegedly 
blamed the organizers of the rally that keeping the agenda of their peace parade had created the 
tensions. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 27 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>62. In its response, the Government first reiterated that in Indonesia, freedom of religion or 
belief was constitutionally established and protected. Moreover, there existed further guarantees 
concerning the respect of this fundamental freedom in various laws. In addressing the issue, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>Government of Indonesia had been mindful of the fact that incidents relating to the Ahmadiyya 
have multiple facets. As regards the doctrinal aspect of this movement, the Government of 
Indonesia noted that in recent years, the interaction of this movement with many communities in 
the country had created major social tension. The Government of Indonesia had endeavoured to 
solve the issue through dialogue with leaders of the Ahmadiyya. It had also promoted dialogue 
between Ahmadiyya and various religious groups in order to enhance mutual respect and 
understanding. The second aspect of this matter related to law enforcement. In particular, when 
there have been incidents of intolerance against the Ahmadiyya, the authorities had stepped in to 
ensure their protection in the same manner they were obliged to ensure the protection of ordinary 
citizens against violence inflicted by any group or persons. Following such attacks in the past, 
the perpetrators of the acts of violence had been detained for questioning and several had been 
brought before the law.  
</p>
<p>63. In light of the need to resolve the issue in a sustainable manner and to prevent its 
recurrence, the Government of Indonesia indicated that it had recently issued a specific decision 
on this issue taking into account the principle of freedom of religion as well as the need to 
respect the existing relevant laws and regulations in the country. The policy (joint 
decree KEP-033/A/JA/6/2008 or SKB No. 3/2008) contained, among others, the following 
elements: it does not outlaw the Ahmadiyya faith, but rather, orders its followers to halt their 
proselytizing (<i>Syi&#8217;ar</i>) activities and to fully respect the existing laws and regulations; it appeals 
to the Ahmadiyya followers to return to the Islamic mainstream religion and at the same time, it 
appeals to the people in general to refrain from acts of violence against Ahmadiyya followers. 
The issuance of such a decree was never meant to be an intervention by the State in people&#8217;s 
right to freedom of religion. It was merely an effort by the Government of Indonesia, as 
mandated by the Constitution and national laws, to uphold law and public order and protect the 
Ahmadiyya followers from any criminal attacks. The Government of Indonesia stated that the 
issuance of this decree did not interfere with religious doctrines or limit religious freedom.  
</p>
<p>64. As regards the acts of violence on the day marking the 63rd anniversary of Indonesia 
Pancasila (1 June 2008), it was reported that a group comprised of 500 individuals, called the 
Islamic Defender&#8217;s Front (FPI), attacked over 100 activists of the National Alliance for the 
Freedom of Faith and Religion during an interfaith rally on religious tolerance in Jakarta. In 
response to these acts of violence, there had been several measures taken by the Government, 
including the arrest of two leaders of the FPI. There had also been police investigations which 
have led to the arrest of several other individuals involved in the violence. In addition, the 
Government of Indonesia called upon the local communities not to attempt any other acts of 
violence or illegal actions against the Ahmadiyya community. Through the application of the 
laws on hate crimes, legal prosecution of those who attack members of the Ahmadiyya would be 
undertaken.   
</p>
<p>65. Therefore, as regards the Ahmadiyya, the Government of Indonesia was not of the view 
that this was an issue which exceeded the precepts of national sovereignty, nor was it one that 
infringed on the freedom to practice religions. Therefore, the Government of Indonesia was of 
the view that the solution to the issues concerning the Ahmadiyya needs to take into account the 
two-fold perspective, namely the preservation of public order and the protection of the 
Ahmadiyya followers from any criminal attack by a mob. In other words, the Government limits 
its role to the levels of maintaining public order and protecting its citizens.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>66. Moreover, while it is acknowledged that human rights are universal in character, the 
Government of Indonesia stated that it was generally understood that the domestic expression 
and implementation of human rights should remain the responsibility of each individual 
Government. This was consistent with the basic principles contained in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, in particular its article 29. The implementation of human rights 
implied the existence of a balanced relationship between individual human rights and the 
obligations of individuals towards their community. Without such a balance, the rights of the 
community as a whole could be denied, which could lead to instability and anarchy, especially in 
developing countries. The Government recalled that Indonesia was a multi-ethnic and 
multi-cultural country which prides itself of its harmonious mosaic of diverse communities 
living together and practicing several religious beliefs of their choice, as long as their religious 
practices do not infringe on public order and the well-being of the society as a whole. 
Additionally, the Government of Indonesia considered efforts in this respect, to form a vital part 
of its ongoing commitment to the eradication of religious radicalism and all acts of violence 
stemming from religious intolerance.   
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response of the Government of Indonesia. She 
would like to emphasize that article 18 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights states that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have 
or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice&#8221;. Each State has the positive obligation of ensuring 
that the persons on their territory and under their jurisdiction, including members of religious 
minorities, can practice the religion or belief of their choice free of coercion and fear. 
Furthermore, she would like to recall that the General Assembly resolution 63/181 urged States 
to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, 
notably by taking all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards 
of human rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation 
and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to 
hostility or violence, with particular regard to members of religious minorities in all parts of the 
world.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur notes that in its reply, the Government&#8217;s indicated that the joint 
decree KEP-033/A/JA/6/2008 or SKB No. 3/2008 &#8220;appeals to the Ahmadiyya followers to return 
to the Islamic mainstream religion&#8221;. In this regard, she would like to refer to the chapter on 
&#8220;Religious minorities and new religious movements&#8221; in her report to the fourth session of the 
Human Rights Council (see A/HRC/4/21, paras. 43-47). The Special Rapporteur reiterates her 
predecessor&#8217;s assessment that, apart from the legal courses available against harmful activities, 
&#8220;it is not the business of the State or any other group or community to act as the guardian of 
people&#8217;s consciences and encourage, impose or censure any religious belief or conviction&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/1997/91, para. 99). Similarly, in its general comment No. 22, the Human Rights 
Committee stated that &#8220;the terms &#8216;belief&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217; are to be broadly construed. Article 18 
[of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] is not limited in its application to 
traditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional characteristics or practices 
analogous to those of traditional religions. The Committee therefore views with concern any 
tendency to discriminate against any religion or belief for any reason, including the fact that they 
are newly established, or represent religious minorities that may be the subject of hostility on the 
part of a predominant religious community.&#8221; </p>

<p>69. The Special Rapporteur would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate her wish to 
visit Indonesia in the framework of her mandate (see E/CN.4/2006/5, para. 23; A/60/399, 
para. 27; A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, para. 176). On 15 April 2008 and on 21 July 2008 she sent 
follow-up letters to the Government requesting an invitation to visit Indonesia. The Government 
of Indonesia replied with letters dated 27 May 2008 and 29 September 2008, indicating that, in 
view of the legislative and presidential elections due to be held in the course of 2009, the 
Government felt it was unlikely that any visits by United Nations human rights mechanisms 
would be possible before some time in 2010 at the earliest and that, consequently, a decision 
regarding an invitation and the setting of dates for the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit should best be 
left to the future Government to make once it had been able to establish its own agenda.

minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions 
</b></p>
<p>70. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding the recent increase of the number of <b>targeted attacks 
against members of the Christian minority in the city of Mosul</b>. On 7 October 2008, 
members of the Christian minority living in east Mosul, namely Mr. <b>Amjad Hadi Putres</b> and his 
son <b>Hussam</b>, Mr. <b>Zeyad Kamal</b>, as well as a pharmacist&#8217;s assistant in al-Tahrir neighborhood, 
were killed. On 8 October 2008, Mr. <b>Hazim Toma</b> was killed when unknown gunmen shot at 
him in Bab Ul Sarai market, in west Mosul. On 11 October 2008, two people were killed after 
the perpetrator had requested to see the victims&#8217; identity cards, which state the religious 
affiliation of the bearer. On 12 October 2008, three vacated Christian homes with furniture and 
belongings still inside were firebombed in al-Sukr neighborhood of Mosul. Since late September, 
the total number of Christians killed is estimated at twenty and more than 200 Christian families 
have reportedly fled certain neighborhoods of Mosul to find shelter with host families. The main 
destination of these internally displaced persons would be in the al-Hamdaniya and Tilkaif 
districts (southeast and north of Mosul).  
</p>
<p>71. In addition to the above, in early October 2008, some members of the Christian community 
were threatened in anonymous leaflets to either convert to Islam, pay a &#8220;tribute&#8221; or be killed. The 
date of 11 October 2008 was specified as the deadline to comply. 
</p>
<p>72. While States&#8217; authorities might not be directly responsible for the alleged violations above, 
the Special Procedures mandate holders stressed that according to article 4 of the Declaration on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief, 
all States shall take effective measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination on the grounds of 
religion or belief in the recognition, exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in all fields of civil, economic, political, social and cultural life. Similarly, they 
recalled that Human Rights Council resolution 6/37 urges States to take all necessary and 
appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, 
intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on 
religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to 
religious minorities.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Iraq concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer to Human Rights 
Committee general comment No. 22 (1993), in which the Committee underlined that no one can 
be compelled to reveal his thoughts or adherence to a religion or belief. As stated in her latest 
report to the General Assembly (see A/63/161, paragraph 77), indicating a person&#8217;s religious 
affiliation on official documents carries a serious risk of abuse or subsequent discrimination 
based on religion or belief, which has to be weighed against the possible reasons for disclosing 
the holder&#8217;s religion. In addition, the General Assembly resolution 63/181 urged States to step up 
their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, and to this 
end, &#8220;to ensure that [&#8230;] everyone has the right to refrain from disclosing information concerning 
one&#8217;s religious affiliation on [official documents] against one&#8217;s will.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 28 November 2008 jointly with the Independent Expert on 
minority issues  
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding incidents involving <b>members of the Sabian Mandaean 
community in Iraq</b>. These incidents include threats to convert to Islam, kidnappings and 
killings. As a result, a significant number of Sabian Mandaeans have reportedly been compelled 
to flee to the neighbouring States of Jordan and Syria.  
</p>
<p>75. On 23 February 2001, the daughter of Mr. and Ms. <b>Al-Sabiri Rawdha</b> was abducted from 
her school by a 56 year-old man who subsequently forced her to marry him. Later, Mr. and 
Ms. Al-Sabiri Rawdha received a call telling them not to attempt to call their daughter, since 
they were infidels. To that day, the parents have received no further information about their 
daughter. On 23 December 2006, the son of Mr. and Ms. Al-Sabiri Rawdha was kidnapped while 
he was on his way home from work. As a hostage, he was assaulted, cursed and beaten. He was 
later released, following the payment of a USD 50,000 ransom.  
</p>
<p>76. In October 2007, Mr. <b>Al-Sabiri Abdulnabi </b>was kidnapped. Ms. Al-Sabiri paid a 
USD 40,000 ransom to release him, but he was later found dead, thrown on the roadside.   
</p>
<p>77. On 17 November 2007, Mr. <b>Al-Nashi Khaldoon</b> and Mr. <b>Al-Nashi Lareen</b>, both Sabian 
Mandaeans, were on their way to deliver some goldsmith work to the market in Baghdad. Their 
car was blocked on the way by unknown armed men who killed both of them and threw a paper 
inside their car, saying it was the certain fate of those &#8220;Sabian Mandaeans infidels&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>78. On 26 March 2008, the house of the <b>Al-Hilali</b> family in Wasset has been destroyed by a 
mortar or RPG-7 attack and ten members of this Sabian Mandaean family died. Only 
one member of the family survived. The family had been previously threatened because of their 
membership to the Sabian Mandaean community. They had therefore decided to move out of 
their house and came back after a while. Six days after they returned, their house was destroyed.   
</p>
<p>79. On 9 September 2008, three male members of the <b>Al-Sabiri</b> family in Al-Sha&#8217;ab 
neighbourhood in Baghdad, were killed in a jewellery shop by unknown armed men. Before that, 
Mr. Al-Sabiri had been threatened and shot at near the same shop, for being an &#8220;infidel 
Sabian Mandaean&#8221;. He had been told to leave the country. </p>

Communication sent on 30 August 2007 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
</b>81. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received concerning Shi&#8217;a cleric Ayatollah <b>Seyed Hossein Kazemeini 
Boroujerdi</b>, Iranian citizen, aged 49, who had been the subject of a joint urgent appeal dated 
20 December 2006. According to the new information received, Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s trial was held 
on 10 June 2007 before the Special Court for the Clergy. He was denied legal counsel. It was 
unclear whether he was sentenced to death or whether his case was still under consideration. 
Allegedly the trial was related to Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s religious views since he supports freedom of 
religion and the separation between religion and politics. Mr. Boroujerdi was detained in Evin 
prison, where, on top of the severe conditions of detention, he was beaten and had cold water 
spilled on him while he was sleeping. Although he suffered from Parkinson&#8217;s disease, diabetes, 
high blood pressure and heart problems, Mr. Boroujerdi was reportedly denied permission to 
seek treatment at the prison&#8217;s medical facility until he started a hunger strike on 22 July 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 14 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>82. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran informed that Seyed Hossein Kazemeini 
Boroujerdi had been Imam of Hemmatabad Mosque in Tehran since 1980, but due to 
misrepresentation of Islamic issues and unusual allegations on having metaphysical/heavenly 
relations aiming at creating a new sect with extremist inclinations, he was summoned to the 
Special Court for the Clergy in 1995. Pursuant to the Court investigations and testimony of his 
teachers, his knowledge of Islamic teachings had been found as being too preliminary to allow 
him to continue to preach in the mosque. Following the passing away of his father (who was 
Imam of Nour mosque in Tehran), who he was not allowed to replace in the mosque, 
Mr. Boroujerdi committed, according to the Government, the following new illegal and 
anti-Islamic teaching acts:  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p> (a) Unusual allegations on having metaphysical/heavenly relations and creating a new 
sect with extremist inclinations: In religious societies, while freedom of expression of religion is 
respected and observed, actions which are a demonstration of distortion, falsification and 
attribution of incorrect issues to religious sanctities are rejected. With resort to incorrect and 
misleading teachings and attribution of unreal issues to religious sanctities, Mr. Boroujerdi 
succeeded in deceiving a number of people as followers and setting them as the center of the sect 
through which they perpetrated offences such as damaging public property, arson of a few 
motorcycles and buses, as well as holding two J-3 machine guns; 
</p>
<p> (b) Publication of lies and disturbing public opinion: Mr. Boroujerdi considered the 
passing away of his father in 2002, due to old age, as being suspicious. Without seeking legal 
assistance to prove his allegation, he labelled it as murder and on that basis, introduced himself 
as the son of the oppressed and killed jurisprudent. As a result, he made false statements against 
police authorities and attributed unreal allegations to them. He also claimed that he was in 
danger of getting assassinated, with the intention of deceiving public opinion and inciting his 
followers to resort to acts of violation. Since 30 July 2006, he had been recommended to 
discontinue his inappropriate and illegal actions, and unfortunately, he not only ignored the 
well-wishing recommendations, but incited public opinion against state officials by telling his 
followers that &#8220;they have the verdict to kill me. They have announced their full preparedness for 
attacking us and I make blood ablution from now. Go home for farewell with your family and 
come back here to be killed together&#8221;. The audio of this statement was also put on websites; 
</p>
<p> (c) Incitement to violation: Following the incitement of his followers to gathering and 
clashing with police forces at midnight of 3 November 2006 (three days before his arrest), they 
gathered around his house carrying stabs, knives and swords. They shouted slogans creating fear 
and terror in the neighbourhood until the following morning and set-up check points for the 
passing cars and passer-bys. They even attacked passer-bys, including a clergyman and 
destroyed a police vehicle. At this gathering, Mr. Boroujerdi delivered a speech and further 
instigated the followers. The gathering continued on 4 and 5 November 2006. All those 
gatherings met on the invitation of Mr. Boroujerdi, during which he openly stated that the 
Government of Iran was an oppressor and judges were not competent to try him in court and 
only the Promised Innocent Imam could put him on trial, repeating that the Government had 
killed his father. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Court for the Clergy investigated the case and on the basis of the existing 
evidence and repetition of offences, sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment. Any allegation 
on his sentence to death is a distortion of realities and is categorically denied. The Government 
indicated that no one is put on trial in the Islamic Republic of Iran because of his/her belief and, 
as described above, Mr. Boroujerdi&#8217;s trial was in accordance with the rule of law and merely in 
relation with his illegal and violent activities. The allegation of his activities in supporting 
freedom of religion and separation between religion and politics was not but an instrument to 
cover his mal-intended activities, and deceiving international human rights bodies. The 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran also stated that Mr. Boroujerdi enjoyed all his legal 
rights before the court of justice. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response of the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. With regard to the question of &#8220;cults&#8221; or &#8220;sects&#8221;, she would like to refer to the 
chapter on &#8220;Religious minorities and new religious movements&#8221; in her report to the 
fourth session of the Human Rights Council (see A/HRC/4/21, paras. 43-47). The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates her predecessor&#8217;s assessment that, apart from the legal courses available 
against harmful activities, &#8220;it is not the business of the State or any other group or community to 
act as the guardian of people&#8217;s consciences and encourage, impose or censure any religious 
belief or conviction&#8221; (E/CN.4/1997/91, para. 99). Similarly, in its general comment No. 22, the 
Human Rights Committee stated that &#8220;the terms &#8216;belief&#8217; and &#8216;religion&#8217; are to be broadly 
construed. Article 18 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] is not limited 
in its application to traditional religions or to religions and beliefs with institutional 
characteristics or practices analogous to those of traditional religions. The Committee therefore 
views with concern any tendency to discriminate against any religion or belief for any reason, 
including the fact that they are newly established, or represent religious minorities that may be 
the subject of hostility on the part of a predominant religious community.&#8221;  
</p><p>85. The Special Rapporteur also would like to emphasize that limitations to freedom of 
expression and freedom of religion or belief are strictly defined in international law, for example 
in articles 18 (3), 19 (3) and 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In 
this regard, she would like to refer to the report on the expert seminar on &#8220;Freedom of expression 
and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence&#8221;, convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and held in 
Geneva on 2 and 3 October 2008 (see A/HRC/10/31/Add.3). 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 21 January 2008 jointly with the Chairperson of the Working Group

</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received concerning the arrest and continued detention of 
Ms. <b>Haleh Roohi</b>, Ms. <b>Raha Sabet</b> and Mr. <b>Sassan Taqva</b>. These three members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
community in the city of Shiraz have already been the subject of two joint communications sent 
on 9 June 2006 and 13 June 2006 (see A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, paras. 195-203 and the summary of 
the Government&#8217;s reply in paras. 204-205). According to new allegations, subsequent to the 
arrest and temporary detention of Ms. Haleh Roohi, Ms. Raha Sabet and Mr. Sassan Taqva in 
May 2006, a court in Shiraz sentenced each of them in August 2007 to a total of four years&#8217; 
imprisonment. They were accused of having engaged in indirect teaching of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; faith, on 
the grounds that their educational programme was based on a Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;-inspired publication 
characterized by the court as having been produced by the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s &#8220;to teach the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; children 
how to teach their Faith&#8221;. The court argued that the permit for the educational programme had 
been obtained by deceiving the city&#8217;s cultural and executive organizations and that the intention 
had in fact been to teach the faith indirectly. Their sentence consisted of three years for 
organizing illegal groups and an additional year for teaching on behalf of groups that are against 
the Islamic regime. 
</p>
<p>87. On 19 November 2007, the three members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community were told by 
telephone to go to the Shiraz office of the Ministry of Information to retrieve items that had been </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>confiscated from them when they were arrested in May 2006. When they did not return within a 
reasonable time, family members who had accompanied them were given conflicting 
information by Information Ministry officials, including that the three Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s had not entered 
the building, whereas their relatives had seen them do so.  
</p>
<p>88. Ms. Haleh Roohi, Ms. Raha Sabet and Mr. Sassan Taqva are reportedly being held at the 
detention centre of the Ministry of Information in Shiraz. The reason for their detainment at this 
facility is not known. Since the Information Ministry does not have the right under Iranian law to 
imprison citizens but only to detain individuals for the purpose of interrogation there are serious 
concerns about their safety. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer 
to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms 
and to the mandate practice concerning the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief and the 
teaching and dissemination of materials, including missionary activity (see above, para. 1, 
category I.3.f).  
</p>

paras. 121-122) and the Government&#8217;s reply of 20 June 2007 (A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, para. 123), 
the Special Rapporteur indicated that the dates of the passing away of Ms. <b>Bihnam Saltanat 
Akhdari</b>,<b> </b>16 February 2007, and of Ms. <b>Shah Baygum Diqhani</b>, 7 March 2007, were already 
indicated in the original communication. In addition, she indicated that Ms. <b>Akhdari</b> was an 
85-year-old resident of Abbas Abad, a dependency of Abadeh in Shiraz and that Ms. Diqhani 
lived in Mohammadiyyeh in the province of Isfahan. 
</p>
<p>91. With regard to the alleged denial of <b>access to education for Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s</b>, the Special 
Rapporteur provided a list of 104 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; students who allegedly were expelled from Iranian 
universities in 2007 as well as their fields of study. According to further information she had 
received, Mr. Asghar Zarei, Director General of the Central Security Office in 2006 issued a 
confidential communication M/2/3/9378 to 81 universities in the Islamic Republic of Iran. These 
universities were instructed to expel any student who is discovered to be a Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;, whether at the 
time of enrolment or in the course of his or her studies. The communication indicated that the 
Ministry&#8217;s instructions were being promulgated under the provision of decree number 1327/M/S, 
referring to the memorandum on &#8220;the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; question&#8221; from the Iranian Supreme Revolutionary 
Council, approved by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei. One of its provisions was reported as follows: &#8220;when a student is known to be a 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;, he shall be expelled from university, either during the admission process or in the course 
of the academic year&#8221; (see the report of the former UN Special Representative on Iran,

<p>92. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer 
to the general comment No. 22 (1993) of the Human Rights Committee which states that 
&#8220;Article 18.2 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] bars coercion that 
would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use of threat of physical 
force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs 
and congregations, to recant their religion or belief or to convert. Policies or practices having the 
same intention or effect, such as, for example, those restricting access to education, medical care, 
employment or the rights guaranteed by article 25 and other provisions of the Covenant, are 
similarly inconsistent with article 18.2&#8221;. In addition, she also would like to make reference to her 
most recent report to the Human Rights Council (see A/HRC/10/8, paras. 29-62) which raises the 
issue of discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to education (see paras. 49-51).

Mr. <b>Behrouz Tavakkoli</b>, Mr. <b>Vahid Tizfahm</b> and Ms. <b>Mahvash Sabet</b>, who are residents of 
Teheran. Reportedly, these seven members of a group that coordinates the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community&#8217;s 
religious and administrative affairs in Iran had been arrested and were detained in Evin prison in 
Teheran. On 14 May 2008, officers of the Intelligence Ministry in Teheran entered the homes of 
Ms. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, 
Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm. These six Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members were subsequently 
arrested and brought to Evin prison where they joined the acting Secretary for their informal 
national-level coordinating group, Ms. Mahvash Sabet. Ms. Sabet had been held in custody since 
5 March 2008 when she was summoned to Mashhad by the Intelligence Ministry to answer 
questions related to the burial of an individual in the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; cemetery in that city. The Special 
Procedures mandate holders expressed the fear that these seven Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members were arrested 
because of their religious beliefs or their peaceful activities on behalf of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. She followed-up this 
case and transmitted further allegations in her communication sent to the Government on 
17 October 2008 (please see below in paras. 101-112). The Special Rapporteur is very much 
concerned about the arrest and detention of the seven members of a group that coordinates the 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community&#8217;s religious and administrative affairs in the Islamic Republic of Iran. She 
would like to take this opportunity to refer to General Assembly resolution 63/181 which 
&#8220;[r]ecognizes with concern the situation of persons in vulnerable situations, including persons </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty, refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced persons, children, 
persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and migrants, as 
regards their ability to freely exercise their right to freedom of religion or belief&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 17 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding the Iranian Parliament vote on 9 September 2008 in favour of a <b>bill 
stipulating the death penalty for apostasy</b>. Reportedly, the Iranian Parliament voted on 
Tuesday 9 September 2008 in favour of a bill stipulating the death penalty for apostasy. The 
approved bill will be sent back to the Legislative Commission to debate proposed amendments 
before it is brought before the Iranian Parliament for a further vote. Reportedly, the bill would 
add a number of crimes to the list of those resulting in execution, such as the establishment of 
weblogs and sites promoting corruption, prostitution and apostasy. 
</p>
<p>96. If the proposed legislation on apostasy passes unchallenged through the final parliamentary 
processes and is enacted into law, Mr. <b>Mahmoud Mohammad Matin-Azad</b> and Mr. <b>Arash 
Ahmad-Ali Basirat</b>, two Christians from Muslim background, may as a result face capital 
punishment. Both men were recently charged with apostasy at the Revolutionary Court in Shiraz 
and have been in detention since 15 May 2008.  
</p>
<p>97. In addition, Mr. <b>Ramtin Soodmand</b>, who works for a church in Tehran, was arrested 
on 20 August 2008, following a phone call from Ministry of Intelligence officials telling him to 
report to the Ministry in Mashhad, north-east Iran. Although Mr. Soodmand told the officials he 
saw no reason why the officials in Mashhad wanted to interview him as he lives in Tehran, he 
eventually agreed to go. Since then, Mr. Soodmand has not been seen. His family has visited the 
Ministry of Intelligence frequently but has been unable to obtain any information about 
Mr. Soodmand&#8217;s whereabouts or legal status. Although no charges have been laid against him 
yet, it is feared that he is detained solely for his religious beliefs and that the approval of the 
above mentioned bill may have adverse consequences on his situation. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Rapporteur urged the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to take all 
necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Mahmoud Mohammad 
Matin-Azad, Mr. Arash Ahmad-Ali Basirat and Mr. Ramtin Soodmand are respected. She also 
requested that the Government ensures the compatibility of any new legislation adopted by the 
Iranian Parliament with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer 
to General Assembly resolution 63/181 which urges States to &#8220;step up their efforts to protect and 
promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief, and to this end to ensure that no one 
within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of person because of 
religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment or arbitrary arrest or detention&#8221;.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>100. In addition, she would like to reiterate that the Human Rights Committee, in its general 
comment No. 22 (1993), observed that &#8220;the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief 
necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#8217;s 
current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views, as well as the right to retain 
one&#8217;s religion or belief. Article 18.2 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] 
bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use 
of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to 
their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their religion or belief or to convert&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 17 October 2008 jointly with the Independent Expert on minority 
issues 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received regarding recent cases involving members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
community in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>102. Reportedly, several fires have been deliberately set to partially or totally destroy homes 
and vehicles belonging to members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community. On 8 July 2008, an attempt 
was made by two men on motorbikes to set fire to the home of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; family of 
Mr. <b>Ahmad Imani</b> in Rafsanjan (Kerman province). A burning rubber tyre was wedged against 
the front door of the house, effectively locking the family inside. Some Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; neighbours 
quickly came to extinguish the burning tyre. No one was hurt and there was no serious damage. 
The police were informed without delay, and a patrol unit arrived an hour later to investigate the 
incident. No arrests have been reported. 
</p>
<p>103. On 25 July 2008, two motorbike riders set fire to the car owned by Mr. <b>Sohail Naeimi</b>, in 
Rafsanjan (Kerman province). The vehicle was completely destroyed. The police came to 
investigate the following day. Reportedly, Mr. Naeimi had received a threatening letter in early 
June from a group identifying itself as the &#8220;Anti-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm Movement of the Youth of 
Rafsanjan&#8221;. The letter contained threats against Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; lives and property. Following that 
incident, during the night of 30-31 August 2008, an unknown motorbike rider repeatedly threw 
stones at the house of Mr. Sohail Naeimi, breaking three windows. Mr. Soheil Naeimi lodged a 
complaint at the local court against the &#8220;Anti-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm Movement of the Youth of Rafsanjan&#8221;. 
But the judge ordered that no further action be taken because the membership of this group is not 
known.  
</p>
<p>104. Reportedly, members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community have been arrested and detained. 
On 9 March 2008, Mr. <b>Touraj Amini,</b> Mr. <b>Iraj Amini</b> and Mr. <b>Payman Amoui</b>, three Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s 
from Tehran, were arrested at their workplace. Two of them, Mr. Iraj Amini and Mr. Amoui, 
were released on bail the next day, while Mr. Touraj Amini was released on bail nine days later. 
On 19 August 2008, all three were summoned to an Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, 
where they were charged with &#8220;teaching Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm, propaganda against the regime of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and insulting the sacred institutions of Islam&#8221;. At present, all three are once 
again out on bail, pending trial.  
</p>
<p>105. Ms. <b>Fariba Kamalabadi</b>, Mr. <b>Jamaloddin Khanjani</b>, Mr. <b>Afif Naeimi</b>, 
Mr. <b>Saeid Rezaie</b>, Mr. <b>Behrouz Tavakkoli</b>, Mr. <b>Vahid Tizfahm</b> and Ms. <b>Mahvash Sabet</b>, who 
have already been the subject of a joint communication sent on 19 May 2008, are reportedly still </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>being detained and have still not been permitted any access to legal counsel. News media, citing 
the deputy prosecutor general for security at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran, have 
claimed that the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; detainees had &#8220;confessed&#8221; to operating an &#8220;illegal&#8221; organization with ties 
to Israel and other countries. Some articles repeated that Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s were agents of Zionism. On 
3 August 2008, the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; International Community categorically denied this allegation and 
repeated that the detainees were members of an ad hoc committee that attended to the needs of 
the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s in Iran. It is feared that the seven members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community are detained and 
convicted solely because of their beliefs or peaceful activities on behalf of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; 
community.  
</p>
<p>106. On 26 July 2008, four officials entered the home of Mr. <b>Mehrdad Sabetrasekh</b> in 
Vilashahr (near Isfahan) with a search warrant from the Najafabad Court. They confiscated his 
personal computer as well as a number of Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; and non-Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; CDs and books. 
Mr. Sabetrasekh was arrested and taken to the Intelligence Ministry office in Najafabad. After 
two months of detention, he was released on bail in September with the amount of 
10,000,000 tumans having been submitted as collateral. The charges against him are still not 
known.  
</p>
<p>107. On 29 July 2008, three officials from the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office entered and searched the 
home of a Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; family in Ahvaz (Khuzestan province). These officials claimed that neighbours 
had lodged a complaint against the couple living there, Mr. and Mrs. <b>Ghanavatian</b>, regarding 
their &#8220;activities against the regime&#8221; and &#8220;teaching Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;sm&#8221;. While the officials were searching 
their home, Mr. and Mrs. Ghanavatian were asked to respond in writing to questions about their 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; activities. All Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; materials found in their home were seized (books, CDs, photos and 
a personal computer). The couple was taken to a military unit for interrogation. On the same day, 
a friend was able to secure their bail by submitting his work permit as collateral. The charges 
against them are still not known.  
</p>
<p>108. Members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community have been denied <b>access to education</b>. Since 2004, all 
Iranian students have been able to take the national entrance exam without being required to 
declare a religious affiliation. However in 2007, the application form for technical and vocational 
institutes contained a required declaration of religion limited to the four recognized faiths, thus 
excluding the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s. The few Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; students currently enrolled in universities continue to face 
expulsion as soon as their religious affiliation becomes known. One Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; student was recently 
expelled from a university in Isfahan after three terms of study. He was accused of lying on a 
registration form, where he had entered two lines (==) instead of declaring a religion as required. 
The university officials stated that, &#8220;according to the new guidelines&#8221;, Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; students are not 
allowed to pursue higher education. 
</p>
<p>109. There have been incidents relating to Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; <b>cemeteries</b>. The Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; cemetery in 
Marvdasht was vandalized. A number of graves were damaged and over 100 trees were 
uprooted. The incident was reported to a number of government agencies, but no official action 
has been taken to date. Mr. <b>Houshmand Talebi</b> (Iskandari), Mr. <b>Mehran Zeyni</b> (Najafabadi) 
and Mr. <b>Farhad Ferdosian</b>, three members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community, were arrested in 
connection with an allegedly illegal burial in the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; cemetery and subsequently released on 
bail, pending trial. They were summoned to the Najafabad court on 6 July 2008 and spoke in 
their own defence in front of the judge. However, the complainant - the Department of Natural 
Resources - was not represented in court at the hearing, so the judge decided to issue the verdict </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>a few days later. The three Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s were eventually found guilty of &#8220;taking part in the illegal 
occupation and use of government property&#8221;. They were fined and ordered to &#8220;cease their 
occupation of the said property&#8221; (i.e. the cemetery) and to &#8220;return it to its prior condition&#8221;, which 
would mean to exhume the deceased Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; recently interred there.  
</p>
<p>110. Another incident includes the display of a <b>petition</b> on 19 September 2008, at the entrance 
of a large outdoor enclosed area in Tehran, in which the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, leads 
the noon-day prayer. This petition, provided for worshippers to sign, asked for the dissolution of 
&#8220;Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;st institutions&#8221;. Reportedly, officials from the Ministry of Information were present in 
large numbers around the entrance to ensure that all worshippers signed the petition on their way 
in.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer 
to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights 
norms and to the mandate practice concerning discrimination on the basis of religion or 
belief/inter-religious discrimination/tolerance (see above, para. 1, category II.1) and concerning 
the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief and the teaching and dissemination of materials, 
including missionary activity (see above, para. 1, category I.3.f).  
</p>
<p>112. Furthermore, she would like to recall that the General Assembly resolution 63/181 urges 
States to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or 
belief, notably by taking all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international 
standards of human rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility or violence, with particular regard to members of religious minorities in 
all parts of the world. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is very concerned by the continued 
violations of freedom of religion or belief suffered by members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community. She 
urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members who are 
currently detained receive a fair trial and she would like to recommend the presence of 
independent observers during the trials.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Jordan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 13 May 2008 
</b></p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding Mr. <b>Muhammad Abbad Abd al-Qader Abbad</b>, a Jordanian citizen. 
Reportedly, Mr. Abbad converted to Christianity fifteen years ago and is married to a Christian 
woman. On 23 March 2008, Mr. Abbad, his wife and their 9-year-old son were assaulted by 
relatives of another convert to Christianity who had sought sanctuary in Mr. Abbad&#8217;s home. 
After the incident, Mr. Abbad&#8217;s father reported his son to the police and sought to obtain custody 
of his two grandchildren. When Mr. Abbad attempted to file a complaint with the police on 
24 March 2008, he was taken to the North Amman Shari&#8217;a court and charged with apostasy. 
Because Mr. Abbad claimed before the court that he was an atheist and not a Muslim when he 
converted to Christianity, Judge Faysal Khreisat sentenced him to one week of imprisonment for </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>contempt of court. On the way to Jweideh Prison in Amman, he collapsed due to his injuries 
following the assault. He was hospitalized and released on bail the following day. At his court 
hearing on 27 March 2008, Mr. Abbad refused to deny his faith and return to Islam. Lawyers 
advised him that he would lose the court case, and therefore custody of his children, if he did not 
deny his conversion. Mr. Abbad and his family fled from Jordan on 28 March 2008. His father 
subsequently initiated the procedure to have Mr. Abbad&#8217;s marriage dissolved. 
</p>
<p>114. Reportedly, in a previous case dated 16 September 2004, also involving a conversion to 
Christianity, the West Amman Islamic Court found a man guilty of apostasy and subsequently 
his marriage was annulled, he was stripped of his rights as a husband and father, and all 
documents he had ever signed were annulled. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Jordan concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to recall that article 18 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that the right to freedom of thought, conscience 
and religion &#8220;includes freedom to change his religion or belief&#8221; and article 18 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes the right &#8220;to have or to adopt a religion or 
belief of his choice&#8221;. Furthermore, in its general comment No. 22 (1993), the Human Rights 
Committee explains in more detail &#8220;that the freedom to &#8216;have or to adopt&#8217; a religion or belief 
necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one&#8217;s 
current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views, as well as the right to retain 
one&#8217;s religion or belief. Article 18.2 [of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] 
bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use 
of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to 
their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their religion or belief or to convert. Policies 
or practices having the same intention or effect, such as, for example, those restricting access to 
education, medical care, employment or the rights guaranteed by article 25 and other provisions 
of the Covenant, are similarly inconsistent with article 18.2. The same protection is enjoyed by 
holders of all beliefs of a non-religious nature.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur also would like to refer to paragraph 9 (a) of Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/37, which urges States to &#8220;ensure that their constitutional and legislative 
systems provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion 
and belief to all without distinction, inter alia, by the provision of effective remedies in cases 
where the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, or the right to practice 
freely one&#8217;s religion, including the right to change one&#8217;s religion or belief, is violated.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 21 November 2008  
</b></p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received that the Upper Chamber of Parliament (Senate) had approved on 7 November 2008 
amendments to the draft law on &#8220;Amendments and Additions to some Legislative Acts of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan on Issues of Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations&#8221;. The 
revised draft was sent back to the Lower Chamber of Parliament for its approval. Reportedly, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>this draft law, including the new amendments adopted by the Senate, would impose undue 
restrictions on freedom of religion or belief of individuals and religious or belief communities in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan.  
</p>
<p>118. Allegedly, the draft law would maintain the prohibition of activities of unregistered 
religious organizations, which existed in the previous law. Whereas the conduct of certain 
religious activities in violation of the law would previously lead to fines to up to 50 times the 
minimum monthly wage, the draft law suggests that they now be sanctioned with a fixed fine of 
50 times the minimum monthly wage, thereby leaving no margin of appreciation to the judges. It 
would also introduce new liabilities and quotas on proselytising activities and would impose a 
ban on missionary activity by people who are not representatives of registered religious 
organizations. In addition, it would strictly limit the dissemination of religious materials in fixed 
premises designated by local executive bodies.  
</p>
<p>119. The proposed draft law also seems to offer the possibility to the authorities to undertake 
substantial reviews of the registration applications submitted to them. Upon the result of this 
&#8220;theological analysis&#8221;, the authorities may put the registration of a religious community on hold 
for an unspecified delay or even deny registration to a religious or belief community. 
Furthermore, the draft law would prohibit private religious education at all levels. Fears have 
been expressed that the draft law contains vague provisions which could lead to the introduction 
of collective sanctions for actions committed by individuals or which could result in abusive 
interpretation and discrimination on the part of the law enforcement authorities. Finally, various 
religious communities have voiced their concern at the lack of public and open debate on the 
proposed draft law. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 6 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>120. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to reflect 
the content of the reply from the Government of Kazakhstan dated 6 December 2008 as she had 
not received the translation of its content from the relevant services.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>121. The Special Rapporteur is grateful that the Government of Kazakhstan replied to the 
communication of 21 November 2008 and she hopes to be able to make observations on the 
response in the next report summarizing the cases transmitted to Governments and replies 
received.  
</p>
<p><b>Kyrgyzstan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 29 July 2008  
</b></p>
<p>122. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received concerning the Christian-Baptist family <b>Isakov</b> in the village of Kulanak, in the Naryn 
region. Reportedly, Mr. Alymbek Isakov&#8217;s son, a fourteen-year-old boy, passed away on 
18 May 2008. Mr. Isakov is a member of the Church of Evangelical Christian-Baptists in 
Kulanak. The Isakov family wanted to bury the boy on a plot of land in the village officially 
allocated to Baptists as a graveyard by the district authorities in April 2006. However, they were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>prevented from doing so by a group of representatives from the local mosque, allegedly led by 
the Imam. Consequently, Mr. Isakov and Baptist leaders brought the issue to the Head of 
Administration of the Naryn district and subsequently to the Governor of the Naryn district. The 
Baptist group requested the Governor to provide police assistance in their village to protect the 
Isakov family and to allow them to bury the deceased boy; however, the Governor did not yield 
to this request. On 21 May 2008, the Head of Administration of the Naryn district reportedly 
came to the village to persuade the Isakov family to convert to Islam or give the boy&#8217;s body to 
his grandfather, who is a Muslim, in order to hold a funeral according to Muslim tradition. 
Mr. Isakov refused to do so and subsequently a crowd of people gathered at the Isakovs&#8217; house 
and assaulted some of the Baptists present, including Mr. Isakov. A group of policemen arrived 
at the house in the evening but did not intervene or break up the mob outside the house. Instead 
the policemen went inside, took away the boy&#8217;s body and buried him in Akiyya, 40 kilometres 
from Kulanak.  
</p>
<p>123. On 22 May 2008, Mr. Isakov and other Baptists travelled to Akiyya where they found the 
boy buried in a hole, unwashed and in his clothes. Mr. Isakov dug out the body, washed it, 
wrapped it up in a white sheet and buried him in a new grave. Since the incident, the Isakov 
family has reportedly been pressurised by the village community. The village council denied 
them water to irrigate their crops. The children of the family have been assaulted by other 
children at school, and the village leaders have taken no action to protect them.  
</p>
<p>124. Concerns have been expressed that the events in Kulanak may be used to introduce 
amendments to the existing Religion Law in order to tighten control over religious organisations. 
Other religious communities, including the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, Jehova&#8217;s Witnesses and Hare Krishnas, have 
reportedly faced similar problems, where local authorities did not allow them to bury members 
of the religious community in local so-called &#8220;Muslim&#8221; territories, unless the family accepted to 
carry out the funeral according to Muslim rituals. Allegedly, a fatwa issued in 2002 by the 
Muftiate, the national Muslim spiritual leadership, banned the burial of non-Muslims in 
&#8220;Muslim&#8221; cemeteries. However, the press-secretary of the Muftiate stated that it is up to the 
people from the community to decide on burial issues. A meeting on 2 July 2008 at the State 
Agency for Religious Affairs to discuss the issue did not lead to a solution. Only representatives 
of the Muslim community participated in the meeting while no leaders from other religious 
groups were present. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would to recall that, in its general 
comment No. 22 (1993), the Human Rights Committee observed that &#8220;the freedom to manifest 
religion or belief may be exercised &#8216;either individually or in community with others and in public 
or private&#8217;. The freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and 
teaching encompasses a broad range of acts. The concept of worship extends to ritual and 
ceremonial acts giving direct expression to belief, as well as various practices integral to such 
acts, including the building of places of worship, the use of ritual formulae and objects, the 
display of symbols, and the observance of holidays and days of rest&#8221;. Furthermore, &#8220;Article 18.3 
[of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] permits restrictions on the freedom 
to manifest religion or belief only if limitations are prescribed by law and are necessary to 
protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>[&#8230;] In interpreting the scope of permissible limitation clauses, States parties should proceed 
from the need to protect the rights guaranteed under the Covenant, including the right to equality 
and non-discrimination on all grounds specified in articles 2, 3 and 26. Limitations imposed must 
be established by law and must not be applied in a manner that would vitiate the rights 
guaranteed in article 18. The Committee observes that paragraph 3 of article 18 is to be strictly 
interpreted: restrictions are not allowed on grounds not specified there, even if they would be 
allowed as restrictions to other rights protected in the Covenant, such as national security. 
Limitations may be applied only for those purposes for which they were prescribed and must be 
directly related and proportionate to the specific need on which they are predicated. Restrictions 
may not be imposed for discriminatory purposes or applied in a discriminatory manner&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 7 November 2008 
</b></p>
<p>126. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received that the Parliament had approved the first reading of the draft law &#8220;On Freedom of 
Conscience and Religious Organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic&#8221; on 9 October 2008. 
Reportedly, this draft law would impose undue restrictions on freedom of religion or belief of 
individuals and religious or belief communities. For instance, the draft law would allegedly 
prohibit the activity or operation of all religious organisations which are not registered at the 
State Body on Religious Affairs. The proposed registration procedures also seem to impose 
minimum membership requirement (at least 200 adult citizens) to acquire legal entity status and 
would offer the possibility for the authorities to undertake substantial reviews of the registration 
applications submitted to them. Furthermore, the draft law would prohibit private religious 
education at all levels and certain proselytising activities such as the distribution in public places 
of religious literature and other materials of religious content and visits to private apartments and 
schools.  
</p>
<p>127. Fears have been expressed that the draft law contains vague provisions which could lead to 
the introduction of collective sanctions for actions committed by individuals or which could 
result in abusive interpretation and discrimination on the part of the law enforcement authorities. 
Finally, various religious communities have voiced their concern at the lack of public and open 
debate on the proposed draft law. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Kyrgyzstan concerning the above mentioned allegations. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights 
norms and to the mandate practice concerning registration (see above, para.1, category I.3.h) and 
concerning the right to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief and the teaching and dissemination of 
materials, including missionary activity (see above, para. 1, category I.3.f). The Special 
Rapporteur would like to emphasize that registration should not be a precondition for practicing 
one&#8217;s religion, but may only be appropriate for the acquisition of a legal personality and related 
benefits. In the latter case, registration procedures should be easy and quick and not depend on 
extensive formal requirements in terms of the number of members or the time a particular 
religious group has existed. The Special Rapporteur would also like to reiterate that registration 
should not depend on reviews of the substantive content of the belief or its structure and clergy.<b> </b></p>

question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p>129. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information regarding pastor <b>Sompong Supatto</b>, Mr. <b>Boot Chanthaleuxay</b> and 
Mr. <b>Khamvan Chanthaleuxay</b>, the latter two secondary school students and church members. 
These three individuals were reportedly arrested on 3 August 2008, between 10:00 a.m. and 
11:00 a.m. in the village of Boukham, by members of the district police authorities of 
Ad-Sapangthong district, Savannakhet province, and transferred to Ad-Sapangthong district 
police station. While they were held there, district police officials tightened handcuffs as well as 
leg restraints made of wooden stocks on all three detained individuals and allegedly stated: &#8220;This 
is the consequence of not signing documents to renounce your faith. We have already given you 
three opportunities to sign these documents but you have refused.&#8221; It is further alleged that the 
concerned persons would be released if they signed the documents renouncing their Christian 
faith.  
</p>
<p>130. On 2 September 2008, Mr. Boot Chanthaleuxay&#8217;s legs reportedly became infected because 
of the wooden stocks put around them, which led to severe pain and swollen legs, rendering him 
unable to walk. He was in need of urgent medical treatment, otherwise it was feared that he 
would not be able to use his leg again. Concern was expressed for the physical and mental 
integrity of Mr. Sompong Supatto, Mr. Boot Chanthaleuxay and Mr. Khamvan Chanthaleuxay 
while in detention. Further concerns were expressed as regards Mr. Khamvan Chanthaleuxay&#8217;s 
state of health. Concern was also expressed that their arrests and detention might have been 
solely connected to their reportedly peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of religion or 
belief.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 22 September 2008 
</b></p>
<p>131. The Government of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic informed that it had carried out 
a full check with the Local Authority, district police of Ad-Saphangthong district, Savanhakhet 
province and had found out that information received by the Special Procedures mandate holders 
was completely false and groundless. Furthermore, the Government drew the attention of the 
Special Procedures mandate holders to the information below, according to the information by 
the Local Authority. 
</p>
<p>132. The Local Authority concerned did not conduct the arrest, torture and other cruel treatment 
of the three individuals. The three individuals were carrying out activities which were violating 
the security order of the district and were therefore detained for a short-term period, from 20 to 
22 July 2008 by the Local Authority. After having conducted the investigation, the 
three individuals were released and immediately returned to their parents in their village. 
</p>
<p>133. The Government of the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic confirmed that, within its 
limited capacity, it had done everything possible to respect, promote and protect the fundamental 
rights and freedom of its Lao people and had upheld the rule of law. The Government provided 
concrete measures to assist the Lao people in all aspects, according to all fundamental human 
rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>134. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would like to refer 
to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms 
and to the mandate practice concerning freedom from coercion (see above, para.1, category I.2). 
Each State has the positive obligation of ensuring that the persons on their territory and under 
their jurisdiction, including members of religious minorities, can practise the religion or belief of 
their choice free of coercion and fear (see A/HRC/6/5, para. 9). In letters sent to the Government 
on 28 March 2008 and 28 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur reiterated her wish to visit the 
Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic in the framework of her mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>Malaysia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 12 October 2005 
</b></p>
<p>135. The Special Rapporteur had received information concerning a decision by Malaysia&#8217;s 
Court of Appeal according to which conversions from Islam to another religion have to be 
authorized by sharia courts in the case of Lina Joy, formerly Azlina Jailani, aged 41.  
</p>
<p>136. Lina Joy, a former Muslim who converted to Christianity in the late 1980s, had approached 
the National Registration Department (NRD) in February 1997 in order to request that her name 
and religious status be changed on her identity card. The application was rejected in August 1997 
on the grounds that the sharia court had not granted permission for her to renounce Islam. When 
she appealed the decision, in 1998, the NRD allowed the name change, but refused to change the 
religious status on her identity card. Following another appeal, High Court Judge Datuk Faiza 
Tamby Chik ruled in April 2001 that she could not change her religious identity, because ethnic 
Malays are defined as Muslims under the Constitution. He also said jurisdiction in such cases lay 
solely in the hands of the sharia court. On 19 September 2005, the Court of Appeal announced 
the final decision stating that Lina Joy must apply to a sharia court for permission to legally 
renounce Islam. 
</p>
<p>137. Law requires all Malaysian citizens over the age of 12 to carry an identity card with them 
at all times and all identity cards issued to Muslims must clearly display their religious identity. 
A Muslim designation on an identity card has legal consequences, such as the prohibition of 
marrying a Christian. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 July 2008 
</b></p>
<p>138. The Government of Malaysia informed that the Federal Court, which is the apex court in 
Malaysia, had concluded the case and therefore provided the Special Rapporteur with the details 
of the judgment. On the case of <i>Lina Joy vs. Wilayah Persekutuan Islamic Religious Council and 
others</i>, the Federal Court, in its majority decisions, held that the National Registration 
Department (NRD) had no jurisdiction to amend the religion of a person. The fact that the NRD 
insisted that Ms. Lina Joy obtain either a sharia court order or a Religious Department&#8217;s 
documentation to confirm the status of her conversion out of Islam before her application to 
amend the statement relating to her religion on her identity card could therefore be allowed. 
According to the Federal Court, the policy adopted by the NRD that a mere statutory declaration </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>was insufficient for it to remove the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; from the identity card of a Muslim, was 
reasonable because renunciation of Islam was a matter that should be dealt with under Islamic 
law and therefore required determination from the Islamic Religious Authority.  
</p>
<p>139. The Federal Court indicated that the mode of renouncing a person&#8217;s religion necessarily 
had to follow the procedures, law or practice of the said religion. Freedom of religion under 
article 11 of the Federal Constitution required Ms. Lina Joy to obey the procedures, law or 
practice of the said religion, specifically in respect of renouncing her religion. The sharia court 
had an implied jurisdiction over matters relating to apostasy or conversion out of Islam. The 
implied jurisdiction was based on the fact that the sharia court had complete jurisdiction on the 
conversion into Islam, and by necessary implication, would have jurisdiction on apostasy and 
conversion out of Islam. This had been enunciated by the Federal Court in the case of 
<i>Dalip Kaur</i> and, as the apex court of Malaysia, is binding on all courts. 
</p>
<p>140. In conclusion, the Federal Court argued that Ms. Lina Joy was not prevented from 
renouncing her religion, Islam. However, because a Muslim is subject to the Islamic laws in 
Malaysia, Ms. Lina Joy had to go through the proper Islamic Religious Authority for the purpose 
of renunciation of her Islamic faith. Once she would obtain an order or a letter of confirmation of 
her renunciation, she would then be able to proceed to get the NRD to delete the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; 
from her identity card. These processes did not impede the freedom of religion of Ms. Lina Joy. 
In this instance, she had never approached the Islamic Religious Authorities for the purposes of 
renunciation of her religion, Islam. 
</p>
<p>141. According to the Government of Malaysia, the Federal Court&#8217;s decision had illustrated 
that, in line with article 11 of the Federal Constitution, which provision is compatible with the 
Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on 
Religion or Belief, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, the freedom of religion or Ms. Lina Joy had never been violated. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>142. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. Concerning the right to 
change or to renounce to one&#8217;s religion, she would like to refer to paragraph 5 of the general 
comment No. 22 (1993) of the Human Rights Committee which states that &#8220;freedom to &#8216;have or 
to adopt&#8217; a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, 
including the right to replace one&#8217;s current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic 
views, as well as the right to retain one&#8217;s religion or belief&#8221;. Furthermore, provided that the 
Federal Constitution of Malaysia recognizes that &#8220;Islam is the religion of the Federation, but 
other religions may be practised in peace and harmony in any part of the Federation&#8221;, she would 
like to refer to her framework for communications, more specifically to the international human 
rights norms and to the mandate practice concerning &#8220;State Religion&#8221; (see above, para. 1, 
category II.2).   
</p>
<p>143. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in paragraph 3 of 
general comment No. 22 (1993), the Human Rights Committee underlined that no one can be 
compelled to reveal his thoughts or adherence to a religion or belief. As stated by the Special 
Rapporteur in her latest report to the General Assembly (see A/63/161, paragraph 77), indicating 
a person&#8217;s religious affiliation on official documents carries a serious risk of abuse or subsequent </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 38 
 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on religion or belief, which has to be weighed against the possible reasons 
for disclosing the holder&#8217;s religion. On the same matter, in its resolution 63/181, the General 
Assembly urged States to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief, and to this end to ensure that &#8220;everyone has the right to refrain 
from disclosing information concerning one&#8217;s religious affiliation on [official documents] 
against one&#8217;s will.&#8221;

<p>144. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information regarding 
the situation of Mr. <b>P. Uthayakumar</b>, Legal Adviser of the Hindu Human Rights Action Force

their arrest on 13 December 2007 under Section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act for allegedly 
carrying out activities that threatened national security, Mr. P. Uthayakumar, Mr. M. Manoharan, 
Mr. R. Kenghadharan, Mr. V. Ganabatirau and Mr. T. Vasanthakumar have reportedly been kept 
in solitary confinement for more than 16 hours a day, and have been exposed to light 
continuously in order to prevent them from sleeping and to disorientate them. Furthermore, they 
were denied their right to worship. They do not have access to temples and prayer rooms and no 
time to worship has been allocated to them. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>145. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Malaysia concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer to her framework 
for communications, more specifically to the international human rights norms and to the 
mandate practice concerning persons deprived of their liberty (see above, para.1, category III.2). 
She would like to stress that persons deprived of their liberty are in a particularly vulnerable 
situation, also with regard to freedom of religion or belief. It is therefore crucial to provide the 
personnel of detention facilities with adequate training, raising awareness and enhancing their 
sensitivity about their duty to promote and respect international human rights standards for the 
treatment of prisoners, in particular the right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p><b>Maldives 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 11 January 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special 
Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>146. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
regarding <b>provisions in the draft Constitution about citizenship </b>which might have an impact 
on freedom of religion or belief. The Peoples Special Majlis (Constitutional Assembly) had 
reportedly approved on 19 November 2007 an amendment to the draft Constitution, requiring all 
Maldivian citizens to be Muslims. The amendment includes a clause that &#8220;none except a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>Muslim can become a citizen of Maldives&#8221;. It has been reported that if this draft Constitution is 
passed and comes into effect a number of Maldivians may lose their right to be citizens of 
Maldives or become stateless. The Peoples Special Majlis was expected to reconvene 
on 13 January 2008. 
</p>
<p>147. In this regard the Special Rapporteur referred to the conclusions and recommendations of 
her recent report on the visit to the Maldives (A/HRC/4/21/Add.3, paras. 60): &#8220;The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the members of the Special Majlis to give serious consideration to 
including the right to freedom of religion or belief in the new draft of the Constitution. This right 
should not be limited to citizens of the Maldives, but should be extended to all persons in the 
Maldives. She takes this opportunity to underline that the designation of Islam as the State 
religion of the Maldives does not require all citizens to adhere to that religion alone. Indeed, she 
notes that there are numerous countries, including in the South Asia region, which have adopted 
a State religion, but do not require their citizens to adhere to that religion.&#8221; Furthermore, her visit 
report included the following conclusions and recommendations (A/HRC/4/21/Add.3, 
paras. 66-67): &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is concerned that constitutional provisions, restricting 
eligibility to vote and hold certain public offices to Muslims, constitute de jure discrimination on 
religious grounds. She is aware that almost all Maldivians are indeed Muslims and that as such, 
the presence of these discriminatory provisions is unlikely to result in many actual instances of 
discrimination. However, the very presence of these provisions in the Constitution contradicts 
the treaty obligations of the Maldives, and particularly article 2, paragraph 1, in combination 
with article 25 of the ICCPR, as well as article 26 of the ICCPR. She is also concerned by 
legislation limiting eligibility for certain public posts to Muslims, including the Human Rights 
Commission Act, and by the Citizenship Law, which stipulates that only Muslims can apply for 
Maldivian citizenship. She encourages legislators to consider introducing amendments to these 
pieces of legislation, to bring them into compliance with the treaty obligations, particularly under 
article 26 of the ICCPR. She notes that according to article 4, paragraph 2, of the 1981 
Declaration, all States must make all efforts to enact or rescind legislation where necessary to 
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>148. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Maldives concerning the above mentioned allegations. She has addressed citizenship issues 
and religious discrimination in administrative procedures in her latest report to the General 
Assembly (see A/63/161, paras. 25-78).<b> </b>In particular, she concluded that &#8220;Governments 
sometimes impose restrictions in such a way that the right to freedom of religion or belief of the 
persons concerned is adversely affected. While the State may have a legitimate interest in 
limiting some manifestations of the freedom of religion or belief, when applying limitations the 
State must ensure that certain conditions are fulfilled. Any limitation must be based on the 
grounds of public safety, order, health, morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, 
it must respond to a pressing public or social need, it must pursue a legitimate aim and it must be 
proportionate to that aim&#8221; (A/63/161, para. 67). Furthermore, she added that &#8220;[m]easures that 
discriminate on the basis of religion or belief, or lead to de facto discrimination on such grounds, 
violate human rights standards. Consequently, it would be contrary to the principle of 
non-discrimination to restrict citizenship to people with certain religious beliefs or to deny 
official documents based on the applicant&#8217;s religious affiliation&#8221; (A/63/161, para. 70).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1

</p>
<p>149. She would also like to refer to the conclusions and recommendations of the report on her 
mission to the Maldives in August 2006 (A/HRC/4/21/Add.3). However, the new Constitution of 
the Maldives, which was ratified on 7 August 2008, includes in its article 9(d) a provision 
according to which a non-Muslim may not become a citizen of the Maldives. The Special 
Rapporteur is deeply concerned that the implementation of this article of the new Constitution 
could have a significant negative impact on human rights in the country, including for those 
individuals who have converted from Islam.

</b></p>
<p>150. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding Mr. <b>U Gambira</b>, a Buddhist monk who was one of the leaders of protests in 
August and September 2007; his brother, Mr. <b>Aung Kyaw Kyaw</b>, a member of the National 
League for Democracy (NLD); their father Mr. <b>Min Lwin</b>; and Ms. <b>Su Su Nway</b>, also a member 
of NLD and a labour activist. All of the aforementioned individuals were the subject of a joint 
urgent appeal sent on 21 November 2007 (see A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 186-189). According 
to new information received, Mr. U Gambira and Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw were charged at the 
end of January 2008 under Section 17/1 of the Unlawful Associations Act, which carries a 
maximum sentence of three years&#8217; imprisonment. A hearing scheduled for 4 February 2008 was 
postponed and the authorities hade not given a new date. Similar charges were brought against 
Ms. Su Su Nway, who was reportedly in poor health. All three were being held in Yangon&#8217;s 
Insein Prison, where they may have been subjected to torture or ill-treatment. 
151. Mr. U Gambira had been stripped of his monk&#8217;s robes and both he and Mr. Aung Kyaw 
Kyaw were allegedly tortured in detention. Their mother and sister were able to visit them but 
they were not known to have been given access to their lawyers. Their father, Mr. Min Lwin was 
released from Insein Prison on 3 December 2007. He and Aung Kyaw Kyaw were arrested on 
4 November 2007 and 17 October 2007 respectively, reportedly in an attempt to force 
U Gambira out of hiding.  
</p>
<p>152. Ms. Su Su Nway was reportedly charged under sections 124, 125 and 505 of the Penal 
Code, which relate to sedition and incitement to offences that damage &#8220;public tranquility&#8221;. She 
was reportedly due to stand trial on 6 February in Yangon&#8217;s Bahan Township, but no information 
was available regarding the judicial proceedings. Su Su Nway was not allowed to meet her 
family or receive parcels from her family. Her health was said to be deteriorating as she suffered 
from a heart condition and, on one occasion, had to be taken to a hospital outside the prison for 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>153. Concern was expressed that the arrest, detention and charges brought against 
Mr. U Gambira, Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw, and Ms. Su Su Nway may have been directly related to 
their activities in defence of human rights. In view of reports of ill-treatment and allegations of 
torture, as well as information received concerning the ill-health of Ms. Su Su Nway, serious 
concern was expressed for their physical and psychological integrity while in detention.  </p>

<p><b>Response from the Government dated 22 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>154. The Government of Myanmar transmitted the following information received from the 
authorities concerned in Myanmar relating to Mr. U Gambira, Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw and 
Ms. Su Su Nway. In July 2006, U Gambira and his brother Aung Kyaw Kyaw illegally contacted 
AAPP, an unlawful organization based in Mae Sot, Thailand, and attended the course on political 
defiance conducted by FDB, an unlawful organisation based in Thailand. U Gambira also led the 
All-Burma Junior Monks Alliance and sent 20 monks to attend the above mentioned trainings; 
he illegally crossed the border between Myanmar and Thailand; he received financial support 
from AAPP and FDB - unlawful exiled groups - and then instigated civil unrest in the country. 
He was therefore arrested on 4 November 2007. After due process of law, he was charged under 
section 13(1) of the Immigration (Emergency Provisions) Act, section 17(1) of the Unlawful 
Association Act and section 124(A) of the Penal Code. He was detained in the Central Prison 
and his family visited him once a week. He was fit and healthy in prison. 
</p>
<p>155. Mr. Aung Kyaw Kyaw had illegal contacts with Bo Kyi from AAPP and attended the 
course on public defiance conducted by FDB. He received financial support from Bo Kyi and 
instigated civil unrest in the country. On 17 October 2007, the authorities concerned arrested him 
while he was receiving the cash transferred from Bo Kyi. After due process of law, he was 
charged under section 13(1) of the Immigration (Emergency Provisions) Act, section 17(1) of the 
Unlawful Association Act and section 124(A) of the Penal Code. He was detained in the Central 
Prison and his family visited him one a week. He was fit and healthy in prison. 
</p>
<p>156. On 11 November 2007, Su Su Nway was arrested as she was attempting to incite civil 
unrest by placing a poster with anti-government slogans at a public place. She was charged under 
sections 124(A), 130 (B) and 505 (B) of the Penal Code for causing fear or alarm to the public 
and thereby disturbing public tranquillity. The authorities concerned conducted the necessary 
investigation and the court is still examining the witnesses. She was detained in the Insein 
Central Prison and her family regularly visited her. She was fit and healthy in prison. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>157. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response. She would like to refer 
to the press release of 18 November 2008 issued jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders: 
&#8220;Following one year of arbitrary detention, dozens of individuals who had been arrested in 
connection with peaceful demonstrations in Myanmar last year, are since August 2008 being 
tried by courts. The closed-door hearings are being held inside prisons by courts which lack 
independence and impartiality. Three of the defence lawyers have been sentenced to several 
months of imprisonment for contempt of court, after they transmitted their clients&#8217; complaints of 
unfair trials. Since early November several other defence lawyers have been barred from 
representing their clients. Last week, a dozen detainees, including several women, were each 
given 65-year prison sentences. More than twenty other detainees, including five monks, were 
recently sentenced to up to 24 years imprisonment. Many other detainees still await sentencing. 
The UN experts strongly urge the Myanmar authorities to cease harassing and arresting </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p>individuals for peacefully exercising their internationally recognized human rights. They further 
demand that all detainees be retried in open hearings respecting fair trial standards and the 
immediate release of their defence counsels. The experts reiterate previous calls to initiate 
reforms for a transition to a multiparty democratic and civil government, as envisaged by the 
new Constitution. In this context, they strongly urge the authorities to immediately commence 
work on ensuring those indispensable pre-conditions for free and fair general elections to be held 
in 2010. These include a comprehensive review of national legislation to ensure its compliance 
with international human rights standards, the release of political prisoners of conscience, and 
reform of the armed forces and the judicial system.&#8221;

Mr. <b>Dawood</b>, Mr. <b>Zeeshan</b> and Mr. <b>Kashil</b>. These 23 Ahmadi students were reportedly expelled 
(&#8220;rusticated&#8221;) on 6 June 2008 from Punjab Medical College in Faisalabad, for &#8220;religious dispute&#8221; 
and &#8220;hate material distribution&#8221;. The expulsion followed a report from a disciplinary committee 
of the college after rumors that Ahmadi students were preaching their religion in the college. On 
the night of 4 June 2008, a local cleric allegedly gave a sermon in the college mosque instigating 
students against Ahmadis, following which four Ahmadi students were brought from the hostel 
and taken to a room where they were insulted and badly mistreated by fellow students. 
Subsequently, 15 Ahmadi students were told to evacuate the hostel in the middle of the night.  
</p>
<p>159. On 5 June 2008, a mob surrounded the Principal&#8217;s office demanding that all Ahmadi 
students be expelled from the college. The Principal convened a disciplinary committee, which 
reportedly did not allow the Ahmadi students to provide any clarifications. On 6 June 2008, the 
Principal issued a notification for the rustication of the above mentioned 23 Ahmadi students 
from the college, which was converted on 10 June 2008, by the college administration, into a 
ten day suspension. 
</p>
<p>160. However, the above mentioned 23 Ahmadi students have not been permitted to return to 
the Punjab Medical College on 21 June 2008 and remain suspended. Furthermore, a college 
committee asked them to provide written statements on their religion and warned them of being 
legally responsible for what they write. Punjab Medical College, an institution of the 
Government of Punjab, reportedly requires applicants to declare themselves either Muslim or 
Non-Muslim in its admission form. Those Ahmadi students who in accordance with their 
belief had indicated in the admission forms that they were Muslims may face legal 
problems since section 298C of the Pakistan Penal Code prohibits Ahmadis to refer to their faith 
as Islam. </p>

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Pakistan concerning the above mentioned concerns. She would like to refer to the Declaration on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, 
in particular its article 2, which stipulates that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subject to discrimination by any 
State, institution, group of persons, or person on grounds of religion or other beliefs&#8221;. 
Furthermore, its article 4 states that &#8220;[a]ll States shall take effective measures to prevent and 
eliminate discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief in the recognition, exercise and 
enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in all fields of civil, economic, political, 
social and cultural life.&#8221; Similarly, in its resolution 63/181, the General Assembly urged States 
&#8220;to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, 
notably by taking all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards 
of human rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation 
and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to 
hostility or violence, with particular regard to members of religious minorities in all parts of the 
world&#8221;. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would also like to make reference to her most recent 
report to the Human Rights Council (see A/HRC/10/8, paras. 29-62) which raises the issue of 
discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights, including the right to education (see A/HRC/10/8, paras. 49-51). 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 18 August 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women 
</b></p>
<p>162. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning two girls from the <b>Christian minority community</b> in Chak Sarwar 
Shaheed, district Muzaffargarh. Reportedly, the two girls S. Y., thirteen years old, and A. Y., 
ten years old, were kidnapped on 26 June 2008 while on their way to their uncle&#8217;s house in 
Chowk Munda. Reportedly, their kidnappers handed the girls over to another individual (his 
name is on record with the Special Rapporteurs), who then organised a forced conversion to 
Islam and the marriage of his own son with Ms. S. Y.  
</p>
<p>163. The police refused the father&#8217;s request to file a case against the kidnappers. When the 
two sisters appeared in the Muzaffargarh District and Sessions court, they were given 
five minutes to testify that their conversion was genuine and Ms. S. Y. indicated that she was 
17 years old. However, her parents were not allowed to submit birth certificates and school 
records to prove the girls&#8217; true ages and provide evidence for a violation of the Child Marriage 
Restraint Act 1929, which bans child marriage for boys under 18 and girls under 16. On 
14 July 2008, the Judge in Muzaffargarh ruled that since the two sisters had converted in a 
legitimate manner to Islam they could be &#8220;handed over to their Christian parents unless they 
become Muslim, too&#8221;. On 6 August 2008, the Lahore High Court Multan Bench ordered a 
medical examination of Ms. S. Y. to ascertain her age and ruled to keep her and her sister A. Y. 
in a house for destitute women until the next hearing on 20 August 2008. It had further been 
alleged that the abductors may have been recruiting young girls for the purpose of prostitution 
and sexual exploitation, and that the marriages were pretences under which they gained control 
over the girls.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 15 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>164. The Government of Pakistan informed that on 7 July 2008 Mr. Y. M., father of Ms. S. Y. 
and Ms. A. Y. had filed a petition before District and Sessions Judge concerning the abduction of 
his daughters by three men. Prior to this petition, on 28 June 2008, his daughters had filed a 
petition before the same court stating that they had embraced Islam, but their parents were 
harassing them. Ms. S. Y had changed her name to Fatima, claimed her age was 17 years and 
had happily contracted marriage with Mr. A. A. Ms. A. Y. also expressed preference to stay with 
her sister. In view of the open statements and expressed desire of the two girls, the District and 
Sessions Judge passed the order that these girls could not be compelled to join their parents. 
After dismissal of their petition by the District and Sessions Judge, the mother of the two girls 
filed a writ petition before the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench. The Lahore High Court had 
directed the local police to get the two girls medically examined in order to determine their ages. 
However, based on an agreement between the two parties, the High Court later decided that 
custody of Ms. A. Y. may be given to her real mother/petitioner with the condition that the 
petitioner shall not interfere in her religious beliefs and practices. Ms. S. Y. was allowed to go 
with her husband Mr. A. A. Her parents, brothers and sisters were at liberty to visit her. The 
dower amount payable to Ms. S. Y. was also enhanced.

<p>165. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response of the Government of Pakistan. She 
would like to refer to the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, in particular its article 2 which stipulates that &#8220;[n]o 
one shall be subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons, or person on 
grounds of religion or other beliefs&#8221;. She also would like to reiterate that article 5 of this 
Declaration states that &#8220;[t]he parents, or as the case may be, the legal guardians of the child have 
the right to organize the life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief and 
bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be brought up&#8221;. The 
Convention of the Rights of the Child, which Pakistan has ratified, provides in its article 14 that 
&#8220;States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal 
guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner 
consistent with the evolving capacities of the child&#8221;. <b>

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 22 September 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>166. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning threats made against members of the <b>Ahmadiyya community</b>. Reportedly, 
thirty-four years after the adoption of the law related to the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan, 
GEO Television broadcasted a programme on 7 September 2008. The programme included a 
panel discussion during which two Maulanas (whose names are on record with the Special 
Rapporteurs) reportedly said that, in reference to the beliefs of the Ahmadiyya community, 
people who held such beliefs were &#8220;Wajb-ul-Qatl&#8221; or &#8220;liable to death&#8221;. This phrase was 
reportedly used repeatedly during the programme. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1

</p>
<p>167. On 8 September 2008, Mr. <b>Abdul Manan Siddiqi</b>, President of the Ahmadiyya 
community in Mirpurkhaas was murdered whilst working in the local hospital. On 
9 September 2008, Mr. <b>Seth Muhammad Yousuf</b>, President of the Ahmadiyya community 
in Nawab Shah was also murdered. It is feared that both Mr. Abdul Mannan Siddiqi and 
Mr. Seth Muhammad Yousuf were killed solely because of their association with the 
Ahmadiyya community. 
</p>
<p>168. In their urgent appeal, the two Special Rapporteurs referred to Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/37 which urges States to take all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity 
with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, 
intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as 
incitement to hostility and violence, with particular regard to religious minorities. They also 
made reference to Human Rights Council resolution 7/36, which requested the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 
within the framework of his mandate, to &#8220;report on instances in which the abuse of the right of 
freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account 
articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general 
comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial 
superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression&#8221;. In addition, 
they also referred to article 153 of the Penal Code of Pakistan which recognizes that &#8220;whoever 
commits or incites any other person to commit, any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance 
of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or 
communities or any group of persons identifiable as such on any ground whatsoever and which 
disturbs or is likely to disturb public tranquillity&#8221; is liable before the law. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>169. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Pakistan concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to recall that General 
Assembly resolution 63/181 urged States to step up their efforts to eliminate intolerance and 
discrimination based on religion or belief, notably by taking all necessary and appropriate action, 
in conformity with international standards of human rights, to combat hatred, discrimination, 
intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance based on

of religious minorities in all parts of the world.  
</p>
<p>170. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned by the continued violations of freedom of 
religion or belief suffered by members of the Ahmadiyya community, including through 
incitement to religious hatred. In this regard, she would like to refer to the report on the expert 
seminar on &#8220;Freedom of expression and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;, convened by the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and held in Geneva on 2 and 3 October 2008 (see

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 17 December 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>171. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received regarding Mr. <b>Mukhammadsolikh Abutov</b>, aged 38, born in Turtkul in 
Karakalpakstan. On 12 July 1996, Mr. Abutov, a teacher of Islam in his community in 
Uzbekistan, was reportedly sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of deliberate 
destruction and damage to property, for burning down the home of the imam of the Turtkul 
mosque. Whilst in detention he was subject to regular and cruel beatings, by the guards and some 
of the prisoners working for them. He was put in solitary confinement for long periods of time. 
In winter he was subject to cold, and he was not given enough to eat. It is alleged that the overall 
conditions of imprisonment - notably the fact that his access to toilets was restricted; there were 
three persons per sleeping place in the accommodation barracks; he had to perform hard labour, 
which included carrying very heavy burdens; there was regular punishment for following 
religious rituals including through sleep deprivation, mocking of his religious convictions - led to 
two suicide attempts by Mr. Abutov. In 2000, his term of imprisonment was extended by 
three years for &#8220;contemptuous violation of the prison regime&#8221;. In total he spent eight and a 
half years in prison.  
</p>
<p>172. In May 2004, Mr. Abutov was released. After his release, he went to Kazakhstan several 
times to earn some money for his family, including in January 2005, when eight persons in 
civilian clothes arrived at his house, searched through the whole house and took away all 
religious literature. The men asked Mr. Abutov&#8217;s wife where he was; she said he was in 
Kazakhstan. They also asked her to get him to come back and talk to them. Afterwards local 
police visited the house several times, asking Mr. Abutov&#8217;s family about his whereabouts and for 
his Moscow address. Since Mr. Abutov was afraid that he might be sent back to prison, he 
decided not to return home and, on 15 February 2007, fled to Russia, where he stayed in 
Krasnogorsk in the Moscow region. 
</p>
<p>173. On 13 June 2007, he received a call from an unknown Uzbek who wanted to meet him. 
When he left the house four men in civilian clothes were waiting for him on the street. They later 
turned out to be officers of the National Security Service of Uzbekistan. They forcibly took him 
to the Krasnogorsk Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but Mr. Abutov was not 
included in the list of persons searched internationally. However, soon after he was given an 
Uzbek arrest warrant, dated 26 February 2007, on the grounds that in 1998 having served his 
time in the offenders&#8217; colony in Uzbekistan, he had allegedly set up a religious extremist 
organization with two other prisoners.  
</p>
<p>174. On 26 June 2007, the City Court of Krasnogorsk ruled that Mr. Abutov should be detained 
for the purpose of his extradition to Uzbekistan. Mr. Abutov&#8217;s lawyer appealed but the appeal 
court dismissed his complaint. On 27 June 2007, Abutov was transferred to the 
50/10 probationary ward in Mozjaisk, where he was placed in a cell where the number of 
prisoners exceeded by two times the number of beds. Mr. Abutov has chronic liver disease but 
has only been seen by a doctor once, in July 2007, following several requests. He has 
subsequently asked for further medical attention but to no avail.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1

</p>
<p>175. At the end of June 2007, Mr. Abutov sent an asylum application requesting to be 
recognized as a refugee on the territory of the Russian Federation to the department of the 
Moscow regional department of the Federal Migration Service. In September 2007, a 
representative of the Migration service visited him for an interview. Currently, the Moscow 
Regional department of the Migration Department is reportedly considering his asylum 
application on its merits. At present, the extradition case is under consideration by the office of 
the General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 28 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>176. The Government of the Russian Federation indicated that Mr. Mukhammadsolikh 
Matyakubovich Abutov, a national of the Republic of Uzbekistan, born in 1969, was detained by 
law enforcement agents on 13 June 2007 on the basis of article 61 of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS) Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family, 
and Criminal Matters, of 22 January 1993 (&#8220;the Minsk Convention&#8221;) and conveyed to the 
headquarters of the Ministry for Internal Affairs for Krasnogorsk municipal district, Moscow 
region. 
</p>
<p>177. The inquiry about Mr. Abutov&#8217;s detention was based on the decision issued 
on 26 February 2007 in relation to criminal case no. 197-07 by the Public Prosecutor of the 
Surkhandarya region of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Senior State Counsellor of Justice 
Mr. D. S. Abdurakhmanov, stating that he was under international investigation and should be 
held in custody under a pre-trial restraining order. Mr. Abutov is accused of having committed 
offences under article 159, paragraph 3 (b), of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan 
(&#8220;Crime against the constitutional order of the Republic&#8221;), article 244, paragraph 3 (a), of the 
Code (&#8220;Production or dissemination of material constituting a threat to public security and public 
order&#8221;), and article 244, paragraph 1, of the Code (&#8220;Establishment, leadership or membership of 
religious extremist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organizations&#8221;). 
</p><p>178. On 13 June 2007, Mr. Abutov was taken into police custody at the Krasnogorsk 
headquarters of the Ministry for Internal Affairs on the basis of an investigation order under 
case no. 1488 of 15 May 2007. Before being placed in custody, he was examined by a doctor 
from Krasnogorsk City Hospital no. 1. No physical injuries of any kind were found and no 
urgent medical attention was required. On 14 June 2007, Mr. Abutov complained of a pain in the 
lumbar region and also informed the management of the detention unit that he would refuse 
food, on the grounds that his detention was unlawful. The same day, Mr. Abutov was examined 
by the police medical officer. As a result of the examination, symptomatic anti-inflammatory 
treatment was carried out to deal with chronic pyelonephritis. X-rays conducted on 18 June 2007 
revealed no pathological change. Medical staff concluded that Mr. Abutov&#8217;s state of health was 
currently satisfactory and he did not require medical assistance. 
</p>
<p>179. The management of the detention unit and a representative of the Krasnogorsk public 
prosecutor&#8217;s office held discussions with Mr. Abutov, in which it was established that there were 
no grounds for his planned hunger strike. The detained man therefore abandoned his hunger 
strike and, from 14 June 2007, received three meals a day. For the whole period of his detention, 
Mr. Abutov was not held in solitary confinement, his cell measured 4 square metres and no 
physical force was used against him. In the course of the daily checks of the detention unit 
carried out by staff of the Krasnogorsk municipal public prosecutor&#8217;s office, no complaints about 
the conditions or the actions of police officers were received from Mr. Abutov. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>180. On 14 June 2007, Mr. Abutov was questioned by the Krasnogorsk First Deputy Public 
Prosecutor, Mr. E.1. Puzanov, Junior Counsellor of Justice, who, on 15 June 2007, concluded 
that, in accordance with the Minsk Convention and the legislation of the Russian Federation, 
Mr. Abutov should be handed over to the law enforcement agencies of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan. On 25 June 2007, the Krasnogorsk public prosecutor&#8217;s office issued a decision, on 
the basis of article 61 of the Minsk Convention, that an application should be made to the courts 
that Mr. Abutov should be held in custody under a pre-trial restraining order. On 26 June 2007, 
Judge E.V. Isaeva of the Krasnogorsk municipal court ordered Mr. Abutov to be held in custody 
in pre-trial detention. On 2 July 2007, Mr. Abutov was transferred to Federal State Pre-trial 
Detention Centre 50110 of the federal headquarters of the Russian Federal Corrections Service 
for the Moscow region. On 29 June 2007, the Moscow region public prosecutor&#8217;s office received 
representations from Mr. Abutov&#8217;s lawyer requesting an investigation into the lawfulness of the 
actions of the staff of the headquarters of the Ministry for Internal Affairs for the Krasnogorsk 
municipal district, Moscow region. An official investigation established that the activities of the 
police officers were lawful; no breaches of the law were found. On 12 September 2007, the 
Moscow regional department of the Russian Federal Migration Service received an application 
from Mr. Abutov to be recognized as a refugee on the territory of the Russian Federation, on the 
grounds that he feared political and religious persecution in the Republic of Uzbekistan. 
</p>
<p>181. On 31 January 2008, the Migration Service issued a decision to refuse Mr. Abutov 
recognition as a refugee in the Russian Federation, on the grounds that he did not meet the 
criteria established in the definition of a refugee contained in article 1, paragraph 1 (i), of the 
Federal Refugees Act of 19 February 1993. Notification of the decision was sent to Mr. Abutov 
on 31 January 2008, together with an explanation of the appeal procedure. Mr. Abutov has the 
right to appeal against the decision of the Migration Service. Under article 10 of the Federal 
Refugees Act, this currently precludes the possibility of his being returned against his will to the 
territory of his State of nationality.

</p>
<p>they were arrested and detained at Hayr Prison in Riyadh. Despite intense efforts undertaken by 
their families in the Kingdoms of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, their detention was only disclosed 
by Saudi authorities four days after the arrests. The detainees were allowed to meet their parents 
only after 55 days of detention. Since their arrests they have been held in solitary confinement 
without charge or trial or access to legal counsel. The individuals were subjected to severe 
psychological pressure during interrogations on details of their lives, including their affiliations 
and beliefs. The investigators also accessed their email accounts. Concern is expressed that the 
arrest and detention of the eight above mentioned individuals might be connected to the religious 
beliefs they hold as Shi&#8217;a Muslims. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>184. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to 
recall that General Assembly resolution 63/181 which urges States to &#8220;step up their efforts to 
protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief, and to this end to 
ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of the right to life, liberty or security of 
person because of religion or belief and that no one is subjected to torture or other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or arbitrary arrest or detention&#8221;. Furthermore, in 
letters sent to the Government on 28 March 2008 and 28 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterated her wish to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the framework of her mandate.

<p>185. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the arrest of <b>Sheikh Tawfiq al-Amer</b> from the Shi&#8217;a community in Ahsa 
district, Eastern province. On 22 June 2008, Sheikh Tawfiq al-Amer was arrested and detained 
for a week without charge. The arrest of Sheikh al-Amer was reportedly linked to his criticism of 
an anti-Shi&#8217;a declaration made by 22 Wahhabi clerics, who had stated that Shi&#8217;as were &#8220;infidels&#8221; 
and &#8220;traitors&#8221; and a &#8220;great threat&#8221; to the Sunni majority in Saudi Arabia. In the mosque where he 
is Imam, Sheikh al-Amer argued on 14 June 2008 that such statements were dangerous to the 
community and asked the Government to prevent incitement to hatred and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>186. Furthermore, it has been reported that members of the Shi&#8217;a community in Ahsa district 
face discrimination, for example that they do not get licenses to operate a private school or a 
kindergarten. In addition, some categories of jobs are allegedly forbidden for Shi&#8217;as, such as 
becoming a minister, government adviser, president of a public company, municipality president, 
diplomat or official in an Islamic organization financed by the Government.

rights has most recently been addressed by the Special Rapporteur in her report to the 
tenth session of the Human Rights Council (see A/HRC/10/8, paras. 29-62).   
</p>
<p><b>Sudan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 5 December 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>189. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
regarding Ms. <b>Gillian Gibbons</b>, a 54 years old English teacher from Liverpool, living in Sudan. 
On 25 November 2007, Ms. Gibbons was reportedly arrested at her home in Khartoum, where 
she teaches at a British International School. A court in Khartoum on 29 November 2007 found 
her guilty of &#8220;insulting the faith of Muslims&#8221; and sentenced her to 15 days in prison to be 
followed by deportation. Prosecutors had called for her conviction on charges of inciting 
religious hatred, which carries a punishment of up to 40 lashes, six months in prison and a fine. 
Allegedly, in September 2007, Ms. Gibbons had asked her pupils to vote a name for a teddy bear 
as part of the class&#8217;s study of animals and they named it &#8220;Muhammad&#8221;. Subsequently an office 
assistant complained to the Ministry of Education and Ms. Gibbons was accused of blasphemy 
for allowing her pupils to name a teddy bear with the Prophet&#8217;s name.  
</p>
<p>190. On 30 November 2007, thousands of protesters demonstrated in Khartoum, claiming that 
the 15-day prison sentence was too lenient. Since protesters have reportedly called for the 
execution of Ms. Gibbons, serious concern is expressed at her safety. Further reports indicate 
that Ms. Gibbons has been given a presidential pardon on 3 December 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Sudan concerning the above mentioned allegations. She would like to refer to her report to the 
62nd session of the General Assembly (A/62/280), which raises the issue of blasphemy laws. In 
paragraph 75, the Special Rapporteur notices that there are worrying trends towards applying 
blasphemy laws in a discriminatory manner and that they often disproportionately punish 
members of religious minorities, dissenting believers and non-theists or atheists. She reiterates in 
paragraph 77 that criminalizing &#8220;defamation of religions&#8221; can be counterproductive, since it may 
create an atmosphere of intolerance and fear and may even increase the chances of a backlash. </p>

</p>
<p>192. The Special Rapporteur also would like to emphasize that limitations to freedom of 
expression and freedom of religion or belief are strictly defined in international law, for example 
in articles 18 (3), 19 (3) and 20 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In 
this regard, she would like to refer to the report on the expert seminar on &#8220;Freedom of expression 
and advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or 
violence&#8221;, convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and held in 
Geneva on 2 and 3 October 2008 (see A/HRC/10/31/Add.3).

<p>193. The Special Rapporteurs raised concern on information they had received concerning the<b> 
</b>desecration<b> of Hmong graves in Wat Tham Krabok</b>. Summaries of this communication as well 
as observations of the Special Rapporteur are already reproduced in A/HRC/4/21/Add.1, 
paras. 288-290. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 23 June 2008 
</b></p>
<p>194. The Government of Thailand submitted a response to the Special Rapporteurs 
on 9 July 2008 which is summarized in the communications report of the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people (see 
A/HRC/9/9/Add.1, paras. 475-478). 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>195. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Thailand for its response to 
the communication of 2 June 2006 and - jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people - she will continue to monitor the 
situation. 
</p>
<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 7 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>196. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received relating to the right of <b>Muslim students to manifest their religion or belief</b> in Turkish 
universities. Reportedly, university regulations would prohibit students from taking examinations 
if their heads are covered. As a consequence, Muslim students would be prevented from wearing 
headscarves when taking their examinations.  
</p>
<p>197. As the Special Rapporteur has been mandated to identify existing and emerging obstacles 
to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and present recommendations on ways and 
means to overcome such obstacles, she requested the Government to provide information on the 
following issues:  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 52 
 
</p>
<p> (a) What are the rules, regulations, laws and policies applied by Turkish universities 
with respect to religious clothing? Do Turkish universities prohibit Muslim students having their 
heads covered? Is the portrayal of any religious symbol/object prohibited?; 
 (b) According to article 18, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Turkey is a State party, freedom to manifest one&#8217;s religion or belief 
may be subject to limitations only if they are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public 
safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. Please do 
clarify the limitations used for the policy on religious clothing enforced by Turkish universities; 
</p>
<p> (c) Have complaints been lodged by university students wearing a headscarf in relation 
to them being prevented from taking their university examinations or having their examinations 
cancelled? 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>198. The Special Rapporteur regrets that she has not received a reply from the Government of 
Turkey concerning the above mentioned concerns. Regarding the issue of religious symbols, she 
would like to refer to her report to the 62nd session of the Commission on Human Rights (see 
E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 36-60), which addresses the issue of religious symbols in greater detail. 
The Special Rapporteur has formulated a set of general criteria on religious symbols, including 
&#8220;neutral indicators&#8221; and &#8220;aggravating indicators&#8221;, in order to provide some guidance on the 
applicable human rights standards and their scope (see E/CN.4/2006/5, paras. 51-60). 
</p>
<p><b>United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 12 August 2008  
</b></p>
<p>199. The Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of the Government information she had 
received regarding Mr. <b>Lyle Moody</b>, who was detained in Western New Mexico Correctional 
Facility (WNMCF), Grants. Since Mr. Lyle Moody, a practicing Muslim, was reportedly 
transferred from Lea County Correctional Facility (LCCF) in Hobbs to WNMCF, he had been 
denied several religious practices by prison staff members. At WNMCF, he was prohibited from 
wearing the traditional Islamic white knit (kufi) cap, while other inmates were allowed to wear 
different kinds of caps in prison. The Islamic Jumah prayer services were not announced over 
WNMCF&#8217;s loudspeakers on Fridays, whereas other religious services were. Mr. Moody 
reportedly did not face such restrictions on the right to practice his religion when he was in 
LCCF Facility.  
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 24 October 2008 
</b></p>
<p>200. The Government informed that the U.S. Department of State had contacted the New 
Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) public affairs office regarding these allegations. They 
cited the Western New Mexico Inmate Rules and Regulations for Level II, which states that 
&#8220;Inmates will be allowed to wear authorized hats, and prescription sunglasses in the housing 
units, work areas and recreation yards only&#8221;. Head gear is not allowed in the library, education, 
medical, dining halls, or other areas of the facility. They noted that Mr. Lyle Moody had been 
allowed to wear the kufi during religious services or while praying in a designated area. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 53 
 
</p>
<p>However, Mr. Moody had expressed a desire to wear the kufi everywhere at all time, which is 
not allowed under the Rules. The WNMCF did not find any misconduct reports for him wearing 
his kufi; however, one deputy warden stated he had repeatedly asked Mr. Moody to remove it 
when he was not allowed to and he did. For this reason, in the view of the WNMCF, it had not 
been an issue. 
</p>
<p>201. With regard to the announcement of the Jumah prayer services over facility loudspeakers, 
the WNMCF responded that the deputy warden had kept the weekly sign-in logs for the Islamic 
services dating back to 25 July 2008. These showed that the services had taken place and that 
Mr. Moody had attended all of them. The deputy warden also noted that while the services may 
not always have been announced over the intercom system, the prison officers went into the unit 
to announce them. 
</p>
<p>202. Mr. Moody filed complaints with the NMCD, which were denied. According to the 
NMCD, Mr. Moody continues to challenge Rules and Regulations and NMCD policies. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>203. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s response, which also included a 
copy of the NMCD policies on religious programs. In particular, she would like to refer to the 
policy CD-101300 (C) which stipulates that &#8220;an inmate&#8217;s religious requests, including those 
considered being fundamental and essential, may be denied for reasons of security or for other 
substantiated reasons. If a request is denied, alternatives to accommodate the religious practice 
must be explored which might allow the inmate to practice by the means appropriate to their 
custody level&#8221;. In addition, she would like to refer to general comment No. 22 of the Human 
Rights Committee, which states &#8220;persons already subject to certain legitimate constraints, such 
as prisoners, continue to enjoy their rights to manifest their religion or belief to the fullest extent 
compatible with the specific nature of the constraint&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize that persons deprived of their liberty are in a particularly vulnerable situation, also 
with regard to freedom of religion or belief. It is crucial to provide the personnel of detention 
facilities with adequate training, raising awareness and enhancing their sensitivity about their 
duty to promote and respect international human rights standards for the treatment of prisoners, 
in particular the right to freedom of religion or belief.

<p><b>Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 12 February 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>204. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they 
had received regarding Mr. <b>Abdugani Tursinov Kamaliev</b>, aged 50, Uzbek national of 
Muslim faith, currently detained in the investigative prison (SIZO) of Namangansk. 
Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev, during his detention by Uzbek authorities, had reportedly been 
suspended by his feet, beaten with steel rods/steel fittings and had his teeth filed to obtain a 
confession. Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev had been deported from Tumen in Russia to Tashkent on 
5 December 2007. Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev was charged with several crimes in Uzbekistan 
(articles 156, 159, 242-2 of the Uzbek Criminal Code), which he was alleged to have 
&#8220;committed &#8230; together with the adherents of religious extremist organisation &#8216;Wahhabi&#8217;, </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 54 
 
</p>
<p>A. Yuldashev amongst others&#8221;. Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev is accused of propagating ideas of this 
organisation in Andijan, calling for the unconstitutional change of state regime by sacral war. 
Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev denies these allegations and any connections with members of the 
&#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; organisation. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 22 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>205. In its response, the Government of Uzbekistan noted that Mr. Tursinov Kamaliev was a 
member of a &#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; religious extremist organization, whose purpose was unconstitutional 
change of the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8217;s system of government. He took an active part in its 
unlawful activities through the dissemination of ideas that fanned religious hatred and the 
recruitment of citizens into its ranks. According to the information available, on 11 March 1999 
proceedings were instituted against Mr. Tursinov by the Namangan provincial procurator&#8217;s 
office on evidence that he had committed the offence referred to in article 159, part 1, of the 
Uzbek Criminal Code. As a result of Mr. Tursinov&#8217;s flight from investigators, on 17 March 1999 
he was indicted in absentia under article 159, part 1, of the Uzbek Criminal Code and a search 
warrant was issued for him by the police.  
</p>
<p>206. Mr. Tursinov was subsequently detained, investigation of the case was reinstituted and he 
was charged under articles 156 (3) (e), 159 (3) (b) and 244 (2) of the Uzbek Criminal Code and 
handed over to the courts. By decision of the Namangan provincial criminal court dated 27 
February 2008, Mr. Tursinov was convicted of multiple offences under articles 156 (3) (e) and 
159 (3) (b) of the Uzbek Criminal Code and sentenced to serve 11 years under an ordinary penal 
regime; he was acquitted of offences under article 244 (2) of the Uzbek Criminal Code. During 
the hearings, Mr. Tursinov partially admitted his guilt and testified that in 1993 he did indeed 
become a member of the religious extremist organization &#8220;Tablikh&#8221;, part of the &#8220;Wahhabi&#8221; sect, 
and that in it he was involved in recruitment of citizens from among his acquaintances to join the 
organization. After the arrest of a number of other adherents of the organization, he emigrated to 
the Russian Federation, where he married Ms. Kamalieva and took up residence with her. He 
views his involvement in the activities of the religious extremist organization as an error and has 
accordingly requested the court&#8217;s clemency. In addition to the above, Mr. Tursinov&#8217;s guilt has 
been demonstrated by the testimony of witnesses Z. Kadyrov, A. Israilov, O. Vakhabov, 
S. Kakhkharov and K. Boimirzaev, records of the confrontation of witnesses and other criminal 
case records.  
</p>
<p>207. The arguments advanced in the joint letter by the Special Rapporteurs about 
Mr. Tursinov&#8217;s having been subjected to torture and other unlawful methods of investigation for 
the purpose of obtaining a confession from him have not been corroborated by the Government 
of Uzbekistan. From the time of his arrest and throughout the subsequent period of his pre-trial 
detention and the judicial examination of the case, Mr. Tursinov voluntarily and with exceptional 
consistency gave self-incriminatory evidence that was objectively confirmed by other proof 
collected. All legal proceedings with regard to Mr. Tursinov were carried out with the 
participation of his counsel, Ms. B. Nurmukhammedova, who made no complaints of unlawful 
techniques of investigation during the conduct of the trial or afterwards.  
</p>
<p>208. The court&#8217;s verdict entered into force on 11 March 2008 but no appeal or application for 
cassation or judicial review was submitted by Mr. Tursinov or his counsel. The court correctly </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
  page 55 
 
</p>
<p>characterized Mr. Tursinov&#8217;s criminal activity, and the punishment imposed in the light of 
circumstances that aggravated or mitigated his guilt was suited to the acts. No grounds have been 
found for objecting to the court&#8217;s decision. 
<b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>209. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response of the Government of Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p><b>Viet Nam 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 16 October 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</b>210. The Special Rapporteurs brought to the attention of the Government information they had 
received concerning the alleged arbitrary killing of two indigenous Degar men, <b>Y-Ben Hdok</b> and 
<b>Mup</b>, by members of the security forces. On 28 April 2008, Y-Ben Hdok, a Degar man from 
Buon Dung village, commune of Cu Ebur, town of Buonmethuot in the province of Daklak, was 
reportedly invited to drink coffee by a friend, a police officer (his name is on record with the 
Special Rapporteurs). When Y-Ben Hdok arrived at the restaurant, eight security police (the 
Special Rapporteurs were provided a list with their names) apprehended him, handcuffed him 
and took him to a secluded location. There they struck him repeatedly with their police batons 
and kicked, punched and stomped on him until he fell down unconscious. The police officers 
then placed a rope around his neck, tied it to a police jeep and dragged him around until he was 
dead. Finally, the police took his corpse to the hospital and called his family, informing them that 
Y-Ben Hdok had committed suicide. When the corpse was brought to Y-Ben Hdok&#8217;s home, the 
police prevented the family from taking pictures. They also prevented relatives and friends from 
entering the house and viewing the body, which bore clearly visible marks of ill-treatment, 
including broken bones in both legs and arms. On 4 May 2008, the day of the burial, 
around 200 security police escorted the family to the burial grounds where numerous other 
security police were also stationed to prevent foreigners from interviewing the family and to 
prevent villagers from demonstrating. The security forces also warned the family and community 
not to report Y-Ben Hdok&#8217;s death to the Degar community in the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>211. Mup, a preacher in Ploi Rong Khong village, district of Dak Doa, Gia Lai province, had 
been summoned three times by the security police to come to their headquarters to be heard on 
his religious activities. Because he feared the police, Mup had failed to follow these summonses. 
On 25 August 2008, Mup left his village to attend the funeral of a relative in Ploi Bla village. 
When he returned to his village that evening, Mup was approached by officials and spoke to 
them. This was the last time his fellow villagers saw him alive. In the morning of 
26 August 2008, his lifeless body was found about 100 meters from the village gate, bearing the 
traces of beating. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 31 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>212. The Government of Viet Nam informed that allegations mentioned in the joint 
communication were untrue and distorted. Due to his activities violating the law, Y-Ben H&#8217;Dok 
was summoned on 28 April 2008 by the Agency for Investigation of Buon Ma Thuot at the 
police headquarters of Tan An Wart. On 30 April 2008, according to a decision of the People&#8217;s </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/8/Add.1 
page 56 
 
</p>
<p>Procuracy, the Agency for Investigation of Buon Ma Thuot provisionally detained him from 
investigation. He confessed that he had conducted activities violating the law. The Government 
indicated that, on 1 May 2008, he was found dead - having committed suicide by hanging with 
his shirt - in the detention house of Tan An Wart. The police of Dak Lak province in 
collaboration with other concerned agencies carried out investigation of the scene, decided to 
send his dead body to the general hospital of Dak Lak province for a post-mortem examination 
to find out reasons of his death, but his family did not agree with a post-mortem examination on 
his dead body. His family voluntarily wrote a paper of guarantee, pledging to take his dead body 
to his village for burial. Therefore, the reasons of his death could not be identified. According to 
the Government, the professional agencies of Viet Nam are facing difficulties in sending dead 
bodies for post-mortem examinations. The local people believe that a post-mortem examination 
breaks their traditional custom and do not want a dead body to be examined. 
</p>
<p>213. With regard to Mup, the Government informed that on 26 August 2008, the People&#8217;s 
Committee of Kdang commune had invited him to its office to identify his activities contrary 
to law provisions. When he finished his declaration, he was allowed to go home. On 
27 August 2008, he committed suicide by hanging in a garden behind his house. When his 
family members saw him, he was already dead. Local people said that he had symptoms of 
mental disease. In the past, he attempted to commit suicide several times, but he was timely 
taken care of. His family certified that he was dead, because he had committed suicide by 
hanging himself. His family asked for permission to bury his dead body, refused a post-mortem 
examination and did not submit a complaint about his death. 
</p>
<p>214. The Government further informed that in Viet Nam, there is a strong legal framework to 
protect complainants and denunciators. Article 74 of the 1992 Constitution stipulates that 
citizens have the right to lodge with any competent State authority a complaint or denunciation 
regarding transgressions of the law by any State agencies, economic or social organizations, 
people&#8217;s armed force units or any individual; retaliation against complainants or denunciators is 
strictly prohibited. Stipulations for dealing with wrong doings of individuals who take 
responsibility to settle complaints, denunciations and dealing with heads of competent agencies, 
organizations that do not apply necessary measures to prevent wrong doings of his/her 
employees are provided in several provisions of the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedures Code, 
the Civil Procedures Code, the Complaints and Denunciations law and of relevant Government 
decrees. In addition, the following measures are applied by professional agencies - such as the 
People&#8217;s Court, the People&#8217;s Procuracy, etc. - to protect complainants and denunciators: 1) to 
receive complainants and denunciators in a friendly manner and to engage in a dialogue with 
them in order to find out prompt solutions; 2) to guide the professional agencies at the lower 
levels to strengthen their cooperation in dealing with complaints and denunciations; 3) to 
guarantee the safety of complainants and denunciators.

<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>215. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the response of the Government of the Socialist 
Republic of Viet Nam. She would like to refer to General Assembly resolution 63/181 which 
urges States &#8220;to step up their efforts to protect and promote freedom of thought, conscience, 
religion and belief, and to this end to ensure that no one within their jurisdiction is deprived of

<p>arrest or detention&#8221;. Similarly, the Human Rights Council resolution 6/37 urges States to &#8220;take 
all necessary and appropriate action, in conformity with international standards of human rights, 
to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by 
intolerance based on religion or belief, as well as incitement to hostility and violence, with 
particular regard to religious minorities&#8221;. Furthermore, in letters sent to the Government on 
28 March 2008 and 28 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur reiterated her wish to visit the

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 28 August 2008 jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 
Working group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b></p>
<p>216. The Special Procedures mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government 
information they had received concerning the arrest and detention of Mr. <b>Zia&#8217;u&#8217;llah 
Pourahmari</b>, Mr. <b>Keyvan Qadari</b>, Mr. <b>Behrooz Rohani</b> and Mr. <b>Sayfi Ibrahim Sayfi</b>, who are 
members of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community in Sana&#8217;a. On the night of 20-21 June 2008, national security 
officials reportedly arrested six Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; members in Sana&#8217;a, including the above mentioned 
individuals as well as Mr. Walid Ayyash and Mr. Mohammad Al-Qulathi, who are both Yemeni 
citizens, during raids in two private homes. Two days later, on 23 June 2008, eight individuals 
(five of whom were armed) came with search warrants to the home of Dr. Moein Pourahmari 
(the son of one of the detainees) which is used as a meeting place for the national and local 
Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Assemblies. The officials conducted a thorough search, photographed the rooms, and 
confiscated files related to the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; National Assembly as well as the Assembly&#8217;s computer. 
They specifically requested a list of all Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s living in Yemen.  
</p>
<p>217. On 12 July 2008, national security officers came to get Mr. Sinan Sayfi, the son of another 
one of the detainees, and interrogated him for two hours before releasing him later the same day. 
They repeatedly asked him to write down the names of all the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s in Yemen and accused 
him of spying for Israel. Reportedly, the six Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s members, two of which are Yemeni, 
three are of Iranian background and one is Iraqi, were detained without charge for six weeks and 
held in solitary cells. On 2 August 2008, all six detainees were transferred to the &#8220;criminal 
investigation jail&#8221;, where they remained in custody while their cases were being investigated 
further.  
</p>
<p>218. Family members were eventually able to visit some of the detainees and at least one of 
them had access to legal counsel. The lawyer was told that all six of them were being charged 
with apostasy. The two Yemeni citizens, Mr. Walid Ayyash and Mr. Mohammad Al-Qulathi, 
have reportedly been released in the meantime but it remains unclear whether all charges have 
been dropped against them.  
</p>
<p>219. It is reported that a decision on the charges regarding Mr. Zia&#8217;u&#8217;llah Pourahmari, 
Mr. Keyvan Qadari, Mr. Behrooz Rohani and Mr. Sayfi Ibrahim Sayfi is imminent and concerns 
have been raised that they may be deported subsequently to the Islamic Republic of Iran or the 
Republic of Iraq, respectively. Concerns were expressed that the arrest and detention of 
Mr. Zia&#8217;u&#8217;llah Pourahmari, Mr. Keyvan Qadari, Mr. Behrooz Rohani and Mr. Sayfi Ibrahim 
Sayfi might be solely connected to the exercise of their right to freedom of religion or belief. 
Further concern was expressed that in the event of their reportedly imminent deportation to Iran 
or Iraq they might be subjected to arbitrary arrests and detention. </p>

Mr. Zia&#8217;u&#8217;llah Pourahmari (and his wife) of Iranian origin, as well as Mr. Sayfi Ibrahim Sayfi 
(with his wife and children) of Iraqi origin, have been deported in January 2009, with the
