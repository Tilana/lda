</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> the relevance of the optional protocols to the core international human 
rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note</i> <i>with appreciation</i> of the broad support for the initiative to elaborate a set of 
human rights voluntary goals, inspired by the Millennium Development Goals, which led to the 
adoption, by consensus, of Council resolution 6/26, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the open-ended intergovernmental process initiated by the Council in its 
resolution 6/26, with special attention to the high-level panel on human rights voluntary goals 
held at the seventh session of the Council, in order to elaborate, on a consensual basis, a set of 
human rights voluntary goals to promote the realization and implementation of the Universal

promotion and protection of human rights and, inter alia, for fostering international cooperation 
and facilitating the exchange of information on best practices in this regard,

with disabilities; 
</p>

system, including special procedures and treaty bodies;

ensure the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to development;
