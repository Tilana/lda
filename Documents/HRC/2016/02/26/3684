</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council, 
</i></p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, in particular as 
to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status,  </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and the relevance of 
these treaties in the protection of all migrants, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also </i>previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the protection of the human rights of 
migrants, and the work of various special mechanisms of the Council that have reported on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> the importance of the decent work agenda of the International 
Labour Organization, including for migrant workers, the eight fundamental Conventions of 
that Organization and the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference 
at its ninety-eighth session, as a general framework within which each country can 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote 
a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the successful negotiation of International Labour Organization 
Convention No. 189 concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers, adopted on 16 June 
2011, </p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the efforts made to ensure respect for the human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of migrants, </p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/170 of 20 December 2010, in which the 
Assembly acknowledges the important nexus between international migration and 
development and the need to deal with the challenges and opportunities that migration 
presents to countries of origin, transit and destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the resolve to take further measures to ensure respect for and protection 
of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and members of their families, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, to 
exercise due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants, including those perpetrated with 
racist or xenophobic motivations, to investigate such crimes and to punish the perpetrators 
and that not doing so violates, and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of, the human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of victims, and urging States to reinforce measures in this 
regard, including international cooperation, </p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind also</i> that article 4 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights establishes that the States parties recognize that, in the 
enjoyment of those rights provided by the State in conformity with the Covenant, the State 
may subject such rights only to such limitations as are determined by law only in so far as 
this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of 
promoting the general welfare in a democratic society, </p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that migrant workers are among the most vulnerable in the context of the 
financial and economic crisis and that remittances, which are significant private financial 
sources for households, have been negatively affected by rising unemployment and weak 
earnings growth among migrant workers in some countries of destination, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> that female migrant workers engaged in domestic services are 
among the most vulnerable groups of migrant workers, some of whom are subject to a 
widespread pattern of physical, sexual and psychological abuse and exposure to health and 
safety threats without adequate information about associated risks and precautions,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing concern</i> <i>also </i>at the fact that the vulnerable situation of migrants may 
result in violations of their human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Global Forum on Migration and Development process, including the 
debates on migratory mobility, which emphasize the importance of facilitating access to 
regular forms of migration and to social services, including health, that contribute to 
strengthening the personal development prospects and outcomes for migrants and their 
families, </p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that workers who are non-documented or in an irregular situation are 
frequently employed under less favourable conditions of work than other workers and that 
certain employers find this an inducement to seek such labour in order to reap the benefits 
of unfair competition,<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing</i> the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of 
international, regional and bilateral cooperation and the need to protect the human rights of </p>


<p>migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized 
economy and take place in a context of new security concerns,  
</p>
<p><i> Mindful</i> of the shared responsibility in the protection of the human rights of migrants 
and that the long-term benefits of migration can be achieved by improving international 
cooperation, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants;1 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet signed, ratified or acceded to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families to consider doing so, and requests the Secretary-General to 
continue his efforts to promote and raise awareness of the Convention;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants 
regardless of their legal status, and also taking into account the principles and standards set 
forth in the relevant human rights instruments as well as those relevant conventions of the 
International Labour Organization;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses</i> <i>its concern</i> at legislation and measures adopted by some States that 
may restrict the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, and reaffirms that, 
when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security 
measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human 
rights of migrants;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i> that migrant workers are entitled to equal protection by the law and 
should receive due process protection regardless of their migratory status;  </p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to ensure that their immigration policies are consistent 
with their obligations under human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the obligations of States under the International Covenants on Human Rights and, in 
this regard, strongly condemns the manifestations and acts of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the stereotypes often applied to 
them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and urges States to apply and, where 
needed, reinforce the existing laws when xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or 
expressions against migrants occur, in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit 
xenophobic and racist acts; </p>
<p> 8.<i> Requests</i> all States to firmly protect migrant workers&#8217; rights with regard to 
their conditions of work, regardless of their migratory status, inter alia, those rights relating 
to payment of wages for the time worked, conditions of health, safety at work and freedom 
of association;  </p>
<p> 9. <i>Stresses </i>that migrant workers are entitled, without any discrimination, to just 
and favourable conditions of work and should have the appropriate means of securing them, 
including through the protection of due process, access to justice and the right to assemble 
peacefully and associate freely; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Reaffirms</i> that once a migrant worker assumes an employment relationship, 
the migrant acquires rights that should be recognized and ensured, irrespective of his or her 
migratory status, in the State where he or she is employed; 
</p>

<p> 11. <i>Welcomes </i>programmes and policies implemented by some States of 
destination that promote the full respect of labour rights of migrants, regardless of their 
immigration status, as well as initiatives of States of origin to promote labour markets; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Urges</i> States to strengthen measures to protect the human rights of migrant 
workers in times of humanitarian crisis;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Encourages</i> countries of origin, transit and destination to seek technical 
assistance and/or collaborate with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to better promote and protect human rights of migrants; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants to continue 
his efforts to promote and support the building of greater synergies between States to 
strengthen cooperation for the protection of migrant workers and their families; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to prepare a report on best practices of 
States to protect the human rights of all migrant workers.
