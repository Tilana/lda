<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences, Rashida Manjoo, conducted an official mission to 
Papua New Guinea from 18 to 26 March 2012. She visited Port Moresby, Goroka, 
Kundiawa, Minj and Buka, in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. The objective of 
the visit was to examine the situation of violence against women in the country in a 
comprehensive manner, including violence that is perpetrated within the family; community 
violence; violence that occurs in institutional settings; and violence related to the 
development of the country&#8223;s extractive industries.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice; the 
Office of the Public Prosecutor; the Ministry for Community Development, including the 
Office of Development of Women; the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, including 
staff from Family and Sexual Violence Units; and the Department of Health. She also met 
with magistrates from a village court, the Parliamentary leader of the opposition, the 
Constitutional Law Reform Commission, and judges from the Supreme Court.   
</p>
<p>3. During her visit to the provinces the Special Rapporteur met with local authorities, 
including the Provincial Administrator of the Eastern Highlands Province and the Governor 
of Simbu Province, as well as police authorities and health-care providers in Goroka, 
Kundiawa and Minj. She also met with the Vice-President and other senior authorities of 
the Autonomous Government of Bougainville, in Buka.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur met with representatives of civil society, including women&#8223;s 
organizations, and representatives of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes. She 
had the opportunity to visit the Family Support Centre at Port Moresby General Hospital, as 
well as the Bomana women&#8223;s prison, and a women&#8223;s shelter, run by a non-governmental 
organization (NGO), in Port Moresby, where she heard testimonies from a number of 
women.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express her appreciation to the Government for its 
cooperation. She is also grateful to the United Nations Country Team, particularly its 
Human Rights Advisor, for the support extended prior to and during the visit. The Special 
Rapporteur looks forward to a fruitful and continued dialogue with the Government and 
other stakeholders on the implementation of her recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The economic and political context and its implications for 
women 
</b></p>
<p>6. Papua New Guinea is the largest and most populated country of the Pacific Islands 
and is extremely diverse, not only in terms of its topography and ecosystems, but also as 
regards the ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups that live in the country. Most settlements 
are small, isolated and scattered throughout a vast landscape, and more than 800 distinct 
languages are spoken in the country.1 
</p>
<p>7. The population is currently estimated at 7.014 million inhabitants.2 It is estimated 
that 87 per cent live in rural areas and only 13 per cent live in the country&#8223;s 20 main urban

<p>centres, including the National Capital District, where Port Moresby is located.3 While the 
total fertility rate has decreased steadily since the 1980s, it remains high, at more than 4 per 
cent.4 With a population growth rate of more than 2.3 per cent per year, the country&#8223;s 
population doubles every 30 years.5   
</p>
<p>8. Papua New Guinea is classified as a low human development country, ranking 153rd 
out of 187 countries in the 2011 Human Development Index of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), with a life expectancy at birth of 62.8 years, the 
expected years of schooling being 5.8 years, and a gross national income per capita of 
US$ 2,271.6 Social indicators from the census of 2000 indicated that women had a lower 
life expectancy at birth than men (54.1 versus 63.7 years), and that infant mortality rates, 
child mortality rates and mortality rates for children under 5 were higher for females than 
males (CEDAW/C/PNG/3, p. 15). 
</p>
<p>9. The country experiences high levels of inequality, and the economic growth 
experienced through the development of extractive industries has not reached all segments 
of the population. This is reflected, for example, in the Southern Highlands Province, a 
resource-rich region with one of the highest provincial revenues in the country, yet with 
lower per capita provincial revenue than the national average.7 Another obstacle to the 
country&#8223;s equitable development is its high levels of corruption. In 2012, Transparency 
International ranked the country 150th out of 176 countries, with 176 being the most 
corrupt.8  
</p>
<p>10. It is argued that there are specific traditional elements of the country&#8223;s social 
environment that help alleviate poverty levels. The traditional land tenure system allows for 
land ownership by clans and/or individuals, the <i>wantok</i> system provides a safety and 
support network for family and clan members, and churches and community-based groups 
play a role as providers of employment and services, including health and education 
services.9 Women, however do not always benefit substantively from such systems. 
</p>
<p>11. With reference to the UNDP Gender Inequality Index, Papua New Guinea ranks 
140th out of 146 countries.10 It has one of the highest global rates of maternal mortality, 
with a figure of 930 per 100,000 births (CEDAW/C/PNG/3, p. 16).  
</p>
<p>12. Due to the low number of schools and their remoteness, access to education remains 
very limited for the majority in rural areas. While the introduction of educational reforms in 
the 1990s increased enrolment rates, in 2007 women&#8223;s literacy rates remained at 53.4 per 
cent compared to 62.1 per cent for men.11 Approximately half of the girls who attend 
primary schools continue to the secondary school level, but girls often leave school after 
puberty due to a number of factors, including sexual harassment/abuse, or preparations for

<p>marriage.12 As regards university education, in 2007 the percentage of female students to 
male students in universities was 35 per cent to 65 per cent, with women mostly enrolled in 
courses such as nursing, secretarial work or teaching.13  
</p>
<p>13. Within the country&#8223;s subsistence economy, women are mainly responsible for food-
crop production, small livestock rearing or fishing. However, with the development of the 
cash economy, women have been increasingly compelled to market any surplus from their 
household production. This has added to women&#8223;s already excessive workload, which 
includes housekeeping chores and child rearing. Formal employment opportunities are very 
limited, with only 5 per cent of females engaging in formal employment.14  
</p>
<p>14. As regards political participation, at the time of the visit there was only one woman 
in Government holding a Cabinet position, serving as the Minister for Community 
Development. There were no female provincial governors. There was one female National 
Court judge. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Main manifestations of violence against women  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic and sexual violence in the family 
</b></p>
<p>15. There is no recent official data available on domestic violence. The last research 
commissioned by the Government was undertaken between 1982 and 1986 and published 
by the Law Reform Commission in 1992. This report reflected that 66 per cent of 
interviewed husbands said they beat their wives and 67 per cent of interviewed wives said 
they had been hit.15 An academic study conducted in 2009 shared similar findings, noting 
that 65.3 per cent of the interviewed women were survivors of domestic violence.16 More 
recent reports confirm that violence against women in the family is widespread, pervasive 
and often tolerated.17 
</p>
<p>16. A report analysing 908 cases of hospitalized male and female victims of violence in 
the Southern Highlands Province found that women made up two thirds of all cases.18 Half 
of all cases of violence against girls and single women were experienced within the family 
and perpetrated by a relative, such as a brother/stepbrother (37 per cent), father/stepfather 
(20 per cent), uncle (19 per cent), or a cousin (20 per cent).19 The study also found that 
women knew their assailant in 94 per cent of cases and that 75 per cent of all cases of 
violence, whether against men or women, involved a male perpetrator.20 
</p>
<p>17. Physical intimate partner violence against women, commonly referred to as &#8220;wife 
bashing&#8221;, is perhaps the most prevalent form of violence against women in the country.21

<p>injuries sustained by women who had been kicked, punched, burned or even mutilated by 
their husbands. She also received a large number of testimonies, both oral and written, from 
service providers, activists and local authorities.  
</p>
<p>18. While each individual story is unique, some common elements were identified (see 
appendix), including: substance abuse by perpetrators of domestic violence; violence not 
limited to physical violence but also involving threats, the destruction of property and/or 
the destruction of identification documents; women having to assume the role of primary 
breadwinners and husbands not working and/or spending the family income on alcohol or 
in gambling activities; reports to the police not being taken seriously; and, in some cases, 
police officers even fearing the alleged perpetrator.  
</p>
<p>19. Among the root causes of such violence are the common perceptions that wife 
beating is a normal part of married life and that a husband has the right to hit his wife as a 
way to discipline her if she does something to upset him, and because he is supposedly the 
main breadwinner or head of the family. The 1992 Law Reform Commission study showed 
that 67 per cent of rural husbands surveyed, and 57 per cent of rural wives, thought it was 
acceptable in some circumstances for a man to hit his wife.22 This reasoning also applies to 
daughters, sisters and other female household members. Being perceived as disobedient, 
disrespectful, flirty, lazy, stubborn or uncooperative may result in unmarried women being 
subjected to discipline by their fathers, brothers or other male relatives.23 
</p>
<p>20. Women victims therefore face a general lack of support from the family and the 
community, and are reluctant to report violence or seek help. The continuing, although 
officially banned, practice by hospitals of charging a &#8220;fighting fee&#8221; to patients involved in 
cases of violence, or charging a fee for a medical certificate, is a further barrier to reporting 
violence, as a case cannot be opened at the police station without such a certificate. 
</p>
<p>21. Many interlocutors referred to the practice of bride-price payment as an aggravating 
factor that fuels situations of domestic violence and limits the avenues for women to escape 
abusive relationships. Men commonly feel entitled to control and even abuse their wives as 
a result of having paid the bride price, thus regarding women as their property. Likewise, 
families who received such payment are reluctant to provide support or receive abused 
women back in the family home, as this will entail paying compensation or returning the 
bride price received for the marriage.  
</p>
<p>22. Polygamy was also identified as a common cause of violence in the family. Many 
victims explained how husbands had become abusive or increased their abusive behaviour 
after deciding to start a relationship with another woman. The abuse usually starts with 
neglect and lack of resource provision for the first wife and her children, but can escalate to 
physical and sexual violence, and in some cases murder. The practice of polygamy also 
creates tension between women within the same family and has led to cases of violence, 
sometimes resulting in murder of the husband or the additional wife/girlfriend. A large 
number of women interviewed in the Bomana prison were serving lengthy sentences after 
being convicted for the murder of their husband or the additional wife/girlfriend.  
</p>
<p>23. Interviewees explained that polygamy is linked to male notions of identity and 
wealth. As men become more wealthy or powerful, having more women and children is a 
marker of status for them. It was stated that many men who have reached top political 
positions in the country have reportedly followed this practice, and therefore have little 
political will to promote the legislative changes that would outlaw the practice of 
polygamy.

<p>24. With regard to sexual violence within the family, a 1993 report found that 55 per 
cent of the interviewed women had been forced into sex against their will, in most cases by 
men they knew, and half of the interviewed married women stated their husbands used 
beatings or threats to force them into sex.24 Although marital rape is penalized by the 
Criminal Code, only two cases have reportedly been prosecuted since the relevant 
legislation was enacted in 2003. Due to the above-mentioned practice of bride price, many 
men feel they have the right to have sexual relations with their wives whenever they want, 
regardless of the woman&#8223;s wishes. This also has consequence on women&#8223;s capacity to 
</p>
<p>protect themselves against HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, particularly 
considering that many men engage in sexual relations with multiple partners. 
</p>
<p>25. Service providers confirmed that the number of cases of incest and teenage 
pregnancies is on the rise. Young girls, particularly those living with relatives or step-
parents, are reportedly at high risk of sexual violence, which is perpetrated by male 
relatives, such as uncles, cousins or brothers, or male family friends. Girls who do not live 
with their natural parents are at a greater risk of experiencing sexual violence due to their 
dependence on male relatives for food, shelter, school fees and other basic necessities.25  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur received information indicating a strong link between 
violence against women and prostitution. She heard testimonies of women who were sold 
into prostitution by their husbands or who were abandoned or kicked out of their homes and 
then resorted to survival sex for food and other basic needs. Some of these women end up 
working in night clubs where the cycle of violence and exploitation continues. Through 
interviews with sex workers and women&#8223;s groups in Port Moresby, the Special Rapporteur 
heard accounts of young girls and women being exploited in nightclubs owned by &#8220;Asian&#8221; 
</p>
<p>men who do not allow women to leave the premises, nor allow women&#8223;s groups to make 
</p>
<p>contact with them to offer services such as HIV education.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual violence against women in the community 
</b></p>
<p>27. In a 2005 report on children and HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Children&#8223;s Fund 
(UNICEF) described rape in Papua New Guinea as &#8220;a major threat to social stability and 
economic development [which] seriously impedes the full and active participation of 
women and girls&#8221;.26 The report found that rape and sexual assault had reached epidemic 
levels, but that most cases remained unreported. Another 2006 report described gang rape 
as a common practice, with approximately 60 per cent of interviewed men indicating they 
had participated in gang rape.27 
</p>
<p>28. In Port Moresby, in particular, interviews revealed that women fear rape, gang rape 
and other forms of violent crime in the streets, and this has limited their ability to move 
freely and safely without a companion. The abuse of alcohol and other substances is 
reportedly also present in many of the cases of sexual violence in the community. It is 
reported that criminal gangs play a formative role in the lives of many young men, often

</p>
<p>promoting sexual violence against women as a way of asserting their masculinity and 
encouraging male bonding.28 
</p>
<p>29. The risk of sexual assault and rape was also a particular source of concern among 
interviewed women who are living in regions facing tribal conflict. In some cases, rape is 
not only carried out to harm the direct victim, but also as a means to harm a rival group or 
community by raping &#8220;their&#8221; women, and thus to express dominance over a group and/or 
celebrate victory against them.29 The Special Rapporteur also heard testimonies of violence 
and rape related to land disputes and electoral processes, which is worsened by the 
increasing availability of firearms, particularly in the Highlands region. Women and girls 
experience displacement and rape, and often contract HIV during times of armed conflict. 
However this problem remains invisible because victims are reluctant to discuss the sexual 
violence they suffered, particularly when displaced in villages where no local support 
exists. Women&#8223;s groups also reported a lack of responsiveness by local police, who often 
allow rival villagers to &#8220;solve&#8221; their problems among themselves. This is usually not in the 
interest of women victims and it serves to make them more reluctant to seek support from 
the authorities.  
</p>
<p>30. The prevalence of sexual violence is particularly worrying given the country&#8223;s 
current high rates of HIV/AIDS. In 2009, 35,800 adults aged 15-49 were living with HIV 
(0.9 per cent of the population), and 11,520 people were estimated to have died of HIV-
related illnesses.30  
</p>
<p><b> C. Sorcery-related violence, tribal violence and displacement 
</b></p>
<p>31. The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is widespread across the country, with 90 per 
cent of the population believing in its existence. This belief is reportedly shared by persons 
of all educational and socioeconomic levels, who fear harm or misfortune that they see as 
caused deliberately through supernatural powers. People do not easily accept natural causes 
of illness, sickness or death, and commonly dismiss medical reasons that explain them.31 
Therefore, the interrogation, torture, exile and even killing of people accused of sorcery as a 
means of punishment is allowed by some communities throughout the country.32 
</p>
<p>32. During her visit to the Highlands region, the Special Rapporteur witnessed the 
brutality of the assaults perpetrated against suspected sorcerers, which in many cases 
include torture, rape, mutilation and murder. She met women survivors who shared oral and 
written testimonies (see appendix).  
</p>
<p>33. According to the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC), Papua New 
Guinea has the highest number of reported cases relating to sorcery-related killings, and 
these cases have been on the rise since the 1980s.33 The exact extent of sorcery-related 
violence is difficult to estimate, however, as many cases are unreported. In a period of 
seven years (2000-2006), two major national newspapers reported 166 cases of sorcery-
related violence, of which 55 took place in the Highlands, 30 in Momase, 23 in the

<p>Southern region, 8 in the New Guinea Islands region and 50 in an unspecified location.34 In 
Simbu Province alone, it is estimated that 150 cases of violence and killings occur each 
year as a result of witchcraft accusations, with impunity as the norm.35 
</p>
<p>34. While both men and women have been accused of sorcery and have fallen victim to 
violence, the number of women being tortured and murdered is higher than the number of 
men. A 2010 report suggests that women are six times more likely to be accused of sorcery 
than men.36 Women who marry into different tribes, widows and elderly women with no 
children or grandchildren to protect them, as well as women born out of wedlock, are at a 
higher risk of being targeted, given that perpetrators have no fear of reprisal killings or 
other consequences.37 Women are the first to be blamed and targeted when there is an 
unexplained death or misfortune in a family or in a village, and thus they &#8220;live with a 
</p>
<p>constant fear of being accused of sorcery&#8221;.38  
</p>
<p>35. There is growing concern that sorcery accusations that lead to killings, injuries or 
exile are often economically or personally motivated and used to deprive women of their 
land and/or property. Furthermore, accusations of sorcery are often a convenient cover for 
premeditated killings triggered by personal dislikes, jealousy, envy, greed, rivalry or 
revenge and the targeting of women from other tribes or communities.39  
</p>
<p>36. This information was confirmed through the testimonies heard in Kundiawa, Goroka 
and Minj. Many interlocutors explained how sorcery-related violence is commonly 
perpetrated against widows or women with no male kin living nearby to defend them. 
Women have lost land, homes, produce and livestock, and in many cases have been exiled 
from their communities. Attacks were commonly perpetrated by young men or boys acting 
under the orders of other members of the community, and under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol, which are provided by such persons. Interviewees often stated that the men who 
raped and/or tortured them were usually intoxicated. 
</p>
<p>37. Factors at the community level which allow for impunity for perpetrators include: 
the unwillingness to intervene prior to, or during, such attacks; fear of reporting and/or 
providing information to the police; and the use of the wantok solidarity tradition by which 
perpetrators are protected. Interviewed police officers in the Highlands region stated that 
the reluctance of survivors and witnesses to provide information greatly impedes their 
ability to investigate these cases and arrest perpetrators. This is coupled with the police&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>own lack of skills and other resources.  
</p>
<p>38. In some cases, women accused of sorcery are not killed but banished from the 
communities. Victims and their families often lose or see destroyed their homes, gardens, 
livestock or other property. Others flee their communities for fear of being attacked and 
killed. The situation of displacement has adverse consequences for women as they often 
lose their main sources of income. The Special Rapporteur met with displaced women in 
Minj who were basically living as nomads, with no access to land to grow food for 
subsistence or for marketing. Some women manage to find refuge with relatives or tribe

<p>members, but this can eventually lead to tensions with the host families or communities, as 
they also fear reprisals for hosting displaced families.  
</p>
<p>39. There is also an important link between sorcery-related violence and armed tribal 
conflict, with sorcery being one of the factors inciting tribal fights in the Highlands. A 2010 
report found that, in the Hangonofi district, 25 of the 31 incidents reported of tribal fights 
between 2005 and 2007 were caused by sorcery. Similarly, 7 out of the 11 tribal fights 
reported during the same period in the Kainantu district were related to sorcery. In the 
Unggai Bena district, all 7 tribal fight cases from 2002 to 2006 were reportedly caused by 
sorcery accusations.40 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur met with a network of women human rights defenders in the 
Highlands, who have been increasingly documenting and reporting cases of violence 
against women in the region, with a special focus on sorcery-related violence. In 2011 the 
network submitted several cases which the Special Rapporteur and other mandate holders 
brought to the attention of the Government through communications in September 2011.41 
To date, these communications have remained unanswered. These cases involve not only 
violence against women, but also serious threats and intimidation faced by the women 
human rights defenders providing support and assistance to the victims.  </p>
<p><b> D. Women in custody and violence perpetrated by the police 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur examined the situation of women in detention, both remand 
and convicted prisoners. She was informed that 90 per cent of women in prisons in the 
country have been serving life sentences for murder. In the Bomana prison for women, she 
interviewed women charged with murder and other crimes. From the information received, 
it was clear that all the women convicted for murder in Bomona were victims of family 
violence, including being subjected to polygamy and neglect, and many of them had acted 
in self-defence. In most cases, women had endured years of physical and sexual abuse from 
their attackers, usually their husbands, and had received no support when reaching out to 
the community or the police (see appendix).  
</p>
<p>42. Most incarcerated women did not have adequate legal representation and they 
accepted the option of a plea for a lesser charge rather than go to trial &#8211; after being advised 
to do so by their lawyers. Nevertheless, all the interviewed women had ended up receiving 
lengthy sentences, despite their expectation that a plea to a lesser charge would result in a 
lower sentence. Many women were of the view that judges were unresponsive to evidence 
that reflected acts committed in self-defence, history of abuse and acts committed in a rage 
when catching their husbands being unfaithful to them. This was reflected in comments 
made by some judges, who stated in some cases that women who had taken a life needed to 
pay the price. 
</p>
<p>43. As regards the conditions in prisons, women do not receive adequate and suitable 
food; they do not have regular access to health services, and need to wait long periods to 
see a medical professional; they are reliant on family and friends for appropriate 
medication; and they are forced to work without receiving any remuneration for their 
products or their labour. Women do gardening and grow some vegetables in prison for 
consumption, as well as make handicrafts, such as traditional <i>bilum</i> bags. Police officers

<p>then sell these products outside the prison with the proceeds going to a Corrective 
Institutions Service trust account. Thus inmates do not receive payment for their work. As 
stated by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, women in prisons were &#8220;forced to perform domestic work for officers in 
both police stations and correctional institutions, including doing their laundry and making 
string bags (<i>bilums</i>) for the officers to sell&#8221; (A/HRC/16/52/Add.5, para. 70). As regards 
hygiene products, such as soap or toothpaste, women rely on visitors to provide them with 
such items, which they then share with other women who have no one to provide these for 
them. For women in prison with their children, there is only a one-bed cell which 
sometimes has to cater for seven women and nine children. Furthermore, the prison does 
not provide food or other necessities for babies and children; these remain the responsibility 
of the mother.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur also visited the detention cells in the police station of 
Kundiawa, where she interviewed seven female detainees, including three minors. One 16-
year-old girl had been detained for three months, a 15-year-old girl had been there for a 
month and another 15-year-old girl had arrived the night before. The three minors were 
sharing a small cell with four adult women, two of them suspected of murder. One of the 
15-year-old girls had been detained for fighting in the street with an adult woman who was 
placed in the same cell as her, and who violently attacked her during the Special 
Rapporteur&#8223;s visit. Police officers reacted to the attack after the Special Rapporteur insisted 
that attention be paid to the screams that were emanating from the cell.  
</p>
<p>45. The detainees receive one meal a day consisting of rice and tinned fish. Many had 
not left the cell, except a couple of times to go to court. The cases of two of the detained 
minors had not been heard in court, despite them having already spent one and three 
months in jail, respectively. A number of the detained women reported having been beaten 
by the police when arrested. They also reported being beaten with a key chain in the 
detention cell when found climbing up the wall to talk to relatives or other visitors through 
the cell&#8223;s window. Some of the interviewed women had not had access to a lawyer. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur attempted, without success, to track down the relevant child rights 
advocate and the court personnel, in order to have the children moved to a suitable facility 
or granted bail so that they could go home. 
</p>
<p>46. Reports of police brutality and misconduct were widely reported in all parts of the 
country. Complaints indicated that violence and sexual abuse of women, including sex 
workers, while in police detention was a systemic issue. The Special Rapporteur met with 
several sex workers in Port Moresby who shared how police officers constantly harass, 
arbitrarily detain and sexually abuse them (see appendix). Interviewees stated that police 
officers often arrest them simply to take their money. One interviewee who had been beaten 
by a police officer attempted to file a complaint through the Internal Investigation Unit of 
the police. On her way to the station, she met another police officer who advised her not to 
waste her time, as these complaints &#8220;were never followed up&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>47. These findings echo those made by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture 
in 2010, when he referred to women&#8223;s risk of sexual abuse upon arrest and in police 
custody, as well as sexual abuse in exchange for release (A/HRC/16/52/Add.5, para. 70). 
The report referred to allegations of officers arresting women for minor offences with the 
intention of sexually abusing them; allowing male detainees to enter cells where women 
were held and sexually attacking them; and threatening to place or actually placing women 
in cells with male detainees for a night, where they were subjected to collective rape (ibid.). </p>

<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p><b> E. Sexual violence related to the extractive industries  
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also received allegations of violence against women 
committed in the context of the country&#8223;s extractive industries. The increasing influx into 
</p>
<p>poor and isolated communities of men who are employed by these companies and who 
have access to much needed cash income has created a &#8220;market&#8221; for sexual services, and 
</p>
<p>has also resulted in cases of sexual exploitation and abuse. The Special Rapporteur heard 
cases of employees &#8220;luring&#8221; or &#8220;marrying&#8221; local women, then abandoning them and their 
children. These men also engage in polygamy, thereby increasing the risk of women 
contracting sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. Other allegations shared by women 
involved rape by miners and other company employees.   
</p>
<p>49. Interviewees also referred to the shift in the policing priorities from the villages to 
the mine sites. This is due to the expansion of the extractive industries, and this has had 
particularly negative effects on women. Younger police officers who are better skilled and 
resourced have been deployed to these sites, or have been engaged as private security 
officers, thus leaving villages with ill-equipped police who do not respond adequately to the 
calls for help by women victims of violence.  
</p>
<p>50. The particular case of the Porgera gold mine was brought to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8223;s attention. Allegations include beatings and gang rape committed by the 
</p>
<p>private security personnel employed by the mine. While the company initially failed to 
detect the abuse or take the allegations seriously, it has reportedly now conducted 
investigations in collaboration with the police; identified additional cases;42 and designed a 
set of gender-sensitive reparations to the victims.43 These reparations would include 
individualized services and support for victims, as well as community-wide services, 
infrastructure and/or facilities to develop the capacity of the local community to address 
issue of violence against women. In addition, a number of important preventative and 
supervisory initiatives would be implemented by the company.44 It is hoped that the results 
of this process will set an important precedent as regards the responsibility of private 
companies and of State authorities in upholding the human rights of women and girls in the 
country, as articulated in international law.45  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitution  
</b></p>
<p>51. From its preamble, the Constitution establishes as one of the country&#8223;s national 
goals &#8220;for every person to be dynamically involved in the process of freeing himself or 
herself from every form of domination or oppression so that each man or woman will have 
the opportunity to develop as a whole person in relationship with others&#8221;.  It also calls for 
&#8220;equal participation by women citizens in all political, economic, social and religious 
activities&#8221;.

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>52. Article 55 of the Constitution asserts that &#8220;all citizens have the same rights, 
privileges, obligations and duties irrespective of race, tribe, place of origin, political 
opinion, colour, creed, religion or sex&#8221;, and allows for specific laws to benefit women, 
</p>
<p>children and &#8220;members of underprivileged or less advanced groups&#8221;. However, the 
Constitution does not explicitly define or prohibit discrimination, including on the grounds 
of sex, in accordance with article 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, acceded to by Papua New Guinea on 12 January 1995.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Equality and Participation Bill  
</b></p>
<p>53. As regards equal participation of women in public and political life, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed of the progress made with regard to the Equality and Participation 
Bill, which provides for the creation of 22 additional seats for women in Parliament. In 
November 2011, Parliament agreed to constitutional amendments creating the additional 
seats, but the enabling organic act on the reserved seats is yet to be approved by Parliament. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that 21 members of Parliament walked out during a 
reading of the organic act in November 2011, in protest against the initiative, and it was 
therefore very unlikely that this issue would be tabled and approved before the elections of 
</p><p>2012.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Domestic and sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>54. There is currently no specific legislation dealing with violence against women 
and/or domestic violence. The Criminal Code penalizes the offences of &#8220;common assault&#8221; 
</p>
<p>with a maximum of 6 months imprisonment and &#8220;aggravated assault&#8221; with a fine or up to 
</p>
<p>12 months in prison (CEDAW/C/PNG/3, p. 23). While the Criminal Code deals with all 
serious or &#8220;indictable offences&#8221;, which are tried in the National Court, other minor criminal 
offences are covered under the Summary Offences Act and are heard in the District Courts 
(ibid.). In 2009, the Magisterial Service introduced Interim Protection Orders (IPOs) with 
the aim of increasing protection of any persons at risk of assault. However, IPOs are only 
valid for two weeks, and women who use this remedy need to return to court to obtain 
another IPO to extend the period. 
</p>
<p>55. In 2011, a number of NGOs, led by Coalition for Change Papua New Guinea and in 
collaboration with the Family and Sexual Violence Action Committee and the CLRC, 
drafted a Family Protection Bill. The Bill has been submitted to the National Executive 
Council for its endorsement before review by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>56. The Bill was drafted with the objective of establishing the offence of domestic 
violence and setting up a regime for family protection orders. It is based on a number of 
underlying principles, including an acknowledgment that &#8220;violence in marriage&#8221; is not a 
private matter, but &#8220;a social problem of public concern&#8221;. The Bill defines domestic violence 
as acts perpetrated against a family member by which the perpetrator assaults, 
psychologically abuses, harasses or intimidates, sexually abuses, stalks, behaves in an 
indecent or offensive manner, damages or causes damage to property; or threatens to do any 
of these acts. The Bill also includes a definition of spouse which includes persons of 
opposite sex who are living or have lived together in a marriage-like relationship, as well as 
people who have a child together, whether or not they are or have been married or living 
together. 
</p>
<p>57. The draft establishes domestic violence as an offence with penalties including 
imprisonment of up to five years and/or a fine. The draft clearly states that the payment of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>any amount of money or other valuable in accordance to custom (compensation) is not a 
defence to any of the offences described in the Bill. 
</p>
<p>58. As regards family protection orders, in accordance with the draft, these could be 
requested by complainants themselves or someone on their behalf if complainants have 
given their oral or written consent. The court could also issue a protection order if it 
believes on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an act of domestic violence or 
is likely to commit one. A person who breached a family protection order would also be 
guilty of an offence and would face a term of imprisonment of up to seven years and/or a 
fine. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the current draft envisages placing 
restrictions, such as approaching certain locations, not only upon perpetrators but also upon 
victims. The Bill also envisages mandating victims to provide evidence, which may put 
them in untenable positions and could possibly lead women to simply deny any acts of 
domestic violence against them. Finally, the current draft allows for the court to order the 
payment of compensation in accordance with custom if, as a result of domestic violence, a 
person suffered personal injury, damage to property, and/or financial loss.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur identified other sources of concern in the current draft. It 
does not make any reference to economic violence, such as withholding food, retaining 
income from marketing and other activities, or preventing access to a person&#8223;s financial and 
</p>
<p>other assets. Other forms of domestic violence, such as emotional, verbal or psychological 
abuse; sexual harassment; or intimidation, are not recognized. The Bill does not provide for 
an expedited procedure that would allow victims to obtain a protection order without 
having to apply through the regular procedure before a judge. It also would allow for the 
court to direct both the defendant and the complainant to participate in counselling and/or 
mediation. This mandatory counselling and/or mediation may not be in the best interest of 
women.  
</p>
<p>61. As regards sexual violence, in 2003 the Criminal Code was amended to cover sexual 
offences and crimes against children.46 New offences were introduced into the Code and 
classified according to the seriousness of the harm, as well as harsher sentences introduced 
for perpetrators. Likewise, the Evidence Act was amended to assist victims of gender-based 
violence. Through these amendments, sexual offences against children were clearly defined 
and now include sexual touching and sexual exploitation, with increased penalties for those 
in a position of trust, such as parents, teachers or the police. The definition of incest was 
also expanded to cover more categories of relationships, such as the extended family.47 The 
Criminal Code established that incestuous sexual relations with a person under the age of 
16 cannot be consensual and therefore amount to incestuous rape as well as unlawful sexual 
penetration of a child, carrying a penalty of up to 25 years&#8223; imprisonment, or life 
imprisonment if the child is under 12 years old or is in a relationship of trust, authority and 
dependency with the offender (CEDAW/C/PNG/3, p. 28). 
</p>
<p>62. As regards rape, the definition was expanded to cover penetration of the mouth or 
anus and the use of objects, the requirement for medical corroboration was removed, and 
the victim&#8223;s previous sexual conduct was established as inadmissible as evidence. 
Furthermore, rape in marriage became illegal (ibid.). The maximum penalty for rape is now 
15 years in prison, or imprisonment for life if committed with aggravating circumstances 
(ibid.).

 47  Ibid.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>63. Court procedures were also improved in an attempt to protect survivors&#8223; safety and 
dignity. This includes court hearings in sexual offences cases being closed to the public, 
victims being allowed to have a support person while giving evidence, and the alleged 
perpetrator not being allowed to cross-examine the victim. Furthermore, medical evidence 
of rape is no longer obligatory, as it was recognized that most victims live in remote areas 
in which access to health services is restricted, and therefore necessary medical 
examinations may be delayed or not possible (ibid.). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Sorcery and sorcery-related killings 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Sorcery Act &#8211; the law on sorcery and sorcery-related killings &#8211; was enacted in 
1971 with the aim &#8220;to prevent and punish evil practices of sorcery and other similar evil 
</p>
<p>practices&#8221;. The Act acknowledges the existence of sorcery and criminalizes both those who 
practice it and those who attack people accused of sorcery. It has been argued, however, 
that the Sorcery Act focuses principally on the sorcerer as perpetrator and does not 
adequately address violence committed against alleged sorcerers. Sorcery-related killings 
are treated as homicides and dealt with through the Criminal Code. The Sorcery Act is 
reportedly rarely used, but some argue that its mere existence helps perpetuate the belief in 
sorcery as a means of harming or killing another person.   
</p>
<p>65. In February 2009, the CLRC was commissioned to carry out a nationwide 
consultation and review of the Sorcery Act, including an assessment of the offences and 
penalties it currently covers, and to publish recommendations on the subject.48 The current 
Act was found to have contradictions and inconsistencies, and is difficult to enforce. For 
example, it refers to the difference between &#8220;innocent&#8221; and &#8220;forbidden&#8221; sorcery, but does 
not clearly specify what they constitute. The CLRC highlighted the extreme difficulty of 
interpretation, given the diversity of cultures and understandings of sorcery in the country. 
It also reflected on the technical difficulties of identifying, in a court procedure, the 
consequences of sorcery and, most importantly, on linking an alleged conduct of sorcery to 
a given consequence, as it is practically impossible to provide evidence that would prove 
the use of sorcery.  
</p>
<p>66. The CLRC therefore proposed that the Sorcery Act be repealed entirely and that 
accusations of use of sorcery be dealt with by religious and spiritual leaders, but not by the 
law. Furthermore, any case of assault or murder should be treated as such by courts, 
regardless of any sorcery accusations made against the victims. The CLRC also concluded 
that village courts needed to be strengthened to adequately deal with sorcery-related 
violence.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Institutional developments  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur was informed of a number of policy and institutional 
initiatives related to the promotion and protection of human rights. In 2011, a national 
human rights forum was established under the leadership of the Secretary of Justice and 
comprises a number of government departments and national institutions, together with 
civil society organizations, United Nations agencies and donors. The Forum has been a 
crucial player in pushing for the establishment of a national human rights commission in 
</p>
<p>  
 48  See CLRC, &#8220;Review&#8221;.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>the country. The bill for the Organic Law on the Human Rights Commission is currently 
with the Cabinet, and is expected to be approved by Parliament.  
</p>
<p>68. Another initiative was the establishment of a &#8220;human rights track&#8221; within the 
Supreme Court and the National Court to help identify and give special consideration to the 
human rights cases that were already being received and heard by courts. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the Courts&#8223; registry reviewed and identified cases that should 
be channelled through the human rights track, and that training was provided to courts at 
the provincial level, to encourage them to identify relevant cases and send them to the 
National Court. The mechanism has been in place since July 2011 but awareness still needs 
to be raised among the public to encourage its use. To date, most of these cases refer to 
violations of basic constitutional rights, and 95 per cent of them involved police brutality 
and thefts during raids and evictions. There have also been some cases referring to 
conditions of detention. However, none of the cases involves the human rights of women.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy for women and gender equality   
</b></p>
<p>69. As regards women-specific policy initiatives, the 2011-2015 National Policy for 
Women and Gender Equality was launched following a review process of the first National 
Women&#8223;s Policy of 1991. The first policy introduced a gender mainstreaming approach. 
However the review revealed that most line departments responsible for including women&#8223;s 
projects within their particular policy mandates did not take the policy seriously. The policy 
was successful in establishing the Office for Development of Women (ODW) within the 
Department for Community Development. Unfortunately, implementation of the first policy 
was hampered by a reduction in State resources and the constant reorganization and 
restructuring of the country&#8223;s bureaucratic structure, as well as staff confusion and 
</p>
<p>demotivation.49 
</p>
<p>70. As a result of the review process, the 2011-2015 Policy was launched based on a 
&#8220;gender and development&#8221; approach, which is aimed at ensuring equal opportunities, 
treatment and entitlements for men and women, and considers how inequalities related to 
the household, custom, religion and culture result in unequal distribution of power, control 
over resources and decision-making power. The implementation of this policy is led by the 
ODW. 
</p>
<p>71. The policy&#8223;s objectives as regards gender-based violence are to: (a) decrease gender-
based violence, (b) build the capacity of the police to deal with drug and alcohol abuses and 
increase penalties, and (c) reduce and eliminate the gender impact of community crime 
rates. To achieve these goals, the policy establishes a number of strategies that include: 
raising awareness, providing victims with just and effective legal remedies and shelters, 
supporting women&#8223;s organizations and NGOs, building the capacity of village court 
magistrates, enacting and enforcing laws on gender-based violence, and increasing 
penalties for perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>72. The policy proposes strong partnerships between the ODW, the police and other 
relevant agencies to establish an integrated database on violence against women and 
children, as well as a database on counselling support options. The policy also recognizes 
that deeper issues regarding masculinity, identity and socialization among young people 
underpin gender-based violence. It therefore proposes innovative and wide-ranging 
community education initiatives to raise awareness about the root causes of violence

<p>against women, and addresses it not only as a crime, but also as a human rights issue. The 
policy will be reviewed in 2015 to inform the development of a new policy. Monitoring 
activities include quarterly meetings of the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee, as well as 
the biannual national conventions of the National Council of Women50. 
</p>
<p>73. The ODW is also in charge of the national strategy for the implementation of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, created to 
promote the implementation of the recommendations made by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The ODW aims to pave the way for other 
governmental agencies, such as the health, education, labour and other departments, to 
work towards the implementation of the recommendations. The first two programmes to be 
encouraged are the establishment of the 22 reserved seats for women in Parliament, and the 
conducting of research on sorcery, torture and sorcery-related killings. However, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that this last endeavour had been stalled due to lack of 
resources.  
</p>
<p>74. Among the programmes run by the ODW is a project on gender-based violence in 
the provinces of Simbu and East New Britain, which provides paralegal and life skills 
training programmes for women and service providers in the provinces. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the project had been replicated in West New Britain Province 
and was intended to reach six other provinces. Provincial authorities in the Highlands 
region referred positively to the training and awareness-raising activities provided by the 
Department of Community Development to challenge traditional beliefs in sorcery and 
other violent practices against women. Together with NGOs in the region, the Department 
has also provided training to police officers at provincial police stations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Civil society initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>75. In the Highlands region, the Women&#8223;s Human Rights Defender Network was 
recently established with the aim of bringing together NGOs and church organizations 
working on women&#8223;s human rights broadly, and more specifically violence against women. 
The network includes organizations from seven provinces in the region, which are 
coordinated by seven respective human rights committees. The network is led by two 
courageous women human rights defenders who have made great personal sacrifices to 
undertake the network&#8223;s activities on a voluntary basis. It operates with few resources and 
little institutional support, and members are often at risk of violence and harassment due to 
their work. The network provides advice and counselling for women victims of violence, 
refers survivors to the police and to other service providers, and accompanies women 
during judicial processes. It has also undertaken awareness-raising and advocacy work, 
liaising with relevant stakeholders, such as Government officials, donors and international 
agencies in Port Moresby and outside the country. Most of the cases that have been 
addressed by the network involve domestic violence, sorcery-related violence, violence 
related to tribal fighting, and displacement.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Access to services and remedies for women victims of violence 
</b></p>
<p>76. There are currently no government-run shelters for women victims of violence. The 
Special Rapporteur visited a women&#8223;s shelter in Port Moresby which is run by a church 
organization, as well as another NGO-run shelter that was temporarily inoperative due to 
lack of funding. It was clear throughout the mission that the limited support and other

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>relevant services that exist for women victims of violence were being provided largely by 
the civil society sector, with the assistance of development partners. There are no such 
services outside the capital. 
</p>
<p>77. The Department of Health has established Family Support Centres (FSCs) in some 
hospitals which provide both counselling and short-term shelter services. The Special 
Rapporteur visited the FSC at Port Moresby General Hospital and also met with service 
providers of the FSCs in Goroka and Kundiawa. 
</p>
<p>78. Hospital emergency and gynaecological services are usually the first point of entry 
for women survivors of violence. FSCs also receive women who walk in, as well as 
referrals from the police. The FSC in Port Moresby does not have any medical staff, but 
collaborates with the hospital. There is reportedly a high turnover of staff in the hospital, 
which requires ongoing training on gender-based violence, to ensure cases are not simply 
dismissed after medical treatment. The FSC helps women request an IPO and report to the 
police, using the medical reports provided by the hospital. It then refers victims to the 
shelter. However, the FSC has had to accommodate women for longer periods if the shelter 
is full or if it does not manage to get an IPO for the victim.  
</p>
<p>79. Staff reported that they often suffer harassment and intimidation by alleged 
perpetrators. Staff reported high levels of corruption, with police officers receiving bribes 
from perpetrators, or protecting known perpetrators. Therefore, women remain at risk after 
leaving the FSC, even if they have relatives or friends who provide them with 
accommodation. Women are often also pressured to drop charges, or judges and/or 
prosecutors are bribed to drop cases. When women return to the FSC after suffering a 
subsequent attack, the severity of their injuries is usually greater.   
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur addressed the issue of policing with staff of the Royal Papua 
New Guinea Constabulary, including the Family and Sexual Violence Units. The Units 
were initially set up in three police stations in the National Capital District in 2008, and 
were extended to other provinces in 2010 and 2012. Currently the Units have 16 staff in 
offices throughout the country. However, as awareness and the number of complaints 
regarding family and sexual violence increase, the Units are less able to attend to these 
cases. The Units are yet to be formalized and permanently integrated into the structure and 
budget of the Constabulary, including with adequate human and financial resources. The 
main challenges experienced by Family and Sexual Violence Units include the lack of basic 
training for police officers; the lack of basic material resources, including vehicles and 
petrol; understaffing; lack of institutional support; and violence and threats against police 
officers by perpetrators of violence against women.   
</p>
<p>81. Most interviewed victims felt that the policing sector had not provided them with 
adequate responses to their cases. The Special Rapporteur also heard numerous accounts of 
police officers ignoring complaints, dismissing women from the police stations, 
encouraging women to drop charges, not enforcing IPOs, or receiving bribes from 
perpetrators to ignore a case.  
</p>
<p>82. As regards the prosecutions of cases of violence against women, the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor also faces staffing and resource constraints. In 2012 the Office 
established a Family and Sexual Offence Unit in Port Moresby where a specialized group 
of prosecution and support staff will jointly respond to complaints. The Unit is reportedly 
planning to expand its services throughout the provinces in 2013.  
</p>
<p>83. While still in the early stages of establishment, the Family and Sexual Offence Unit 
currently carries around 40 to 50 per cent of the prosecution files. It also conducts 
awareness-raising and training activities. For example, the Unit has developed a medical 
pro forma to be used by medical practitioners in cases of violence against women, provided </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>training to the Highlands Women&#8223;s Human Rights Defenders Network, and participated in 
law reform activities related to violence against women.  
</p>
<p>84. The lack of access to justice for women and girls is reflected in the lack of 
substantive and consistent service by all components of the criminal justice system. 
Unfortunately, despite the abovementioned efforts at specialization, which exist mainly in 
the capital city, cases of violence against women rarely reach the district courts or the 
National Court. Such cases are mainly being resolved through mediation processes and 
compensation payments at the village court level. This is also the case for offences such as 
grievous bodily harm, rape or incest &#8211; crimes that are not within the jurisdiction of the 
village court, but are still heard by such courts, given the inaccessibility of the National 
Court. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Government has undertaken a number of legal and institutional initiatives 
to meet its human rights obligations and address the situation of women and girls in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the country. However, these have not translated into concrete improvements in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>lives of the majority of women who remain marginalized, discriminated against and at 
</b></p>
<p><b>high risk of being subjected to violence.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Most of the programmes and initiatives that have been launched by the 
Government in Port Moresby, with the technical and financial support of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development partners and donor agencies, have not reached the majority of the 
</b></p>
<p>population who live outside the capital. In these regions, women&#8217;s access to justice and 
</p>
<p><b>protection is still impeded by generalized impunity, limited access to services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>shelters, lack of or insufficient legal representation and limited awareness of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. Other factors include economic dependency and societal reluctance to 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognize numerous forms of violence against women as crimes and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations that require serious attention.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The clear disconnect between the capital and the regions is worrying, as new 
</b>social forces and economic interests, driven by the development of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>extractive industries, reach new and more isolated communities, in which rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>women and girls face greater risks of experiencing exploitation, violence and abuse.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
following recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Law and policy reforms 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Make the necessary constitutional amendments to explicitly define and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prohibit discrimination, including on the grounds of sex, in accordance with article 1 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Enact the Organic Law on the Human Rights Commission, to expedite 
</b></p>
<p><b>the launch of the national human rights institution. This mechanism must be 
</b></p>
<p>mandated to include a specific focus on women&#8217;s human rights, in ord<b>er to address 
</b></p>
<p><b>the structural and systemic inequalities and discrimination that women face; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Resolve, as a matter of priority, any ambiguity between the Equality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Participation Bill and its enabling organic act, to ensure the equal participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women candidates in the next parliamentary elections; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt other affirmative action measures to increase the participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women in public life, including by appointing women to the judiciary and as senior 
</b></p>
<p><b>level officials in the executive and judicial branches at the national and local levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Provide for temporary special measures, including quotas and 
</b></p>
<p>preferential treatment, to advance women&#8217;s integration into education and the 
</p>
<p><b>economy, and provide incentives to increase the employment of women within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>private sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Strengthen the capacity of the Office for Development of Women within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Department for Community Development, by allocating more human and 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial recourses and providing the necessary support for the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>2011-2015 National Policy for Women and Gender Equality.    
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Make the necessary amendments to the current Family Protection Bill to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Acts of economic violence are included, such as withholding food, 
</b></p>
<p><b>retaining income from marketing and </b>other activities, or preventing women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>access to their financial and other assets; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Emergency or expedited protection orders are easily obtainable by 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Protection orders do not impose any restrictions on victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Women victims are not compelled to provide testimony or evidence, or to 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in counselling and/or mediation without their consent;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Enact the Family Protection Bill as a matter of priority;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  Include within national legislation the explicit prohibition and 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalization of sexual harassment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Entirely repeal the Sorcery Act of 1971, as recommended by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitutional and Law Reform Commission, and ensure that all cases of assault or 
</b></p>
<p><b>murder based on sorcery accusations are treated swiftly and effectively by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>National Court;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Adopt international standards and norms for the protection of women 
</b></p>
<p><b>prisoners and detainees and incorporate these into the national legislation. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should ensure that women in prison receive adequate food and services, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including physical and mental health care. Vocational training and income- 
</b></p>
<p><b>generating activities should be offered to incarcerated women. Furthermore, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government should guarantee the adequate care of children of incarcerated mothers. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Alternatives to incarceration should be considered, particularly for women detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b>who are primary caregivers of their children. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Formalize and permanently integrate the Family and Sexual Violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>Units into the structure and budget of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including with adequate human and financial resources; and ensure their presence in 
</b></p>
<p><b>police stations in all provinces;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) Strengthen the Family and Sexual Offence Unit within the Office of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Public Prosecutor by allocating adequate staff and resources and supporting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishment of such units in provincial branches of the Office. Launch pilot 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes in courts, together with the Family and Sexual Offence Units, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequately prosecute and punish perpetrators of violence against women; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/49/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) Demonstrate commitment and political will to regulate the operation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies in remote provinces, including the fishing, logging and mining industries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by establishing adequate monitoring and inspection mechanisms, and investigating 
</b></p>
<p><b>any allegations of violence against women committed by company employees. Regular 
</b></p>
<p><b>inspections of nightclubs and bars should also be undertaken, to ensure women are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not being sexually exploited in these businesses. These efforts should reflect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards as per the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31, annex); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(o) Review and make the necessary amendments to the human rights track 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the Supreme and National Courts, to ensure that cases of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women are given priority and are resolved swiftly by the courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(p) Take measures to strengthen the provision of legal aid to women who 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been subjected to violence, including women who have been charged with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>murder of their abusers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(q) In cooperation with w</b>omen&#8217;s organi<b>zations and development partners, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and as a matter of urgency, develop a project for the establishment of a government-
</b></p>
<p><b>run shelter for women victims of violence in the Highlands region;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(r) Establish a coordinated and integrated referral system to include all 
</b></p>
<p><b>sectors, such as the health, police, legal, social welfare and education sectors, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>view to address the protection needs of women and girls who have been subjected to 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence. Develop, to this end, the necessary regulations, protocols and instructions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide clear guidance to service providers;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(s) Put in place emergency procedures to rescue and resettle women who 
</b></p>
<p><b>are at risk of suffering sorcery-related violence in their communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(t) Establish and enforce sanctions against entities that charge women 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of violence for health services or medical reports; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(u) Cooperate closely with and provide support for non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations, particularly those operating in remote regions, to ensure their full 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in all efforts aimed at eliminating violence against women. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Statistics and data collection 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Establish a standardized system for the collection and analysis of data, 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregated by sex, race, age, ethnicity and other relevant characteristics, in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to understand the magnitude, trends and patterns of violence against women in the

</p>
<p><b> C. Societal change and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Design and launch targeted awareness-raising campaigns to educate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>change societal attitudes, particularly those that place women in a lower social status

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Selected testimonies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic violence 
</b></p>
<p>1. X married a man who already had a wife and children at age 19. She took care of 
these children and also had one son and one daughter with him. Her husband&#8223;s job would 
take him out of the village for most of the year. During that time she would be left alone to 
take care of the children and support them, as he did not provide financially for them. Every 
time he came back home for vacation he would bring another woman with him. He would 
get drunk, humiliate and beat X. Even when the children were sick he would spend all their 
money and drink instead of providing for his family.  At first she did not say anything out 
of fear and continued taking care of the children. Her husband was abusive. He would hit 
her for refusing to have sex with him. She did report the abuse to the police once, but had 
no response. Whenever she sought support from her family, they sent her back as they had 
received the bride price, and could not afford to pay it back.  
</p>
<p>2. Y was married for 6 years. She has two girls, 1 and 5 years old. After meeting in 
Lae, Y and her husband married in 2005 and moved to her husband&#8223;s village in Kerowagi 
</p>
<p>District. Y&#8223;s husband used drugs and home-brew, he also grew and used marihuana. He was 
very controlling with Y, who was not allowed to go out or do any marketing. He would 
always set boundaries for her and her children. He did not provide economically so they 
had no decent clothes and barely enough food. He was also violent with her and the 
children. Most nights he would come back home drunk and rape her. He beat her many 
times with a bush knife, an iron rod, and an axe. He also used to beat up her two daughters. 
She reported the matter to the police twice but was unsuccessful. The Police said they 
would investigate but that there wasn&#8223;t anything else they could do. She finally decided to 
</p>
<p>escape with her two girls and moved back to her family with the support of an NGO.  
</p>
<p>3. Z, a victim of domestic violence and mother of 5 children, had her ear bitten off by 
the second wife of her husband. She did not take the case to the formal courts, as she did 
not have her husband&#8223;s support and she feared being beaten or thrown out of her home if 
</p>
<p>she pursued the case. The dispute was solved at the village level and Z received K500 
(approximately 200USD) and a pig in compensation for the loss of her ear.   
</p>
<p>4. W is in her late 20s. She lost her right hand when her former partner attacked her 
with a bush knife after accusing her of adultery. The incident was reported to the police but 
no action was taken, even though she visited the police station in several occasions. Her 
relatives claimed a compensation of K800 (approximately 280 USD) and 6 small pigs, for 
the loss of her hand. The perpetrator was never charged for the damage he caused. W still 
sees him in the community and this disturbs her greatly.  
</p>
<p>5. When V&#8223;s husband died, her eldest son announced he would now take over as head 
of the family. He kept the biggest and better portion of the coffee block for himself and left 
the rest of the land to V and her younger children. When V tried to confront her son about 
this decision, he became violent and beat V and her two younger daughters. V&#8223;s younger 
son also became angry with V and blamed her for allowing this to happen. V&#8223;s younger son 
once confronted his older brother about the situation and V intervened when they began to 
fight. As a result, V&#8223;s older son beat her severely, kicking her to the ground and punching 
</p>
<p>her, while accusing her of putting his younger siblings against him. As a result of her dire 
economic situation, V&#8223;s younger daughter has abandoned her studies and accepted to marry 
</p>
<p>a man who already has 2 other wives.  </p>

<p><b> B. Sorcery and tribal related violence 
</b></p>
<p>6. On the 14th of March 2012, A, a 50 year old woman from a village in the Simbu 
province was in her garden when a group of men from the same village arrived and 
attacked her, accusing her of having killed her recently deceased husband through sorcery. 
The men were armed with bush knives and axes with which they injured her head and legs. 
They then dragged and kicked her all the way from her house to a &#8222;hausman&#8223; (men&#8223;s house) 
</p>
<p>in the village where they tied a rope around her neck and body, stripped her naked, and 
raped her using a red-hot iron blade. Her fingers were also chopped off and 4 of her teeth 
broken. While in the hospital recuperating from her injuries, A&#8223;s two daughters were also 
</p>
<p>accused of sorcery and chased out of their village. The family was fearful of retaliation, and 
in need of a safe place to stay. &#8220;A&#8221; felt that returning to her original village was not a 
feasible option. Her only remaining family there are her aging parents, but no male kin to 
protect them from the perpetrators who live close by. She is therefore considering moving 
to Port Moresby and seeking refuge with her brother and his wife. 
</p>
<p>7. C is married and has three children aged 10, 7 and 1. In April 2009, a son from her 
husband&#8223;s first marriage had a fatal bicycle accident. Following this death, C was accused 
of killing him through sorcery and received beatings, verbal harassment and threats from 
her husband. On one occasion he used an iron rod to hit her. C&#8223;s husband also accused C of 
</p>
<p>being responsible for the death of his brother-in-law, who reportedly died during surgery, 
and his younger brother, who reportedly died later of malaria. On both occasions C&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>husband accused her of practicing sorcery leading to their deaths. C&#8223;s husband also publicly 
assaulted her, accusing her of sorcery, hitting her repeatedly and leaving her with injuries 
all over her body. C&#8223;s husband will not allow C back into her house and she is now 
</p>
<p>displaced with her three children.  
</p>
<p>8. B is 26 years old, married, and has a 4 year-old daughter. In 2009 a big tribal fight 
erupted after men from her clan killed a young man from a neighbouring clan during a New 
Year&#8223;s celebration. Gun shots were exchanged and everyone in her village fled in different 
</p>
<p>directions. She left all her possessions behind and the rival clan took what they could and
