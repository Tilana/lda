<p>Declaration of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 3 October 2013, 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Taking into account</i> the attention paid by the treaty bodies, including the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child, to the treatment of unaccompanied and separated children 
</p>
<p>outside their country of origin and their enjoyment of human rights, including in its general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 6 (2005), as well as the general discussion of the Committee in 2012 on the 
</p>
<p>rights of all children in the context of international migration, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing serious concern</i> about the situation of vulnerability and risk faced by 
</p>
<p>migrants in transit and destination, in particular children, including adolescents, who are 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied or separated from their families, who are forced to flee or decide to leave 
</p>
<p>their homelands owing to multiple causes, and calling upon States of origin, transit and 
</p>
<p>destination to work together to find effective and sustainable solutions within a framework 
</p>
<p>of solidarity and regional and international cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> by the fact that migrant children and adolescents who find themselves in 
</p>
<p>a vulnerable situation by attempting to cross international borders without the required 
</p>
<p>travel documents may be exposed to serious human rights violations and abuses that can 
</p>
<p>threaten their physical, emotional and psychological well-being, and may also be exposed 
</p>
<p>to crimes and human rights abuses committed by transnational criminal organizations or 
</p>
<p>gangs, including crimes such as theft, kidnapping, extortion, physical abuse, sale of persons 
</p>
<p>and trafficking in persons, including forced labour, and sexual abuse and exploitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> of the fact that, in the fulfilment of their obligations to promote, protect and 
</p>
<p>respect human rights, States of origin, transit and destination can benefit from schemes of 
</p>
<p>international cooperation, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Calls upon</i> countries of origin, transit and destination to facilitate family 
</p>
<p>reunification, as appropriate, as an important objective in order to promote the welfare and 
</p>
<p>the best interests of migrant children, including adolescents, as applicable under national 
</p>
<p>law, due process and the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
</p>
<p>and the Optional Protocols thereto, and to comply with the consular notification and access 
</p>
<p>obligations set forth in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations so that States may 
</p>
<p>provide child-friendly consular assistance, as appropriate, including legal assistance; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Encourages</i> States to continue to take into account the principle of the best 
</p>
<p>interests of the child as a primary consideration, and to promote, protect and respect their 
</p>
<p>human rights, bearing in mind their needs in the process of return to their countries of 
</p>
<p>origin; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Encourages</i> States of origin, transit and destination to continue to seek 
</p>
<p>greater cooperation and technical assistance with all relevant stakeholders in different areas 
</p>
<p>in order to identify jointly alternatives to reduce, mitigate and eliminate the causes and 
</p>
<p>structural factors that lead to irregular migration so as to prevent minors from feeling 
</p>
<p>compelled to migrate from their communities, while taking into account the need to 
</p>
<p>promote capacity-building activities;  
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Advisory Committee to develop a research-based study on the 
</p>
<p>global issue of unaccompanied migrant children and adolescents and human rights, in 
</p>
<p>which it identifies areas, reasons and cases where this issue arises in the world, and the 
</p>
<p>ways in which human rights are threatened and violated, and makes recommendations for 
</p>
<p>the protection of the human rights of members of this population, and to submit it to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council at its thirty-third session for its consideration; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to ensure that their immigration policies are consistent 
</p>
<p>with their obligations under international human rights law, and to promote the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of human rights by all migrants without discrimination, including by taking steps to 
</p>
<p>increase cooperation and coordination at all levels to detect and suppress the smuggling of 
</p>
<p>migrants and trafficking in persons, in accordance with international law; </p>


<p>6. <i>Requests</i> the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, within their 
</p>
<p>mandates, to continue to give due consideration to the situation of unaccompanied migrant 
</p>
<p>children, including adolescents, and the impact of this issue on the full enjoyment of their 
</p>
<p>human rights, and to continue to report thereon; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter. 
</p>
<p><i>43rd meeting 
</i></p>
<p><i>2 July 2015

<p>[Adopted without a vote.]
