<p>Summary 
 
In its decision 1/107 of 30 June, 2006, the Human Rights Council expressed &#8220;concern over 
</p>
<p>the increasing trend of defamation of religions, incitement to racial and religious hatred and its 
recent manifestations,&#8221; and  requested the &#8220;Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
related intolerance as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to 
the next session on this phenomenon, in particular its implications for article 20, paragraph 2, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&#8221;. This report summarizes the preliminary 
outcome of research conducted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
subject. The report focuses on the international human rights dimension and reviews the status of 
the law and the scope of, as well as limits on, action to regulate the defamation of religions and 
incitement to racial and religious hatred.  
</p>
<p> 
The preliminary conclusion of the report is that more effort is needed, possibly within the 
</p>
<p>international human rights machinery, more specifically to define the parameters of the law in this 
area in order to facilitate more coherent and effective implementation at the national level in a 
manner that can promote tolerance, while enhancing safeguards for the freedom of expression and 
other fundamental freedoms.

 <p> 
<b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 1/107 of 30 June, 
2006, which expressed &#8220;concern over the increasing trend of defamation of religions, incitement 
to racial and religious hatred and its recent manifestations&#8221;, and  requested the &#8220;Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance as well as the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the next session on this phenomenon, in 
particular its implications for article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>2. The report presents initial findings, conclusions and recommendations from very 
preliminary research conducted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In 
the short time available between the decision of the Human Rights Council in June and this 
session, OHCHR has only been able to undertake a preliminary review of the status of 
international law and regional and national jurisprudence and practice which is presented here. 
As proposed below, substantial additional work is needed to flesh out in more detail the full 
scope of the current state of the law and practice on this complex issue, and to explore the range 
of available policy options to deal with the global challenge of fostering tolerance and 
understanding globally.  
</p>
<p>3. While international human rights law, as well regional and national jurisprudence and 
practice, permits States to curb speech and other forms of manifestations that have the potential 
to foster racial and religious hatred and violence, there is no consensus on critical elements of the 
law and practice varies considerably.  Global experience, from the Nazi atrocities to the genocide 
in Rwanda and more recent episodes, demonstrates how speech and the media in general can be 
abused to promote hatred, discord and even violence. It is precisely for this reason that many of 
the international human rights instruments and mechanisms have focused attention on the issue. 
</p>
<p>4. Curbing speech that incites hatred and violence generally involves restrictions and 
curtailment on the freedom of speech and other human rights and freedoms that are at the core of 
the international human rights framework. The challenge has, therefore, been how to deal with 
the nefarious effect of hate speech without jeopardizing freedom of speech, the free exchange of 
ideas and thought, and other freedoms that form the very foundation of human rights. For this 
reason, international law and most regional and national jurisprudence generally regard any 
action to limit or sanction speech as an exceptional measure to be applied in strictly defined 
circumstances on the basis of clearly identified criteria.   
</p>
<p>5. Consensus has not fully emerged on the precise boundary and parameters of this 
exception.  Among the key issues, there is a great deal of uncertainty about: (a) the notion of 
incitement itself and how to assess its applicability in practical situations; (b) the precise 
circumstances under which incitement may be prohibited; and (c) the scope of permissible 
sanctions and remedies that may be employed.  There is also particular concern about impact of 
the potential prohibition of hate speech on freedom of expression.  While freedom of speech is 
certainly not absolute, international law as well as most regional and national jurisprudence, 
requires a careful balancing of any limitations on speech or other forms of expression.  Clarity on 
the objectives of the law and its contours is essential in attaining this balance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. The extent to which article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR) can be used as the basis for actions to counter hate speech and 
intolerance needs further investigation. There is also need for a policy dialogue to balance the 
various competing demands, and for guidance in order to agree on a coherent response that can 
guide States in fulfilling their obligations to curtail incitement of hatred and violence, while at 
the same time ensuring the integrity of the international human rights system.  
</p>
<p>7. The report starts with a brief statement on the state of racial and religious intolerance, 
noting the need to undertake a more comprehensive study to document the extent of the problem 
as the basis for an effective international legal and policy response. The second part of the report 
reviews the state of the law and practice on incitement to racial and religious hatred, and how it 
is interpreted and applied by relevant monitoring mechanisms. The third part of the report 
discusses in more detail the main legal and policy issues that arise from the analysis of the 
jurisprudence with respect to the implementation of the law. In the fourth part, the report 
identifies some of the challenges of interpreting and implementing the law. The report then 
discusses possible alternative responses to the phenomenon of racial and religious hatred and 
intolerance, with an emphasis on how to promote tolerance. The final part of the report draws 
some preliminary conclusions from the review of the law and proposes steps for the 
consideration of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>I. DEFAMATION OF RELIGIONS AND INCITEMENT  
</b></p>
<p><b>TO RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS HATRED 
</b></p>
<p>8. It has not been possible for OHCHR, in the short time available to produce this report, to 
undertake the kind of extensive exercise that is necessary to document the extent to which there 
may be an increase in incidences of defamation of religions and incitement to racial and religious 
hatred and how these incidences are manifested.  
</p>
<p>9. However, several highly publicized episodes over the last few years have highlighted the 
need to focus attention on measures to foster tolerance and understanding, and to reinforce global 
efforts to promote and protect all the human rights of all people. These include incidences of 
vandalism directed against places of worship, including mosques, churches and synagogues, 
reported cases of attacks on individuals because of their religious beliefs, and restrictions and 
other punitive measures that are applied on the basis of race and religion. At a time of 
particularly high sensitivities, these have led to social tensions and discord. 
</p>
<p>10. In response, many Governments have initiated measures to strengthen legal protection for 
victims of the abuses that stem from such episodes. Some have introduced new legislation to 
sanction these actions, while others have reinforced existing law and introduced new punitive 
measures. At the international level, as well, concern has been raised about some of these 
developments &#8211; including those by special rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights and 
now the Human Rights Council.  The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief, and the Special Rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, have expressed their concern about intolerance and the 
absence of respect for other religions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. As part of any initiative to review the status of the law in this area, it will be important to 
undertake a comprehensive review of trends and patterns to establish if indeed there is an 
increase in incidences of religious defamation and incitement to racial and religious hatred, 
where and how it is manifested, to what specific causes it might be attributed, and the magnitude 
of the individual and social harm that it might cause. The information from this exercise would 
help to inform the review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the existing law, as well as the 
focus of any future policy dialogue.   
</p>
<p><b>II. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>12. This part of the report reviews the status of the law on incitement, beginning with 
relevant provisions in international human rights instruments and their interpretation by the 
respective mechanisms.   
</p>
<p><b>A.  Status of the law in international instruments 
</b></p>
<p>13. Many international and regional human rights instruments and institutions deal with 
various aspects of incitement and advocacy of racial and religious hatred and intolerance. These 
include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the Convention against Genocide, 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), 
and ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>14. The rationale for prohibiting hate speech is partly grounded in the goal of promoting 
substantive equality among human beings, including freedom from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>15. In that regard, several provisions of the Universal Declaration have been interpreted to 
permit State action to prohibit hate speech or speech that is considered inflammatory or to incite 
hatred although the UDHR does not expressly address incitement and advocacy. Thus, the legal 
authority to proscribe hate speech has been inferred from article 1 of the UDHR, which provides 
that &#8220;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&#8221;, article 2, which provides 
for equal enjoyment of the rights and freedoms proclaimed in the UDHR &#8220;without distinction of 
any kind, such as race, colour, (and) sex&#8221; and article 7,  which more explicitly provides for 
protection against discrimination and incitement to discrimination.  
</p>
<p>16. Article 29 of the Universal Declaration, on the other hand, refers to the duties that 
everyone holds to the community, and recognizes that certain limitations on rights may be 
necessary and legitimate to secure, among other things, &#8220;due recognition and respect for the 
rights and freedoms of others.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>17. The Genocide Convention of 19481 goes further and in Article 3 (c) explicitly includes 
&#8220;public incitement to commit genocide&#8221; among punishable acts.  
</p>
<p>18. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination2 
is the first and the most far reaching international treaty to deal directly with the issue of hate 
speech. Article 4 of ICERD provides that: 
</p>
<p>States Parties . . . . . undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures 
designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to 
this end, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of 
this Convention, inter alia:  
</p>
<p>(a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas 
based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as 
well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group 
of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any 
assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;  
</p>
<p>19. The ICCPR, 3 on the other hand, uses more restrictive language. Article 20, paragraph 2, 
of the ICCPR provides that: &#8220;Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. The Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY 
Statute),4 as well as the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR 
Statute), 5 repeat articles 2 and 3 of the Genocide Convention verbatim.6 The Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court (ICC Statute)7 replicates article 3(c) of the Genocide Convention 
and provides for liability for anyone who, &#8220;directly and publicly incites others to commit the 
crime&#8221; of genocide.8  
</p>
<p>21. Hate speech is restricted because of its intrinsic ability to hurt and its perceived influence 
to incite hatred and even violence. For example, the travaux pr&#233;paratoires history of the 
Genocide Convention highlight that the perpetration of genocide could, &#8220;in all cases be traced 
back to the arousing of racial, national or religious hatred&#8221;,9 and this was part of the rationale for 
including incitement to genocide among the punishable acts of genocide. Likewise, in 2005, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) adopted a Declaration on the 
Prevention of Genocide10 and a Decision on follow-up to the declaration on the prevention of 
genocide: indicators of patterns of systematic and massive racial discrimination<i>,</i>11 both of which 
draw a link between hate speech and incitement to genocide and identify as indicators of 
genocide the systematic and widespread use and acceptance of speech or propaganda promoting 
hatred and/or inciting violence against minority groups, particularly in the media, and statements 
by political leaders/prominent people that express support for affirmation of superiority of a race 
or an ethnic group, dehumanize and demonize minorities, or condone or justify violence against 
a minority as indicators of genocide.  
</p>
<p>22. Despite their uniform acceptance of the idea of limitation, the international instruments 
discussed above vary in scope and in their interpretation of key elements of the law. ICERD as 
discussed earlier is the most far-reaching and seems to allow for a wide range of responses to 
incitement and advocacy which it also defines fairly liberally. Other instruments take the more 
cautious and narrow approach of ICCPR. Furthermore, interpretation of ICCPR suggests that 
there may be a &#8220;tension&#8221; between several of its provisions, in particular between article 20 , 
paragraph 2, and the rights to freedom of religion and belief and the right to freedom of 
expression, guaranteed by articles 18 and 19, respectively. 
</p>
<p><b>B. The jurisprudence of treaty bodies and other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>23. The relevant international human rights mechanisms, including the Human Rights 
Committee, CERD, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, the Special 
Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>intolerance, and the independent expert on minorities have dealt with different aspects of issues 
involving allegations of blasphemy or advocacy of racial and religious hatred.  In this section, 
the report highlights some of the main observations and conclusions. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The Human Rights Committee  
</b></p>
<p>24. The Human Rights Committee has addressed the issue of incitement to racial and 
religious hatred during the examination of several recent reports, and in a number of recent 
concluding observations has noted it as a major concern. Notable recent examples include:   
</p>
<p>(a) In connection with a report of <b>Italy</b>,12 the Human Rights Committee expressed 
concern about &#8220;reported instances of hate speech, including statements attributed to certain 
politicians, targeting foreign nationals, Arabs and Muslims, as well as the Roma&#8221;. The 
Committee accordingly requested Italy to &#8220;recall regularly and publicly that hate speech is 
prohibited under law and take prompt action to bring those responsible to justice&#8221;. The 
Committee recommended that the State Party provide it with statistical data concerning 
complaints, prosecutions and judicial decisions on the issue in order to monitor the situation; 
</p>
<p>(b) Concerning <b>Switzerland</b>,13 the Human Rights Committee expressed concern about 
the increasing &#8220;incidents of racial intolerance.&#8221; It called upon Switzerland to &#8220;ensure rigorous 
enforcement of its laws against racial incitement and discrimination&#8221;. The Committee also 
suggested that the State Party strengthen the mandate of its Federal Commission against Racism 
so as to allow it to initiate legal action; 
</p>
<p>(c) With respect to a report of <b>Germany</b>,14 the Human Rights Committee addressed the 
relationship between anti-terrorism policies and human rights, and expressed concern about the 
consequences of anti-terrorism measures on persons of foreign extraction, &#8220;because of an 
atmosphere of latent suspicion against them&#8221;. The Committee accordingly recommended that 
the German authorities &#8220;undertake an educational campaign through the media to protect 
persons of foreign extraction, in particular Arabs and Muslims, from stereotypes associating 
them with terrorism, extremism and fanaticism&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>(d) In connection with the report of <b>Egypt</b>,15 the Committee expressed concern about the 
publication in the Egyptian press of &#8220;some very violent articles against Jews&#8221;, which it deemed 
to constitute &#8220;advocacy of racial and religious hatred and incitement to discrimination, hostility 
and violence&#8221;. The Committee requested the State Party to &#8220;take whatever action to punish such 
acts&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>25. The jurisprudence of the Human Rights Committee has also addressed the issue of 
incitement in connection with several individual complaints submitted under the first Optional 
Protocol to the ICCPR, including <i>Faurisson v. France</i> (Communication No. 550/1993, 8 
November 1996). This case involved prosecution under France&#8217;s 1990 Gayssot Act which made 
it a crime to contest the existence of certain crimes against humanity under which Nazi leaders 
were convicted by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946, and <i>Ross v. Canada 
</i>(Communication No. 736/1997, 18 October 2000) which alleged a denial of the right to express 
religious views provided for in article 19 of ICCPR. In both cases, the Human Rights Committee 
endorsed limitations on the exercise of free speech on the grounds that the restrictions were 
consistent with the ICCPR.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>26. The issue of incitement to racial and religions hatred has also been addressed by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD).<b> </b>Although incitement to 
religious hatred may <i>prima facie </i>appear to fall outside the mandate of the Committee, CERD has 
affirmed that cases of &#8220;intersectoriality of ethnic and religious discrimination&#8221; are of relevance to 
it.16 The following examples illustrate how the Committee has addressed the issue of incitement 
to racial and religions hatred.  
</p>
<p>(a) Regarding the <b>Islamic Republic of Iran</b>,17 CERD expressed concern over the 
uncertainty of actual enforcement of domestic law criminalizing incitement to racial 
discrimination. As a result, the Committee has expressed its wish to receive &#8220;information on the 
effective implementation of legislation concerning the eradication of all incitement to, or acts of, 
racial discrimination&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>(b) With respect to <b>Nigeria</b>,18 CERD noted with concern that feelings of hostility 
amongst and between some ethnic and religious groups are prevalent in the country. It expressed 
further concern about &#8220;the absence of an explicit penal provision in the State party&#8217;s legislation 
prohibiting organizations and propaganda activities that advocate racial hatred&#8221;.19 The 
Committee recommended that the State party &#8220;endeavour, by encouraging genuine dialogue, to 
improve relations between different ethnic and religious communities with the view to 
promoting tolerance and overcoming prejudices and negative stereotypes&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>(c) In relation to <b>Guatemala</b>,20 CERD deplored the lack of domestic legislation on racial 
discrimination and incitement to such acts and called upon the State Party to &#8220;adopt specific 
legislation classifying as a punishable act any dissemination of ideas based on notions of 
superiority or racial hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, and violent acts directed against 
indigenous peoples and persons of African descent&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>(d) In relation to <b>Sweden</b>,21 CERD welcomed amendments to Fundamental Law of 
Freedom of Expression, which aim at facilitating &#8220;the bringing of legal action in cases of racial 
agitation&#8221;;     
</p>
<p>(e) CERD also noted with satisfaction that &#8220;serious acts of racial hatred or incitement to 
racial hatred are criminal offences in most of <b>Australian</b> States and Territories&#8221;,22 and that 
<b>Slovakia</b> had adopted an &#8220;Action Plan for the Prevention of All Forms of Discrimination, 
Racism, Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism and Other Expressions of Intolerance for the Periods 2002-
2003 and 2004-2005&#8221;.23 
</p>
<p>27. International tribunals, including the 1946 Nuremberg Military Tribunal, the International 
Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have 
also passed judgment on key aspects relating to the issue.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Regional jurisprudence  
</b></p>
<p>28. The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),24 the American Convention on 
Human Rights (ACHR)25 and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (ACHPR)26 
have all been interpreted to permit State action to prohibit hate speech and the advocacy of 
hatred on the basis of religion and race. All three include provisions relating to equality and non-</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>discrimination and also guarantee the right to freedom of expression. But they also vary in 
significant ways in the way they deal with the issues and in striking the balance between the 
prohibition of hate speech and the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>29. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (ECHR)<b>27</b> does not have a specific provision prohibiting incitement to racial and 
religious hatred. But general limitation clauses in article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and 
religion), article 10 (freedom of expression) and article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) 
allow for limitations of these rights in the interest of preservation of social and public order, 
protection of health and morals as well as rights of others.  
</p>
<p>30. The European Court of Human Rights has read these limitation clauses to permit the 
prohibition of incitement to racial and/or religious hatred. For example, article 17 of ECHR 
stipulates that the provisions of the Convention may not be interpreted as granting the right to 
engage in any activity aimed at the destruction of any of the rights it proclaims, or at limiting 
them further than is provided for in the Convention. This has been relied upon by the European 
Court of Human Rights as justifying hate speech laws but not as necessarily requiring them. 28 
</p>
<p>31. The <b>African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights29</b> (ACHPR), similarly, has no 
express reference to racial and religious hatred. Nevertheless, several provisions of ACHPR that 
provide for limitations on people&#8217;s right to receive and disseminate information, as well its 
recognition of duties as well as rights, which include requirements that rights should be exercised 
with due regard for the rights of others (art. 27), and to respect others and to maintain relations 
aimed at promoting respect and tolerance (art. 28), could be relied upon to justify hate-speech 
laws.  
</p>
<p>32. Only the <b>American Convention on Human Rights30</b> (ACHR) specifically provides for 
the banning of hate speech in its article 13(5), which provides that: &#8220;Any propaganda for war and 
any advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitements to lawless 
violence or to any other similar illegal action against any person or group of persons on any 
grounds including those of race, colour, religion, language, or national origin shall be considered 
as offenses punishable by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>33. Like the international instruments, the regional instruments leave many issues 
unexplained and do not provide much detail on specific interpretations and how to reconcile 
apparent inconsistencies among their provisions. 
</p>
<p><b>III. THE INTERPRETATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW 
</b></p>
<p>34. Although the international human rights instruments as well as regional instruments and 
national jurisprudence clearly establish that incitement to racial and religious hatred can be 
proscribed and sanctioned, the interpretation and implementation of the law has been highly 
uneven and problematic. Many of the key concepts are not uniformly defined and there is a lot of 
ambiguity about critical issues such as the objectives of the law, the extent of the public harm 
that should warrant limitations on essential freedoms, the limit that can appropriately be placed 
on freedom of expression and other freedoms, and the nature and scope of sanctions and 
remedies that can be applied against offending speech. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>35. Clear guidelines and coherence are important to ensure effective implementation of the 
law and the promotion of tolerance which should be the goal of the law. On the other hand, the 
risk of undermining human rights in general increases when there is no consensus and common 
understanding of the essential elements of the law. This is an area where the Human Rights 
Council can make an important contribution to guide the national implementation of the law in a 
manner that can promote tolerance without undermining other human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>A. The notion of incitement 
</b></p>
<p>36. Despite the apparent widespread agreement that certain categories of harmful speech or 
speech that provoke harmful consequences can be legally proscribed, the notion of incitement 
and other key concepts are not well defined. The international and regional instruments generally 
do not provide any definitions and the relevant monitoring bodies have encountered difficulties 
in articulating suitable definitions for purposes of implementation. For example, the Human 
Rights Committee has avoided a definition of hate speech or incitement and instead focused on 
the potential harm of speech on the rights of others and whether it was necessary to prevent that 
harm (see, e.g. <i>Ross v. Canada</i>31 and <i>Faurisson v. France</i> 32 both of which focused on the impact 
of the statements in raising anti-Semitic feelings).  
</p>
<p>37. Attempts to define hate speech have not generated much consensus. For example, the 
Council of Europe&#8217;s Recommendation on hate speech has proposed a broad definition of &#8220;hate 
speech&#8221; that encompasses <i>&#8220;all forms of expression which spread, incite, promote or justify racial 
hatred, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or other forms of hatred based on intolerance, including: 
intolerance expressed by aggressive nationalism and ethnocentrism, discrimination and hostility 
against minorities, migrants and people of immigrant origin&#8221;.33</i> This is very inclusive and may 
raise more questions than it solves. Similarly, the ICTR&#8217;s definition of hate speech in the 
<i>Nahimana Case</i> as &#8220;stereotyping of ethnicity combined with its denigration&#8221; is also 
unsatisfactory, because the two elements, stereotyping and denigration, are not self-defining. 
</p>
<p>38. The notion of incitement is generally used to connote at least three different ideas: (a)  
incitement to an illegal act that takes place (e.g. genocide, violence, discrimination); (b)  
incitement to an illegal act that does not take place but creates in the mind of the recipient the 
requisite desire to commit an illegal act; and (c) creating a certain state of mind &#8211; racial hatred, 
racism &#8211; without a link to any particular illegal act. The first two are probably the least 
problematic from a practical standpoint as illustrated by the genocide cases. 
</p>
<p>39. The international and regional human rights instruments embrace somewhat different 
notions of incitement. For example, article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR and article 13, paragraph 
5, of the ACHR ban the advocacy of hatred. Thus, in order to convict someone under either 
provision it is necessary to prove advocacy with the intent to sow hatred. On the other hand, 
article 4(a) of ICERD prohibits the mere dissemination of ideas based on superiority and racial 
hatred. Under ICERD, the dissemination of the idea itself is what attracts sanction without any 
further or requirement about its intent or impact.34 This may seem a subtle difference but it is 
significant in determining the scope of the law. 
</p>
<p>40. Moreover, the instruments also apply different terminologies to describe the nature of the 
offense, but presumably reflecting similar notions.  Article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR prohibits 
&#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes <i>incitement to discrimination, 
hostility or violence</i>&#8221;. On the other hand, the equivalent provision in article 4(a) of ICERD to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred&#8221;. Hatred and hostility would appear 
to refer to very similar notions even though, unlike discrimination or violence, neither concept 
can be precisely defined. Both the Human Rights Committee and CERD have understood their 
respective terms to include a passive state of mind rather than a specific act. In other words, the 
proscribed result is the fact of harbouring hostility towards a target group and it is not essential 
that this state of mind be acted upon. 
</p>
<p>41. It is difficult to extract firm conclusions on the rules governing hate speech from the 
cases. From the perspective of international law, the question of what constitutes incitement to 
genocide or to other proscribed results recognized under hate speech provisions requires 
consideration of a number of issues, including intent, causation or nexus between the speech and 
the proscribed result, context, tone and truth. On the other hand, the recent cases from the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda illustrate the conceptual and policy difficulties that 
arise from these definitional problems.  
</p>
<p><b>B. The context of race and religion 
</b></p>
<p>42. The legal debate is complicated by the sensitivity that attaches to discussions of issues of 
race and religion. For example, heightened concern with racism is sometimes offered as an 
explanation for the broader scope of article 4(a) of CERD, which prohibits the mere 
dissemination of ideas based on racial hatred or superiority, regardless of any impact. In contrast, 
article 19, paragraph 3, of ICCPR, which encompasses incitement in other contexts, permits 
restrictions on freedom of expression only to the extent necessary to protect the public interest in 
question.  
</p>
<p>43. This point is illustrated by the <i>Jersild</i> case in which the European Court of Human Rights 
held that the airing of a television programme that included hate speech statements by racist 
extremists was protected speech because the producer&#8217;s intention was to generate public debate 
on the issue. It seems clear from the decision that the actions of the journalist would not fall 
within the scope of article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR, primarily because they did not constitute 
advocacy of hatred. The Court also noted that the context made it unlikely that the statements 
would have incited violence, discrimination or hostility. 
</p>
<p>44. Although the European Court held that its decision was compatible with ICERD, it is 
quite conceivable that Mr. Jersild&#8217;s conviction would have been compatible with that instrument 
because article 4(a) prohibits the mere dissemination of ideas based on racial hatred. CERD&#8217;s 
report to the General Assembly noted that some members welcomed this decision as the clearest 
statement yet, in any country, that the right to protection against racial discrimination took 
precedence over the right to freedom of expression. Other members thought that in such cases 
the facts needed to be considered in relation to both rights.35 
</p>
<p>45. With respect to religion, the general view is that the guarantee of freedom of expression 
protects even very strong criticism of religion.36 Free speech may not, however, protect 
statements whose goal is simply to promote hatred against particular religious adherents. In 
<i>Giniewski</i>, the European Court of Human Rights seemed to support this approach, holding that 
the impugned speech was not a gratuitous attack on religion but, rather, part of a clash of ideas 
(&#8220;<i>d&#233;bat d&#8217;id&#233;es&#8221;</i>).37 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>46. Blasphemy laws, generally intended to ensure respect for the deeply held views of 
religious adherents, have posed a different set of issues. The European Court of Human Rights 
has upheld restrictions to freedom of expression on this basis,38 but the limited focus has been on 
&#8220;expressions that are gratuitously offensive to others and thus an infringement of their rights and 
which do not contribute to any form of public debate capable of furthering progress in human 
affairs39.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>C. Freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to freedom of expression is not absolute and both international law and most 
national constitutions recognize that limited restrictions may be imposed on this right to 
safeguard overriding public and/or private interests. International law lays down a clear test by 
which the legitimacy of such restrictions may be assessed. Specifically, article 19, paragraph 3, 
of ICCPR provides that: 
</p>
<p>3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries 
with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain 
restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:  
</p>
<p>(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;  
</p>
<p>(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (<i>ordre public</i>), or 
of public health or morals. 
</p>
<p>48. Concern about the impact of rules on incitement on freedom of expression has been 
expressed throughout the drafting history of the various international instruments as well as in 
their texts and in the jurisprudence of the various bodies tasked with their application. These play 
a key role in defining the limits of incitement to genocide and hate speech under international 
law.  
</p>
<p>49. International law on incitement involves balancing two competing claims and 
imperatives of human rights:  equality and free speech. Equality is a fundamental human right 
and philosophically foundational to all human rights and the protection of human dignity. 
Freedom of expression is similarly foundational, largely due to its functional role in protecting 
other rights and underlying social values. Both equality and free speech are key underpinnings of 
democracy and participation. International and national courts alike frequently stress the 
particular importance of speech in public participation and discourse and, therefore, the need for 
high standards of protection.40  
</p>
<p>50. The interface between freedom of expression and the prohibition of incitement is treated 
in somewhat different ways in the various instruments as well as by scholars. Both the UDHR 
and the ICCPR guarantee the freedom of expression in very similar terms.41 
</p>
<p>51. The Human Rights Committee has specifically stated that article 20, paragraph 2, is 
compatible with article 19.42 Although ICERD does not guarantee the right to freedom of 
expression, it requires that measures taken pursuant to article 4 have due regard for the principles 
set out in the UDHR, which include equality, non-discrimination and freedom of expression. 
Article 5 of ICERD also provides for equality before the law in the enjoyment of a large number 
of rights, including freedom of expression. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. Freedom of expression is also protected in all three regional human rights instruments. 
The guarantee in the ECHR is very similar to that of the ICCPR, albeit with a slightly longer list 
of aims in service of which expression may be restricted. The guarantee in the ACHR is also 
structurally very similar, although it additionally contains a number of explicit protections for 
freedom of expression, such as a prohibition on prior censorship and on using indirect means to 
restrict expression.<b>43</b> The guarantee in the ACHPR is rather weaker on its face, allowing simply 
for restrictions &#8220;within the law&#8221;, although subsequent interpretation of this by the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has substantially narrowed the potential scope of 
this provision.<b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>53. International courts have made it clear that the test for restrictions on freedom of 
expression is a very strict one which imposes a high standard of justification on States.45 First, 
the restriction must be provided for by law. This implies not only that the restriction finds a basis 
in law but also that the law is accessible and &#8220;formulated with sufficient precision to enable the 
citizen to regulate his conduct&#8221;.46 The first part of the test &#8211; the requirement of being provided 
for by law &#8211; would apply to laws on incitement to genocide and hate speech in the same way as 
any laws restricting freedom of expression. In other words, such laws must be accessible and 
precise.  
</p>
<p>54. However, international courts have held that even a somewhat vague set of primary rules 
may be clarified by judicial interpretation.47 In <i>Ross</i>, the Human Rights Committee recognized 
the &#8220;vague criteria of the provisions&#8221; but held that they were nevertheless provided for by law, 
noting that the Supreme Court of Canada had considered all aspects of the case and found a 
sufficient basis for the original decision in Canadian law. 
</p>
<p>55. Furthermore, the interference must pursue one or more of the aims listed in article 19, 
paragraph 3, of ICCPR. This list of aims is exclusive and it is clear that restrictions on freedom 
of expression serving other aims are not legitimate. Third, the restriction must be necessary to 
protect those aims. &#8220;Necessary&#8221; implies that there is a &#8220;pressing social need&#8221; for the restriction, 
that the reasons given by the State to justify the restriction are &#8220;relevant and sufficient&#8221; and that 
the restriction is proportionate in the sense that the benefits outweigh the harm.48 It is under this 
part of the test that the vast majority of freedom of expression cases, including those involving 
hate speech, are decided. 
</p>
<p>56. As highlighted during the drafting of the ICCPR, there is a potential conflict between 
Article 19, paragraph 3, of the ICCPR which guarantees freedom of expression but permits 
restrictions on this freedom under specific conditions, and Article 20, paragraph 2, which 
imposes an obligation to restrict speech.49 The two articles were kept separate since they dealt 
with different objectives, however, it was decided that they should go next to each other to 
emphasize the close relationship between them.50 
</p>
<p>57. In <i>Ross</i>, the Human Rights Committee held that a restriction on the author&#8217;s freedom of 
expression aimed at protecting against racism had to be justified by reference to the test set out in 
Article 19, paragraph 3, of ICCPR.51 This reflects the natural conclusion that any law seeking to 
implement the provisions of article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR must not overstep the limits on 
restrictions on freedom of expression set out in article 19, paragraph 3. Conversely, article 19, 
paragraph 3, must be interpreted in a manner that respects the terms of article 20, paragraph 2. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>58. The primary difficulty in resolving the potential incompatibility between article 19, 
paragraph 3, and article 20, paragraph 2, is in relation to the necessity part of test for restrictions 
on freedom of expression. In large part, this is a question of what constitutes incitement, dealt 
with earlier. 
</p>
<p>59. It is also significant that the right to hold opinions is not subject to restriction, article 19, 
paragraph 3, being applicable only to article 19, paragraph 2, and not to Article 19, paragraph 1, 
protecting opinions. This means that everyone is free to hold any opinions they wish, even racist 
and genocidal opinions. It is only where opinions are articulated that international law may 
permit restrictions. 
</p>
<p><b>D. The scope of sanctions and remedies 
</b></p>
<p>60. When and how far a State may act to prohibit incitement is uncertain, and options range 
from banning the media to criminal sanctions. Article 20, paragraph 2, of ICCPR requires that 
the included speech be &#8220;prohibited by law&#8221;, whereas article 4 of CERD and article 13, paragraph 
5, of ACHR require included speech to be an &#8220;offence punishable by law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>61. In practice, most States have some form of criminal hate speech provisions, although 
many of these do not extend to all forms of speech specified in article 4(a) of ICERD. The more 
stringent language of ICERD has led most CERD members to support a primarily criminal law 
approach,52 although civil or administrative regimes may also be said under certain 
circumstances to impose punishment. For example, the European Commission Against Racism 
and Intolerance (ECRI) has adopted a policy recommendation on legislation to combat racism 
which spells out quite clearly what they consider different branches of law should cover in this 
area. While they recognize an important role for the civil and administrative law, they also 
recommend that certain forms of hate speech should be subject to criminal sanction.53 
</p>
<p>62. General Comment No. 11 of the Human Rights Committee54 refers to a law which makes 
it clear that the activities are &#8220;contrary to public policy&#8221; and which provides for an &#8220;appropriate 
sanction&#8221; in case of a violation. The notion of &#8220;sanction&#8221; suggests criminal or administrative 
law, but civil law remedies could also be understood to satisfy this standard. 
</p>
<p>63. International courts have sought to the limit application of criminal sanctions to restrict 
speech because these are deemed very intrusive. 55  In many countries, it is possible to bring a 
civil suit for compensation for discrimination, for example in the workplace, including where 
this is propagated by means of speech. The Council of Europe Recommendation on hate speech, 
for example, calls for greater attention to civil law remedies leading to compensation for hate 
speech.56 The same Recommendation refers to the possibility of providing for a right of reply 
and/or retraction for hate speech. 
</p>
<p>64. Various administrative measures may be used to address racist speech. For example, 
many countries have administrative systems for addressing discrimination. Indeed, several of the 
cases discussed above are based on the application of measures by administrative anti-
discrimination bodies at the national level.57 These systems allow for the application of 
administrative measures in response to speech that amounts to discrimination, as well, of course, 
as other forms of discrimination. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. Legal measures may be supplemented by a number of non-legal measures, including self-
regulatory measures by media bodies, media outlets or journalists&#8217; associations to prevent the 
dissemination of harmful speech. In many countries, media sectors, in particular newspapers and 
journalists, have formed self-regulatory bodies to promote professional standards and in some 
cases to provide the public with a complaints system for reporting which fails to meet minimum 
standards. In many cases, these standards include rules relating to reporting on matters involving 
race. 
</p>
<p>66. The International Federation of Journalists, for example, has adopted a Declaration of 
Principles on the Conduct of Journalists<i>.</i>58 Principle 7 states that: 
</p>
<p>The journalist shall be aware of the danger of discrimination being furthered 
by the media, and shall do the utmost to avoid facilitating such discrimination 
based on, among other things, race, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, 
political or other opinions, and national or social origins. 
</p>
<p>67. Awareness-raising, directed at both the media specifically and the general public, is 
another important social means of addressing racist speech. In its General Recommendation 
No. 29, focusing on descent-based discrimination, CERD called on States Parties to &#8220;take 
measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent-
based discrimination&#8221;.59 
</p>
<p>IV. <b>PRACTICAL ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATION AND 
ENFORCEMENT</b> 
</p>
<p>68. As noted above, incitement may be to a particular illegal act &#8211; violence or discrimination 
&#8211; or simply to a state of mind. The notion of &#8220;hatred&#8221; is extremely vague and not defined either 
in international instruments or in the decisions of international courts. It is therefore problematic 
from the perspective of the provided by element of prescription by law in the test for restrictions 
on freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>69. Unlike incitement to an act, it is almost impossible to prove whether hatred <i>per se</i> is or is 
not likely to result from the dissemination of certain statements. Regular evidentiary techniques 
may be employed to assess the risk of a particular illegal act occurring but these do not work 
well in assessing the risk of a purely psychological outcome. International courts have tended to 
avoid the issue and, instead, either simply conclude, perhaps after a cursory scan of the context, 
that the statements would be prone to have this result, or they focus on other factors, such as 
intent. 
</p>
<p>70. In this context, international law provides little with respect to the crucial question of 
how the law is to be implemented. This is a critical area because of its relevance to how the 
balance is struck between the need to protect equal rights of groups, on the one hand, and 
safeguarding freedoms of speech and association, for example. 
</p>
<p> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROMOTE TOLERANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b> AND UNDERSTANDING 
</b></p>
<p>71. One of the main rationales for prohibiting hate speech and advocacy of hatred is to 
safeguard the rights of minorities and affected people. Yet, the effectiveness of hate speech 
prosecutions in curbing the underlying concern, racial or religious hatred, may, at least in some 
contexts, be doubted. Indeed, it may be conceivable that the prohibition of speech may, in fact, 
provide platforms to amplify hate speech to the extent that those convicted of propagating hate 
speech are viewed as martyrs rather than criminals by their fellow racists. In this regard, 
prosecution can provide a far more effective platform for those espousing racist views than 
would otherwise be available to them.  
</p>
<p>72. On the other hand, there is a counter-argument that the prohibition of incitement should 
not be viewed exclusively from the point of view of their effectiveness because there is an 
intrinsic value in such action as an expression of public disapproval. In this sense, the action 
serves as a statement of support for victims. In other words, democratic societies must condemn 
speech which is inherently inimical to equality to maintain their own commitment to that very 
value and cannot remain passive. 60 
</p>
<p>73. Related to the question of effectiveness is the potential for abuse of the law on incitement 
to suppress unpopular speech or stifle dissent.61 This is particularly problematic where freedom 
of expression is suppressed and the power of the truth is weak. In such a climate, hate speech 
laws are ineffective and may even be counterproductive.62 Indeed, even in far less polarized 
contexts, such laws may be used to suppress minority viewpoints. 
</p>
<p>74. Giving voice to minorities is also an important way to combat racism. Racism is often 
based on a portrayal of minority groups as one-dimensional others who have collective 
shortcomings such as stupidity, ignorance, greed or whatever. Such distortions are based on 
ignorance about these minorities and ensuring their presence in the media, particularly the 
broadcast media, is an important way of combating such ignorance. 
</p>
<p>75. Media diversity in the sense of ensuring minority access can be promoted in a number of 
ways, including through the broadcast licensing process and by providing subsidies to minority 
print media. In South Africa, for example, article 2(a) of the Independent Communications 
Authority of South Africa Act (ICASA Act) states one of the three objects of the Act to be to, 
&#8220;regulate broadcasting in the public interest and to ensure fairness and a diversity of views 
broadly representing South African society&#8221;.63 
</p>
<p>76. Civil society and, in particular, the media, have an important role to play in combating 
racism. While such a role should not be enforced by law, it nevertheless represents an important 
social duty for these actors. As the three special mandates for freedom of expression &#8211; the United 
Nations  Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, the OSCE Representative on 
Freedom of the Media and the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression &#8211; have stated: 
</p>
<p>Media organisations, media enterprises and media workers &#8211; particularly public 
service broadcasters &#8211; have a moral and social obligation to make a positive </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>contribution to the fight against racism, discrimination, xenophobia and 
intolerance.64 
</p>
<p>77. Often, public service broadcasters are specifically required to give voice to minorities, an 
appropriate obligation given that, as public bodies, they should represent the whole population. 
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, for example, is required, among other things, to 
&#8220;reflect the multicultural and multiracial nature of Canada&#8221;.65  
</p>
<p>78. Finally, resolution 2005/40 of the Commission on Human Rights on the elimination of all 
forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To take all necessary steps and appropriate action to combat hatred, intolerance and acts of 
violence, intimidation and coercion motivated by intolerance; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To promote and encourage understanding, tolerance and respect in all matters relating to 
freedom of religion or belief; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To make appropriate efforts to encourage those engaged in teaching to cultivate respect for 
all religions or beliefs, thereby promoting mutual understanding and tolerance. 
</p>
<p><b>VI. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>79. The international human rights architecture is anchored on fundamental imperatives of 
equality and non-discrimination. Intolerance in general, and xenophobia and incitement to racial 
and religious hatred and violence in particular, imperil this very foundation of international 
human rights.  It is therefore both appropriate and timely that the Human Rights Council should 
focus attention on the issue at this time of increased global tensions and sensitivities. 
</p>
<p>80. There is clearly consensus on the broad outlines of the law relating to incitement and 
advocacy of racial and religious hatred and violence. The provisions of the international human 
rights instruments, particularly ICCPR and ICERD, as well as the three regional instruments, 
provide a good basis on which the legal and policy responses to the problem of intolerance more 
generally, and the incitement of hatred and violence in particular, can be constructed. 
</p>
<p>81. The implementation of this body of law is challenging, however, because many of the 
essential details remain undefined. These include lack of clarity on key concepts such as 
incitement, hatred and hate speech. Clearly, this is one area where attention might be focused to 
try to elaborate a sufficiently precise legal regime to provide guidance to States in developing 
national responses.  Issues surrounding the freedom of expression raise a particular concern in 
this regard.  
</p>
<p>82. It appears that some national jurisprudence is far richer than the international on the 
many dimensions of the law and policy on incitement. Courts in many countries have developed 
very detailed jurisprudence on a number of the key issues and built a large body of cases from 
which to draw principles and rules of interpretation. The situation is not even, however, and 
there are many other countries where the law in this area is still fairly rudimentary. The 
international system could learn much from the relevant national experiences.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>83. A juridical response is undoubtedly immensely significant in countering the impact of 
hate speech and of incitement to hatred and violence, but it cannot be the only or even main 
response. Incitement is a reflection of the growing global challenge of managing pluralism and 
fostering harmony. It is, therefore, crucial that the Human Rights Council reflect on the relevant 
political and social dimensions of the issue, as well search for lasting solutions to better 
knowledge and understanding across cultures and religions in the pursuit of a more tolerant 
world.  
</p>
<p>84. Uniform, consistent application of the law is essential to ensure the effectiveness of 
international efforts to counter intolerance. Key elements of the law need to be more concisely 
interpreted and defined in order to facilitate national efforts to comply with international 
obligations, and specific criteria should be developed to establish the essential boundary for 
freedom of expression. Further critical reflection is also required on the scope of actions that a 
State may take to curb speech. State practice across different legal systems will likely provide 
substantial guidance on these issues. It will therefore be necessary to undertake more work to 
document and analyze national as well as regional jurisprudence and the vast literature on the 
subject. In this regard, the Human Rights Council may consider the following possible actions: 
</p>
<p>(a) Request the treaty bodies, particularly the Human Rights Committee and CERD, to 
develop general comments on the areas of the law that need further definition; 
</p>
<p>(b) Mandate the relevant Special Rapporteurs to study national practice and  experiences 
in order to document best practices; 
</p>
<p>(c) Commission expert studies to further analyze and develop appropriate doctrine in the 
area; and 
</p>
<p>(d) Organize public dialogue to draw attention to the problem of intolerance and promote 
better understanding.

<p>45 The European Court of Human Rights, for example, interpreting a similar rule in Article 10 of the ECHR, has 
stated: &#8220;Freedom of expression &#8230; is subject to a number of exceptions which, however, must be narrowly 
interpreted and the necessity for any restrictions must be convincingly established.&#8221; See <i>Thorgeirson v. Iceland</i>, 25

promote an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and restrictions, given the limited capacity to apply
