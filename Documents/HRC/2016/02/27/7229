<p><b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 19 June 2015, the Human Rights Council convened its annual full-day 
</p>
<p>discussion on the human rights of women, pursuant to resolutions 6/30, 23/25, 26/15 and 
</p>
<p>29/14. The discussion consisted of two panels. The first focused on eliminating and 
</p>
<p>preventing domestic violence against women and girls. The second addressed women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>human rights and participation in power and decision-making.   
</p>
<p>2. The current report summarizes the discussion under those two themes. It sets out the 
</p>
<p>main issues raised, together with the conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Panel one: eliminating and preventing domestic violence 
against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>3. The panel on eliminating and preventing domestic violence against women and girls 
</p>
<p>was moderated by the General Secretary of the World Young Women&#8217;s Christian 
</p>
<p>Association (YWCA) and African Union Goodwill Ambassador for Ending Child 
</p>
<p>Marriage, Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda. It was composed of the Minister on the Status of 
</p>
<p>Women and Women&#8217;s Rights of Haiti, Marie Yves Rose Morquette Myrtil; representative 
</p>
<p>of the Government of Spain for issues related to gender-based violence Blanca Hern&#225;ndez 
</p>
<p>Oliver; founder and head of Aliansi Laki-Laki Baru, Indonesia, and Member of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE Network of Men Leaders to End Violence against Women, Nur 
</p>
<p>Hasyim; Director ad interim of the Policy Division, United Nations Entity for Gender 
</p>
<p>Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), Bego&#241;a Lasagabaster; professor 
</p>
<p>and researcher at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte university, Tijuana, Mexico, Julia Estela 
</p>
<p>Mon&#225;rrez Fragoso; and Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Officer of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Sven Pfeiffer.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Statement by the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. In her opening remarks, the Deputy High Commissioner said that it had taken years 
</p>
<p>of struggle to frame domestic violence as a human rights violation. She noted that gender 
</p>
<p>and ideological stereotypes that require women&#8217;s obedience to their husbands and fathers 
</p>
<p>had sustained the idea that domestic violence was a private matter in which the State could 
</p>
<p>not interfere. She said that at the heart of violence lay the belief that men&#8212;fathers, 
</p>
<p>husbands, brothers&#8212;had an entitlement over women and a right, or even a responsibility, to 
</p>
<p>control their behaviour or protect their &#8220;honour&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>5. She welcomed the considerable normative developments at the international, 
</p>
<p>regional and national levels that had been developed around the issue. Nonetheless, one in 
</p>
<p>three women in the world would experience violence during the course of her life and in 
</p>
<p>2012 alone, half of all female murder victims had been killed by family members or 
</p>
<p>intimate partners, compared with only 6 per cent of male murder victims.  
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner called for comprehensive interventions that 
</p>
<p>addressed both the causes and the impact of domestic violence. She highlighted four areas 
</p>
<p>where State action was crucial. First, in addressing discriminatory legislation; including 
</p>
<p>constitutionally recognizing equality between men and women in all spheres of life and 
</p>
<p>prohibiting marital rape. Second, the need for effective prosecution of perpetrators and 
</p>
<p>measures for strengthened prosecution not only to ensure accountability but also as a way 
</p>
<p>to challenge the social acceptance of domestic violence. She said that effective access to </p>


<p>justice for women was also urgently required, including through gender-sensitive law 
</p>
<p>enforcement, which would also offer adequate protection from retaliation and stigma. 
</p>
<p>Third, reparation for survivors that went beyond simply returning women to the situation in 
</p>
<p>which they were found before the individual instance of domestic violence and that was 
</p>
<p>transformative, in that it had the potential to reverse prior gender inequalities that were 
</p>
<p>often the root causes of the violence. Fourth, targeted efforts to change mindsets, including 
</p>
<p>by organizing awareness-raising campaigns to challenge attitudes and stereotypes, and 
</p>
<p>informing the public about measures of protection and redress, as well as education, to 
</p>
<p>deconstruct stereotypical notions of masculinity and femininity and promote new 
</p>
<p>understandings that valued the full equality of men and women.  
</p>
<p>7. She recalled several tools and projects developed by the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that could assist States in eliminating and 
</p>
<p>preventing domestic violence, such as the Latin American model protocol for the 
</p>
<p>investigation of gender-related killings of women, programmes on gender stereotyping by 
</p>
<p>the judiciary and guidance on gender-just and transformative reparations for survivors. The 
</p>
<p>Deputy High Commissioner recommended that States undertake educational and 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising activities, including on relationships and sexuality education, and involve 
</p>
<p>communities and traditional and religious leaders in promoting gender equality and shifting 
</p>
<p>attitudes about gender roles and relationships.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of the </b>panellists&#8217;<b> interventions 
</b></p>
<p>8. The panel moderator said that domestic violence was unnatural and a violation of 
</p>
<p>trust, and that it was preventable. Ms. Gumbonzvanda noted the two resolutions tabled at 
</p>
<p>the session on the issue of violence against women and girls and on child, early and forced 
</p>
<p>marriage and welcomed the fact that the Council was paying attention to the issue. She also 
</p>
<p>welcomed regional initiatives on the issue, in particular the Council of Europe Convention 
</p>
<p>on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the ASEAN Region and the 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in 
</p>
<p>Africa.  
</p>
<p>9. Ms. Gumbonzvanda stressed the importance of implementing and enforcing 
</p>
<p>legislation and policies and said that violence against women was not merely a social issue, 
</p>
<p>but a crime. She referred to work done by YWCA in 100 countries, including the provision 
</p>
<p>of shelters, legal assistance and hotlines. She encouraged the panellists and States to 
</p>
<p>explore the manifestations, prevalence and underlying causes of domestic violence and to 
</p>
<p>build on previous decisions, resolutions and interventions by States towards implementing 
</p>
<p>and accelerating efforts at national level. 
</p>
<p>10. Ms. Morquette Myrtil recalled the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, in 
</p>
<p>which violence against women had been identified as one of 12 critical areas of concern. 
</p>
<p>She said that Haiti had taken a number of steps to combat domestic violence, including 
</p>
<p>adopting laws against sexual violence, prosecuting perpetrators, establishing shelters, 
</p>
<p>training civil society organizations and other stakeholders, raising awareness within the 
</p>
<p>media and collecting accurate data to inform the development and implementation of public 
</p>
<p>policies.  
</p>
<p>11. Ms. Morquette Myrtil said that violence against women was multidimensional and 
</p>
<p>hindered sustainable development and that it required a comprehensive approach and 
</p>
<p>policies that were adequately resourced. She said that Haiti would continue to strengthen its 
</p>
<p>action against domestic violence and called on all States to build a world where women 
</p>
<p>could live free from violence. She also recommended the establishment of national 
</p>
<p>observatories on domestic violence. </p>


<p>12. Ms. Hern&#225;ndez Oliver explained how Spain addressed issues of domestic violence, 
</p>
<p>which she said could be applied in other countries. She said that Spain allocated a clear 
</p>
<p>budget line for support and assistance to victims of domestic violence in all areas of their 
</p>
<p>life, including in employment. The Government had focused on collecting and making 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data publicly available. In the area of awareness-raising, it had combined the 
</p>
<p>use of traditional channels, such as the media, with non-traditional actors such as chemists, 
</p>
<p>pharmacists and corporations. She emphasized the importance of political support and 
</p>
<p>commitment for addressing the issue. She also pointed out the importance of early 
</p>
<p>detection, including early signs of violence; addressing prevailing macho and chauvinist 
</p>
<p>attitudes; and the importance of stigmatizing perpetrators. She said that comprehensive 
</p>
<p>legislation that paid appropriate attention to women with disabilities and rural women 
</p>
<p>among others was also critical to eliminating and preventing domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>13. Addressing the role of men and boys in ending domestic violence, Mr. Hasyim 
</p>
<p>spoke about the work of his organization, a crisis centre for women victims of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence in Indonesia. He said the centre also offered a counselling programme for abusive 
</p>
<p>husbands and a men&#8217;s programme for engaging men and boys in ending violence against 
</p>
<p>women. He explained that, in his experience, the majority of women victims of domestic 
</p>
<p>violence chose to remain in the violent relationship as a result of lack of alternative 
</p>
<p>solutions. They were faced with the choice of applying for a divorce or staying with their 
</p>
<p>abusive partner. In that regard, he highlighted the importance of working with male 
</p>
<p>perpetrators to stop the cycle of violence and change their abusive behaviour.  
</p>
<p>14. He said that they offered training to male perpetrators on sexual and reproductive 
</p>
<p>health and rights, on how to construct healthy relationships and on non-violent 
</p>
<p>communication skills. They also offered premarital counselling for both men and women 
</p>
<p>and classes on motherhood and fatherhood. He said that one of the challenges of working 
</p>
<p>with male perpetrators was the high dropout rates, which he said could be addressed if the 
</p>
<p>Government made this training mandatory. He noted that changes to the domestic violence 
</p>
<p>act in Indonesia had given judges the power to require perpetrators to attend counselling, 
</p>
<p>although there had yet to be a government-funded programme on counselling male abusers. 
</p>
<p>He recommended that mandatory counselling sessions be integrated into programmes and 
</p>
<p>policies for domestic violence prevention.  
</p>
<p>15. Ms. Lasagabaster said that although progress had been made by States in the 
</p>
<p>adoption of laws and policies, as well in improving justice and service responses for 
</p>
<p>survivors of domestic violence, many challenges remained. She pointed to the lack of 
</p>
<p>strong political will, inadequate resources, policies and procedures; insufficient monitoring, 
</p>
<p>evaluation and enforcement of legislation; lack of coordination among different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders; persistent and entrenched negative stereotypes; and discrimination and gender 
</p>
<p>inequality.  
</p>
<p>16. She said that prevention was the only way to reduce and eventually eliminate 
</p>
<p>violence against women and girls. However, prevention remained a relatively new area, 
</p>
<p>with a fragmented approach and without critical mass of data and expertise. In this regard, 
</p>
<p>she announced that UN-Women, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, was 
</p>
<p>finalizing a global inter-agency framework on the prevention of violence against women. 
</p>
<p>The framework was intended to strengthen a shared understanding on the prevention of 
</p>
<p>violence against women, and it included a number of effective strategies.  
</p>
<p>17. She said the legal frameworks should be complemented by community mobilization, 
</p>
<p>education, awareness-raising, partnerships with media and civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>including women&#8217;s movements, community and religious leaders and programmes that 
</p>
<p>strengthened the involvement of men and boys.  </p>


<p>18. Ms. Mon&#225;rrez Fragoso pointed out that 17 countries in Latin America had the 
</p>
<p>specific crime of femicide on their statute books. She stressed that, when addressing 
</p>
<p>femicide, States should not only take into consideration gender, but also the causes and 
</p>
<p>challenges more broadly. She said that femicide was linked to social class, the geopolitical 
</p>
<p>position of a country, political, structural and hierarchical issues, the distribution of wealth, 
</p>
<p>the security policies of States, and even organized crime. She urged States to allocate 
</p>
<p>adequate budget and resources, to make publicly available gender disaggregated data on all 
</p>
<p>forms of violence against women, including transgender women, to provide funding for 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s rights institutions and ensure their independence, to strengthen men and youth 
</p>
<p>groups working for gender equality, and to end impunity for violence against women. She 
</p>
<p>also asked for particular attention to be paid to women who were particularly vulnerable, 
</p>
<p>such as women in the prison system or who had been recently released. 
</p>
<p>19. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 23/25, which called for an update on 
</p>
<p>the outcome of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group meeting on gender-related 
</p>
<p>killing of women and girls, Mr. Pfeiffer presented the outcome of that meeting, which had 
</p>
<p>taken place from 11 to 13 November, in Bangkok. He said that States had discussed 
</p>
<p>promising practices and made practical recommendations on the prevention and 
</p>
<p>prosecution of and punishment for gender-related killing. He said that they had 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that the killing of women and girls often represented the final event in a 
</p>
<p>continuum of domestic and other forms of violence, which continued as a result of high 
</p>
<p>levels of impunity and a lack of accountability.  
</p>
<p>20. He said that recommendations included the need for more systematic and 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data collection and analysis and cooperation with civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>community and religious leaders, women&#8217;s organizations, human rights defenders and the 
</p>
<p>private sector. He said that experts at the meeting had stressed the importance of laws, 
</p>
<p>policies, procedures and practices to prevent and address not only the killings, but violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, and to utilize existing international standards and norms in crime 
</p>
<p>prevention and criminal justice. 
</p>
<p>21. He said that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice had adopted 
</p>
<p>a follow-up resolution that called for further action by Member States and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system to enhance their knowledge base on gender-related killings and to 
</p>
<p>accelerate efforts towards preventing them. Mr. Pfeiffer said that UNODC stood ready to 
</p>
<p>partner with Member States and United Nations entities to intensify action against domestic 
</p>
<p>violence and other forms of violence. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Interventions by representatives of States members of the Council, 
</b></p>
<p><b>observer States and other observers 
</b></p>
<p>22. During the discussion, States agreed that the elimination of violence against women 
</p>
<p>was a priority. Concern was expressed that violence against women continued to be one of 
</p>
<p>the most pervasive human rights violations and that domestic violence was the most 
</p>
<p>prevalent. A number of speakers noted that domestic violence included sexual violence 
</p>
<p>such as marital rape, which should not be treated as a private matter but rather as a criminal 
</p>
<p>act. It was noted that domestic violence continued to be shrouded in a culture of silence that 
</p>
<p>placed the shame on the victim rather than on the perpetrator, where it belonged. It was also 
</p>
<p>pointed out that often, culture, tradition and religion were used to justify violence against 
</p>
<p>women and domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>23. It was highlighted that violence against women occurred both during armed conflict 
</p>
<p>and peace, that it increased in disaster settings and was not limited to one culture, region or 
</p>
<p>a particular group of women within a society. It was usually underpinned by gender </p>


<p>inequalities and discrimination. It was also observed that violence against women was often 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by poverty, lack of education, low levels of empowerment, and negative social 
</p>
<p>attitudes and norms that tolerated such practices. A number of speakers noted that 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of violence against women included State and non-State actors and that certain 
</p>
<p>groups of women were more vulnerable to violence. These included lesbian, bisexual, 
</p>
<p>transsexual and intersex women, rural women and incarcerated women. 
</p>
<p>24. Several States said that violence against women threatened economic prosperity and 
</p>
<p>prevented the full participation of women in society, and that women should therefore be 
</p>
<p>promoted and empowered within societies and countries in all areas of public life and in 
</p>
<p>decision-making. Repeatedly emphasized was the importance of criminalizing violence 
</p>
<p>against women, providing training for justice-sector officials, including prosecutors and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary, providing victims with protection from reprisals by their families and 
</p>
<p>communities when they reported cases of domestic violence, and making reparations for 
</p>
<p>victims.  
</p>
<p>25. Several speakers raised the need for good practices on protection and prevention 
</p>
<p>strategies against domestic violence, as well as the need to shift from a patriarchal culture 
</p>
<p>to a culture of gender equality. The importance of countering victim shaming and blaming 
</p>
<p>and empowering victims so they could break the cycle of violence, as well as the need for a 
</p>
<p>targeted response to women from vulnerable groups, was also raised by several speakers. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Concluding remarks by the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>26. The panellists highlighted the linkages between economic empowerment, sexual and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health and rights, and domestic violence, and the importance of shifting the 
</p>
<p>focus from awareness towards behavioural change. 
</p>
<p>27. They recommended that States adopt a transformative agenda which should be 
</p>
<p>adequately budgeted and resourced to address the root causes of domestic violence such as 
</p>
<p>poverty, lack of education, gender stereotypes, negative social attitudes and norms that 
</p>
<p>tolerated violence. 
</p>
<p>28. Panellists agreed that to eliminate and prevent domestic violence effectively  
</p>
<p>domestic violence in different contexts would need to be addressed, such as in conflict and 
</p>
<p>disaster situations, among populations of refugees and internally displaced persons, and in 
</p>
<p>the new forms of social media. They also said that domestic violence should be viewed as 
</p>
<p>part of the continuum of violence that women experience throughout their life cycle. 
</p>
<p>29. Panellists agreed on the need for further research on the different manifestations of 
</p>
<p>domestic violence, including on gender-related killing and the collection of disaggregated 
</p>
<p>data. And in order have sustainable impact on addressing social and economic inequalities 
</p>
<p>between men and women, panellists recommended that prevention strategies should be 
</p>
<p>holistic and multisectoral, and that interventions should be mutually reinforcing. 
</p>
<p>30. Panellists noted that conflict settings exacerbated existing attitudes and behaviour 
</p>
<p>that condoned violence against women and that accountability of State and non-State 
</p>
<p>actors, even in conflict situations, was necessary to prevent domestic violence. Panellists 
</p>
<p>called for support for States affected by conflict, in order to prevent and respond effectively 
</p>
<p>to sexual violence. They also pointed to the need for continued gender mainstreaming in all 
</p>
<p>policies and programmes of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>31. They emphasized the critical role of civil society organizations and of religious and 
</p>
<p>community leaders. They also agreed on the importance of involving men and boys in 
</p>
<p>efforts to prevent domestic violence. It was stressed that men were not naturally violent and 
</p>
<p>that violence was a learned behaviour that could be unlearned. </p>


<p>32. The panellists underlined the importance of education in eliminating stereotypical 
</p>
<p>notions of the role of men and women and masculinity constructs that encouraged violence 
</p>
<p>by men. To transform existing cultures of patriarchy to gender equality, panellists 
</p>
<p>recommended that States model their policies on international standards and share 
</p>
<p>information and practices for education on positive masculinity and for school curricula to 
</p>
<p>include harmful masculinity stereotypes and practices. 
</p>
<p>33. Panellists welcomed the inclusion of a specific target in the post-2015 agenda on the 
</p>
<p>elimination of violence against women in public and private spheres. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Panel two: w</b>omen&#8217;s human rights<b> and participation in power 
and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>34. The panel was composed of the Executive Director of the International Trade 
</p>
<p>Centre, Arancha Gonz&#225;lez; a Parliamentarian and trade-union activist from Bangladesh, 
</p>
<p>Shirin Akhter; a Project Officer from the World YWCA in Benin, Lucr&#232;ce Falolou; a 
</p>
<p>Partner at Index Ventures, from France, Mich&#232;le Ollier; and a researcher on gender, public 
</p>
<p>policies and public administration from Paraguay, Lilian Soto. The panel was moderated by 
</p>
<p>the Chair of the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
</p>
<p>practice, Emna Aouij. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Statement by the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner  
</b></p>
<p><b>for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. In her opening remarks, the Deputy High Commissioner welcomed the fact that 
</p>
<p>women had increased their participation in political and public life, in part owing to the 
</p>
<p>adoption of gender-sensitive laws and temporary special measures to accelerate de facto 
</p>
<p>equality. She said that progress, however, was still at a snail&#8217;s pace, still far from the 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent parity that should be the objective. At present, women represented a mere 20 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the world&#8217;s parliamentarians and 17 per cent of heads of State. Women were also 
</p>
<p>severely underrepresented in top leadership bodies in the economic sphere, they continued 
</p>
<p>to be paid less for work of equal value, and too many were trapped in the informal 
</p>
<p>economy, as well as having to shoulder most of the unpaid work in the home.  
</p>
<p>36. The Deputy High Commissioner stressed that not enough had been done to ensure 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s participation in peace and security, despite studies indicating that post-conflict 
</p>
<p>agreements negotiated without women broke down faster than those that included women. 
</p>
<p>As barriers to women&#8217;s equal enjoyment of the rights to economic and political 
</p>
<p>participation, harmful gender stereotypes significantly affected the rights of women by 
</p>
<p>confining them to roles deemed &#8220;appropriate&#8221; or &#8220;feminine&#8221; and resulted in unequal 
</p>
<p>treatment. Deep-seated patriarchal structures, which manifested in discriminatory social, 
</p>
<p>economic and political norms further compounded the issue.  
</p>
<p>37. The Deputy High Commissioner called for a comprehensive and holistic approach, 
</p>
<p>which must begin at an early age to address these barriers. She said that we needed enabling 
</p>
<p>environments that valued and promoted women and girls and equipped them for leadership 
</p>
<p>positions. And we also needed the commitment of men and boys to equality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. In addition, political systems needed to fully represent women as well as 
</p>
<p>men, and laws needed to be put in place and implemented that mandated the equality of 
</p>
<p>women and their equal access to resources and opportunities. She said that laws that 
</p>
<p>discriminated against women must be removed.  </p>


<p>38. The Deputy High Commissioner called on everyone to take advantage of the unique 
</p>
<p>opportunities of the coming months&#8212;particularly relating to negotiations around the 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals&#8212;to assess the progress made 20 years since Beijing and 
</p>
<p>come up with concrete transformative actions that could dismantle harmful gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes, drive greater gender equality and enhance women&#8217;s ability to claim their rights 
</p>
<p>and participate in power and decision-making. 
</p>
<p><b> B. </b>Overview of the panellists&#8217; presentations<b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. Ms. Aouij, the panel moderator, referred to the first thematic report of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice presented in 
</p>
<p>2013 concerning women&#8217;s participation in public and political life. The report gave an 
</p>
<p>account of the progress that had been made and the main challenges that needed to be 
</p>
<p>tackled so that women could participate fully in public and political life on an equal basis 
</p>
<p>with men and with respect for democracy and human rights. To ensure this, it was essential 
</p>
<p>to tackle the structural and social underpinning of gender-based discrimination.  
</p>
<p>40. She said that there was still a long way to go and that no country would establish 
</p>
<p>gender equality in public and private life so long as discrimination persisted between 
</p>
<p>women and men. More efforts were needed for incorporating women in decision-making 
</p>
<p>bodies in corporate structures, international bodies and elsewhere. Recalling the Working 
</p>
<p>Group&#8217;s 2014 thematic report on discrimination against women in economic and social life, 
</p>
<p>Ms. Aouij also stressed the importance of having women represented in cooperatives and 
</p>
<p>trade unions, and of having them participate in economic and social life generally. She 
</p>
<p>observed that a large number of States had put in place positive initiatives, such as special 
</p>
<p>temporary measures, which had improved women&#8217;s participation in public and political life. 
</p>
<p>41. Ms. Gonz&#225;lez emphasized that economic empowerment was key to ensuring 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s human rights in practice. It turned women into independent and confident 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in the economy and society, and trade could play an important role in 
</p>
<p>empowering women economically. The International Trade Centre helped build the 
</p>
<p>capacity of women to produce and offer services that the market wanted and helped connect 
</p>
<p>those services to regional and international markets. She said that failing to create economic 
</p>
<p>opportunities for more than half the population was not a smart economic decision and, 
</p>
<p>citing a study from McKinsey and Company, pointed out that corporations that had greater 
</p>
<p>gender diversity at the top performed better.  
</p>
<p>42. She said that women&#8217;s participation in the paid economy also benefited their 
</p>
<p>families and societies as a whole. Employed women could have a significant effect on 
</p>
<p>poverty reduction, universal primary education and reduced child mortality. As women 
</p>
<p>increased not only their own but also their children&#8217;s economic prospects, the impact of 
</p>
<p>economic empowerment was transgenerational.  
</p>
<p>43. To pave the way towards gender equality, she emphasized that, besides legal 
</p>
<p>structures that ensured gender parity in law and equal access to resources, women&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>should also be approached as human rights across the entire empowerment chain. This 
</p>
<p>included providing trade and business-related training for girls and women, encouraging 
</p>
<p>gender parity at work, analysing and addressing trade barriers that affected women 
</p>
<p>disproportionally, encouraging public procurement practices that included companies 
</p>
<p>owned by women, and promoting the inclusion of more women suppliers in and across the 
</p>
<p>entire value chains. 
</p>
<p>44. Ms. Akhter stated that progress had been made in Bangladesh since the adoption of 
</p>
<p>the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action 20 years previously. That was exemplified 
</p>
<p>by the representation of women in senior public positions, including a Head of State, a </p>


<p>Prime Minister, several government ministers, a speaker of parliament and an opposition 
</p>
<p>leader. Citing articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, she stressed the need to ensure equality in all spheres of 
</p>
<p>life, including in the family and the workplace, as well as to ensure equal opportunity in 
</p>
<p>education, health and security. Reference was also made to general recommendation No. 23 
</p>
<p>of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which called on 
</p>
<p>Governments to lead and guide public opinion and change attitudes that discriminated 
</p>
<p>against women or discouraged women&#8217;s involvement in political and public life.  
</p>
<p>45. Ms. Akhter said that in Bangladesh the mindset of men needed to be changed to 
</p>
<p>address these discriminatory and discouraging attitudes. She stressed that terrorism in the 
</p>
<p>name of religion was an important challenge to women&#8217;s participation in politics and the 
</p>
<p>economy. Bangladesh had instituted a quota system for women&#8217;s representation in 
</p>
<p>parliament since 1973; currently, 50 seats were reserved for women and 20 of 300 
</p>
<p>parliamentary seats were occupied by women who had been directly elected to fill those 
</p>
<p>seats. However, Ms. Akhter highlighted that although the Constitution of Bangladesh 
</p>
<p>guaranteed equal rights for women, this was not always evident in all spheres of life. 
</p>
<p>46. She pointed out the importance of achieving equality in local government and the 
</p>
<p>need to build the capacities of women at the local level. She called on everyone to take 
</p>
<p>positive initiatives, including at the grassroots level, to change the mindset of men, to 
</p>
<p>ensure that women could work together with men on an equal basis, and to empower young 
</p>
<p>women with the goal of achieving equality. 
</p>
<p>47. Citing her own experience, Ms. Falolou highlighted the importance of the role that 
</p>
<p>women leaders had played as role models in shaping her own personal development as a 
</p>
<p>leader. One such role model has been Ms. Marie-Elise Gbedo, formerly Minister of Justice 
</p>
<p>and Minister of Commerce of Benin and an accomplished businesswoman, lawyer and 
</p>
<p>politician, in addition to being a courageous and tenacious advocate for women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Falolou also paid tribute to YWCA and its work to promote women&#8217;s leadership and 
</p>
<p>empowerment.  
</p>
<p>48. As a youth educator and coordinator of YWCA Benin, Ms. Falolou described her 
</p>
<p>work in training young women and girls to be future leaders, as well as engaging with 
</p>
<p>teachers, parents, local authorities, religious leaders, Parliament and the Government 
</p>
<p>through workshops and other activities. At the international level, she continued to 
</p>
<p>participate in numerous workshops, training courses, forums and conferences representing 
</p>
<p>African youth and engaging policymakers.  
</p>
<p>49. She highlighted the various barriers to women&#8217;s participation, which included 
</p>
<p>attitudes, discriminatory laws and practices, the persistence of sociocultural stereotypes, 
</p>
<p>and family and childcare responsibilities. Without the active participation of women and the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of their views at all levels of decision-making, she said that the goals of equality, 
</p>
<p>development and peace could not be achieved.  
</p>
<p>50. She said that women must have the courage to challenge cultural barriers, be 
</p>
<p>confident and dare to be different, set life goals and the means to achieve them, be better 
</p>
<p>informed about legislation, have the ambition to gain access to positions of responsibility 
</p>
<p>and believe in their potential. In conclusion, she said that the most important determinant of 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s participation in economic and political decision-making was education, citing the 
</p>
<p>African proverb: &#8220;If you educate a boy, you train a man. If you educate a girl, you train a 
</p>
<p>village&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>51. Ms. Ollier observed that the venture capital industry was a world dominated by men 
</p>
<p>and an area where men held 90 per cent of the decision-making posts. Although gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes did exist and attitudes tended to be masculine and aggressive&#8212;which often 
</p>
<p>made it difficult for men to incorporate women in this area&#8212;one of the challenges were the </p>


<p>attitudes and confidence of women themselves. She said that if a woman wanted to obtain a 
</p>
<p>senior position in the area of venture capital, or in other corporate structures, she could. It 
</p>
<p>required a large amount of work, sacrifice and determination, but the door was open, as was 
</p>
<p>evidenced by her own case.   
</p>
<p>52. Ms. Ollier pointed out that in the business world, women must be willing to take 
</p>
<p>greater risks and have more confidence in their abilities. Women in jobs that are male-
</p>
<p>dominated bore a responsibility to empower, mentor and teach young women that they 
</p>
<p>were every bit as good and qualified as men and that they had everything it took to succeed. 
</p>
<p>53. Ms. Soto outlined a number of stereotypes in the Latin American and Caribbean 
</p>
<p>region that prevented women from participating in the political sphere. The stereotypes 
</p>
<p>included: women were seen as sensitive, uncompetitive and unfit for political life; women 
</p>
<p>were seen as caregivers and confined to domestic work; successful women were expected 
</p>
<p>to look and dress in a certain way and focus on their appearance rather than their policies; 
</p>
<p>and a &#8220;good&#8221; woman was seen as having a family and children, being heterosexual and 
</p>
<p>generally conforming to such dominant gender norms.  
</p>
<p>54. She said that politics was generally seen as the stamping ground of powerful men, 
</p>
<p>and that women were often confined to social policies, commonly regarded as being of 
</p>
<p>lesser importance politically&#8212;such as health care and sexual and reproductive health and 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>55. To attack those stereotypes, Ms. Soto said that we needed to use education, mass 
</p>
<p>communications systems and the media, the very institutions that had laid the foundations 
</p>
<p>for such stereotyping. Measures such as quotas could also be effective in leading to greater 
</p>
<p>participation of women in public and political life. Those measures also reminded everyone 
</p>
<p>that women must be present in various spheres and contribute to breaking the existing 
</p>
<p>monochromatic and monodimensional view of politics. She concluded by calling on States 
</p>
<p>to observe the example of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which had adopted a law 
</p>
<p>against political harassment and violence against women and had achieved parity in 
</p>
<p>Parliament, when 10 years previously, less than 15 per cent of parliamentarians had been  
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Interventions by representatives of States members of the Council, 
</b></p>
<p><b>observer States and other observers 
</b></p>
<p>56. In their interventions, States agreed that although progress has been made since the 
</p>
<p>adoption in 1995 of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, a significant amount 
</p>
<p>of work remained to be done in all countries to ensure the full and equal participation of 
</p>
<p>women in power and decision-making. The speakers agreed that multiple barriers, such as 
</p>
<p>discriminatory social, economic, and political norms, harmful gender stereotypes, 
</p>
<p>entrenched patriarchal structures, and unequal allocation and access to resources and 
</p>
<p>opportunities continued to perpetuate discrimination against women, violate their human 
</p>
<p>rights and inhibit progress in this area.  
</p>
<p>57. A number of States highlighted women&#8217;s economic contribution to development and 
</p>
<p>observed that enhancing women&#8217;s full and meaningful participation in power structures 
</p>
<p>across economic, political and social spheres was critical to advancing human rights. Yet, 
</p>
<p>several speakers pointed out that women still suffered from unequal access to high-level 
</p>
<p>positions in decision-making worldwide and more needed to be done in enhancing the 
</p>
<p>visibility of female leadership and in utilizing successful women as role models to motivate 
</p>
<p>and inspire. Some speakers observed that women&#8217;s participation in political and legislative 
</p>
<p>bodies was crucial for shaping policymaking on issues that affected them and that particular 
</p>
<p>attention should be given to including minorities and disabled women. </p>


<p>58. In sharing a number of good practices to address those barriers at the national level, 
</p>
<p>States highlighted the adoption of national action plans, policies and legislation to foster 
</p>
<p>women&#8217;s leadership and in support of gender parity. That included legal provisions in the 
</p>
<p>constitution and additional legislation to implement effectively the principle of gender 
</p>
<p>equality, legally binding quotas for women&#8217;s representation in public (e.g. electoral lists) 
</p>
<p>and private leadership positions (e.g. company boards) and linking State funding for 
</p>
<p>political parties to a minimum percentage of women representatives.  
</p>
<p>59. States also discussed good practices at the international level, such as the 
</p>
<p>organization of high-level events, initiatives, programmes and regional frameworks. This 
</p>
<p>included calls by several speakers for centrality of gender equality, and gender perspective 
</p>
<p>as a crosscutting issue, in the post-2015 development agenda and for renewed commitment 
</p>
<p>to this important issue, including strengthening efforts to consistently mainstream women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights in the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>60. The need for greater involvement of men and boys in promoting gender equality was 
</p>
<p>also emphasized by several speakers. A number of States pointed out that ensuring gender 
</p>
<p>equality was a rights issue that concerned every member of society and that investing in 
</p>
<p>women as agents of development led to better living conditions for entire populations.  
</p>
<p>61. Some speakers also observed the need to ensure the equal sharing of domestic work 
</p>
<p>and childcare between women and men, as well as to ensure that all women had equal 
</p>
<p>access to high-quality education. In the context of peace and security, several States pointed 
</p>
<p>out that women continued to be excluded from peace negotiations and conflict resolution 
</p>
<p>initiatives and that their empowerment and full participation in conflict resolution and post-
</p>
<p>conflict efforts was critical to the sustainability of international peace and security. Some 
</p>
<p>speakers called on States to step up their efforts to enforce the principle of gender parity 
</p>
<p>and also take into account the situation of women human rights defenders, who often faced 
</p>
<p>systemic and pervasive attacks against their work, their identity and their bodies.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Concluding remarks by the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>62. Panellists agreed that gender stereotypes, prejudices and patriarchal structures 
</p>
<p>continued to have a negative impact on gender equality, and that this situation was often 
</p>
<p>exacerbated by negative portrayals of women in the media. There was a need for greater 
</p>
<p>recognition of women as important agents of change. Therefore, much remained to be done 
</p>
<p>to ensure the full and equal participation of women in power structures and decision-
</p>
<p>making bodies.  
</p>
<p>63. While welcoming measures taken by States to promote gender equality in 
</p>
<p>participation in power and decision-making, panellists emphasized that laws, policies and 
</p>
<p>plans should also be gender sensitive and be fully implemented. Special temporary 
</p>
<p>measures such as quotas were a good way to accelerate progress towards gender equality, 
</p>
<p>but must be complemented by programmes that supported and built capacities of women 
</p>
<p>with the skills and confidence needed to lead and participate effectively in decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes. 
</p>
<p>64. In this connection, panellists emphasized the crucial importance of education&#8212; 
</p>
<p>teaching girls and boys at as early an age as possible about gender equality, and 
</p>
<p>empowering young women with the tools to become the leaders of tomorrow. Confidence-
</p>
<p>building measures, such as utilizing the media, including social media, to showcase women 
</p>
<p>and girl role models, would contribute to creating greater confidence among women and 
</p>
<p>girls in their ability to be successful in all areas. Technology was also deemed of great 
</p>
<p>importance, for example in education and e-training for women, in financing through crowd 
</p>
<p>funding, and in gender-sensitive data collection.  </p>


<p>65. Other recommendations proposed by panellists included the promotion of 
</p>
<p>secularism and the establishment of mechanisms and financing to facilitate consideration of 
</p>
<p>women candidates for senior appointments in the public sector. Calls were also made to 
</p>
<p>motivate and involve men in promoting awareness of gender equality and changing 
</p>
<p>attitudes, as well as to support debates on masculinity, in order to bring about lasting 
</p>
<p>change and combat harmful gender stereotypes.  
</p>
<p>66. Panellists also emphasized the need for States to support the women&#8217;s movement, in 
</p>
<p>particular women&#8217;s associations and organizations, which were crucial in their systematic 
</p>
<p>monitoring and reporting on women&#8217;s human rights. In conclusion, the need was expressed 
</p>
<p>to more aggressively promote the beneficial role of women&#8217;s values in the business sector, 
</p>
<p>which were often neglected. This included a greater concentration on welfare within the 
</p>
<p>business community, a more consensus-based approach and a stronger inclination to search 
</p>
<p>for peaceful solutions that would benefit everyone. 
</p>
<p>67. Panellists also shared examples of good practices to promote the equal participation 
</p>
<p>of women in power and decision-making. This included public procurement policies that 
</p>
<p>provided greater opportunities for women in small and medium enterprises to thrive, as 
</p>
<p>well as the setting of targets by multinationals themselves to make their supply chains more 
</p>
<p>inclusive.  
</p>
<p>68. Other examples included moving women from the informal to the formal sector by 
</p>
<p>ensuring access to credit, reforming the taxation systems and reducing bureaucracy. 
</p>
<p>Support by countries and communities to vulnerable refugee communities, the majority of 
</p>
<p>whom were women, and efforts to connect them to markets, was highlighted as bringing 
</p>
<p>benefits to everyone.  
</p>
<p>69. Panellists also shared good practice examples, such as networking initiatives in 
</p>
<p>some Latin American countries to connect and establish relationships between civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and national human rights and women&#8217;s institutions; the establishment of 
</p>
<p>bodies to monitor the situation of women&#8217;s participation in politics; and the existence of 
</p>
<p>organizations that help finance political campaigns of women candidates who are 
</p>
<p>committed to defending the human rights of women, including their sexual and 
</p>
<p>reproductive health and rights. 
</p>
<p>70. The panel discussion provided an opportunity to consider what has been 
</p>
<p>accomplished since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and to 
</p>
<p>emphasize the international legal underpinnings of women&#8217;s equal participation in power 
</p>
<p>and decision-making in all spheres&#8212;political, economic, social and cultural. The panel was 
</p>
<p>unanimous in calling for action at all levels, from the family to the regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels. It said that States should remain committed and persist in the common 
</p>
<p>endeavour to accelerate and ensure that the targets adopted in Beijing were met. 
</p>
