<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2001, following a recommendation of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, 
in General Assembly resolution 56/138 the Secretary-General was asked to conduct an in-
depth study on the question of violence against children. In 2003, the Secretary-General 
appointed Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro as independent expert to lead the study.  
</p>
<p>2. The Secretary-General&#8217;s study on violence against children1 was presented at the 
sixty-first session of the General Assembly. It addressed violence against children in five 
settings: the family, schools, alternative care institutions and detention facilities, places 
where children work and communities. The study recognizes that violence against children 
affects every country and knows no social, cultural, religious or ethnic boundaries, 
remaining widespread, largely hidden and often condoned by society. Moreover, violence 
against children has a serious, lifelong emotional and health impact on children&#8217;s lives; it 
undermines child development and learning abilities, inhibits positive relationships, 
provokes trauma and depression and often leads to risk-taking and aggressive behaviour.  
</p>
<p>3. The study calls for urgent action to prevent and respond to all forms of violence, and 
presents a set of recommendations to guide follow-up actions. These recommendations 
provide a solid navigation chart for future steps and constitute a decisive reference for 
accelerating and monitoring progress. To promote dissemination and ensure effective 
follow-up to the study&#8217;s recommendations, the appointment of a Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on violence against children was recommended in the study.  
</p>
<p>4. The General Assembly took note with appreciation of the study&#8217;s recommendations 
and requested the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Special Representative on 
violence against children2 to act as a high-profile, global independent advocate to promote 
prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Appointment of the Special Representative on violence 
against children 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 1 May 2009, the Secretary-General announced the appointment of Marta Santos 
Pais of Portugal as his Special Representative on violence against children at the level of 
Assistant Secretary-General. Ms. Santos Pais took her position on 1 September 2009. 
</p>
<p>6. According to the terms of reference approved in compliance with General Assembly 
resolution 62/141, the Special Representative reports directly to the Secretary-General, 
chairs the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Children and 
collaborates closely with a wide range of partners, within and beyond the United Nations 
system. The Special Representative reports annually to the General Assembly, the Human 
Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council. 
</p>
<p>7. In conformity with the General Assembly resolution, the position of the Special 
Representative and the supporting Office are funded from voluntary contributions. The 
mandate was established for a period of three years, after which time it should be evaluated, 
including with regard to its funding. The Office of the Special Representative is located in 
New York and provided with administrative support by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF). UNICEF has established a trust account in order to receive, hold, administer

<p>and disburse financial contributions provided to fund the operation of the Office of the 
Special Representative, including payment for personnel costs.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Mandate of the Special Representative on violence against 
children 
</b></p>
<p>8. According to General Assembly resolution 62/141, the Special Representative on 
violence against children will: 
</p>
<p> (a) Promote the wide dissemination of the United Nations study on violence 
against children and advance the follow-up to its recommendations; 
</p>
<p> (b) Identify and share good practices and promote cross-fertilization of 
experiences between actors, and across regions and sectors; 
</p>
<p> (c) Assist States in their efforts to prevent and respond to all forms of violence 
against children, particularly to promote a gender perspective and the participation of 
children, and ensure: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of a comprehensive national strategy, policy or plan of 
action on violence against children, integrated into the national planning 
process, with realistic, time-bound targets, well resourced, coordinated by an 
agency with the capacity to involve multiple sectors and systematically 
evaluated; the adoption of national legislative and other measures to prohibit 
and eliminate all forms of violence against children, in all settings 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The development of national research and the consolidation of data 
collection, analysis and dissemination systems to inform effective action, 
mobilize adequate resources and assess progress achieved 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The investment in the prevention of violence with the consideration of its 
underlying causes and risk factors 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The promotion of non-violent values and awareness-raising activities to 
overcome the invisibility and social acceptance of violence against children, 
support the abandonment of harmful practices and promote positive forms of 
discipline and child development approaches 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The protection of children from violence by those who work with and for 
children, including through the development of systematic education and 
training programmes, and the promotion of codes of conduct and clear 
standards of practice 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The provision of accessible, child-sensitive and universal health and social 
services to ensure children&#8217;s recovery and reintegration 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The establishment of safe, well-publicized, confidential and accessible 
mechanisms to enable reporting of violence against children and the filing of 
complaints 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption of measures to fight impunity, including through the 
investigation and prosecution of violence against children and the imposition 
of appropriate penalties 
</p>
<p>9. To move this process forward, the Special Representative on violence against 
children will act as an independent voice and a global advocate, keeping violence 
prevention and the protection of children from all forms of violence high on the 
international agenda, and as a bridge-builder and a catalyst of actions in all regions and in </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p>all settings where violence against children may occur; she will promote information-
sharing and cross-fertilization of experiences, stimulating evidence-based approaches to 
preventing violence and safeguarding the right of each child to freedom from violence.  
</p>
<p>10. The mandate of the Special Representative builds upon developments in public 
health and child protection and envisages the protection of children from violence as a 
human rights imperative. Indeed, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other 
international human rights instruments provide a firm normative foundation for the 
prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against children. They are an indicator 
of genuine national commitment to respecting the human dignity of the child at all times; 
addressing risk factors that compromise children&#8217;s development and citizenship; investing 
in the social inclusion of the most vulnerable; and promoting actions that build upon 
children&#8217;s best interests, perspectives and experiences. International human rights standards 
also provide a sound framework for mainstreaming the protection of children from violence 
in the national policy agenda, helping to avoid fragmented, diluted or simply reactive 
solutions and influencing lasting change through national implementation informed by 
good practices and lessons learned.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Representative will carry out her mandate by making use of mutually 
supportive strategies, including the promotion of advocacy for concerns related to violence 
against children; the contribution to strategic meetings at the international, regional and 
national levels, including for the identification of good practices and the promotion of 
cross-fertilization of experiences across regions, sectors and settings; the organization of 
field missions; and the promotion of thematic studies and reports. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Priority focus for the mandate: a strategic agenda, solid 
partnerships and firm support 
</b></p>
<p>12. The protection of children from violence calls for urgent action. Violence is a harsh 
reality for millions of children around the world; it remains largely invisible and socially 
accepted, and it has dramatic and lifelong consequences on children&#8217;s life and development, 
carrying with it serious social costs.  
</p>
<p>13. Guided by this sense of urgency and the need to accelerate progress in key strategic 
areas, over the period of three years foreseen for her mandate, the Special Representative 
will place a priority focus on: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Promoting a strategic agenda, building upon the recommendations of the United 
Nations study on violence against children  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Strengthening key partnerships to achieve progress in the follow-up to the study 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Securing firm support, including sound funding to promote progress in violence 
prevention and in the protection of children from all forms of violence 
</p>
<p><b> A. Promoting a strategic agenda 
</b></p>
<p>14. The 12 overarching recommendations of the study provide a navigation chart for 
accelerating and monitoring progress in violence prevention and responses, in all settings 
where children may be at risk. In view of the particular urgency, the study identified time-
bound targets for three strategic overarching recommendations. These areas remain critical 
and require renewed and firm attention at all levels. For this reason, in the broad framework 
of the study&#8217;s recommendations, the Special Representative will give priority attention to 
initiatives aimed at: </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; The development in each State of a national comprehensive strategy to prevent and 
respond to all forms of violence, mainstreamed in the national planning process, 
coordinated by a high-level focal point with leading responsibilities in this area, 
supported by adequate human and financial resources to support implementation and 
effectively evaluated 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The introduction of an explicit national legal ban on all forms of violence against 
children, in all settings  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The promotion of a national system of data collection, analysis and dissemination, 
and a research agenda on violence against children 
</p>
<p><b> B. Consolidating strategic partnerships 
</b></p>
<p>15. The process of development of the study generated solid and strategic alliances, 
within and beyond the United Nations system, in favour of the protection of children from 
all forms of violence. To advance in this field, strengthened partnerships will be crucial. 
The Special Representative will therefore promote enhanced collaboration with key 
partners, including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and 
armed conflict, United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, human rights 
treaty bodies and mechanisms, national governments, regional organizations, 
parliamentarians, national independent institutions on children&#8217;s rights, and civil society, 
including children and young people.  
</p>
<p>16. Relevant institutional collaboration mechanisms already in place, such as the Inter-
Agency Working Group on Violence against Children and the NGO Advisory Council for 
follow-up to the study, will provide a robust framework to move this process forward 
through an effective consultative approach.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Securing firm support 
</b></p>
<p>17. Sound support and predictable funding are indispensable for the effective and 
independent performance of the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate. In this regard, the 
General Assembly has called upon States and institutions concerned, United Nations 
agencies and entities, regional and civil society organizations, and the private sector to 
provide support, including financial. Voluntary contributions in support of the mandate and 
the Office of the Special Representative are channelled through a trust account which has 
been set up and is administered by UNICEF in order to receive, hold, administer and 
disburse financial contributions provided for the mandate, including payment for personnel 
costs.  
</p>
<p>18. By December 2009, initial contributions had been received. Although such positive 
developments are welcome, additional secure funding is required to enable the Special 
Representative to effectively pursue her role as a global advocate for violence prevention 
and the protection of children from all forms of violence.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p><b> V. Cooperation with key partners 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation with the United Nations system, in particular with the 
Special Representative for children and armed conflict and members of 
the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Children 
</b></p>
<p>19. Since the start of her mandate, the Special Representative has given very high 
priority to the promotion of enhanced synergies with United Nations partners in the area of 
violence against children.  
</p>
<p>20. Strong cooperation has been developed with the Special Representative for children 
and armed conflict. Regular meetings are held to exchange information and discuss areas 
for a mutually supportive collaboration, including in the promotion of joint initiatives and 
missions, and the consideration of joint advocacy and awareness-raising activities for the 
protection of children&#8217;s rights. In this regard, the joint participation in international 
conferences of relevance for both mandates was particularly valuable. Strategic 
opportunities will continue to be considered for enhancing further this critical collaboration 
around the strong human rights foundation shared by both mandates, including in the 
context of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the two Optional Protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 2010.  
</p>
<p>21. In her collaboration with United Nations organizations, the Special Representative 
on violence against children has built upon existing inter-agency structures and 
mechanisms, in particular the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Children, 
of which the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are core members. The Inter-
Agency Working Group is a critical forum for consultation, promotion of policy 
formulation and mainstreaming of concerns related to violence against children within the 
United Nations system&#8217;s agenda.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Representative has maintained very close cooperation with the core 
members of the Working Group, having held important bilateral discussions and a working-
level meeting of the Inter-Agency Working Group in Geneva. The Special Representative 
welcomes the critical advice received and the support provided, which have been of 
decisive relevance for the shaping of her mandate and the missions she has conducted.  
</p>
<p>23. UNICEF provides administrative support to the Office of the Special Representative 
and has established a trust fund for the financial contributions provided in support of the 
Special Representative&#8217;s mandate. Protection of children from violence is a key dimension 
of the UNICEF mandate and, as noted in the sections above, the Special Representative has 
been associated with important initiatives promoted by that organization.  
</p>
<p>24. In the framework of its 2008 Child Protection Strategy, UNICEF supports the 
follow-up to the United Nations study by strengthening child protection systems and 
promoting social change in attitudes and behaviours towards children. The Special 
Representative participated in important discussions on the implementation of the UNICEF 
strategy and its focus on the protection of children from violence, at headquarters and in the 
Middle East and North Africa and in the Latin America and Caribbean regions. She has 
made significant inroads into collaborating with UNICEF on child protection, having 
initiated discussions with the child protection unit in UNICEF and the Special 
Representative for children and armed conflict to enhance synergies and promote 
complementary work in areas falling within her mandate.  </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>25. UNICEF is engaged in a number of initiatives to strengthen the evidence base 
concerning the nature and scope of violence against children, and consolidate efforts for the 
collection of reliable data and the development of research on violence against children, 
including on harmful practices. UNICEF launched in October 2009 a new publication, 
<i>Progress for Children: a Report Card on Child Protection</i>,3 which gathers significant data 
on a range of areas on violence against children, helping to overcome the invisibility of 
children&#8217;s suffering and better inform policies and actions to prevent and combat violence. 
The Special Representative was associated with the dissemination of this important report 
which addresses a priority dimension of her mandate.  
</p>
<p>26. Sexual violence against children, and particularly against girls, has been a topic 
which has received increased attention. Building upon a national study on violence against 
children undertaken in Swaziland in 2007 and supported by the Clinton Global Initiative, 
UNICEF has joined WHO, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women, together with the United States Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, in a strong partnership to promote similar research in other countries and 
provide support for the strengthening of an environment protecting girls against sexual 
violence. This is a significant initiative that the Special Representative will continue to 
follow closely and which is expected to lead to important results in violence prevention and 
protection from violence. 
</p>
<p>27. OHCHR plays a decisive role in the process of implementation of the United 
Nations study&#8217;s recommendations and its advice and support have continued to be critical 
during the initial phase of the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate. Since 2007, OHCHR has 
established a focal point on violence against children in order to provide support to the 
follow-up to the study. Since the appointment of the Special Representative, OHCHR has 
continued to provide substantive support to her mandate. The Office helps ensure that the 
theme of violence against children is mainstreamed across the organization and given 
specific attention at all levels.  
</p>
<p>28. OHCHR supported the organization in Geneva of the Special Representative&#8217;s 
meetings with members of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Children, 
with human rights treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and 
with special procedures of the Human Rights Council.4 The Office also assisted in the 
organization of meetings with members of the NGO Advisory Council and other civil 
society partners. 
</p>
<p>29. At the invitation of OHCHR, the Special Representative participated in December 
2009 in the Human Rights Council&#8217;s open-ended working group on an optional protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure. In her 
contribution, the Special Representative recalled the recommendations of the United 
Nations study, in particular the call it had made for the establishment of effective and 
independent complaints, investigation and enforcement mechanisms to deal with cases of 
violence and emphasized the relevance of a communications procedure for the protection of 
children from all forms of violence.  
</p>
<p>30. Cooperation with OHCHR will remain high on the Special Representative&#8217;s agenda 
and critical for consolidating the human rights foundation of her mandate and advancing the 
implementation of the agenda on violence against children.  
</p>
<p>31. WHO was an active supporter of the development of the United Nations study and 
remains a critical partner in the process of follow-up. The organization&#8217;s contribution to the

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p>initiative to prevent sexual violence against girls, mentioned above, is a meaningful 
illustration of such steady commitment.  
</p>
<p>32. Violence prevention and the promotion of sound evidence, two priority areas 
addressed by the study&#8217;s recommendations, are high on the WHO agenda. These 
dimensions gained centre stage at the Fourth Milestones of a Global Campaign for Violence 
Prevention meeting, organized in September 2009 in Geneva, in which the Special 
Representative participated.   
</p>
<p>33. The Fourth Milestones meeting was devoted to &#8220;Boosting global violence 
prevention&#8221; and drew high-level participation and expertise from across regions. Those 
attending the meeting benefited from hearing about new evidence on effective interventions 
to prevent interpersonal violence and reflected on lessons from a wide range of country-
level initiatives, which provided inspiring examples of data-driven and evidence-based 
violence prevention in action.  
</p>
<p>34. In the discussions, which gave particular attention to the protection of children from 
violence, including child maltreatment and its underlying causes, special emphasis was 
placed on strategies aimed at developing safe, stable and nurturing relationships between 
children and their parents and caregivers; promoting life skills for children and adolescents; 
reducing the availability and harmful use of alcohol, and access to guns and knives; 
promoting gender equality, change of cultural and social norms that support violence and 
victim identification, care and support programmes. Advancing work in these areas will 
remain a key dimension of the Special Representative&#8217;s cooperation with WHO.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Representative developed a fruitful collaboration with ILO, particularly 
with regard to the protection of children from violence in the workplace and in other 
labour-related activities. Important opportunities are expected for strengthening 
collaboration in support of the implementation of the study&#8217;s recommendations, including 
through advocacy, the consolidation of data and research and relevant standard-setting 
activities. In 2010, a global conference will be held on child labour in The Hague to mark 
the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of ILO Convention No. 182 concerning the 
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
and accelerate progress towards its global elimination target by 2016. The conference will 
promote universal ratification of relevant ILO standards.  
</p>
<p>36. In 2010, the ILO will also release new global estimates on child labour which will 
help to consolidate evidence to inform policies and promote progress in this area. 
Following a 2008 decision by its Governing Body, ILO is also currently engaged in the 
consideration of new standards on decent work for domestic workers, which will open up 
avenues for improving the protection of children from exploitation in domestic service and 
any form of violence associated therewith. Indeed, child domestic workers, especially girls, 
are highly vulnerable to violence; working in private households, in many instances away 
from their home, and behind closed doors, with little or no protection or social support, they 
are exposed to excessive hours of work, hazardous tasks, discrimination, social stigma, 
physical, psychological and emotional violence, sexual abuse, and lack of engagement in 
community and social life. These significant initiatives provide a sound framework for 
strengthening this important partnership further.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with human rights treaty bodies and mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>37. The development of close collaboration with human rights bodies and mechanisms 
is an essential component of the Special Representative&#8217;s agenda. This cooperation is 
critical in pursuing an integrated approach to children&#8217;s protection from violence and 
capitalizing on synergies across mandates, in the overall framework of the implementation </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>of children&#8217;s rights standards and commitments to children, including those undertaken at 
the Millennium Summit, the Special Session on Children and, more recently, the Third 
World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents. The call for 
action issued as part of the Congress highlights the importance of close cooperation 
between mandate holders, and its agenda provides a valuable framework for mutually 
supportive actions and accelerated progress towards the achievement of the time-bound 
targets agreed upon at the Congress; these targets are also of strategic relevance to the 
process of follow-up to the study&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Against this background, the Special Representative&#8217;s cooperation with the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child gains crucial relevance. The United Nations study 
was developed at the request of the Committee and is very strongly grounded in its work 
and jurisprudence on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 
Committee has devoted special attention to violence against children, including in thematic 
debates, general comments and during the consideration of States parties&#8217; reports. At 
present, all concluding observations include a specific section on the follow-up to the 
study&#8217;s recommendations and on cooperation with the Special Representative.  
</p>
<p>39. The Committee&#8217;s role is particularly valuable to the Special Representative&#8217;s 
mandate, helping to inform advocacy initiatives, assess progress on the protection of 
children from all forms of violence and support countries in their efforts. For this reason, 
the Special Representative met the Committee soon after her appointment and has 
developed very fruitful collaboration with it through regular meetings, exchanges of 
information and through joint participation in strategic events and initiatives within and 
beyond the United Nations system at the global, regional and national levels. Cooperation 
with the Committee, and other treaty bodies, will remain high on the Special 
Representative&#8217;s agenda.  
</p>
<p>40. Collaboration with special procedures of the Human Rights Council has been 
equally important. The Special Representative&#8217;s participation, soon after her appointment, 
in their sixteenth annual meeting in 20095 was particularly useful in promoting the sharing 
of information, the identification of good practices and the cross-fertilization of 
experiences, as well as in prompting the consideration of mutually supportive activities for 
violence prevention and elimination. 
</p>
<p>41. As a cross-cutting issue, working to eliminate violence against children opens up 
avenues for developing partnerships across mandates &#8212; including child-related mandates 
&#8212; through cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery and, in 
particular, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, with whom regular meetings have been held to exchange information and 
strengthen collaboration. Similarly, cooperation will be valuable with violence-related 
mandates, including on violence against women and torture; with economic, social and 
cultural rights-related mandates, to help address the root causes of violence; as well as with 
others, such as those mandates on the rights to education, freedom of opinion and 
expression that can help to empower children and young people, enhance prevention efforts 
and consolidate a culture of respect for children&#8217;s rights in society. These are important 
partnerships that the Special Representative will continue to promote.

</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with civil society, including children and young people 
</b></p>
<p>42. When the study was being developed, strong support was received from civil society 
organizations and a decisive contribution from children and young people. Both groups 
remain active partners in the process of implementation of the study&#8217;s recommendations.  
</p>
<p>43. As highlighted in previous sections of this report, the Special Representative 
promotes mutually supportive collaboration with civil society. This cooperation has been 
facilitated by the establishment, in 2007, of the NGO Advisory Council, which was formed 
to support strong and effective follow-up to the study. The Council has equal representation 
from leading international organizations and national and regional NGOs, and its primary 
aim is to encourage and maintain NGO involvement at national, regional and international 
levels, in advocacy with Governments, United Nations agencies and other stakeholders for 
full implementation of the study&#8217;s recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Representative met with the NGO Advisory Council in early October 
2009 in New York. The meeting helped to shed light on strategic areas where progress can 
be further achieved and identify significant opportunities for fruitful cooperation in the 
follow-up to the study&#8217;s recommendations at the global, regional and national levels and 
across the various settings within which violence against children continues to take place; 
these areas and opportunities include the adoption of national plans of action to advance 
implementation of the study&#8217;s recommendations, the legal prohibition of all forms of 
violence against children in all settings, the collection and dissemination of disaggregated 
data on violence against children and the establishment of effective and accessible 
complaint mechanisms for children. The meeting also considered ways of enhancing 
children&#8217;s participation in the follow-up to the study, benefiting from their insights and 
experience, and mobilizing and empowering them to take action in their own communities.  
</p>
<p>45. With the same aim, the Special Representative met in Geneva with the NGO Group 
for the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Working Group on Children and 
Violence, which highlighted the importance of pursuing strong collaboration with human 
rights bodies and mechanisms, in particular the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Representative also held important discussions at the regional level with 
NGO partners and with child-led organizations to consider ways of further consolidating 
action in violence prevention and responses. This cooperation will continue to be actively 
pursued in the framework of the Special Representative&#8217;s agenda. 
</p>
<p>47. Over recent years, the participation of children and young people in the promotion 
of actions to address violence against children has been significant. Their contribution to 
the study was essential and their involvement continues to be critical for the steps ahead.  
</p>
<p>48. As noted in the sections above, during the initial period of her mandate, the Special 
Representative has reached out to children and young people in a number of meetings and 
discussions held at global, regional and national levels. Across the regions, children express 
strong concern at the incidence of violence; they inspire a deep sense of urgency, and their 
views and recommendations help to refine the effectiveness of actions taken, including by 
helping to improve understanding of the hidden face of violence, raise awareness and 
promote advocacy on positive initiatives, and support the development of child-sensitive 
policies and mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>49. Dialogue and regular consultations with children and young people will remain a 
core component of the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate. In this regard, the Special 
Representative welcomes the adoption by the Committee on the Rights of the Child of its 
general comment No. 12 on the right of the child to be heard, which, as acknowledged by 
General Assembly resolution A/RES/64/146, will be a valuable reference for the </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>contribution of children and young people to the process of follow-up to the study and for 
informing them about developments in this area.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Key developments and initiatives promoted 
</b></p>
<p>50. Framed by the priority agenda identified above, during the initial months of her 
mandate, between early September 2009 and the submission of the present report, the 
Special Representative devoted particular attention to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Global advocacy initiatives to promote the further dissemination of the study and 
encourage follow-up to its recommendations at the international, regional and 
national levels  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The consolidation of strategic partnerships, including through the Special 
Representative&#8217;s contribution to high-level meetings with key actors, and the 
strengthening of institutional collaboration with international and regional 
organizations 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption of measures for the establishment of her Office in support of her 
mandate 
</p>
<p>51. Recognizing the critical contribution of legislation to protecting children from all 
forms of violence, and benefiting from the special attention given to this topic during the 
commemorative events of the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Special Representative placed a particular emphasis in her advocacy work on the 
adoption of a legal ban on all forms of violence against children. 
</p>
<p>52. Significant legal reforms have been introduced in recent years in different regions to 
prohibit violence against children. At present, some 25 countries have enacted laws to 
prohibit all forms of violence in all settings, and more than 20 others are working towards 
the same end. Several States have reinforced their legislation to address specific forms of 
violence, including violence in schools, trafficking and sexual exploitation, and harmful 
practices such as female genital mutilation and early and forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>53. The legal prohibition of violence against children is important, as it conveys a clear 
message of political commitment to prevention work and the use of non-violent alternatives 
for conflict resolution. It constitutes a vital safeguard for child victims and witnesses, being 
a strong reference for capacity-building initiatives and the development of guidance and 
codes of conduct for professionals working with and for children. Law reform gains 
renewed value when used in support of public information and awareness-raising activities, 
and for promoting positive discipline, social mobilization and behaviour change. When 
harmful practices persist behind deeply entrenched traditions, legal reform has been 
particularly useful when promoted with the involvement of community and religious 
leaders, parliamentarians, professional associations, academic institutions and grass-roots 
organizations, and with the engagement of communities concerned. Bridging international 
standards, policy action and local values, and motivating change from within, legislation 
has been supported as the fruit of true conviction, gaining traction as a genuine deterrent 
with preventive effect.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Address to the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>54. In her address to the Third Committee at the sixty-fourth session of the General 
Assembly, the Special Representative reaffirmed the human rights foundation of the 
protection of children from all forms of violence, recalled the framework provided by the 
study and its recommendations for her mandate and presented the key priority areas for her </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p>work, namely the adoption of an explicit national legal ban on all forms of violence against 
children, the development of a national strategy to prevent and respond to violence against 
children, and the consolidation of research and data systems in this area. The positive 
feedback received from Member States at such an early stage of the mandate was critical to 
shaping the work ahead and opened up avenues for a fruitful collaboration with 
Governments across regions.  
</p>
<p>55. During the General Assembly&#8217;s session, the Special Representative also participated 
in two high-level side events devoted to the gender dimension of violence against children 
and the participation of children in decision-making, respectively. The first event &#8212; a 
ministerial breakfast meeting jointly organized by the Governments of Brazil, the 
Netherlands and the United States of America and in which heads of United Nations 
agencies and ministerial representatives from a large number of countries participated &#8212; 
raised the importance of combating violence against girls as part of the international 
agenda, promoted international cooperation in this area and supported child and youth 
participation in the developing policies concerning girls. At the meeting, commitment to the 
Special Representative&#8217;s role was expressed and countries were encouraged to implement 
policies and programmes for the elimination of all violence against children, with a 
particular focus on girls.  
</p>
<p>56. The second event, an interactive panel on child participation, was organized by the 
Governments of Belize, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Uruguay, in cooperation with 
UNICEF, Plan International, Save the Children and War Child Holland. The meeting was 
informed by the active contribution of young people from Ghana, Honduras, Norway and 
the United States and moderated by Ishmael Beah, UNICEF Advocate for Children 
Affected by War. At the meeting, it was recalled that children and young people had made 
a critical contribution to the study and stressed that child participation continued to play an 
essential role in the process of follow-up and in support of the Special Representative&#8217;s 
mandate, particularly in support of awareness-raising activities, peer education and the 
promotion of child-sensitive counselling and reporting mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with intergovernmental and regional organizations and 
institutions 
</b></p>
<p>57. Violence against children is gaining attention at the regional level. Regional 
cooperation helps to capitalize on the potential offered by States in each individual region, 
while promoting the development of strategies tailored to the national context and 
enhancing opportunities to mainstream universal values and shared commitments. 
</p>
<p>58. The widely participatory regional consultations organized in support of the study 
and the preparations for the Third World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children 
in Brazil were instrumental in generating interest in and commitment to the elimination of 
violence in its many forms. In some regions, a regional follow-up mechanism was set up to 
facilitate coordination of efforts and help to advance implementation of the study&#8217;s 
recommendations. Building upon these significant developments, the Special 
Representative gave particular attention to strengthening institutional collaboration with 
regional forums, helping promote information-sharing and cross-fertilization of 
experiences, scale up positive initiatives, encourage evidence-based approaches to 
overcome prevailing challenges and influence progress within and across regions.  
</p>
<p>59. With this aim, in the course of the initial months of her mandate, the Special 
Representative took part in strategic high-level regional conferences and promoted 
cooperation with regional institutions. Strengthening and expanding partnerships with 
regional organizations and institutions will remain a priority dimension of her mandate.  </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Participation in the twentieth Pan-American Congress on Children and Adolescents 
</b></p>
<p>60. In September 2009, the Special Representative participated in the twentieth Pan-
American Congress on Children and Adolescents organized by the Organization of 
American States and the Inter-American Children&#8217;s Institute and hosted in Lima by the 
Government of Peru. With high-level participants from the Organization&#8217;s member States, 
as well as from national independent institutions for children&#8217;s rights, non-governmental 
organizations and academics from the Americas, the Congress was held in commemoration 
of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and of the eighth anniversary of the Inter-American Children&#8217;s Institute. Great attention 
was devoted to investment in public policies for the realization of children&#8217;s rights, 
including the protection of children from violence. Violence against children was centre 
stage in the official sessions and the formal dialogue between ministers and high 
authorities, and the Special Representative and the Rapporteur on the Rights of the Child of 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Professor Paulo Sergio Pinheiro.  
</p>
<p>61. The Congress was a strategic forum to promote and review progress in the Americas 
on follow-up to the recommendations of the study, and to launch the report on corporal 
punishment and human rights of children and adolescents, recently issued by the Office of 
the Rapporteur on the Rights of the Child of the Inter-American Commission.6 This 
important report builds upon the United Nations study and calls on member States of the 
Organization of American States to place explicit and absolute legal bans on the use of 
corporal punishment in all settings; adopt preventive, educational, and other measures to 
ensure the eradication of this form of violence and promote positive and non-violent 
alternatives; and make the Americas a region free of child corporal punishment by 2011. 
</p>
<p>62. The Pan-American Congress was preceded by a civil society forum and included, for 
the first time, a Pan-American Forum on Children and Adolescents. The Children&#8217;s Forum 
helped to place the question of child participation high on the agenda for the Congress, 
showing young participants&#8217; crucial capacity to identify concerns and anticipate solutions to 
address them. Violence against children was a key topic discussed by the young 
participants who also identified this phenomenon as their most pressing concern.  
</p>
<p>63. The Congress laid the ground for a solid future institutional collaboration with 
regional forums and institutions in the Americas, including the Inter-American Children&#8217;s 
Institute and, particularly, the Rapporteur on the Rights of the Child of the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, with whom a strategic framework of cooperation was 
developed for the protection of children from all forms of violence.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional meeting on the role of parliamentarians in preventing and eliminating 
violence against children 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Congress followed an important regional meeting on the role of 
parliamentarians to prevent and eliminate violence against children, hosted by the National 
Assembly of Costa Rica and supported by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UNICEF. 
Representatives from national parliaments adopted strong recommendations for national 
follow-up to the United Nations study, including by holding parliamentarian sessions to 
monitor and advance follow-up to the study&#8217;s recommendations, promoting law reform to 
introduce an explicit ban on all forms of violence against children, and ensuring adequate 
resource allocation for child-related public policies. 
</p>
<p>65. The key dimensions addressed by the meeting in Costa Rica were raised by the 
Special Representative in her official meetings with parliamentarians in the region,

</p>
<p>including the President of the Congress of Peru. These dimensions constitute establishing a 
core agenda which will be pursued across regions in close collaboration with the Inter-
Parliamentary Union and UNICEF. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Cooperation with the Latin American and Caribbean Chapter of the Global 
Movement for Children 
</b></p>
<p>66. Decisive steps were also taken to consolidate regional collaboration and agree on a 
strategic action plan on violence against children with the Latin American and Caribbean 
Chapter of the Global Movement for Children, in which UNICEF and key civil society 
organizations participate. In this context, the Special Representative held an important 
planning meeting in Panama with members of the Movement, the Rapporteur on the Rights 
of the Child of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and representatives of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child and OHCHR. As a key outcome from the 
meeting, it was agreed to pursue, over the next three years, implementation of the 
recommendations of the study with particular emphasis on the adoption of legislation to 
prohibit all forms of violence against children; the development of a comprehensive, well-
coordinated and well-resourced national strategy, and the consolidation of research and data 
systems in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Participation in the Cairo Conference on the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and Islamic Jurisprudence, co-sponsored by the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference and UNICEF 
</b></p>
<p>67. In November 2009, the Special Representative participated in an important 
conference organized in Cairo, under the patronage of the First Lady of Egypt, to 
commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood of Egypt. 
</p>
<p>68. The meeting was co-sponsored by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) 
and UNICEF, and participants were representatives of international organizations 
(including OHCHR), the Committee on the Rights of the Child, national human rights 
institutions and NGOs and children from 10 OIC countries.  
</p>
<p>69. Through the Cairo Declaration on the Convention on the Rights of the Child and 
Islamic Jurisprudence that was adopted at the conference, participants renewed their 
commitment to the rights of the child, calling for, inter alia, greater compliance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the provision of adequate human and financial 
resources for its implementation and the establishment of effective data systems on 
children.  
</p>
<p>70. As regarded violence against children, participants expressed commitment to 
developing productive cooperation with the Special Representative and providing her with 
the necessary technical and financial support. They called on OIC member States to take all 
appropriate legislative, social and other measures for effective follow-up to the study&#8217;s 
recommendations; urgently review and reform legislation to ensure the prohibition of all 
forms of violence and the promotion of positive, non-violent forms of discipline; and, on 
the basis of positive national experiences, establish a high-level focal point to coordinate 
actions to prevent and combat violence, and develop a well-resourced national strategy on 
violence against children. Special attention was also given to prevention and protection 
from harmful practices, protection of children under occupation and in times of war and 
poverty alleviation.  
</p>
<p>71. The Cairo Declaration provides a strong platform for OIC member States and civil 
society organizations to advance the protection of children from violence and support the 
further implementation of the study&#8217;s recommendations. With its specific call for the </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>establishment of a children&#8217;s forum, it may open up new avenues for children to genuinely 
contribute to this process of follow-up and help to keep children duly informed of 
developments in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Cooperation with the African Union and the African Committee of Experts on the 
Rights and the Welfare of the Child 
</b></p>
<p>72. At the end of November 2009, the Special Representative held important meetings 
in Addis Ababa with the African Union Commissioner for Social Affairs and the 
Chairperson of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, 
with a view to exploring opportunities for collaboration in the protection of children from 
all forms of violence. Violence against children has been high on the policy agenda of the 
African region, including in the context of the implementation of the African Charter on the 
Rights and Welfare of the Child; during the drafting of the study and when the 2006 Day of 
the African Child was devoted to this topic; during the Second Pan-African Forum on 
Children, held in Cairo in 2007; and in &#8220;The Call for Accelerated Action to make Africa Fit 
for Children&#8221;, adopted thereafter. With the follow-up to the study, renewed opportunities 
exist to move this agenda forward.  
</p>
<p>73. The initial meetings held in Addis Ababa laid the ground for fruitful institutional 
collaboration, including for promoting initiatives to map out critical developments and 
positive initiatives across the region and within African Union member States, supporting 
legislative reforms aimed at protecting children from all forms of violence, encouraging the 
development of independent institutions on children&#8217;s rights, and further consolidating 
national information and data systems on violence against children. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Cooperation with the Council of Europe  
</b></p>
<p>74. In the European region, significant developments have also taken place, with 
violence against children being given increasing attention in policymaking within the 
Council of Europe and the European Union. The Special Representative developed strong 
collaboration with these institutions and took part in strategic policy forums addressing 
elements of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Representative participated in meetings which led up to the adoption of 
the Council of Europe Strategy for 2009&#8211;2011 &#8220;Building a Europe for and with Children&#8221;, 
which identifies the protection of children from violence as a key priority concern. Under 
the strategy, the Council acts as the regional initiator and coordinator of national and 
regional initiatives to combat violence against children, and as the European forum for 
follow-up to the recommendations contained in the United Nations study and cooperation 
with the Special Representative.  
</p>
<p>76. Important regional standards and initiatives provide a framework for the protection 
of children from violence. To support progress in this area, the Council of Europe 
organized a conference in Strasbourg to establish a children&#8217;s rights platform with national 
focal points from countries across the region and a network of experts from key partner 
organizations. The Special Representative participated in this high-level policy forum, 
which will play a crucial role in the promotion of information-sharing, advocacy and 
debate, and monitor progress achieved within the European region.  
</p>
<p>77. Moreover, in November 2009, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe 
adopted policy guidelines on integrated national strategies for the protection of children 
against violence to guide national efforts for the development of a comprehensive national 
agenda for violence prevention and the protection of children from all forms of violence. 
The Special Representative participated in the process leading to the adoption of the </p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10640 
</p>
<p>guidelines and will collaborate with the Council of Europe in advancing implementation 
thereof. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Cooperation with the European Union 
</b></p>
<p>78. Violence against children is high in the policy agenda of the European Union and 
has been identified in a recent survey as a priority concern for young people within the 27 
member States. The Special Representative participated in two high-level European Union 
conferences held under the Swedish Presidency of the European Union and devoted to the 
protection of children from violence, namely the European Union-NGO Forum on Human 
Rights and the high-level meeting of the Permanent Intergovernmental Group &#8220;L&#8217;Europe de 
l&#8217;Enfance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>79. Key recommendations from the meetings call for a strong partnership to be 
established with the Special Representative and support to be given to her Office; in the 
recommendations, the need to pursue active implementation of the United Nations study&#8217;s 
recommendations is recognized, including legal reforms to prohibit all forms of violence, 
the promotion of research incorporating children&#8217;s own experiences and perspectives; the 
development of independent children&#8217;s rights institutions and the establishment of effective 
complaints mechanisms; and the use of development assistance programmes and funding 
mechanisms to support these efforts. The Special Representative also pursued discussions 
with the representatives of the European Union on the implementation of its 2007 
Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child, which include a 
specific implementation strategy on violence against children that draws on the study&#8217;s 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>80. With the recent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon &#8212; which explicitly 
identifies children&#8217;s rights as a key dimension of the European Union&#8217;s agenda &#8212; the 
protection of children from violence is expected to gain increasing attention, opening up 
avenues for accelerated action in follow-up to the study. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Cooperation with policymakers, experts and researchers in support of an evidence-
based agenda 
</b></p>
<p>81. One key overarching recommendation contained in the United Nations study 
highlights the importance of national improvements in child data systems and the 
development of a national research agenda to address violence against children. Violence 
against children is an area where available information is limited and difficult to gather, 
reflecting the tip of the iceberg and failing to capture the true scale and extent of this 
phenomenon in society. Overall, monitoring systems are weak, while research remains 
scattered and of widely differing quality. 
</p>
<p>82. To promote progress in this area, in November 2009 in Addis Ababa, the Special 
Representative participated in the Global Conference on Research and Child Rights 
organized by the Childwatch International Research Network, the African Child Policy 
Forum and the UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre, in cooperation with the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>83. The conference brought together an eminent group of government representatives, 
policymakers, experts and researchers committed to the protection of children&#8217;s rights 
through evidence-based analysis, advocacy and public policies.  
</p>
<p>84. Violence against children was high on the agenda of the conference. Discussions 
highlighted the role of sound data, analysis and research in supporting follow-up to the 
study. In particular, the relevance was highlighted of such discussions to the development 
of national comprehensive strategies and the promotion of legal reforms, the breaking of </p>


<p>GE.10-10640 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>the silence around sensitive questions, understanding of risk factors and vulnerabilities and 
effective investment in violence prevention. 
</p>
<p>85. Cooperation with academics and research institutions will continue to be given 
special attention, with a view to consolidating progress in areas covered by the study, and 
understanding and addressing emerging concerns. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions 
</b>86.<b> In the light of relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council 
resolutions, the mandate of the Special Representative on violence against children is 
anchored by the United Nations study on violence against children and aims to 
promote progress in the follow-up to the study&#8217;s recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The study helped to challenge the acceptance of violence against children, 
highlighting that no violence against children is justifiable and all violence can be 
effectively prevented. With its action-oriented recommendations, the study has shaped 
a strategic agenda to consolidate the protection of children from all forms of violence 
in all settings.  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Within and across borders, it is essential to maintain momentum around this 
agenda; increase visibility and generate renewed concern at the harmful effects of 
violence on children; promote behavioural and social change; mobilize political and 
financial support to prevent and combat this phenomenon; and achieve steady 
progress along the way.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> This initial report of the Special Representative reaffirms the human rights 
foundation of her mandate and the significant developments in public health and child 
protection which will support its implementation. The report sets out the strategic 
direction that the Special Representative proposes to pursue during her mandate. This 
approach was informed by a wide range of meetings and consultations with key 
stakeholders at the global, regional and national levels that the Special Representative 
has held over the months since she took up her position. These include Governments 
and intergovernmental organizations; United Nations partners, including the Special 
Representative on children and armed conflict; United Nations agencies, in particular 
the core members of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence against Children; 
human rights bodies and mechanisms; civil society organizations; and children and 
young people.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> With this in mind, in the immediate future, the Special Representative will give 
attention to progress in three key areas as a priority, namely the development in each 
State of a comprehensive strategy on violence prevention and response; the 
introduction of an explicit national legal ban on all forms of violence against children; 
and the consolidation of national data systems and research in this field. Moreover, 
the Special Representative will pursue efforts to widen and further strengthen 
partnerships with key stakeholders, within and beyond the United Nations system, as 
well as secure firm support including adequate resources for her mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Special Representative looks forward to developing close collaboration 
with the Human Rights Council in the performance of her mandate aimed at the 
protection of children from all forms of violence in all settings.
