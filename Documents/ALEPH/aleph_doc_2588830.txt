<b>Endeavour Silver Reports Financial Results for Second Quarter, 2016; 
Conference Call at 10am PDT (1pm EDT) Today</b>
<p>
VANCOUVER, BC -- (Marketwired - August 03, 2016) - Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:
EXK) (TSX: EDR) released today its financial results for the second quarter 
ended June 30, 2016. Endeavour owns and operates three underground silver-gold 
mines in Mexico: the Guanacevi mine in Durango state, and the Bolanitos and El 
Cubo mines in Guanajuato state.
</p>
<p>
(Please click here for an audio review of Q2 highlights).
</p>
<p>
The Company's financial performance in the Second Quarter, 2016 improved 
compared to the Second Quarter, 2015. Revenues were down due to lower silver 
production and lower silver prices, but earnings were up as a result of lower 
operating costs. Management successfully strengthened the balance sheet over the
past six months through two ATM equity offerings and improved free cash flow.
</p>
<p>

    are non-IFRS measures. Please refer to the definitions in the Company's
    Management Discussion & Analysis
</pre>
<p>
Endeavour CEO Bradford Cooke commented, "Having successfully minimized our all-
in sustaining costs and boosted our free cash flows in recent quarters, 
management returned its attention to optimizing near-term production and long-
term growth in Q2, 2016. Our production is well ahead of plan for the year and 
as a result, we revised our operating plan and raised our production guidance by
about 13% for 2016.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to the turn-around in precious metal prices, we were able to 
substantially boost our cash and working capital and return some of our focus to
exploration, development and acquisitions. Endeavour made its first acquisition 
in four years with the purchase of Oro Silver and its high quality El Compas 
gold-silver project in Zacatecas. We also sampled several new high grade veins 
at Terronera.
</p>
<p>
"Upcoming catalysts for the second half of 2016 include permitting a new mine at
Guanacevi, developing a new ore-body at Bolanitos, evaluating a production ramp-
up at El Cubo, exploration results across all projects, advancing updated 
resource estimates and engineering studies at Terronera and El Compas, and 
adding to our land position in Zacatecas."
</p>
<p>
Operations Update, Revised Operating Plan
</p>
<p>
At Guanacevi, throughput of 1,085 tonnes per day (tpd) in Q2, 2016 lagged behind
plan as the new mining contractor focused on mine development in order to 
provide better stope access in H2, 2016. Ore grades were lower and metal
recoveries were higher compared to Q1, 2016. Management expects production to 
meet the low range of 2016 production guidance.
</p>
<p>
The Company plans to invest $2.8 million in H2, 2016, part of a three-year, $8.4
million capital investment, to commence mine development and ramp down into the 
Santa Cruz Sur ore-body to access an indicated resource of over 650,000 tonnes 
grading 250 g/t silver and 0.70 g/t gold. The currently defined ore-body is open
to the south and at depth. Underground drilling is planned to continue exploring
the mineralized zone once underground access is available.
</p>
<p>
At Bolanitos, throughput averaging 1,498 tpd exceeded plan as mining at LL-
Asunci&#243;n uncovered new extensions of the ore-body beyond the resource 
blocks and also in and around historic mine workings. Ore grades were lower and 
metal recoveries were higher compared to Q1, 2016. Management has revised 2016 
production guidance higher to 900,000-1,000,000 oz silver and 24,000-26,000 oz 
gold, with throughput decreasing to 800 tpd in H2, 2016 as originally guided.
</p>
<p>
On July 11, 2016, the Company announced plans to invest $1.7 million capital in 
H2, 2016 to develop the Plateros orebody located only 50 metres from the 
existing LL-Ascunci&#243;n mine workings. The development will access an 
indicated resource of over 130,000 tonnes grading 116 g/t silver and 1.61 g/t 
gold, still open at depth. Underground drilling is planned to continue exploring
the mineralized zone once underground access is available.
</p>
<p>
At El Cubo, throughput was above plan at 1,562 tpd as management elected to 
continue mine development sufficient to sustain 1,500 tpd in Q2, 2016 and 1,000 
tpd in H2, 2016 given the rising precious metal prices. Endeavour has also made 
a decision not to ramp down production to care and maintenance by year-end as 
previously guided, and various operating plans are under evaluation for 
production to return to 1,500 tpd with additional mine development. Management 
has revised the 2016 production guidance higher to 1,700,000-1,900,000 silver 
ounces and 19,000-21,000 gold ounces.
</p>
<p>
On July 11, 2016, the Company announced plans to invest $1.6 million in H2, 2016
to extend the V-Asunci&#243;n ramp an additional 1.6 km in order to access an 
indicated resource of more than 300,000 tonnes grading 141 g/t silver and 1.55 
g/t gold. The V-Asunci&#243;n ore-body extends well south of the current mine 
plan, but further evaluation work is needed before Endeavour can commit to any 
additional development.
</p>
<p>
Financial Results
</p>
<p>
For the second quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company generated revenue 
totaling $44.5 million (2015 - $47.7 million). During the quarter, the Company 
sold 1,493,790 silver oz and 15,364 gold oz at realized prices of $16.54 and 
$1,289 per oz respectively, compared to sales of 1,912,595 silver oz and 13,797 
gold oz at realized prices of $16.34 and $1,191 per oz respectively in Q2, 2015.
</p>
<p>
After cost of sales of $31.6 million (2015 - $40.9 million), mine operating 
earnings amounted to $12.9 million (2015 - $6.8 million) from mining and milling
operations in Mexico. Excluding depreciation and depletion of $4.1 million (2015
- $9.3 million), and share-based compensation of $0.2 million (2015 - $0.2 
million), mine operating cash flow before taxes was $17.3 million (2015 - $16.4 
million) in Q2, 2016. Net earnings were $1.7 million (2015 - net loss of $1.0 
million) after exploration expense of $3.2 million (2015 - $2.6 million) and 
corporate general and administrative costs of $1.9 million (2015 - $2.5 
million).
</p>
<p>
The falling Mexican peso and continued focus on cost reductions resulted in 
lower consolidated operating costs, which fell 12% to $73.01 per tonne in Q2, 
2016. This resulted in lower cash costs per oz, net of by-product credits (a 
non-IFRS measure and a standard of the Silver Institute), which decreased 38% to
$5.37 per oz of payable silver compared to $8.60 per oz in Q2, 2015. Similarly 
the lower operating costs and lower exploration and development expenditures 
resulted in all in sustaining costs (also a non-IFRS measure) decreasing 38% to 
$10.53 per oz compared to Q2, 2015. Resuming mine development and exploration 
programs will increase all in sustaining costs for the second half of the year.
</p>
<p>
Cash holdings grew to $56.8 million and working capital at the end of Q2, 2016 
rose to $71.2 million which is sufficient for the Company to meet its short and 
medium term growth goals.
