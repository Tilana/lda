<p>GE.11-11842 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The expert consultation on access to medicines as a fundamental component of the 
right to health was held on 11 October 2010, in Geneva, pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 12/24 on access to medicines in the context of the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In the 
resolution, the Council invited the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene an expert consultation for an exchange of views on 
human rights considerations relating to the realization of access to medicines as one of the 
fundamental elements in achieving progressively the full realization of the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
and requested the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to present a summary of the 
discussions held during the expert consultation. 
</p>
<p>2. The expert consultation featured a variety of participants, including representatives 
of Member States, international organizations, independent experts and a number of non-
governmental and civil society organizations. Regrettably, neither patients&#8217; organizations 
nor pharmaceutical companies attended the consultation. However, Novartis, a 
pharmaceutical company, submitted a letter in which it regretted not being available to 
participate in the consultation, and reported on its work on a statement of intent under the 
auspices of the Gates CEO Roundtable, to be launched on 8 and 9 November 2011 in 
Washington, D.C..1  
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the expert consultation 
</b>3. The expert consultation was organized in close cooperation with Member States and 
other relevant stakeholders, and focused on the elements identified in Council resolution 
12/24, namely, access to medicines as a fundamental element of the right to health, and 
emerging issues, existing obstacles to providing access to medicines and ways forward.  
</p>
<p>4. The consultation aimed at gathering and discussing expert opinions on the 
interpretation of the above-mentioned human rights obligations. It also sought to encourage 
a greater policy coherence between human rights obligations and other areas of government 
policymaking, as well as to strengthen the global partnership for development, institutional 
coordination and collective action towards enhancing access to medicines. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Panel 1: Access to medicine as a fundamental component of the full 
realization of the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his opening remarks, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Anand Grover, reminded 
participants of the current world situation with regard to access to medicines. Despite recent 
progress, massive inequalities remained in access to medicines around the world, as nearly

 The Gates CEO Roundtable consists of 10 chief executive officers of the largest pharmaceutical 
</p>
<p>companies, and aims, among other things, to improve access to medicines.  </p>

</p>
<p>2 billion people2 (or one third of the world&#8217;s population) lack such access. Furthermore, 
more than 100 million people fall into poverty annually because of high health-care costs. 
In low- and middle-income countries, 50 to 90 per cent of the cost of medicines is paid by 
the patient, even though medicines account for 20 to 60 per cent of the health-care budget. 
The median coverage of health insurance is 35 per cent in Latin America, 10 per cent in 
Asia, and less than 8 per cent in Africa.3 Furthermore, only 5.2 of the 15 million persons 
living with HIV receive antiretroviral treatment.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur pointed out the positive examples of domestic courts in 
Latin America, South Asia and South Africa, which have abolished the distinction between 
civil and political rights, on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights, on the 
other, by recognizing the individual&#8217;s right to have access to medicines. He recalled the 
importance of the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of medicines, as well 
as equality and non-discriminative approach, indicating that special attention needed to be 
paid to women, children and marginalized groups.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur recalled that some issues relating to intellectual property 
laws threatened access to medicines. Current health inequalities demonstrated that States 
had to respect their obligations under international law, including laws and practices 
relating to intellectual property, and take into consideration the need to ensure access to 
affordable medicines for all. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur warned that the 
Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), or at least its 
application by certain States, remained an impediment to greater access to medicines. In 
this respect, he noted the pressure of developed countries on least developed and 
developing countries to refrain from using the flexibilities that TRIPS provides for. He 
cautioned against new standards in the area of patent law in free-trade agreements such as 
TRIPS-plus, which threatened to compound this problem even further. He concluded that 
developing and least developed countries should be allowed to use TRIPS flexibilities. 
</p>
<p>8. Other issues brought up by the Special Rapporteur as crucial to facilitating access to 
medicines were calls to resist the establishment of anti-counterfeiting laws, rules and 
measures, and the setting-up of border controls. He noted the need to ensure that medicine-
related health priorities were not weakened in exchange for investment, and ensuring 
adequate drug regulations. In addition, he warned against the reduction of funding for 
medicines at the international and national levels, and lamented the lack of technology 
transfer, which is crucial for the long-term development of least developed countries. 
</p>
<p>9. Following the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opening remarks, Stephen Marks of the Harvard 
School of Public Health recalled Commission on Human Rights resolution 1999/49 on the 
protection of human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, in which the Commission 
reaffirmed that international agreements should not prevent Governments from taking 
measures to protect public health but rather encourage them to do so. Dr. Marks, who also 
chaired the High-level Task Force on the Implementation on the Right to Development, had 
been in charge of informing the Task Force on the attainment of Millennium Development 
Goal 8 on the development of global partnership development. He noted that the Task 
Force had devoted particular attention to target E on access to essential medicines, and had 
positive interaction with all stakeholders involved in this issue, including pharmaceutical

<p>companies and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Finally, he pointed 
out that access to medicines derived not only from article 12 of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but also from article 15.1.b., which implied that 
everyone had the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications.  
</p><p>10. Following this presentation, Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, member of the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, mentioned the obligation of States, including 
through international assistance, to achieve the full realization of the rights in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including the adoption of 
legislative measures to that effect. This obligation stemmed from articles 2.1 and 12 of the 
Covenant, as elaborated in general comments Nos. 3 and 14, in which the Committee 
emphasized States parties&#8217; important role in international cooperation. Mr. Dasgupta also 
cautioned about the existing gap in access to medicines between developed and developing 
countries, which was both politically and socially unacceptable.  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. Dasgupta reiterated that States parties should ensure that the right to health, 
including access to medicines, is given due attention in international agreements, as 
detailed in general comment No. 14, and that States parties should ensure that laws and 
practices were consistent with the provisions of the Covenant. He shared the assessment of 
the Special Rapporteur regarding generic medicines, and concluded that TRIPS-plus 
standards that denied countries the flexibilities to which they are were otherwise entitled 
were unacceptable if they had an adverse impact on access to medicines.  
</p>
<p>12. Richard Laing from the World Health Organization (WHO) contributed to the 
discussion by stressing the importance of measuring access to medicines as a very clear and 
relatively robust way of measuring a Government&#8217;s commitment to fulfilling the right to 
health. He noted, for instance, that the availability of generics in the public health sector 
was much lower (30 to 40 per cent) than the availability of generics in the private sector (60 
per cent). As a result, many patients living in poverty and used public facilities had limited 
access to medicines. He underlined the fact, however, that contrary to popular opinion, 
Governments were performing very well, as in most countries, public sector procurement 
obtained medicines at very reasonable international prices. This was not the case in the 
private sector, where prices were 10 to 20 times higher and driven by taxes, markups and 
other determining factors. Mr. Laing pointed out that, for many chronic diseases, such as 
asthma and diabetes, people were asked to spend up to 30 per cent of wages just to obtain 
medicines needed daily. Chronic disease often led to unsustainable levels of expenditure, 
and situations in which people had to choose between buying food or medicine.  
</p>
<p>13. Access to medicines was also affected by the use of retrogressive measures used in 
times of economic recession, when Governments often increased taxes on medicines, 
decrease co-payment and access to health insurance and cut subsidies, which consequently 
impeded access to medicines.  
</p>
<p>14. The creation of a new website with data on access to medicines-related case law was 
one of the most recent awareness-raising activities of WHO. Many examples from Latin 
America proved that laws could be used to improve access to medicines. In that context, 
WHO has also analysed constitutions worldwide and found that 135 of 186 national 
constitutions included provisions relating to health or the right to health. Of these, 95 
mentioned the right to access to health facilities, goods and services, while only 4 
recognized access to essential medicines as a fundamental right (Mexico, Peru, the 
Philippines and the Syrian Arab Republic).  
</p><p>15. Mr. Laing also noted the responsibility of multinational and national generic 
companies for increases in the price of medicines. In that context, WHO recalled the access </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.11-11842 
</p>
<p>to medicine index of 2008,4 which ranked 20 pharmaceutical companies according to their 
performance in ensuring access to medicines, and which demonstrated a high variation 
among them.  
</p>
<p>16. In conclusion, Mr. Laing recommended that Governments should incorporate a 
rights-based approach to national health policies, emphasizing the importance of collecting 
disaggregated data. He furthermore called upon States to specify their obligations relating 
to provision of health-care services and access to essential medicines. He also urged 
Governments to endorse a selection of essential medicines to be covered by social security, 
to establish monitoring and accountability mechanisms and mechanisms of redress, and to 
report regularly on the progressive realization of the right to health.  
</p>
<p>17. The presentation delivered by Dr. Zafar Mirza (WHO) focused on essential 
medicines for non-communicable diseases. He emphasized that essential medicines were a 
major component of the treatment of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
asthma, many types of cancer, tobacco dependency, depression and epilepsy. Recent 
surveys in over 40 low- and middle-income countries showed that generic medicines for the 
treatment of acute diseases were only 56.1 per cent available in the public sector and 65.6 
per cent in the private sector. For chronic diseases, the figures were even lower: 36 per cent 
were available in the public sector, and 54.7 per cent in the private sector. The main causes 
for low availability in the public sector were lack of public resources or under-budgeting, 
inaccurate demand forecasting and inefficient procurement and distribution. This in turn 
forced patients to buy these medicines from the private sector at a much higher price.  
</p>
<p>18. Dr. Mirza raised concerns about the increasing presence of counterfeit or falsified 
medicines for chronic diseases on the market owing to unregulated Internet sales used by 
patients treated for chronic diseases. He also noted the need to develop evidence-based 
clinical guidelines for non-communicable diseases, including diagnostic standards and 
international agreements on when to start medicine treatment. Since such diseases had a 
long-term market potential for chronic treatments, the pharmaceutical industry was heavily 
engaged, and potential conflicts of interest between the industry, patient organizations, 
professional associations, health insurance and public sector organizations needed to be 
carefully identified and adequately addressed. This also applied to low- and middle-income 
countries, where many locally produced &#8220;branded generics&#8221; were aggressively marketed.  
</p>
<p>19. Parra Vera, Senior Attorney from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, noted 
that litigation could and should be used to improve access to medicines, and emphasized the 
importance of having in place mechanisms for monitoring and accountability. Colombia 
and other Latin American countries had tried to reform their health sectors in the 1990s by 
unifying two systems of distribution of health services and medicines, to those in the labour 
market versus those who had no means to pay. This distinction had led to discriminating 
effects, and thus forced the poor to resort to legal redress in order to have access to health 
care. For example, in Colombia, between 1999 and 2008, more than 600,000 cases were 
filed to ensure access to medicines and health care. As a result of the litigation, judges 
ordered the State to provide funds for certain medicines. In some countries, the prices of 
medicines were exorbitant, as the State had left prices up to the market. In Colombia, the 
deregulation of price controls over medicines in 2006 (letting pharmaceutical industries 
establish their own price according to market laws) was ultimately paid by the State budget. 
There was thus a need for oversight and control over the price of medicines on the basis of 
international law. Moreover, health rights litigation played an important role, but if the 
protection implied greater entitlements of those already covered in the health system, it 
could lead to inequitable protection. Legal protection had to be harmonized, as distinctions

<p>GE.11-11842 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>could lead to inequality and discrimination. For that reason, it was important to use 
strategic litigation and judicial decisions to make structural changes in the policies on 
access to medicines, rather than to benefit a single individual in a case. 
</p>
<p>20. Leah Hoctor from the International Commission of Jurists highlighted the 
importance of bringing the international legal requirements of equality and non-
discrimination in the enjoyment of rights to bear in efforts to address and improve access to 
medicines. She pointed out that place of birth, gender, ethnicity, age, level of education and 
employment were all factors that had a significant impact on access to medicines. She 
underlined the importance of ensuring a particular focus on the access to medicines of 
women as work on this issue moved forward. Women and girls faced significant 
discrimination and inequality in their access to medicines on grounds of sex and gender, but 
their access was often affected also by intersectional and multiple forms of discrimination, 
for example on the grounds of social status and age. She emphasized the fact that States 
must take a number of steps to ensure women&#8217;s right to equal access to medicines. Such 
steps included ensuring that essential medicines women need are both listed on the essential 
medicines list of countries and available in practice, including reproductive health 
medicines, contraceptives, drugs that prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child, 
and drugs that treat and palliate breast cancer. Ensuring that women have effective access to 
these medicines means taking into account economic factors, since women represent the 
majority of the poor. Fulfilling the right of women and girls to access to essential medicines 
may mean making them available for free or subsidized by national health services. 
Meanwhile a range of indirect factors must be taken into account: for example, improving 
education and combating illiteracy are key steps in improving access to medicines. Legal 
prohibitions of certain family planning drugs and health-care services or laws that affect 
women&#8217;s legal status also hinder access to medicines and health services. In conclusion, 
Ms. Hoctor urged that, in their efforts to improve access to medicines, stakeholders take not 
only a right to health approach but also a broader holistic human rights one that 
acknowledges that human lives are multifaceted, not one dimensional, and facilitates the 
identification of the range of interconnected realities that combine to limit access to 
medicines in women&#8217;s daily lives.  
</p>
<p>21. Participants discussed existing obstacles, their causes and possible remedies 
regarding access to medicines. A number of State representatives expressed their concern 
regarding the great number of people who lacked such access. They also expressed concern 
about developing countries being pressured not to use TRIPS flexibilities and the 
repercussions of the TRIPS-plus standards, which were essentially aimed at strengthening 
the protection of patents. The impact of poverty and pricing, and the problem of research 
that prioritizes diseases in the developed world as opposed to the developing world, were 
also raised. This resulted in the creation of a vicious circle, whereby poor countries relied 
on the research and technology of rich countries to produce the medicines they need, while 
remaining unable to develop their own production of medicines. This could, however, be 
overcome by establishing worldwide cooperation in investment in research and technology 
in poor countries. 
</p>
<p>22. Counterfeit and falsified medicines were another issue discussed at the meeting. A 
number of State representatives stressed the importance that the concept of the right to 
access to medicines should not be used to undermine the international intellectual property 
regime and its built-in flexibilities or as an excuse to introduce new legislation in the name 
of addressing the falsification of medicines. While remaining fully committed to the 
realization of the right to health, State representatives of some developed countries 
highlighted the need to ensure that the concept of the right to medicines was not used to 
undermine intellectual property rights or resulted in tolerance of sometimes dangerous 
counterfeit medicines, although these two issues should not be confused. In that context, the 
need of a functioning health system that ensured the provision of health care for all, </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.11-11842 
</p>
<p>including for particularly vulnerable groups, such as women, children, drug addicts and 
people living with HIV-AIDS, was underlined. Lengthy and cumbersome registration 
procedures for medicines should be simplified to facilitate and allow timely access to 
medicines, without compromising their quality and safety. Some representatives reiterated 
the need for coherence in discussions among OHCHR, WHO and WIPO to avoid 
duplication, and recommended that more empirical studies should be carried out in order to 
evaluate the realization of the right to access to medicines in practice. States agreed that the 
international community should do more to ensure that people have unhindered access to 
medicines, and that the approach should be preventive rather than curative.  
</p>
<p>23. In response to the above issues, Dr. Mirza drew attention to the WHO Global 
Strategy and Plan of Action, which covers the transfer of technology at the global, regional 
and national levels. While the national medicines list should be the basis for discussion, the 
WHO medicines list had 17 patent-protected medicines in 2003, and the list would be 
expanded in cooperation with WIPO. He noted the importance of ensuring the quality and 
public availability of simple generic medicines. 
</p>
<p>24. A number of State representatives requested to be part of WHO-WIPO talks on 
intellectual property and to participate in the deliberations, and expressed interest in 
learning what the consequences would be for States that were not a party to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Panel 2: Emerging issues and existing obstacles to providing access to 
medicine as a fundamental element of the full realization of the right to 
health 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur opened the second panel and again emphasized the most 
significant obstacles to access to medicines, namely, issues relating to intellectual property 
rights and competition seen as the most important element in the reduction of prices and 
making medicines affordable to all. He referred to 2001, when the HIV crisis was at its 
peak, and when the prices for antiretroviral medicines dropped from $15,000 to less than 
$400 per patient per year. The availability of cheaper generic antiretrovirals from 
developing countries inevitably led to competition and price reduction. The Special 
Rapporteur stressed that the only effective competition was that provided by generic 
medicines. 
</p>
<p>26. The need to ensure that multinational companies adopt a corporate social 
responsibility approach was becoming increasingly urgent. It was of particular importance 
in the context of the right to health; while States had primary responsibility to ensure the 
enjoyment of the right to health, this responsibility was shared with other national and 
international actors, such as pharmaceutical companies. Although pharmaceutical 
companies had the legitimate aim of improving shareholder value, their main societal goal 
must be to improve access to medicines, which had to be considered in the context of other 
social and development objectives, as well as human rights. 
</p><p>27. The Special Rapporteur also cautioned that more stringent measures regarding 
patents had been introduced. Until recently, patents violations were not subject to criminal 
procedures (as opposed to trademark or copyright). However, criminal remedies were 
envisaged to be introduced in patent law, thus shifting the decision of whether patents were 
infringed to customs inspectors and drug regulators. Moreover, adoption of so-called anti-
counterfeiting measures might further limit access to medicines. Although the actual 
number of counterfeit medicines was very small, the conflation between generic drugs and </p>


<p>GE.11-11842 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>counterfeit drugs was, however, being strongly supported by developed countries and 
multinational companies.5 The so-called &#8220;bottom measures&#8221;, such as the ones applied by 
the Netherlands, on medicines exported from India to Brazil and Latin American countries 
had long-reaching effects on access to medicines.6 If medicine is not patented in either 
country, the shipment may be seized and the transport subject to criminal procedure. 
</p><p>28. Dr. Hans Hogerzeil stated that some 30,000 children die every day owing to lack of 
access to essential medicines, which are largely available in generic form; he stressed the 
importance of holding Governments accountable for this lack of access. In addition, there 
was an increasing problem with access to new essential medicines that were still covered by 
a patent, such as second-line medicines for the treatment of AIDS. This aspect of the 
problem was largely due to newer and stricter patent laws, making this one of the key 
public health issues of our times. 
</p>
<p>29. Dr. Hogerzeil called upon States to publicly commit to universal access and 
recognize the enjoyment of the right to health and access to medicines in their constitutions 
or other laws of major importance. He also urged them to commit to ensuring full 
accessibility to medicines by establishing monitoring and accountability mechanisms and 
focusing on the poorest and most disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p>30. In that context, Dr. Hogerzeil noted that the creation and adoption of good policies 
to promote the use of good-quality generic drugs were possible and would be most useful. 
These guidelines would enable Governments to identify which patented drugs were really 
necessary or whether a generic drug would be just as effective. By regulating the price of 
patented medicines and managing competition through generic policies where possible, 
Governments could ensure that medicines would be affordable and accessible to all, 
including persons living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>31. Dr. Hogerzeil called upon OHCHR to contribute to the development of standardized 
indicators for human rights reporting, which would include reporting on the right to health 
and access to essential medicines. Lastly, Governments should report on activities that they 
undertook in order to ensure the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. 
</p><p>32. Dr. Annemiek van Bolhuis, also from WHO, focused on non-communicable 
diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma and mental health diseases. She 
reiterated that, for the treatment of these diseases, access and affordable, good-quality 
medicines was a prerequisite. Access to essential medicines for non-communicable diseases 
was even lower than those for communicable diseases, in both the public and private 
sectors. Moreover, if available, many medicines for treating non-communicable diseases 
(such as insulin) have to be taken for life, and thus have a severe impact on household 
expenditure, pushing many families below the level of poverty. In tackling this issue, all 
actors should be involved, including pharmaceutical companies, health insurance and 
public health organizations, as well as patients&#8217; organizations, provided that careful 
management of any conflict of interests is taken into account.  
</p>
<p>33. Following the above presentation, Huong Ha of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria presented the approach that the fund uses to address the various 
challenges to access to medicines, including patent issues facing grant recipient countries. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 In Kenya, for example, anti-counterfeiting law equates qualified generic drugs sent by Indian or 
</p>
<p>Brazilian generic companies to Kenya with counterfeit drugs. This practice is now spreading 
throughout East Africa. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 According to the Special Rapporteur, the seizure of these goods by the Netherlands had no legal 
</p>
<p>justification, as medicines were in transit and patent laws are territorial, and do not extend beyond 
borders. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.11-11842 
</p>
<p>Ms. Ha discussed procurement and supply management challenges, and underlined the 
importance of having a transparent, competitive and fair procurement system that ensured 
quality, availability and affordability of medicines. She explained that the Fund provided 
procurement supply management assistance to countries and facilitates access to technical 
assistance and capacity-building services in recipient countries in partnership with technical 
agencies. It spends around 37 per cent of its budget on medicines and health products, and 
15 per cent on human resources. She also pointed out that strengthening health systems was 
fundamental to achieve the goal of ensuring access to medicines and the full enjoyment of 
the right to health. The Fund spent 6 per cent of its budget to support health system-
strengthening-related activities. She highlighted the need of a sustainable solution for the 
production of lower priced generic drugs in adequate formulations; to simplify intellectual 
property management to ensure that countries were able to take full advantages of TRIPS 
flexibilities as well as to comply with those flexibilities; and lastly, to provide an incentive 
mechanism to facilitate the arrival of new drugs on the market. She pointed out the various 
harmonization steps and initiatives taken by the Fund, and also highlighted the fact that 
human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination, participation, transparency and 
accountability were reflected in the work of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>34. Tido vos Schoen-Angerer and Emmanuel Tronc from M&#233;d&#233;cins sans Fronti&#232;res, 
raised several crucial questions that had been previously mentioned, namely, that some 
States pursued policies that directly undermined access to medicines and were often 
unwilling (or unable) to provide care of adequate quality; and the fact that the prevalence of 
diseases in developing and developed countries could change the world&#8217;s perspective on the 
importance of access to medicines. The necessity to ensure access to new medicines, where 
to produce them and how to enable their importation to countries where they were most 
needed, as well as how to provide patients with the latest recommended treatment, was 
again underlined. M&#233;d&#233;cins sans Fronti&#232;res welcomed the WHO Global Strategy and Plan 
of Action for Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, as it could fundamentally 
change the way health research and development was conducted and financed, in order to 
ensure that medicines were made accessible to those who needed them. This was a 
historical change, but its implementation depended on the willingness of States to translate 
the Strategy into action. It was noted that particularly vulnerable groups, such as 
undocumented migrants, were subject to additional obstacles in the context of access to 
medicines owing to their uncertain legal status, cultural and linguistic differences and 
exclusion from health insurance schemes and social security systems, as well as lack of 
community support. 
</p>
<p>35. In the interactive debate following the panel discussion, many substantive issues 
were raised, including the concern that the adjective &#8220;essential&#8221; medicines may lead to the 
exclusion of other much-needed medicines. Regarding the responsibility of Governments, 
some State representatives were of the opinion that the Governments of developing 
countries were being too harshly judged, and that otherwise responsible Governments 
sometimes simply did not have the means to provide access to medicines. This was, in turn, 
due to the fact that patents &#8212; imposed by pharmaceuticals and developed countries &#8212; 
increased the prices of medicines. As a result, the Governments of developing countries 
were not only unable to afford these medicines, but because of the long terms of patents, 
they were also unable to benefit from the knowledge of developed countries, which they 
needed in order to produce cheap generic medicines. Moreover, if the duration of patents 
was extended for an additional five years, as had been proposed by certain pharmaceutical 
companies and developed countries, the situation would further deteriorate. 
</p>
<p>36. Essential medicines should not be patented. When TRIPS flexibilities were again 
raised, some State representatives insisted that issues such as the protection of private 
sector industries by the developed countries, which caused vast injustice to poor people, 
should also be discussed in other forums, such as the Human Rights Council and the World </p>


<p>GE.11-11842 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Trade Organization. Panellists were requested to share views on how the Council could 
take forward recommendations from the special procedures. Concern was also raised that 
many of the efforts discussed during the expert consultation could be nullified by the 
attempts of developed countries and the private sector to circumvent the flexibilities 
available in the TRIPS agreement. There was general agreement that the discussions and 
negotiations on TRIPS-plus standards should be monitored closely. In this respect, it was 
suggested that more information be circulated on the legitimacy for making use of TRIPS 
flexibilities. 
</p>
<p>37. In their response to some of the concerns raised by representatives of States, and 
non-governmental and other organizations, the panellists made further clarifications. 
Regarding the confusion between national essential medicines and the international 
essential medicines list developed by WHO, Dr. Hogerzeil stated that any national list was 
more important, as it referred to the specific needs of the country; he also cautioned, 
however, that, in circumstances where a large country with many health problems had only 
some 30 essential medicines on its list, this was clearly not enough and, in such cases, the 
WHO list should perhaps be taken as a reference. With regard to promoting generic 
policies, he noted several important measures that countries could take: to create an 
adequate legal framework; to publish price information and inform which generics were 
available; and to ensure that generics were of good quality. By creating financial incentives, 
especially for pharmacists, Governments could also raise the interest of and include the 
private sector in the promotion of generic policies. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to patents, while agreeing that pharmaceutical companies should not 
extend patents beyond reason, Dr. Hogerzeil emphasized that pharmaceutical companies 
should go beyond, by also promoting and protecting human rights. Regarding the protection 
of nationally produced medicines in government procurement, Dr. Hogerzeil suggested 
that, if locally produced medicines were given favourable treatment by the Government 
while cheaper medicines could be found outside the country, the Ministry of Trade (not the 
Ministry of Health), as part of its industrial policy, should pay for the price difference with 
the lowest price good quality generic medicine that could be imported. 
</p>
<p>39. Dr. Hogerzeil also explained the selection process for essential medicines and the 
changes that WHO had made in this process since 2002. Before then, affordability and 
patent status were a selection criterion; today, it was effectiveness, safety and cost 
effectiveness (within their group). There are many options for reducing prices, namely by 
reducing import taxes, decoupling them from prescriptions, substituting a specific medicine 
that is patented with something equally efficient, and negotiating prices. Moreover, States 
could negotiate for a lower price for a specific medicine with a pharmaceutical company on 
the basis of price differentiation, or opt for voluntary licensing, while ensuring that such 
price differentiation was not abused by re-exporting the same medicine. Furthermore, 
countries could support incentives for innovations by differential pricing and streamlining 
regulation.  
</p>
<p>40. On the question of innovation, the Special Rapporteur stated that, while research and 
development was important, there was a need to differentiate between a completely new 
drug, a &#8220;new molecule&#8221; and a drug that had only been slightly changed, namely a &#8220;new 
form&#8221;. The majority of pharmaceutical patents were actually new forms and not new 
molecules, yet both categories were being patented. Only 15 per cent of new drugs 
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration from 1989 to 2000 were for </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.11-11842 
</p>
<p>highly innovative priority new medical entities.7 Medicines were thus insensibly modified, 
and thereafter patented, needlessly making them more costly. In this respect, the patent 
system needed to change, to prevent the overpricing of drugs that were only slightly 
different from already existing ones. 
</p>
<p>41. During the discussion, some State representatives expressed concern that too much 
responsibility was placed on Governments, and too little on international organizations and 
pharmaceutical companies. It was especially difficult for developing countries to reconcile 
human rights with trade concerns, while developed countries pressure them not to use the 
flexibilities provided for in trade agreements. On the other hand, it remained unclear 
whether pharmaceutical companies had a true incentive to fulfil human rights, and this, 
according to some countries, was an overarching issue. Other State representatives still 
emphasized the important role of generic medicines in setting the price and opening the 
floor to competition, and wondered whether the time frame for patents could not be 
reviewed in the interest of public health. In addition, some State representatives underlined 
the importance of traditional medicine. Drug supply chains, insufficient and inequitable 
pricing, inappropriate prescriptions, poor medicine selection and information on access to 
medicines, weak accountability and low public participation were all sources of 
considerable concern. Several countries noted that price differentiation should also take into 
account that some countries that were not considered least developed should nevertheless 
enjoy price differentiation, owing to the high prevalence of a disease tied to their climate or 
other unique factors. 
</p>
<p>42. In response to these observations, Dr. Marks reiterated the potential role and 
function of regional organizations, some of which had already noted and discussed all the 
issues considered during the expert consultation. He agreed with the fact that, while 90 per 
cent of the poor lived in low-income countries, they were dispersed, and three quarters 
actually lived in middle-income countries and Europe. Thus, the differentiation not only 
between poorest countries on the international level but also between rich and poor on the 
country level needed to be taken into account. 
</p>
<p>43. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Dasgupta raised the issue of the impact of climate 
change on health and the fact that some countries in North America could be facing 
malaria, dengue fever and other diseases commonly thought of as &#8220;third world&#8221; diseases or 
diseases prevalent in least developed and developing countries. This &#8220;migration&#8221; of 
diseases could change the world&#8217;s perspective on the importance of access to medicines, 
their price and patent-related context. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>44. <b>The right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
health encompasses access to medical services and the underlying determinants of 
health, such as water, sanitation, non-discrimination and equality. As access to 
medicines is an integral and fundamental part of the right to health, Governments and 
the international community as a whole have a responsibility to provide access to 
medicines for all. Yet massive inequalities remain in access to medicines around the 
world, as up to 2 billion people (or one third of the world&#8217;s population) lack access to 
essential medicines. Most of them live in low- and middle-income countries, where the 
needs of persons living in poverty, women, children and undocumented migrants, as

</b></p>
<p><b>well as other marginalized and vulnerable groups who are often discriminated against 
in terms of access to medicines, are ignored or underestimated.  
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>States have the primary responsibility for enhancing access to medicines; as the 
Millennium Development Goals recognize, however, this is a shared responsibility. If 
there is to be an increase in access to medicines, numerous national and international 
actors have a role to play. Pharmaceutical companies are among those who share this 
responsibility owing to their evident impact on the ability of Governments to realize 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health.</b>8<b> The expert consultation 
identified the need for a reliable system for the supply of good-quality medicines that 
are affordable to all, including those living in poverty and other disadvantaged 
groups.  
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>From the right to health perspective, access to medicines must be equitable. 
Additionally, more research and development is needed to promote the availability of 
new drugs for those diseases causing a heavy burden on developing countries. Within 
a framework of international assistance and cooperation, States should resort to a 
variety of incentives to influence research and development for these specific health 
needs. 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>While intellectual property rights have the important function of providing 
incentives for innovation, they can, in some cases, obstruct access by pushing up the 
price of medicines. The right to health requires a company that holds a patent on a 
lifesaving medicine to make use of all the arrangements at its disposal to render the 
medicine accessible to all. As patents create monopolies, limit competition and allow 
patentees to establish high prices, they consequently have a significant impact on 
access to medicines. While some countries lack sufficient awareness about the use of 
TRIPS flexibilities and have limited technical capacity to implement them, others have 
not streamlined their patent laws sufficiently to facilitate use of such flexibilities. 
Furthermore, pressure from developed countries and multinational pharmaceutical 
corporations have played a prominent role in shaping the implementation of TRIPS 
flexibilities in developing and least developed countries. For example, a number of 
developing countries, while attempting to implement TRIPS flexibilities to address 
public health concerns, have experienced pressures from developed countries and 
multinational pharmaceutical corporations. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>A new challenge for the health sector is ensuring access to medicines for non-
communicable or chronic diseases. As for any other general essential medicine, 
equitable access (including rational selection of medicines, affordable prices, 
sustainable financing and reliable health systems), availability, safety and quality 
must also be ensured for medicines for non-communicable diseases. Another challenge 
for these drugs is the creation of clinical guidelines for them, including diagnostic 
standards and an international agreement on when to start medical treatment. The 
international pharmaceutical industry is heavily engaged in non-communicable 
diseases owing to the long-term market potential of chronic treatments. For this 
reason, a potential conflict of interests between industry, patient organizations, 
professional associations, health insurance companies and public sector bodies must 
be carefully indentified and managed. This also applies to low- and middle-income 
countries, where many locally produced and branded generic medicines are 
aggressively marketed.
