<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/182 of 21 December 2010 on the follow-
</p>
<p>up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing, in which the Assembly established an open-
</p>
<p>ended working group for the purpose of strengthening the protection of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>older persons by considering the existing international framework of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>older persons and identifying possible gaps and how best to address them, including by 
</p>
<p>considering, as appropriate, the feasibility of further instruments and measures, and taking 
</p>
<p>into account that no international instrument addresses specifically the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the human rights of older persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the Political Declaration and the Madrid International Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action on Ageing of 2002, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation</i> of the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-
</p>
<p>up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing,1 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation also</i> of the report of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights on the human rights of older persons,<footnote name="2">E/2012/51.  </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with appreciation</i> the analytical outcome paper prepared by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner on normative standards in international human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>general comment No. 6 of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>

</p>
<p>recommendation No. 27 of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against

</p>

<p>Women on older women and the protection of their human rights, as well as other relevant 
</p>
<p>documents by treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p><i>Conscious</i> that older persons represent a large and growing segment of the 
</p>
<p>population, and that greater attention is needed to the specific human rights challenges 
</p>
<p>affecting them, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> at the multiple forms of discrimination faced by older persons and the 
</p>
<p>high incidence of poverty among older persons, in particular older women, people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, people of African descent, indigenous people, people belonging to minorities, 
</p>
<p>rural populations and people living on the streets, among other groups particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to poverty, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recognizes </i>that older persons face human rights challenges relating to civil, 
</p>
<p>cultural, economic, political and social rights, such as age discrimination, long-term care, 
</p>
<p>violence and abuse, social protection, adequate food and housing, decent work, access to 
</p>
<p>productive resources, and legal capacity and health support, and that those challenges 
</p>
<p>require in-depth analysis on normative and operational protection gaps; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also recognizes</i> that current international mechanisms have been insufficient 
</p>
<p>to promote and protect the human rights of older persons, and that dedicated measures are 
</p>
<p>needed without delay; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Welcomes</i> multilateral, regional and subregional initiatives aimed at the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of rights of older persons, including the development of 
</p>
<p>normative standards; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to ensure the realization of all human rights for older 
</p>
<p>persons, including by addressing age discrimination, neglect, abuse and violence against 
</p>
<p>older persons and by providing social integration and adequate health care, bearing in mind 
</p>
<p>the crucial importance of family intergenerational interdependence, solidarity and 
</p>
<p>reciprocity for social development; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Encourages</i> all States to conduct their age-related policies through inclusive 
</p>
<p>and participatory consultations with relevant stakeholders and social development partners 
</p>
<p>in the interest of developing effective policies creating national policy ownership and 
</p>
<p>consensus-building;  
</p>
<p>6. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to adopt or improve national legal mechanisms 
</p>
<p>dedicated to the promotion and protection of the human rights of older persons; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Encourages</i> all States to ensure that older persons receive information about 
</p>
<p>their rights; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Invites</i> existing special procedures and treaty bodies to integrate, within their 
</p>
<p>existing mandates, the human rights of older persons; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Encourages</i> all States to consider including in their national reports, to be 
</p>
<p>submitted for the universal periodic review, information on the human rights of older 
</p>
<p>persons; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to organize, in Geneva, an intersessional public consultation on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of the human rights of older persons, to receive the inputs of States Members of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, relevant international organizations, United Nations agencies and 
</p>
<p>stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to present a summary 
</p>
<p>report of the above-mentioned consultation to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-third 
</p>
<p>session; </p>


<p>12. <i>Decides</i> to continue consideration of the question of human rights of older 
</p>
<p>persons at its twenty-third session.
