<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The report presents the main findings of the country visit to Viet Nam undertaken by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, from 21 to 31 
</p>
<p>July 2014. After an analysis of Vietnamese legal framework and norms concerning freedom 
</p>
<p>of thought, conscience, religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur identifies positive 
</p>
<p>developments but also a number of serious problems; mainly the lack of clarity in the legal 
</p>
<p>provisions that tend to give broad leeway to regulate, limit, restrict or forbid the exercise of 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief in the interest of &#8220;national unity and public order&#8221;. Other 
</p>
<p>challenges originate from the tight control that the Government exercises on religious 
</p>
<p>communities. Whereas religious life and religious diversity are a reality in Viet Nam today, 
</p>
<p>autonomy and activities of independent religious or belief communities, that is, 
</p>
<p>unrecognized communities, remain restricted and unsafe, with the rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief of such communities grossly violated in the face of constant surveillance, 
</p>
<p>intimidation, harassment and persecution. The Special Rapporteur sees the need for 
</p>
<p>improvements and shares his recommendations with a view to maintaining a constructive 
</p>
<p>dialogue and cooperation with the Government.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief visited Viet Nam from 21 to 
</p>
<p>31 July 2014. This was the second visit of the mandate after the 1998 visit of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s esteemed predecessor, the late Abdelfattah Amor.1 He would like to thank the 
</p>
<p>Government of Viet Nam for its invitation and for maintaining cooperation with his 
</p>
<p>mandate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in particular was helpful throughout the 
</p>
<p>preparation and the visit, including by facilitating a meeting with a prisoner. The 
</p>
<p>Government Committee for Religious Affairs was similarly cooperative.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all interlocutors from the legislative, executive 
</p>
<p>and judiciary branches of the Government at the central and local levels, as well as 
</p>
<p>religious communities and institutions (legally recognized and unrecognized), civil society 
</p>
<p>actors, the diplomatic community and United Nations agencies. Discussions held in Hanoi, 
</p>
<p>Tuyen Quang, Ho Chi Minh City and Vinh Long were mostly open, frank and constructive. 
</p>
<p>He would also like to thank the United Nations Development Programme in Hanoi for its 
</p>
<p>logistical support.  
</p>
<p>3. However, the Special Rapporteur is disappointed that the planned visits to An 
</p>
<p>Giang, Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces could not be completed from 28 to 30 July owing 
</p>
<p>to various interruptions that undermined the terms of reference of a country visit, while the 
</p>
<p>privacy and confidentiality of some meetings and sources of information had been seriously 
</p>
<p>compromised. He experienced first-hand and received credible information that some 
</p>
<p>individuals with whom he wanted to meet had been heavily surveilled, warned, intimidated, 
</p>
<p>harassed or prevented from travelling by the police. Even those who successfully met with 
</p>
<p>him were not free from different degrees of police surveillance or questioning.  
</p>
<p>4. Moreover, undeclared &#8220;security or police agents&#8221; closely monitored the whereabouts 
</p>
<p>of the Special Rapporteur and his interlocutors. All such incidents were in clear violation of 
</p>
<p>the terms of reference of country visits that had been agreed upon by the Government prior 
</p>
<p>to the visit. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned and outraged by incidents of 
</p>
<p>reprisals,2 including intimidation, harassment by way of police interrogations and even 
</p>
<p>physical injuries of some of his interlocutors during and after his visit. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur brought the instances to the attention of the Government, raised his concerns 
</p>
<p>and sought clarifications and intervention to stop them. In one of the final meetings with the 
</p>
<p>Government, the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated the importance of the visit and 
</p>
<p>indicated that the incidents of interruptions would be looked into and verified with the local 
</p>
<p>authorities.  
</p>
<p>5. Even though some meetings could not take place owing to the interruption of the 
</p>
<p>later part of his visit, the Special Rapporteur continues to receive relevant information in 
</p>
<p>the scope of his visit. He also seeks factual clarifications from the Governments and 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Brief overview on the religious landscape in Viet Nam 
</b></p>
<p>6. A member of the Government Committee for Religious Affairs described the 
</p>
<p>religious landscape in Viet Nam as a &#8220;museum of religions and beliefs&#8221;. According to the 
</p>
<p>official statistics presented by various Government agencies, there are currently 38 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See E/CN.4/1999/58/Add.2. 
</p>
<p> 2 See A/HRC/28/85, case VNM 11/2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>registered religious organizations in the country. The overall number of followers of 
</p>
<p>recognized religions is about 24 million out of a population of almost 90 million. Formally 
</p>
<p>recognized religious communities include 11 million Buddhists, 6.5 million Catholics, 
</p>
<p>2.5 million Cao Dai followers, 1.5 million Protestants, over 1.3 million Hoa Hao Buddhists, 
</p>
<p>78,000 Muslims, 7,000 Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237;s, 1,500 Hindus as well as people with other beliefs, such as 
</p>
<p>animists and non-believers. There are around 25,000 places of worship in the country. Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam has also around 9,000 traditional belief festivals held per year and takes pride in 
</p>
<p>having hosted international conferences of religious leaders, in particular the Day of Vesak, 
</p>
<p>a summit of Buddhist dignitaries that took place in May 2014. The people of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>comprise 54 different ethnic groups, some of which including sizable groups of religious 
</p>
<p>minorities.  
</p>
<p>7. While the majority of Vietnamese do not belong to one of the officially recognized 
</p>
<p>religious communities, they may nonetheless &#8212; occasionally or regularly &#8212; practise 
</p>
<p>certain traditional rituals, usually referred to in Viet Nam under the term &#8220;belief&#8221;. Many of 
</p>
<p>those traditional rituals express veneration of ancestors. In recent years, there have 
</p>
<p>apparently been attempts to preserve or revive such traditional rituals among the ethnic or 
</p>
<p>religious minorities.  
</p>
<p>8. Moreover, there is also a reality of religious faiths and practices outside of the 
</p>
<p>officially recognized religious communities. However, it is difficult to get a clear and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive picture of the religious life beyond those registered religious communities. 
</p>
<p>While some Government experts gave a low estimation of the number of followers of 
</p>
<p>unregistered religious communities, the Special Rapporteur also heard conjectures that the 
</p>
<p>number of people practising religions outside of registered communities &#8212; or wishing to do 
</p>
<p>so &#8212; may be up to several million.  
</p>
<p>9. Apart from the very different estimates of numbers, the Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>received conflicting information with regard to the conditions under which people could 
</p>
<p>enjoy their human right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. One of the 
</p>
<p>most striking features of recent religious developments in Viet Nam is the enormous growth 
</p>
<p>of Protestantism, in particular among some ethnic or religious minorities. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>this has led to some worrisome cases of religious persecution. The coexistence of people of 
</p>
<p>different religious or denominational persuasion does not lead to major problems.  
</p>
<p>10. Many representatives of different religious communities acknowledged that there 
</p>
<p>was generally more space for the exercise of religious freedom in Viet Nam at present, 
</p>
<p>especially compared with the post-1975 situation. Religious life is a visible reality, as 
</p>
<p>evidenced by places of worship that belong to various religions and denominations and by 
</p>
<p>the participation of people from diverse religious and belief practices. At the same time, the 
</p>
<p>conditions under which individuals or groups can exercise their right to freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief remain unpredictable, often depending on the good will of the local authorities, 
</p>
<p>particularly Government agencies.  
</p>
<p>11. Despite the broadening of the space for religious or belief practices, religious 
</p>
<p>communities remain subject to tight control. Members of unrecognized religious 
</p>
<p>communities face enormous difficulties in practising their religion or belief, especially 
</p>
<p>where such practices or rituals are not considered to be matching the &#8220;legitimate interests of 
</p>
<p>the majority&#8221; &#8212; a phrase often invoked in discussions with representatives of the 
</p>
<p>authorities. Moreover, many members of unrecognized communities face continuous 
</p>
<p>religious persecution and, as a result, have to flee the country and are unable to return home 
</p>
<p>to their families and relatives. It is worth noting that the invocation of historical reasons 
</p>
<p>cannot serve as a justification for infringing freedom of religion or belief. </p>

<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework and norms of freedom of religion 
or belief 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Relevant legal norms of freedom of religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>12. Viet Nam has ratified most international human rights instruments, including the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The newly amended Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>Constitution, adopted on 28 November 2013, contains a chapter on &#8220;human rights and 
</p>
<p>citizen&#8217;s fundamental rights and duties&#8221; that did not exist in the 1992 Constitution. This is a 
</p>
<p>positive step towards promoting and upholding human rights, even though some provisions 
</p>
<p>are rather vague and ambiguous.  
</p>
<p>13. Representatives of the Government repeatedly highlighted that the rights holders 
</p>
<p>under article 24 of the new Constitution in relation to freedom of religion or belief related 
</p>
<p>to all human beings, unlike the provision of the 1992 Constitution, which was confined to 
</p>
<p>the citizens of Viet Nam. This was presented as an indicator of a more positive attitude 
</p>
<p>towards freedom of religion or belief. Article 24 states that: (1) everyone shall enjoy 
</p>
<p>freedom of belief and of religion, can follow any religion or follow none, and all religions 
</p>
<p>are equal before the law; (2) the State respects and protects freedom of belief and of 
</p>
<p>religion; and (3) no one has the right to infringe on the freedom of belief and religion or 
</p>
<p>take advantage of belief and religion to violate the law. 
</p>
<p>14. Viet Nam does not have a law regulating religious affairs. The most relevant legal 
</p>
<p>document is the Ordinance on Belief and Religion (Ordinance 21), adopted after long 
</p>
<p>deliberations on 18 June 2004. Ordinance 21 is the first comprehensive legal document that 
</p>
<p>is pertinent to freedom of religion or belief in Viet Nam. Despite its restrictive language, its 
</p>
<p>adoption symbolized a move towards the legal accommodation of religious and belief 
</p>
<p>communities. Article 38 of the Ordinance provides that the stipulations of any international 
</p>
<p>treaty concluded or acceded to shall prevail over the provisions of the Ordinance whenever 
</p>
<p>they contravene. A decree detailing the regulations and enforcement measures of the 
</p>
<p>Ordinance on Belief and Religion (Decree 92) was adopted on 8 November 2012.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur learned that a proposal would be submitted in 2015 to pass a 
</p>
<p>law on religion or belief based on the current Ordinance; the new law was expected to be 
</p>
<p>adopted in 2016. Apart from the higher legal status of a law in comparison to the current 
</p>
<p>Ordinance, the process of creating a new comprehensive law offers an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>introduce substantive revisions to Ordinance 21 in conformity with international human 
</p>
<p>rights law in order to strengthen the protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>When discussing this issue with Government experts on religious affairs, there were 
</p>
<p>indications that land issues would be better addressed. At the same time, the freedom for 
</p>
<p>foreigners to practise their religions or belief would also become easier. Other officials also 
</p>
<p>expressed their willingness to consider substantive changes to overcome the still very 
</p>
<p>restrictive language of Ordinance 21.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Restrictions of freedom of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>16. According to international standards, the exercise of the human right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>thought, conscience, religion or belief is broadly protected by article 18 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant but it is not without possible limitations. Article 18, paragraph 3, of the Covenant 
</p>
<p>provides a number of criteria that must be satisfied for such limitations to be legitimate.  
</p>
<p>17. Limitation clauses as provided in the 2013 Constitution, Ordinance 21 and Decree 
</p>
<p>92 are much broader than the limitation clauses stipulated in the International Covenant. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>The problem is that overly broad limitation clauses may blur the contours of freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, thereby seriously jeopardizing its implementation in practice. One 
</p>
<p>missing element in these legal provisions concerning religion or belief is a clarification on 
</p>
<p>the internal dimension of a person&#8217;s religious, moral or philosophical conviction &#8212; <i>forum 
</i></p>
<p><i>internum</i> &#8212; that must be respected unconditionally and never be exposed to any restrictions 
</p>
<p>or interferences for whatever reasons, even in situations of a serious crisis or an 
</p>
<p>emergency.3  
</p>
<p>18. The unconditional protection of the <i>forum internum</i> reflects the principle that forcing 
</p>
<p>human beings to feign a faith that is not authentic or to denounce their deeply held 
</p>
<p>convictions would gravely undermine their self-respect and human rights. The prohibition 
</p>
<p>of any coercive interference with the inner core of a person&#8217;s religious, moral or 
</p>
<p>philosophical conviction has the same elevated status under international law as the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of slavery or the prohibition of torture. These are absolute prohibitions with no 
</p>
<p>exceptions. However, article 24 of the 2013 Constitution, notwithstanding its reference to 
</p>
<p>freedom of belief and religion in general terms, does not provide for a specific protection of 
</p>
<p>the <i>forum internum</i> dimension of freedom of religion or belief. This may lead to serious 
</p>
<p>protection gaps. 
</p>
<p>19. Unlike the <i>forum internum</i>, manifestations of religions or beliefs in the social sphere 
</p>
<p>&#8212; <i>forum externum</i> &#8212; are not protected unconditionally by international law. Hence, the 
</p>
<p>conditions for limitations must be specified in law, in a clear and predictable manner. This 
</p>
<p>should be done in the understanding that freedom of religion or belief, in all its individual 
</p>
<p>and community dimensions, has the normative status of a universal human right. The 
</p>
<p>relationship between this freedom and its limitations thus should be seen as a relationship 
</p>
<p>between rule and exception. It is important to stress that, in case of doubt, the rule prevails, 
</p>
<p>that is, the burden rests with the Government to provide empirical evidence and normative 
</p>
<p>reasoning to justify limitations that are deemed necessary. 
</p>
<p>20. In discussions with Government representatives, the Special Rapporteur frequently 
</p>
<p>heard broad references to &#8220;the Vietnamese law&#8221;. Such general invocation of domestic legal 
</p>
<p>order is likely to obscure and undermine the normative rank of freedom of religion or belief 
</p>
<p>as an inalienable universal right. In view of the inalienability of human rights, the scope of 
</p>
<p>those rights, including freedom of religion or belief, cannot be left to the discretion of the 
</p>
<p>national legislator.  
</p>
<p>21. Any limitations must be for the pursuit of a legitimate aim &#8212; the protection of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others&#8221; as 
</p>
<p>provided by article 18, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant.4 Limitations must 
</p>
<p>furthermore strictly remain in the realm of necessity and proportionality, which, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>means that they should always be confined to a minimum degree of interference. These and 
</p>
<p>other criteria are prescribed with the purpose of safeguarding the substance of freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief also in situations of a potential or factual collision with other rights or 
</p>
<p>important public interests. 
</p>
<p>22. Many clauses in the 2013 Constitution, Ordinance 21 and Decree 92 give the State 
</p>
<p>broad leeway to regulate, limit, restrict or forbid the exercise of freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief.5 Article 14, paragraph 2, of the 2013 Constitution contains a number of reasons for 
</p>
<p>restricting human rights and citizens&#8217; rights that, presumably, would also apply to freedom 
</p>
<p>of religion or belief. While the possibility to restrict human rights in the interest of

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8220;national defence, national security, social order and safety, social morality and community 
</p>
<p>well-being&#8221; differs slightly from the criteria set out in article 18, paragraph 3, of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant, article 24, paragraph 3, of the 2013 Constitution broadly allows 
</p>
<p>limitation by forbidding anyone &#8220;to take advantage of belief and religion to violate the 
</p>
<p>law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, Ordinance 21 and Decree 92 often make reference to purposes such as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;national unity and harmony&#8221;, &#8220;unity of people&#8221;, &#8220;interests of the nation&#8221; and &#8220;fine cultural 
</p>
<p>traditions, customs and habits&#8221;, which are open to subjective interpretations. For example, 
</p>
<p>article 8, paragraph 2, of Ordinance 21 provides that &#8220;no one shall be permitted to abuse the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of belief and religion to undermine the peace, independence and unity of 
</p>
<p>the country, to instigate violence or carry out war propaganda or propaganda against State 
</p>
<p>laws or policies; to sow division among the people and religions; to disturb public order, to 
</p>
<p>encroach upon the life, health, human dignity, honour or property of others or to obstruct 
</p>
<p>the exercise by the people of their civic rights or obligations; to carry out superstitious 
</p>
<p>activities; or to commit other breaches of the law&#8221;. The definition of the type of actions or 
</p>
<p>activities that would constitute &#8220;propaganda against State laws and policies&#8221;, actions of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;sowing division&#8221; or &#8220;superstitious practices&#8221; remains unclear. Moreover, articles 87, 88 
</p>
<p>and 258 of the Viet Nam Penal Code are often applied arbitrarily in conjunction to punish 
</p>
<p>people who are accused of violating the limitations set out in Ordinance 21 and/or 
</p>
<p>Decree 92. 
</p>
<p>24. Senior representatives of the Government, including from the judiciary, frequently 
</p>
<p>referred to these broad clauses of restriction. The invocation of the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>abstract purposes, such as &#8220;interest of the State&#8221;, easily leads to criminal prosecution. The 
</p>
<p>first paragraph of article 258 of the Penal Code reads as follows: &#8220;[t]hose who abuse the 
</p>
<p>rights to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of belief, religion, assembly, 
</p>
<p>association and other democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interest of the State, the 
</p>
<p>legitimate rights and interests of organizations and/or citizens shall be subject to warning, 
</p>
<p>non-custodial reform for up to three years or a prison term of between six months and three 
</p>
<p>years&#8221;. The absence of specified acts that would amount to an &#8220;abuse&#8221; of religious freedom 
</p>
<p>of other democratic freedoms in the paragraph is particularly disturbing. Even the members 
</p>
<p>of a local provincial court and the People&#8217;s Supreme Court could not clarify the meaning of 
</p>
<p>the term &#8220;abuse&#8221; and failed to specify the acts that would constitute violations of the law. 
</p>
<p>The ambiguous formulation in article 258 gives the relevant authorities carte blanche to 
</p>
<p>sanction people for all sorts of activities &#8212; and their underlying attitudes &#8212; that are 
</p>
<p>deemed to somehow run counter to the interest of the State. This may particularly apply to 
</p>
<p>religious or belief communities, owing to their ability to organize people.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur had inferred from many of the discussions held during his 
</p>
<p>visit that such ambiguity in the legal provision is not merely a theoretical problem. 
</p>
<p>Article 258 is frequently invoked in practice and has been applied to arrest people who 
</p>
<p>resist the imposed restrictions on their freedom of religion or belief and other human rights, 
</p>
<p>such as the freedom of expression and the freedom of association and assembly. When the 
</p>
<p>question of prisoners of conscience was raised, the Special Rapporteur was assured that no 
</p>
<p>such cases exist in Viet Nam. Given the vague formulations and the high number of cases 
</p>
<p>charged under article 258, this assurance remains however, rather doubtful.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Administrative stipulations on religious or belief activities and practices 
</b></p>
<p>26. An issue that was in the heart of almost all discussions held during the visit 
</p>
<p>concerned the registration of religious or belief communities. Although article 5 of 
</p>
<p>Ordinance 21 provides that the State guarantees the right to conduct belief and religious </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>activities, Ordinance 21 contains a broad number of regulations, reinforced by Decree 92, 
</p>
<p>concerning the operation of religious or belief communities.  
</p>
<p>27. Decree 92 specifies the conditions and requirements of registration for belief or 
</p>
<p>religious activity and operation. Religious or belief communities have to apply for specific 
</p>
<p>permits for the construction or renovation of houses of worship; they have to present to the 
</p>
<p>local authorities an annual overview of planned activities; they have to inform the 
</p>
<p>authorities about the ordainment of religious clergy and in some cases must receive 
</p>
<p>approval from the authorities; and they have to get permission from the relevant local 
</p>
<p>authorities in order to conduct public ceremonies. Thus, the stipulations contained in 
</p>
<p>Ordinance 21 and Decree 92 include obligations concerning information and notification as 
</p>
<p>well as provisions for formal approval before being allowed to conduct certain religious or 
</p>
<p>belief activities.  
</p>
<p>28. The excessive requirements in these provisions certainly amount to a high burden 
</p>
<p>for the functioning of religious communities. Decree 92 does not seem to have made the 
</p>
<p>life of the religious or belief communities easier with its extra layer of bureaucratic 
</p>
<p>requirements, although the time frame within which the authorities are required to respond 
</p>
<p>is shorter than before. In the case of a negative decision, they are obliged to state the 
</p>
<p>reasons. 
</p>
<p>29. According to article 16 of the Ordinance, organizations have to meet a number of 
</p>
<p>criteria in order to obtain the status of a legally recognized religious organization. These 
</p>
<p>conditions are aimed, inter alia, at ensuring respect for the &#8220;fine customs and habits and 
</p>
<p>interests of the nation&#8221;.6 Article 6 of Decree 92 also demands that other requirements be 
</p>
<p>met before a registration is possible, including that religious organizations have conducted 
</p>
<p>regular religious activities for at least 20 years from the date of being approved by a 
</p>
<p>commune-level People&#8217;s Committee for religious activities. Without going into further 
</p>
<p>details of these provisions, the Special Rapporteur would like to raise two points of concern 
</p>
<p>that are of particular importance in relation to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>30. The first point concerns the nature of registration and whether this is an offer or a 
</p>
<p>formal requirement. The Special Rapporteur received different views on this, and there 
</p>
<p>seems to be a lack of clarity. While a number of Government representatives 
</p>
<p>unambiguously stated that without, legal registration by the authorities, the religious or 
</p>
<p>belief communities would not be allowed to operate, others indicated that individuals from 
</p>
<p>unregistered denominations could be &#8220;allowed&#8221; to exercise some basic religious functions, 
</p>
<p>such as holding religious gatherings in private homes, as long as the authorities were 
</p>
<p>notified of their activities. Even within this slightly more accommodating latter 
</p>
<p>interpretation, the scope of freedom of religion or belief, however, remains extremely 
</p>
<p>limited and unsafe. Moreover, it seems unclear what status the term &#8220;allowance&#8221; has. 
</p>
<p>Obviously, it remains far behind a lawful entitlement on which communities could rely in 
</p>
<p>respect of their members&#8217; right to freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>31. In this context, the term &#8220;recognition&#8221;, often mentioned in conversations, may 
</p>
<p>warrant a short clarification. The exercise of the human right to freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief, by individuals and/or in community with others, cannot be made dependent on any 
</p>
<p>specific acts of administrative recognition, allowance or approval. As a universal right, 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief inheres in all human beings and thus has a normative status 
</p>
<p>prior to any administrative acts and procedures whatsoever. The preamble of the 1948 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights starts with the due &#8220;recognition of the inherent 
</p>
<p>dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 Article 16 (1) of Ordinance 21. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Obviously, &#8220;recognition&#8221; here points to the basic principle that any meaningful interaction 
</p>
<p>among human beings presupposes respect for human dignity and human rights. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Recognition&#8221; in this fundamental sense of respect for human dignity and human rights 
</p>
<p>thus precedes any &#8220;recognition&#8221; in terms of specific administrative acts.7  
</p>
<p>32. It should be clear that the right of an individual or group to their freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief can never be &#8220;created&#8221; by any administrative procedures. Rather, it is the other 
</p>
<p>way around: registration should serve this human right, which itself must be respected as 
</p>
<p>preceding any registration. On the basis of this general understanding, registration should 
</p>
<p>be an offer by the State but not a compulsory legal requirement. The situation of 
</p>
<p>unregistered religious or belief communities thus assumes the quality of an important test 
</p>
<p>question about the understanding of the normative status of freedom of religion or belief in 
</p>
<p>general. 
</p>
<p>33. The second point that the Special Rapporteur would like to make concerns the 
</p>
<p>availability of some alternative legal personality status for communities that are not 
</p>
<p>registered as religious organizations. Given the rather high threshold set out by article 16 of 
</p>
<p>the Ordinance, it seems important that religious or belief communities have a reliable 
</p>
<p>option to obtain some alternative form of legal personality status, if they so wish.  
</p>
<p>34. Under freedom of religion or belief, States have a responsibility to provide an 
</p>
<p>appropriate legal and institutional infrastructure that facilitates the free functioning of 
</p>
<p>religious and belief communities without undue burdens and without discrimination. This 
</p>
<p>includes the option for religious and belief communities to obtain legal personality status, 
</p>
<p>which they may need to undertake important community functions, such as purchasing real 
</p>
<p>estate, employing professional staff, operating charity organizations, establishing training 
</p>
<p>institutions for clergy or educating the younger generation. Without the availability and 
</p>
<p>actual accessibility of an appropriate legal personality status, such acts can only be 
</p>
<p>undertaken by private individuals who take it upon themselves to do this in the interest of 
</p>
<p>the community. As a result, the long-term development prospects of religious and belief 
</p>
<p>communities, in particular smaller groups, may be in serious peril.  
</p>
<p>35. After the various discussions held with Government representatives on the issue of 
</p>
<p>registration, the Special Rapporteur is convinced that this is an area of concern that requires 
</p>
<p>legislative and other measures. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Issue of legal recourse 
</b></p>
<p>36. Article 30 of the 2013 Constitution enshrines the right of everyone to lodge 
</p>
<p>complaints and denunciations with competent State authorities. Indeed, any efficient 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, largely depends on the 
</p>
<p>availability of suitable legal recourse. Everyone should have recourse to legal instruments 
</p>
<p>without being required to meet undue thresholds or burdens. They should be able to 
</p>
<p>challenge decisions taken by the authorities if they feel their rights have been infringed 
</p>
<p>upon. Independent courts should be entrusted with the assessment of such complaints in 
</p>
<p>accordance with all principles of due process. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur has not come across any cases in which people have 
</p>
<p>successfully challenged alleged infringements of their rights to freedom of belief and 
</p>
<p>religion within the judiciary. Members of the People&#8217;s Supreme Court were not aware of a 
</p>
<p>single successful case either. The Special Rapporteur finds this very surprising, especially 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 7 See the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/19/60), including a thematic focus on the issue of 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief and recognition issues.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>against the background of a number of conflicts over land issues that have been brought to 
</p>
<p>his attention. Some of these conflicts apparently involve a dimension of freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>or belief, for instance, when land previously used for religious cemeteries or places of 
</p>
<p>worship was taken away for purposes of economic development. 
</p>
<p>38. When discussing the issue of legal recourse, reference was usually made to the 
</p>
<p>possibility of administrative procedures, that is, filing petitions addressed to authorities, 
</p>
<p>from the local level to higher levels of the administration. However, this option cannot 
</p>
<p>count as equivalent to an independent judiciary in charge of securing the human rights of 
</p>
<p>everyone, including in situations of conflict between individuals or groups of people and 
</p>
<p>the administration.  
</p>
<p>39. Although the Special Rapporteur heard about a few cases in which petitions filed 
</p>
<p>with higher authorities, including the Prime Minister, had helped to ease conflicts, in many 
</p>
<p>other cases, petitioners had not seen any reaction at all. In yet other cases, the higher level 
</p>
<p>of the authorities had merely referred the issues back to the local authorities for 
</p>
<p>reconsideration, potentially putting the case in a kind of limbo. From the perspective of the 
</p>
<p>rule of law, this situation is far from satisfactory. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Autonomy of religious and belief communities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Negative attitudes towards unrecognized religious communities 
</b></p>
<p>40. Government representatives repeatedly emphasized that, while recognizing the 
</p>
<p>spiritual needs of the people, religions should contribute to consolidating the unity of the 
</p>
<p>nation as a whole, not least by promoting social values. This expectation seems to be made 
</p>
<p>on the assumption that religious values, civic values and the values inherent in Marxist-
</p>
<p>Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s thoughts8 largely overlap. Hence, religious 
</p>
<p>communities are expected to play a role in teaching, preaching and sustaining such values 
</p>
<p>as provided in article 2 of Ordinance 21, which states that &#8220;[d]ignitaries and clergypersons 
</p>
<p>shall have the responsibility to educate regularly believers about patriotism, exercise of 
</p>
<p>civic rights and obligations, and the sense of law observance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>41. Some religions or denominations have become members of the Fatherland Front, a 
</p>
<p>mass organization led by the Communist Party of Viet Nam. One of the biggest religious 
</p>
<p>organizations within the Fatherland Front is the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha. It is also the 
</p>
<p>sole legitimate religious organization and representative of the Vietnamese Buddhist 
</p>
<p>monks, nuns and followers in Viet Nam and overseas. The Committee for Solidarity of 
</p>
<p>Vietnamese Catholics also cooperates with the Fatherland Front in its capacity as a Catholic 
</p>
<p>association. There are also other religious organizations under the Fatherland Front.  
</p>
<p>42. During discussions with the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha at its central office in 
</p>
<p>Hanoi, the Special Rapporteur learned that the organization comprised nine schools of 
</p>
<p>Buddhism originating from the Mahayana tradition, which is dominant in Viet Nam, as well 
</p>
<p>as the Theravada tradition, Hoa Hao and others. By cooperating in a spirit of solidarity, the 
</p>
<p>different schools of Buddhism were able to maintain their distinctive characteristics and 
</p>
<p>identities to a certain extent, including different linguistic heritages.  
</p>
<p>43. However, while acknowledging the internal diversity within the Viet Nam Buddhist 
</p>
<p>Sangha, the Special Rapporteur noticed a remarkably dismissive attitude towards Buddhist 
</p>
<p>practices outside of the organization. Some dignitaries operating within the organization 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 See article 4, para. 1, of 2013 Constitution. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>claimed they had never heard of any independent Buddhist groups in Viet Nam. Others 
</p>
<p>alluded to mere &#8220;private opinions&#8221; of some individuals driven by morally problematic 
</p>
<p>ambitions that were not worthy of serious attention. The ascription of trivial &#8220;selfish&#8221; 
</p>
<p>interests, such as &#8220;personal ambition&#8221;, &#8220;greed&#8221; or &#8220;material benefits&#8221; coming from foreign 
</p>
<p>donors, to people who practise Buddhism or other religions outside of the official channels 
</p>
<p>was a feature that came up frequently in conversations.  
</p>
<p>44. In this context, the Special Rapporteur asked officials on several occasions whether 
</p>
<p>it seemed at least conceivable to them that the insistence on independent religious 
</p>
<p>community life could also originate from more respectable motives, to which he never 
</p>
<p>received a clear positive answer. This consistently negative attitude towards independent 
</p>
<p>religious communities coincides with the regular invocation of &#8220;majority interests&#8221;, which, 
</p>
<p>it was assumed, should prevail over the rights and interests of minorities or dissenting 
</p>
<p>individuals. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize in this context that freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief is not merely a minority issue.9 As a human right, it relates to all human 
</p>
<p>beings, regardless of whether they follow a majority religion or belong to a minority 
</p>
<p>community or to no religious community at all. The treatment of minorities, however, 
</p>
<p>deserves particular attention, since it is usually indicative of the general &#8212; tolerant or less 
</p>
<p>tolerant &#8212; climate in a society. The same is true with regard to individual religious 
</p>
<p>dissidents, that is, individuals who hold positions not in line with mainstream communities 
</p>
<p>and their official organizations. Where minority communities can operate freely and 
</p>
<p>independently and where dissident positions can be voiced without fear, members of a 
</p>
<p>majority typically also have more space for practising their religion in the way they see fit.  
</p>
<p>46. Moreover, respect for the views of individuals, including dissident views, facilitates 
</p>
<p>the free flow of ideas in a society in general, thereby also enriching the interaction of 
</p>
<p>people within the majority. However, the Special Rapporteur noticed that, in some 
</p>
<p>discussions, &#8220;majority interests&#8221; were invoked with the obvious intention to dismiss claims 
</p>
<p>of minorities or dissenting individuals as irrelevant or even to delegitimize them as morally 
</p>
<p>problematic. This was also the case in discussions concerning independent religious 
</p>
<p>communities, such as the Unified Buddhist Church of Viet Nam, certain ethnic minority 
</p>
<p>Buddhist groups (some of whom identified themselves as &#8220;Khmer Krom&#8221; Buddhists), 
</p>
<p>independent groups of Hoa Hao and Cao Dai, Protestants, Duong Van Minh and Falun 
</p>
<p>Gong.  
</p>
<p>47. During his meetings with representatives of independent Buddhist communities, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur heard complaints of ongoing heavy repression that prevented 
</p>
<p>individuals from exercising their freedom of religion or belief in even a minimal way. The 
</p>
<p>general attitude of delegitimizing non-official religious practices, which he encountered in 
</p>
<p>many conversations, clearly indicated that independent Buddhist communities currently 
</p>
<p>could not exercise their freedom of religion or belief. Moreover, some Buddhist monks who 
</p>
<p>identified themselves as Khmer Krom expressed their wish to have more autonomy not 
</p>
<p>only within the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha but also outside of the official Buddhist 
</p>
<p>umbrella organization. The situation of the independent communities of Hoa Hao 
</p>
<p>Buddhism also seems to be similarly difficult. 
</p>
<p>48. A religion hardly known outside of Viet Nam is Cao Daism, which combines 
</p>
<p>traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism and Christianity with some new teachings. 
</p>
<p>As in the case of Buddhism, Cao Dai followers are divided between those who are part of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See the report of the Special Rapporteur (A/HRC/22/51), including a thematic focus on the issue of 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief of persons belonging to religious minorities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>the Government-established Cao Dai Administrative Council and those who insist on their 
</p>
<p>independent religious practice. The relationship between the two groups seems to be tense. 
</p>
<p>Whereas the officially recognized organizations of Cao Dai accuse dissenting groups of 
</p>
<p>having a &#8220;separatist mind&#8221; and creating &#8220;confusion&#8221; among the people, the independent 
</p>
<p>Cao Dai followers see the authenticity of their tradition jeopardized by Government 
</p>
<p>interference, which, they claim, has led to some imposed changes of the Cao Dai religion.  
</p>
<p>49. While the Special Rapporteur is not in a position to assess the theological details of 
</p>
<p>this conflict, he would expect that the Government ensure the free functioning of 
</p>
<p>independent Cao Dai communities and facilitate their development in a way that they 
</p>
<p>themselves see fit. The current situation of independent Cao Dai groups is certainly not in 
</p>
<p>line with freedom of religion or belief, since the communities lack appropriate facilities for 
</p>
<p>worship and teaching and allegedly face pressure to join the official organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Religious education and training  
</b></p>
<p>50. Articles 19 and 20 of the Education Law 2005 prohibit the preaching of religion in 
</p>
<p>schools and other educational institutions in Viet Nam. The Law nonetheless promotes 
</p>
<p>&#8220;good customs&#8221; of different beliefs and festivities while warning against &#8220;superstitions&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>those beliefs and practices considered as bad customs. 
</p>
<p>51. Meanwhile, the number of training institutions for the clergy of different religions 
</p>
<p>has increased significantly in recent decades. According to information provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government, there are 46 religious training institutions in the country. While religious 
</p>
<p>communities decide on the main parts of the curriculum, such as the teaching of theological 
</p>
<p>doctrines, practices and ceremonies and the history of the community, the curriculum also 
</p>
<p>includes mandatory courses on the history and laws of Viet Nam provided for and overseen 
</p>
<p>by the Ministry of Education and Training, as required by articles 14 and 15 of Decree 92. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also learned that Marxism or Leninism was part of the compulsory 
</p>
<p>curriculum. 
</p>
<p>52. Apart from training institutions, religious or denominational schools do not exist in 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. However, the Catholic Church operates a number of kindergartens, apparently 
</p>
<p>often in connection to a monastic order. These kindergartens accept children from different 
</p>
<p>religious backgrounds in addition to Catholicism. Several religious organizations expressed 
</p>
<p>their wish to establish institutions of higher learning, which is currently very difficult and 
</p>
<p>requires long negotiation with the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Appointment of clergy 
</b></p>
<p>53. According to the Government, religious communities can appoint and ordain their 
</p>
<p>clergy in accordance with their own internal rules and laws. They reportedly do not need 
</p>
<p>approval for their decisions from the authorities in general. However, communities are 
</p>
<p>required to register ordained clergy and notify the authorities. Article 22 of Ordinance 21 
</p>
<p>requires that the appointed persons be Vietnamese citizens, having good ethical qualities 
</p>
<p>and spirit of national unity and harmony. Such vague requirements seem disproportionate 
</p>
<p>and it is not the role of State to interfere in the internal affairs of the organizations. 
</p>
<p>Concerning dismissals of clergy or monks, which are apparently rare, decisions are also 
</p>
<p>generally taken by religious communities, in accordance with their religious laws. 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur also came across allegations of Government interference 
</p>
<p>in some cases of defrocking monks. Although he was not able to establish the details 
</p>
<p>required for a clear assessment of individual cases, he is convinced that the very limited 
</p>
<p>options for autonomous religious community life certainly lead to structural vulnerability, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>that is, situations in which appointments or dismissals may be de facto largely influenced 
</p>
<p>by the interests of the Government. However, article 6 (g) of the 1981 Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or 
</p>
<p>Belief10 explicitly guarantees the freedom to &#8220;train, appoint, elect or designate by 
</p>
<p>succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion 
</p>
<p>or belief&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. The situation of the Catholic Church demonstrates some exceptional features since 
</p>
<p>the ordainment of bishops is carried out by the Holy See, that is, a &#8220;foreign&#8221; authority based 
</p>
<p>outside of Viet Nam. The Catholic Church in Viet Nam sees itself as part of the universal 
</p>
<p>church. Against this background, the appointment and ordainment of bishops has led to 
</p>
<p>some controversies. Although Viet Nam and the Holy See still do not maintain official 
</p>
<p>diplomatic relations, their relationship has much improved in recent years, and high ranking 
</p>
<p>delegations have met on numerous occasions, including a meeting between the Pope and 
</p>
<p>the Prime Minister in October 2014. While the Government continues to claim a power of 
</p>
<p>veto over the ordainment of bishops, pragmatic solutions can reportedly be negotiated. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Property and land issues  
</b></p>
<p>55. During the visit, many property issues were brought to the attention of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, not only by members of unrecognized communities, but also by representatives 
</p>
<p>of communities that are officially recognized and members of the Fatherland Front. Many 
</p>
<p>of the property claims concerned real estate and/or land. In the interest of economic 
</p>
<p>development and other modernization projects, some religious communities have lost or are 
</p>
<p>in danger of losing large parts of their land, along with places of worship of historical 
</p>
<p>value.11 The Special Rapporteur heard multiple requests from religious communities, 
</p>
<p>including some that were recognized, to repossess the property and land in order to be fully 
</p>
<p>operational. 
</p>
<p>56. Property disputes require precise information on complicated details; the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur therefore limits himself to a few general remarks. The availability of real estate 
</p>
<p>and land is one of the basic preconditions for religious community life. Clear and well-
</p>
<p>established ownership furthermore becomes an important factor defining the autonomy or 
</p>
<p>lack of autonomy of religious communities. The fact that, in Viet Nam, all lands are 
</p>
<p>managed by the State and no one can own any land creates an additional element of legal 
</p>
<p>insecurity for communities, including officially registered communities, as the State can 
</p>
<p>take back land whenever it seems opportune. Moreover, some communities, such as the 
</p>
<p>Chams, who profess a combination of Hinduism and Islam, show a strong cultural or 
</p>
<p>religious attachment to particular pieces of land, for instance, the burial places of their 
</p>
<p>ancestors. 
</p>
<p>57. Government representatives openly admitted that land conflicts existed in Viet Nam, 
</p>
<p>as in many other countries. At the same time, they questioned whether such conflicts could 
</p>
<p>in any sense affect freedom of religion or belief. At least in some cases, however, religious

</p>
<p> 11 For example, in 2007, the local government of Da Nang city announced a plan to expropriate the Con 
</p>
<p>Dau village. Compensation was poor and the request of the parishioners to be resettled near their 
</p>
<p>church was rejected twice. By 2013, hundreds of residents had moved out under threats and 
</p>
<p>harassment or after their homes had been forcibly demolished. Concerns were expressed that the 
</p>
<p>forced eviction of the residents of Con Dau would seriously disrupt the cultural and religious life of 
</p>
<p>the community (see A/HRC/27/72, case VNM 3/2014). See also the case of Lien Tri Pagoda 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/85, case VNM 11/2014).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>demands obviously played an important role in land issues. For instance, representatives of 
</p>
<p>Protestant groups spoke about cases in rural areas in which different Protestant parishes 
</p>
<p>were merged into one single parish for purposes of &#8220;easier management&#8221;. Reportedly, such 
</p>
<p>merging was not always handled with due respect for the distinct features of different 
</p>
<p>Protestant denominations and the religious needs of parishioners of different locations. 
</p>
<p>Managerial advantages and interests in using land for various economic purposes often 
</p>
<p>seem to trump people&#8217;s freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>58. Conflicts over land issues always require sensitive handling in order to provide 
</p>
<p>acceptable solutions for all interested parties. The Government emphasized that it provided 
</p>
<p>land for the use of religious communities with tax exemptions. However, the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned lack of effective legal recourse, in particular within the judiciary, has strong 
</p>
<p>relevance also for the situation of land and other property issues related to religious 
</p>
<p>communities. In conversations with representatives of various religious communities, again 
</p>
<p>including communities that cooperate with the Government within the Fatherland Front, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur noticed high degrees of frustration about inefficient legal procedures. 
</p>
<p>As a result, some religious communities felt they were largely left at the mercy of local 
</p>
<p>authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Religious practices in particular circumstances 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prison inmates 
</b></p>
<p>59. As mentioned above, article 24 of the 2013 Constitution refers to all human beings 
</p>
<p>rather than to citizens only. This would include prisoners who, even if they may have 
</p>
<p>temporarily lost their full rights as citizens, should in any case benefit from the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief as a universal human right inherent in all human beings. When 
</p>
<p>discussing this issue, the Special Rapporteur received conflicting information. Government 
</p>
<p>agencies generally emphasized that prison inmates could practise their religion within the 
</p>
<p>confines of the prison provided this does not negatively affect other prisoners and the 
</p>
<p>general functions of prison life.  
</p>
<p>60. By contrast, some individuals with knowledge and experiences of prison life alleged 
</p>
<p>that religious practices were hardly accommodated in prisons and that even the reception 
</p>
<p>and possession of religious books or materials would usually be prohibited. When asked 
</p>
<p>about this issue, a high-ranking representative of the Government Committee on Religious 
</p>
<p>Affairs told the Special Rapporteur that prisoners&#8217; freedom of religion or belief should be 
</p>
<p>respected, while admitting that the Committee so far had not given any instructions to 
</p>
<p>prison managements in order to secure an effective protection of freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief for prison inmates. 
</p>
<p>61. The institution of prison chaplains, that is, clergy of different religions, who cater for 
</p>
<p>the spiritual needs of prison inmates, on their requests, does not exist in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>However, representatives of the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha explained they would 
</p>
<p>increasingly offer services in prisons, including lectures for the social and moral edification 
</p>
<p>of prisoners. Catholic priests, too, seem to have occasionally offered religious services to 
</p>
<p>prison inmates. Protestant pastors with whom the Special Rapporteur discussed this issue 
</p>
<p>said they were not aware of any spiritual assistance given to Protestant prison inmates. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Soldiers  
</b></p>
<p>62. The Vietnamese military does not have a system of military chaplains who regularly 
</p>
<p>cater for the religious or spiritual needs of soldiers. Similar to the situation in prisons, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>however, the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha seems to have become increasingly involved. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was told that Buddhist monks prayed for soldiers who serve the nation 
</p>
<p>under complicated conditions. They may also teach meditation technics that can help 
</p>
<p>soldiers to better come to terms with their difficult task and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>63. The right to conscientious objection to compulsory military service is not known in 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam, and the option of an alternative civilian service for individuals who object to 
</p>
<p>taking arms for conscientious reasons does not exist. This contravenes the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of thought, conscience and religion or belief, which provides protection, consistent with 
</p>
<p>article 18, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant, against being forced to act in 
</p>
<p>contrary to genuinely held religious or moral belief.12 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Reports about violations of freedom of religion or belief  
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur has received serious allegations concerning violations of 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion or belief in Viet Nam. Reported violations are often perpetrated by 
</p>
<p>local authorities at the commune, district and provincial levels and public security officials, 
</p>
<p>including those belonging to Unit 41/PA 38, who are assigned to monitor social issues and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;detect people who violate freedom of religion or belief&#8221;. Some attacks have been 
</p>
<p>particularly violent in nature and perpetuated against innocent and unarmed people, 
</p>
<p>including women and children. 
</p>
<p>65. Leading Buddhist clerics, monks and nuns of the Unified Buddhist Church of Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam have been subjected to surveillance, police &#8220;work sessions&#8221; (interrogations), arbitrary 
</p>
<p>arrest and detention, house arrests and long-term imprisonment.13 Lay followers have been 
</p>
<p>forbidden from accessing its pagodas, forced to sign a declaration that they would not join 
</p>
<p>the organization or threatened with the loss of their jobs. Furthermore, relevant authorities 
</p>
<p>have issued propaganda against the organization. Educational and health establishments and 
</p>
<p>places of worship belonging to these communities have been confiscated. 
</p>
<p>66. The independent communities of Hoa Hao Buddhism, who have engaged in peaceful 
</p>
<p>forms of protest, such as hunger strikes, have been harshly punished, including with 
</p>
<p>repeated or long-term imprisonment.14 Security agents and hired thugs have reportedly not 
</p>
<p>hesitated to use excessive force during arrests or attacks of these communities for 
</p>
<p>organizing gatherings to pray at so-called &#8220;illegal minarets&#8221; that were built for religious 
</p>
<p>congregation purposes. 
</p>
<p>67. Some &#8220;Khmer Krom&#8221; Buddhists have faced similar difficulties in getting permission 
</p>
<p>to organize prayers, funerals or renovate their temples, even though they have been 
</p>
<p>recognized by the Viet Nam Buddhist Sangha. It has also been reported that they have been 
</p>
<p>systematically discriminated against and many have not been allowed to study or teach in 
</p>
<p>their local native language. Every aspect of their religious life is regulated and monks risk 
</p>
<p>being disrobed if found to have been in contact with foreign countries.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See A/HRC/7/10/Add.2, para. 46 and A/HRC/10/8/Add.4, para. 51. 
</p>
<p> 13 In early January 2014, members of the Unified Buddhist Church of Viet Nam executive were 
</p>
<p>subjected to police harassment and placed under house arrest. The security police purportedly 
</p>
<p>prevented the new Church leadership from organizing a memorial day ceremony on 10 January 2014 
</p>
<p>and subsequently intercepted members of the Church and prevented them from attending the 
</p>
<p>celebrations. Several leaders of the Church youth movement were also harassed and placed under 
</p>
<p>house arrest (see A/HRC/26/21, case VNM 2/2014). 
</p>
<p> 14 See, for example, A/HRC/28/85, case VNM 10/2014. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>68. None of the practices of the independent Cao Dai religion have been authorized, and 
</p>
<p>the religion itself is considered illegal. Followers of Cao Dai encounter difficulties even to 
</p>
<p>practise at home. Like other independent communities, they have been pressured, harassed 
</p>
<p>and attacked physically. Their ritual ceremonies, including funerals, have often been 
</p>
<p>monitored and disrupted. Moreover, they constantly fear losing their jobs and being 
</p>
<p>discriminated against in administrative procedures. Some of their children have also faced 
</p>
<p>difficulty at school. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur has also heard about the harsh persecution of the followers 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;Montagnard&#8221; churches, such as the Ede ethnic minority. Hundreds of ethnic minority 
</p>
<p>churches in the Central Highlands region have been forced to close and their pastors 
</p>
<p>arrested and imprisoned. Thousands have been forced to flee or go into hiding after mass 
</p>
<p>protests calling for land rights and religious freedom. Those who fled to neighbouring 
</p>
<p>countries face many obstacles and continue to fear for their lives. It was also reported that, 
</p>
<p>in 2000, the Government issued documents instructing local officials overseen by the 
</p>
<p>Guidance Committee to stop the spread of Protestantism.  
</p>
<p>70. According to information received, even though some Hmong Protestants have been 
</p>
<p>allowed to register with the Government to conduct religious activities, they continue to be 
</p>
<p>subjected to harassment and slander. Allegedly, the authorities have found pretexts to arrest 
</p>
<p>them, beat them severely in police custody and force them to recant. There has even been a 
</p>
<p>reported case of a death in police custody. In some villages, rules have been created to 
</p>
<p>punish converts by forced eviction. They are also not allowed to own bibles in their native 
</p>
<p>Hmong language or to use their local language to conduct religious activities. 
</p>
<p>71. Hmongs of the Duong Van Minh faith have also been subjected to arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detentions and imprisonment, beatings, torture, constant monitoring, and pressure to 
</p>
<p>renounce their faith. Those who have refused to do so face losing their jobs and the social 
</p>
<p>benefits provided to ethnic minorities. Reportedly, 24 of their funeral sheds have been 
</p>
<p>destroyed for being &#8220;illegitimate&#8221;, that is, without a permit, including the most recent 
</p>
<p>destruction in October 2014, after the country visit of the Special Rapporteur. The 
</p>
<p>Government has also allegedly spread propaganda against this community through the 
</p>
<p>media and internal gazettes of the Government. 
</p>
<p>72. Cham communities are facing the threat of losing their land, especially their sacred 
</p>
<p>ancestral cemeteries that have been passed down from generation to generation. New 
</p>
<p>development projects, including road constructions, have failed to consult with the 
</p>
<p>communities or respect the needs of the communities to relocate tombs by conducting 
</p>
<p>appropriate traditional rituals. It was also reported that, owing to the resistance of the 
</p>
<p>communities to relocate the cemeteries, all mosques were allegedly locked up during 
</p>
<p>Ramadan and would only be accessible if they agreed to the relocation plan. Some temple 
</p>
<p>towers of the Chams have been turned into tourist attractions, which is considered utterly 
</p>
<p>inappropriate by the community as these sacred places of worship should usually remain 
</p>
<p>closed. They have also failed to register themselves despite many attempts. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur heard many accounts of arbitrary arrests or house arrests 
</p>
<p>and recurring detentions, including some disproportionately long prison sentences given to 
</p>
<p>individuals from different religious or belief backgrounds for the advocacy of their 
</p>
<p>religious freedom or activities. Often, they were charged under article 258 of the Penal 
</p>
<p>Code with &#8220;offending democracy&#8221;, &#8220;partaking in a separatist movement&#8221; or &#8220;distorting a 
</p>
<p>situation and criticizing the Government&#8221;, simply for exercising their rights to freedom of 
</p>
<p>religion or belief, freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of assembly and 
</p>
<p>association in a peaceful manner. The Special Rapporteur met with Nguyen Van Ly in Nam </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Ha Prison, whom he would without doubt recognize as a prisoner of conscience or political 
</p>
<p>prisoner.15 To his dismay, Father Ly is possibly one of the many more prisoners or 
</p>
<p>detainees of conscience that exist in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>74. Other individuals, for example, members of the Evangelical Mennonite Church for 
</p>
<p>example, have also suffered frequent heavy-handed police raids; repeated invitations to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;work sessions&#8221; with the police; torture during detention; pressure exercised on family 
</p>
<p>members, especially those of religiously persecuted refugees; acts of vandalism and the 
</p>
<p>destruction of places of worship, cemeteries and funeral sheds and homes; confiscation of 
</p>
<p>property; and systematic pressure to give up certain religious activities and denounce their 
</p>
<p>religion or belief. As a result of pressure and persecution, some people have left or fled the 
</p>
<p>country on religious grounds. The Special Rapporteur would also like to underline that 
</p>
<p>official registration status with the Government is no guarantee that freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief is fully respected. 
</p>
<p>75. The purpose of a country visit by the Special Rapporteurs is not to make 
</p>
<p>comprehensive assessments of individual cases as this would require much more 
</p>
<p>information in order to get the full picture of relevant facts from the perspectives of all 
</p>
<p>involved parties. Instead, the purpose is to assess the general credibility of different 
</p>
<p>allegations concerning human rights problems and identify major challenges. Without 
</p>
<p>prejudice to the accuracy of all specific facts of all individual cases brought to his attention, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur is convinced that serious violations of freedom of religion or belief 
</p>
<p>are a reality in Viet Nam, in particular, but not only, in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>76. This general assessment is made on the basis of not only interviews and documents 
</p>
<p>provided by human rights defenders and members of different religious communities, but 
</p>
<p>also observations made during the country visit, including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The generally dismissive, negative attitude towards the rights of minorities and 
</p>
<p>individuals practising religions or beliefs that are not registered  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The frequent invocation of unspecified &#8220;majority interests&#8221; or interests of &#8220;national 
</p>
<p>unity and harmony&#8221; or &#8220;public disorder&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Overly broad provisions for the limitation of human rights in general, hence 
</p>
<p>restricting freedom of belief and religion in all aspects  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Vague formulations within the Viet Nam Penal Code, in particular article 258 
</p>
<p>concerning the &#8220;abuse&#8221; of democratic freedoms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The absence of sufficiently efficient and accessible legal recourse within the 
</p>
<p>judiciary 
</p>
<p>77. These conditions create a structural vulnerability for certain individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities that actually matches the reports of specific violations described above. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline in this context that, in his many 
</p>
<p>discussions with members of religious communities, some of which are formally registered 
</p>
<p>with the authorities and cooperate within the Fatherland Front, people have shown a general 
</p>
<p>awareness of ongoing restrictions of freedom of religion or belief and the resulting 
</p>
<p>challenges. It is all the more surprising that leading members of the judiciary apparently 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 See the allegations of the Special Rapporteurs concerning the case (E/CN.4/1991/56, para. 86; 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/1993/62, para. 68; A/56/253, para. 77; A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 301-303; and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/16/53/Add.1, paras. 422-427) and the responses of the Government of Viet Nam 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/1994/79, para. 80; E/CN.4/2002/73, para. 114; A/HRC/7/10/Add.1, paras. 304-308; and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/16/53/Add.1, paras. 428-430). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>have never heard about any cases in which alleged infringements of freedom of religion or 
</p>
<p>belief have been brought before a court. 
</p>
<p>79. An important aspect that came up in many discussions concerns the divide between 
</p>
<p>urban and rural areas. The conditions of religious communities may vary considerably, 
</p>
<p>according to different practices in different parts of the country. Moreover, it seems that 
</p>
<p>policies at the central level are not always efficiently communicated to the authorities at the 
</p>
<p>local level, hence there is a gap between the understanding and the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>policies. However, it would not be fair to ascribe the existing problems mainly to 
</p>
<p>shortcomings only of local authorities. Central authorities should review their policies and 
</p>
<p>instructions to ensure that their implementation is compatible with international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. It is also not fair to blame the existing problems on the lack of education 
</p>
<p>of villagers or people in rural areas, because many of the described challenges are of a 
</p>
<p>systemic nature, as evidenced in respective domestic legal regulations. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The terms of reference for country visits by Special Rapporteurs include 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees concerning the </b>&#8220;confidential and unsupervised contact with witnesses and 
</p>
<p>other private persons&#8221; and <b>the </b>&#8220;assurance by the Government that n<b>o persons, official 
</b></p>
<p>or private individuals who have been in contact with the special rapporteur [&#8230;] in the 
</p>
<p><b>relation to the mandate will for this reason suffer threats, harassment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>or be subjected to judicial proceedings&#8221;. Serious incidents of <b>intimidation and cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a blatant breach of the principle of confidentiality unfortunately led to an incomplete 
</b></p>
<p><b>country visit to Viet Nam. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>This interruption is all the more regrettable as the Special Rapporteur had 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed some positive developments, in particular at the central level. Many 
</b></p>
<p><b>representatives of religious communities agreed that, in spite of ongoing serious 
</b></p>
<p><b>problems, their space for religious practices had increased in recent years. Religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities that had been forbidden after 1975 were now allowed to operate. Diverse 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious life has become a visible reality in all parts of the country, and different 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious communities coexist peacefully. Moreover, some representatives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government agencies expressed their willingness to consider substantive revisions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the current Ordinance on Beliefs and Religions in the process of preparing a draft law 
</b></p>
<p><b>on these issues.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>A litmus test for the development of freedom of religion or belief in Viet Nam is 
</b></p>
<p><b>the conditions of independent or unregistered religious communities. As elaborated 
</b></p>
<p><b>above, the exercise of freedom of religion or belief cannot be rendered dependent on 
</b></p>
<p><b>any particular acts of administrative approval; as a universal human right, it is 
</b></p>
<p><b>inherent in all human beings, prior to any acts of registration or official recognition. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Under the current situation, however, the possibilities of independent religious life are 
</b></p>
<p><b>unsafe and restricted, in clear violation of article 18 of the International Covenant on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Civil and Political Rights, to which Viet Nam has been a State Party since 1982. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>upcoming law on religious affairs, to be discussed and possibly enacted in 2016, offers 
</b></p>
<p><b>an opportunity to rectify this state of affairs.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Against this background, the Special Rapporteur would like to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations to the Government of Viet Nam: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Government is encouraged to broaden and solidify the very limited 
</b></p>
<p><b>and unsafe space provided for the free unfolding of religious diversity in Viet Nam. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>this context, the situation of independent religious or belief communities should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>seen as a test question indicative of the general societal tolerance;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/66/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Article 38 of the current Ordinance on Belief and Religion 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Ordinance 21), which provides for the prevalence of international treaties over 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflicting domestic legislation, should be implemented to the fullest. This requires 
</b></p>
<p><b>reforms both at the legislation and practical implementation levels;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Legal provisions related to freedom of religion or belief should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>brought in line with article 18 of the International Covenant. This includes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>unconditional protection of the <i>forum internum</i> dimension of freedom of religion or 
</b></p>
<p><b>belief as well as precise formulations of limitation clauses concerning religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations in the <i>forum externum</i>;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Vague formulations in the legal provisions that are used to limit freedom 
</b></p>
<p><b>of religion or belief and other human rights, such as those employed in article 258 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Penal Code regarding </b>the &#8220;abuse&#8221; of freedom, should be removed and replaced <b>by 
</b></p>
<p><b>precise legal definitions, in line with international standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The Government should clarify that the official registration of religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>or belief communities is an offer rather than a legal requirement. The envisaged new 
</b></p>
<p><b>law on religious affairs should simplify the registration requirements for the religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The Government Committee on Religious Affairs is encouraged to advise 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government on the draft law on the international standards that protect and 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote freedom of religion or belief. Proper legal training and instruction to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>local authorities on these issues must be provided accordingly;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Religious or belief communities that, for whatever reasons, do not have 
</b></p>
<p><b>or do not wish to have registration status under the current Ordinance 21 (or the 
</b></p>
<p><b>future law replacing the Ordinance), should have efficient access to an alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>form of legal personality status, which they may need to undertake important 
</b></p>
<p><b>community functions. This requires respective reforms of the law of associations, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>currently under discussion;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Restrictions imposed on religious communities under Ordinance 21 in 
</b></p>
<p><b>conjunction with Decree 92 should be substantially eased, in accordance with, inter 
</b></p>
<p><b>alia, the principle of proportionality, as enshrined in article 18 of the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Covenant.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Effective and accessible legal recourse must be prioritized in current 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal reforms in order to allow victims, whose freedom of religion or belief have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>infringed upon, to obtain redress and compensation within an independent judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system and judiciary; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) State officials and religious leaders should refrain from publicly 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacking independent religious groups, including through the media;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) The State should investigate allegations of violations of freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religion or belief and other human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Land issues involving religious communities, including cemeteries and 
</b></p>
<p><b>places of worship, should be handled in a fair and sensitive manner. Communities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>their representatives should have legal recourse to rectify decisions deemed to violate 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of religion or belief or other human rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) The Government is encouraged to further develop the landscape of 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious training institutions. The selection of candidates and programmatic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be entirely left to the religious communities that operate these institutions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(n) The Government is also encouraged to create more space for religious 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Intergovernmental organizations that deal with refugees from Viet Nam

</b></p>
<p><b>ongoing serious restrictions and persecution, in particular of independent religious 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Human Rights Council should act on allegations of intimidation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>reprisals taken against persons who have cooperated with mandate holders during 
</b></p>
<p><b>their visit;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The United Nations country team should consider integrating the 
</b></p>
<p><b>observations and recommendations in the present report to its common country 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the recommendations, along with those accepted recommendations
