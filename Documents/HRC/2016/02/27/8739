<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 8/4. 
The current Special Rapporteur decided to devote his sixth and last annual report to the 
question of the right to education of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. The focus is on 
those who have crossed national borders, who generally are at risk of marginalization and 
specifically to discrimination in the provision of education. The report aims to inform and 
assist Governments and interested parties in their efforts to address these matters and 
develop best practices so as to ensure the enjoyment of the currently unfulfilled right to 
education for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p> The report addresses six core issues, the consideration of which follows an analysis 
of the contextual background. Attention to these issues is viewed by the Special Rapporteur 
as indispensable in meeting the educational challenges and opportunities related to 
migration. These core, but inevitably interrelated, themes are: the legal and normative 
framework; social and cultural issues; language and curriculum; teachers; accreditation; 
and learning for life.

<p>GE.10-12879 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 8/4. 
Since presenting his previous report to the Council, the Special Rapporteur has undertaken 
missions to Paraguay (April 2009), Mongolia (October 2009) and Mexico (February 2010). 
The reports of these missions are contained in addenda to this report (A/HRC/14/25/Add.2 
to 4). He has participated in working meetings with Governments, United Nations and other 
specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations, universities, students, children and 
adolescents and national human rights institutions globally. At the invitation of the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), he undertook a visit to 
refugee camps in Uganda (January 2010). The Special Rapporteur also presented a report to 
the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly (A/64/273) that focused on the issue of 
lifelong learning. He underlined its mutual interdependence with human rights learning and 
drew attention to a number of concepts and initiatives concerning human rights learning 
that he has seen in practice.  
</p>
<p>2. Building upon the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s sustained focus on groups traditionally 
marginalized and vulnerable to discrimination in education, this report considers the 
situation of those who have crossed national borders &#8212; migrants, refugees and asylum-
seekers &#8212; and what this means for the enjoyment of their right to education and as learners 
over their lifetime. 
</p>
<p>3. Preparations for this report repeatedly raised issues of definition and the associated 
categorization of groups with &#8220;particular concerns&#8221;. Common definitions and particular 
concerns are frequently reflected in legal and political frameworks and the educational 
programming of Governments, intergovernmental agencies and civil society. They do not, 
however, adequately reflect the complexities associated with movement and migration of 
people across national borders, the histories of these movements and the social reality of 
those living this situation today. These complexities contribute to the processes of 
educational marginalization. 
</p>
<p>4. While the report, by necessity, draws on current definitions and programmes, a 
recurrent challenge runs throughout: in order to formulate adequate educational legislation, 
policy and programmes, how can the limitations of existing categories, typologies and legal 
status been worked with and gone beyond. Furthermore, in order to utilize existing 
expertise, capacities and experience, the focus should, on the one hand, be on augmenting 
and strengthening educational opportunities where they exist and, on the other hand, 
directly responding to the needs of individuals and institutions that are the result of cross-
border movements and migrations and associated challenges of equity in diversity. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has benefited greatly from the significant engagement of 
numerous relevant actors in the report process which has generated a wealth of different 
perspectives from which lessons can be learned and which form the basis of a number of 
recommendations. The Special Rapporteur extends his thanks to those who engaged in this 
context.   
</p>
<p>6. He extends his thanks to those who contributed to the international dissemination 
and completion of a questionnaire addressed to Governments,1 interested stakeholders and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 At the time of finalizing the report, the following Governments had responded: Albania, Australia, 
</p>
<p>Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, 
Lebanon, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Portugal, Qatar, Republic 
</p>
<p> </p>

</p>
<p>organizations.2 The questionnaire invited addressees to share a broad range of practices, 
experiences and expertise with the Special Rapporteur on the following: the demographic 
and sociological characteristics of cross-border migrants; the educational needs and 
challenges faced by migrant students and providers; the impact of the migrant presence on 
education services, provision and demand; and the relevant legal frameworks and their 
methods of application.  
</p>
<p>7. A specific aim of the questionnaire was to provide an opportunity for those in 
communities and geographical regions currently underrepresented in the local, national, 
regional and international systems to raise their concerns and issues in respect of the right 
to education for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. The Special Rapporteur considers 
that such opportunities should continue to be provided. 
</p>
<p>8. In order to accommodate the reporting requirements of the Human Rights Council, 
only those responses received at the time of finalizing the report could be reflected in the 
report. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur welcomes further responses. 
</p>
<p>9. Given the length constraints on the report, the Special Rapporteur felt that it was 
necessary to focus on some issues at the expense of others3 and to raise some other 
concerns only briefly. This report should therefore be read in the context of other thematic 
reports on the right to education; most specifically, those on gender, disability and 
education in emergencies4 or relevant peer-reviewed literature. It should also be viewed as a 
contribution towards an ongoing dialogue on the right to education for migrants, refugees 
and asylum-seekers.   
</p>
<p>10. An understanding of the contextual background is indispensable to meeting the 
educational challenges and opportunities of migration. This background is provided below 
and is followed by an analysis of the associated legal and normative framework. An 
examination of distinct but interrelated themes &#8212; social and cultural issues, language and 
curriculum, teachers, accreditation and learning for life &#8212; comprises the bulk of the report, 
which is followed by a number of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The contextual background 
</b></p>
<p>11. Historically, movement has defined ancient and modern societies. There are multiple 
reasons for these movements or migrations. They are the outcome of complex social, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>of Korea, Russian Federation, Serbia, Spain, Suriname, Switzerland, Syria, Thailand, Trinidad and 
Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Kingdom, Ukraine and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). 
Due to limited capacity for translation, the full content of some replies could not be reflected in the 
report. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The following national human rights institutions also provided replies: Egypt, France, India, Mexico, 
</p>
<p>Panama and South Africa. In addition, the Special Rapporteur also received replies from the 
following international organizations: UNHCR, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO), International Organization for Migration (IOM) and from the following 
NGOs: Amnesty International, Asociaci&#243;n de Derechos Civiles de Argentina, Asylum Access, 
Bertelsmann Foundation, Bureau International Catholique de l&#8217;Enfance (et al.), Children on the Edge, 
Defense for Children International, Dutch Refugee Council, Fe y Alegria, Foundation for the Refugee 
Education Trust, Gewerschaft Erziehung und Wissenschaft, Human Rights Watch, Hungarian 
Helsinki Committee, Joint Committee with Migrants in Korea, Jesuit Refugee Service, Platform for 
International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants and Save the Children. Numerous individuals 
also responded.

<p>GE.10-12879 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>political, economic and cultural phenomena that include political and economic projects 
aimed at searching beyond territorial boundaries and opening new markets, economic 
failure, social conflict, unpopular political regimes, persecution, natural or man-made 
catastrophes, or simply decisions of individuals and families to seek a better life elsewhere. 
Migrations always involve individuals and their rights and raise challenges as to how to 
build new ways of ensuring communities that acknowledge respect for diversity (cultural 
and linguistic), anchored in equity and solidarity.   
</p><p>12. Movements are often not one way, nor do they take one form. Some families and 
groups develop complex, embedded relations in multiple locations, with the result that they 
move between often quite distant, and distinctly different, communities with various social 
and cultural milieux. Other communities have a permanent orientation to moving, reflected 
by their deeply engrained way of life. Such longer-standing traditions challenge more 
modern ways of thinking about citizens and their rights as tied to nation States and realized 
as a result of the rights acquired at birth or by naturalization.  
</p>
<p>13. Movements also include movements of money, ideas, languages and other kinds of 
resources. Remittances, for instance, constitute a significant component of some countries&#8217; 
gross domestic product (GDP), although in the current financial climate they are a highly 
unstable flow of resources. Such resources are also difficult to access for the purpose of 
local and national development, and therefore unavailable as a means of securing social 
justice through redistribution. Resources, like language and cultural and social ties, do not 
always move easily; they have value, and can be culturally and socially leveraged to secure 
social mobility and social justice in one community, but not in another. Such differently 
valued linguistic and cultural knowledge and resources make it difficult for those who 
move over borders &#8212; in this case migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers &#8212; to easily 
integrate into new communities. As a result, their contribution to the community as a whole 
is hindered. Indeed, in many cases, the presence (and in some cases size) of migrant, 
refugee and asylum-seeker populations are viewed as a threat to existing communities, 
generating xenophobic and racist reactions.  
</p>
<p>14. At particular points in time, unprecedented numbers of individuals, families or large 
populations move either willingly or unwillingly across territorial borders. Current 
processes associated with economic, political, technological and cultural globalization &#8212; 
the result of changes in the organization of the global economy and new threats to world 
order and security &#8212; have resulted in major upheavals and the fracturing of existing 
communities and family relations. Many developed economies, themselves facing major 
demographic declines and new economic competitiveness challenges, are also favouring 
policies that seek to attract highly skilled labour and talented students. Yet, with around 
half of the world&#8217;s refugees residing in cities and towns,5 how might these populations gain 
access to relevant education and training programmes that enable them to contribute in 
more meaningful ways to local economic and community development?  
</p>
<p>15. Despite considerable challenges in collecting accurate data because of the very 
nature of (often forced) migration and challenges presented by immigration laws forcing 
people into illegality, a rapid increase in the number of migrants can be observed &#8211; from 82 
million persons in the early 1970s living outside their country of origin for more than one 
year6 to nearly 200 million in 2007 (3 per cent of the world&#8217;s population of 6.5 billion). 
UNHCR places the number higher than this; it argues that there are 214 million

<p>international migrants in the world in 2010, or about 3.1 per cent of the world&#8217;s population. 
Almost half (47 per cent) are women, and 44 per cent are children under the age of 18.7 
UNHCR estimates the number of refugees and asylum-seekers to be 16 million.8 
</p>
<p>16. Today, some 60 per cent of the world&#8217;s migrants live in the developed world, yet 
they do not always share the wealth of those societies and, in many cases, enjoyment of 
their basic rights as citizens is highly problematic. Conversely, 80 per cent of all refugees 
are hosted by countries of the South, which shows that a disproportionate burden is carried 
by those least able to afford it.9 About 10&#8211;15 per cent of migration involves migration 
under irregular conditions.10 For 2008, remittance flows were estimated at US$ 444 billion 
worldwide, of which US$ 338 billion went to developing countries.11 The International 
Labour Organization indicates that the US$ 250 billion of remittances effected in 2005 
exceeds the sum of all official development assistance and foreign direct investment.12 
Compounding this issue is the fact that developing countries lose around 10&#8211;30 per cent of 
skilled workers and professionals through a constant &#8220;brain drain&#8221;,13 with the result that 
their knowledge and skills are not available for economic development projects.  
</p><p>17. Whatever the reasons behind these forced movements and migrations, new 
challenges are faced, including how individuals (children and adults alone), families and 
communities can realize their fundamental human rights, in particular the right to 
protection, education and dignity, and how best to enhance the many dimensions and 
opportunities inherent in diversity. Women, men, boys and girls of all ages and 
backgrounds &#8212; whether migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, stateless persons, returnees or 
internally displaced persons &#8212; have the right to education, and particularly those forms of 
education which are most likely to contribute to realizing individual capabilities, on the one 
hand, and shared norms of respect and social justice, on the other. This report shows that 
the international community too easily tolerates the many violations of this right.  
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the forced movement or 
migration of populations over national borders. Such vulnerable population groups14 need 
the full attention of the international community and should fall into the target group of the 
objectives set by Education for All goals for 2015, in the realization of the national and 
international education obligations.

<p>GE.10-12879 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. The legal and normative framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur on the right to education associates the fundamental right to 
education with the non-discriminatory right to free education, which includes direct (fees, 
transport, textbooks, etc.) and indirect (opportunity) costs (foregone earnings and work-
related learning).  
</p><p>20. The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to the 1948 Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (art. 26), which views the right to education as comprising: (a) fundamental 
education, which refers to free, often non-formal education for illiterate people, with a 
strong collective and cultural emphasis for human development (&#8220;community education&#8221;); 
and (b) elementary education, i.e., free compulsory formal education which, while not 
specifying any particular level(s) or stage(s), normatively integrated free post-primary 
education.15 Article 26 of the Declaration, and subsequent international human rights law,16 
also guarantee the right of parents and legal guardians to choose their children&#8217;s education 
in conformity with their religious, moral or philosophical convictions. States, however, are 
not legally obliged to provide instruction in line with such choices.17 
</p>
<p>21. The right to education has subsequently been enshrined in a range of international 
conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(1966), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) and, more recently, the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families (1990). Specific to refugee concerns are the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention, 1951) and its 1967 Protocol (arts. 4 
and 22), and the Convention against Discrimination in Education (1960, art. 4). 
</p><p>22. The Special Rapporteur also draws attention to a number of regional conventions 
which also make provision for the right to education, in particular Protocol 1 (1952, art. 2) 
of the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms which follows the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in normatively 
integrating all educational types and levels in the right to education; the 1996 European 
Social Charter (revised) (art. 17.2); the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (arts. 13 and 16); and 
the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (art. 11).  
23. A number of notable declarations and plans of action are also worth mentioning, 
although these do not carry the same binding obligations on States. The Special Rapporteur 
wishes to refer to the 1990 World Declaration on Education for All; the 2000 Dakar 
Framework for Action; the 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration; and the 2005 
World Summit Outcome (paras. 34, 43 and 44).18  
24. The Special Rapporteur notes that, over the decades, the formerly more 
comprehensive notion of the right to education has been reconceptualized. This 
reconceptualization has a particular geography to it. In the global developing world, this 
right has come to be normatively restricted to literacy and primary schooling (4&#8211;6 years), 
while in developed countries, it refers to compulsory primary and secondary schooling.

</p>
<p>Milestones in this process have been the Convention against Discrimination in Education 
and the declarations mentioned above. This progressive reduction in scope of the right to 
education in the South has been criticized for serving as a largely functional, basic-skill 
acquisition for low value-added routine work within the global division of labour.19 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur also observes with concern that increasingly, especially 
since the adoption of the World Declaration on Education for All, goodwill has become a 
substitute for entitlement. Frequently, the right to education has been replaced by legally 
non-binding terms such as &#8220;access to education&#8221;.20 This coincides with a general shift from 
a teacher-centred to a learner-centred approach, on one hand, and the redefinition of 
education, on the other. Here, education, for whose provision the State is primarily 
responsible, is being redefined as a commodity rather than a societal good, with the learner 
made responsible for this &#8211; portrayed as a consumer with choices. For the Special 
Rapporteur, this approach to education, particularly in the face of wider global challenges 
(sustainability, security and equality) is problematic.  
</p><p>26. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the international norms and instruments 
listed earlier pay little attention to the particular situation of the educational rights of 
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. The same is the case with many other instruments, 
such as the Convention concerning Migration for Employment (Revised 1949), the Geneva 
Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949), the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), 
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious or 
Linguistic Minorities (1992), and the European Charter for Regional or Minority 
Languages (1992). 
27. However, the Special Rapporteur observes that the Convention relating to the Status 
of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (arts. 4 and 22) and the Migrant Workers Convention 
reiterate the right to educational choice and the obligation of the contracting States to 
accord to refugees the same treatment as is accorded to nationals with respect to 
&#8220;elementary education&#8221;21 and to ensure &#8220;equal opportunities&#8221; with respect to non-
elementary education. This includes access, the recognition of certificates and diplomas, the 
remission of fees and charges and the award of scholarships. Moreover, in accordance with 
article 28.1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; in terms of the 
&#8220;best interest&#8221; principle may justify differential treatment of migrant, refugee and asylum-
seekers&#8217; children, such as mother-tongue teaching, provided that non-discrimination 
measures are in place,22 although in article 45.4 of the Migrant Workers Convention, there 
is no obligation for receiving States to provide special mother-tongue instruction schemes. 
</p>
<p>28. Furthermore, according to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its general 
comment No. 6 (2005), equality of treatment irrespective of nationality, immigration status 
or statelessness should also be guaranteed to unaccompanied and separated children. The 
Special Rapporteur notes, however, that, for some authors writing on education, the 
international legislation applicable to the situation of independent child migrants remains

<p>incomplete, as it fails to specifically and systematically address the circumstances of most 
unaccompanied child migrants.23  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the incomplete realization of the right 
to education of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers (or children thereof) of irregular 
status. The Special Rapporteur thus welcomes the increasing recognition of equality of 
treatment irrespective of legal status, as expressed in the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Migrant Workers Convention No. 143 (Supplementary Provisions) (arts. 1 and 9), the 
United Nations Migrant Workers Convention, the final report of the 1994 International 
Conference on Population and Development (principle 12) and the 2000 Council Directive 
2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between 
persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (para. 12). The Special Rapporteur, however, 
views the lack of ratification of, in particular, the United Nations Migrant Workers 
Convention (which by February 2010 had been signed by only 31 of the 192 United 
Nations Members, of which virtually all are countries of emigration)24 as indicative of State 
apathy in this area. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur further notes that child migrants and refugees, often in 
search of education and work opportunities, are particularly vulnerable to forced, 
compulsory and exploitative labour and sexual abuse. International instruments, such as the 
ILO Minimum Age Convention No. 138 and the European Social Charter (revised) (art. 
7.2), establish 15 as the minimum age for both the completion of compulsory schooling and 
entry into employment. Consequently, the increased reduction of the right to education in 
elementary schooling undermines the protection of child migrants and refugees from 
hazardous work. This is related to the understanding that education can, and should, serve 
as an important tool to protect children from sexual and gender-based violence, HIV/AIDS, 
military recruitment, crime and drugs, inter alia. 
</p>
<p>31. Equally, restricted access to education jeopardizes entitlements to the knowledge 
and skills and values that might directly contribute to societal development (democracy, 
non-violent conflict resolution, mutual respect, tolerance and respect for the natural 
environment) and full human development (personality, talents, mental and physical 
abilities, the respect for migrants&#8217; and refugees&#8217; own culture, language and values), as 
expressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 29, 31 and 32) and the 1993 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human 
Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Culture and social issues 
</b>32. Prominent among the questionnaire responses was the perception that the cultural 
diversity which follows as a result of migration ought to be valued as a resource, rather than 
being conceived as an instrument of division. The Special Rapporteur found the repeated 
statement that the migrant, refugee and asylum-seekers&#8217; presence in national education 
systems could be drawn upon more systematically to enrich and enhance non-formal and 
formal learning environments, and thus the learning experience of all students.   
</p>
<p>33. However, there continue to be tensions between national and migrant, refugee and 
asylum-seeker communities. These tensions often reach levels of xenophobia, as both

<p>experience unfamiliar languages, cultural practices and expectations. These can be 
exacerbated when finite resources are perceived to be focused upon one community at the 
expense of the other. One contributor from Liberia noted: &#8220;if education is not equitably 
distributed ... there are bound to be pockets of dissatisfaction and escalation of crime&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>34. There is also ample evidence that migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking students in 
many countries face a far higher risk of marginalization with regard to education systems 
and opportunities when compared with native students25 Movement across national borders 
is only one of the many causal factors and mechanisms (social, economic, cultural, physical 
and psychological) that impact upon migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers in the exercise 
of their right to education. Early marriage and pregnancy, cultural expectations requiring 
girls and women to attend to childcare and household duties, and insecurity when travelling 
to school are examples of others. An assumption of linear causality should therefore be 
avoided.  
</p>
<p>35. Many of these factors combine and are reflected in low socio-economic status, class-
based residential patterns and consequent school composition. Research suggests that a 
concentration of non-native students in any one school can be detrimental to education 
outcomes.26 Many low-income families and migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers do not 
have access to good-quality education.27  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur highlights the issues facing families in conflict-affected 
areas, especially those on precarious incomes. Pertinent is the comment of a refugee who 
stated that: &#8220;shortage of food forces parents to use their children to work&#8221;; and another who 
stated that: &#8220;an empty stomach does not have ears&#8221;<i>. </i>In such contexts, food and shelter are 
prioritized over payment of education fees (where imposed) and indirect costs to quality 
education.  
</p>
<p>37. States, civil society and global international agencies have, in their own ways, 
sought to address some of the issues noted above. The Special Rapporteur points to three 
examples of how to strengthen educational opportunity and quality across all groups in 
disadvantaged communities.28 First, a number of European States have weighted additional 
funding according to the socio-demographic characteristics of the student population. 
Switzerland, aiming to halt native middle-class &#8220;flight&#8221; from inner city districts with a high 
proportion of ethnically-diverse populations, has focused on raising the quality of existing 
multi-ethnic schools by introducing an area-wide model of quality assurance.29 In Ecuador, 
human rights organizations and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have 
collaborated to organize inclusive workshops to design and implement &#8220;codes of living 
together&#8221; based upon respect for diversity, solidarity, equity and justice.

<p>38. Segregation can take many forms, but invariably results in discrimination and thus 
impedes social mobility through education.30 In this respect, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that &#8220;ability&#8221; grouping (and tracking) within learning environments may be based on a 
variety of factors, including socio-economic background, ethnic origin and migrant status. 
Early-ability grouping and tracking has been shown to impact negatively on the school 
achievement of migrant students and students of migrant origin.31 In particular, migrants are 
more likely than their native peers to be diagnosed as having &#8220;special needs&#8221; resulting in 
their placement in separate institutions providing &#8220;special&#8221; education.32 
</p>
<p>39. Some replies to the questionnaire indicated that there is a lack of information and 
awareness among migrant, refugee and asylum-seeker populations about their rights, 
specifically those that safeguard their right to education. Implicit in this is what it means to 
make informed school and educational decisions. It is essential, therefore, to provide 
information and logistical support to migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking populations to 
strengthen their capacity in this regard. Activities might include, for example, home visits 
to low-income and migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking families, &#8220;education booths&#8221; in 
shopping malls, information fairs and hotlines in relevant migrant languages.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur notes the invisibility33 of migrants, refugees and asylum-
seekers with disabilities. They are neither visible in current research, nor were they a focus 
of attention in the replies to the questionnaire. In the relevant comment that does exist, there 
is little recognition of their specific, in many cases discriminatory, experiences, let alone 
steps that might be taken to address them.   
</p>
<p>41. While the main focus of this report is on those &#8220;first-generation&#8221; migrants, refugees 
and asylum-seekers who are marginalized, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the recent 
research which confirms the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) findings concerning the 
structural discrimination (social, political and institutional) of &#8220;second-generation&#8221; 
immigrants in education. However, research into the educational concerns of second-
generation immigrants is regrettably scarce. This lacunae demands attention.34 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur thus believes that the basis for positive social interaction is 
grounded in intercultural education. This intercultural dimension of education confirms the 
interdependence between education and other social systems, particularly those at the 
community level and, as such, is the means for advancing and embedding the principles of 
diversity, respect and solidarity.35 
</p>
<p><b> V. Language and curricula concerns 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur observes that social and cultural issues are intrinsically 
entwined with language and curricula. Much has been written, particularly in Europe and 
more widely across the OECD countries, on issues of language acquisition for migrants.

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12879 
</p>
<p>However, the Special Rapporteur notes that much less research exists on how migration 
impacts upon curriculum content. A common theme in relevant materials and the 
questionnaire responses is that there are three guiding principles contributing significantly 
to the development of quality linguistic and culturally relevant core curricula. These are: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Curricula should be entrenched within the human rights framework  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consultation with migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking parents/guardians  and 
communities should be the norm in their planning, design, implementation and 
evaluation, and  
</p>
<p>&#8226; A focus upon inclusive, mutual and collective learning with minimal segregated 
adaptation groups and classes36<b> 
</b></p>
<p>44. It is now widely recognized that having a home language that differs from that used 
in schools has a negative impact on achievement,37 learning and integration into the wider 
community. Policy and pedagogic responses require host-language training combined with 
the preservation of mother tongue. This requirement was recognized in many questionnaire 
responses.38 The Special Rapporteur concurs with those who view diversity in language 
within a State as a national resource and invites States to promote such diversity and accord 
it full recognition.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes the varied approaches to addressing this crucial matter 
and draws upon two as particularly illustrative. In Sweden, refugees and asylum-seekers 
aged from 7 to 16 are legally entitled to bilingual education, and municipalities are obliged 
to offer mother-tongue tuition and Swedish as a second-language course. Denmark 
promotes a co-education policy in which bilingual and monolingual children learn together. 
Migrant children receive up to two years of basic instruction in Danish as a second 
language in separate teams or classes until they are ready for mainstream classes. 
&#8220;Compulsory language stimulation&#8221; for bilingual children starts at age 3 and is supported 
by free materials provided at the municipal level. The Special Rapporteur notes the utility 
of good quality, early child education, known to play an important role in offsetting social, 
economic and language-based disadvantage.39 
</p>
<p>46. In reality, State, intergovernmental and civil society practices vary markedly in the 
age groups, gender balance, intensity and location of those targeted. Disturbingly, 
monitoring and evaluating practice and programmes is limited. It is also clear from 
evidence that their &#8220;success&#8221; is by no means consistent.40 The Special Rapporteur urges 
more sharing of best practice and draws attention to the importance of regional answers to

 Denmark offers an interesting example of mutual learning where bilingual and monolingual children

 The Government of Cyprus for instance indicates that one of the most important needs of migrants,

 The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the research, highlighted by the Government of Cyprus, 
</p>
<p>into the effectiveness of the intensive training programme for bilingual students, currently 
implemented in 31 secondary schools. In contrast is evidence from Norway that 20 per cent of 
migrant students placed in special language training groups on entering school never leave them; in 
Switzerland, most migrant children not deemed equipped to enter mainstream classes are still in such 
groups after two years. Moreover, evidence from several countries shows that catching up through 
special classes often requires students to miss the normal curriculum. From <i>EFA Global Monitoring 
Report 2010</i>, p. 49. </p>

<p>regional needs.41 Regions might also consider developing a global dimension in their 
curriculum; this would help develop an awareness of near neighbours in order to promote 
greater understanding and create the basis for mutual learning within the region.  
</p>
<p>47. In the case of refugees in camps, although the desirable language and curricula is 
noted as &#8220;ideally&#8221;42 that of origin, education providers should engage in broad consultation 
and act to ensure that the most appropriate curriculum is followed. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur takes this opportunity to emphasize that school learning 
content and non-formal learning for refugees and asylum-seekers in refugee camps should 
aim to transmit key life-saving and life-sustaining messages (including landmine and 
unexploded ordinance awareness, rapid evacuation, skills-based health education, conflict 
resolution, humanitarian norms, child protection, etc.) in addition to preparation for local 
integration, repatriation or resettlement.43 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur specifically 
draws attention to, and welcomes, the educational work of UNHCR, but encourages 
increased attention, intensity and breadth in its provision. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Teachers 
</b></p>
<p>49. Teachers and schools (meso-level) are positioned at the intersection of national and 
subnational policy directives and programmes (macro-level), on the one hand, and the 
expectations of households (micro-level) in the delivery of education, on the other. The 
Special Rapporteur recognizes that the meso-level processes linking the individual and 
society matter tremendously for student performance, and thus the right to education for 
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers.44 
</p>
<p>50. The shortage of teachers is a major obstacle to access and good quality education for 
refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants. Overcrowded and unmanageable classes increase 
student dropout. Especially in developed countries, schools with a large migrant and 
refugee proportion are often the most disadvantaged in terms of funds and qualified and 
experienced staff. In refugee camps, low and/or inappropriate compensation (teachers 
receiving monetary or non-monetary &#8220;incentives&#8221; instead of salaries) encourage teachers to 
work for NGOs or for schools outside the camp rather than in a refugee school.  
</p>
<p>51. Almost universally, teachers lack the pedagogical, psychological and didactical 
education and training to adequately respond to the challenges posed by multilingual, 
multicultural and multi-ethnic learner groups. This is particularly problematic when 
working with traumatized learners. In the Philippines, for instance, teachers and children 
reportedly can receive support from specialists, such as guidance counsellors. In refugee 
camps, the problems are further compounded as the teacher is likely to have very little 
previous training and experience.

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12879 
</p>
<p>52. The issue of teacher supply remains a serious problem which must be addressed, 
given the consequences for those who are marginalized in the learning process; many 
teachers exit the profession given such tremendous challenges and frustration in their work. 
</p>
<p>53. Related to the lack of adequate education are the low expectations of teachers and 
the stereotypes held about a minority cultural group which often leads to discrimination. 
According to an education workers&#8217; union, in segregationist school systems such 
misjudgement may discourage and push migrant and refugee children illegitimately into 
special needs schools.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur views the provision of intercultural training courses and 
awareness-raising conferences and seminars for teachers in many countries as a very 
positive activity and one that could be replicated elsewhere. In Denmark, for instance, 
teacher education includes cultural theory and research into multiculturalism. In Latvia, the 
&#8220;Teacher in Intercultural Environment&#8221; project has aimed to educate teachers in 
intercultural communication and tolerance. However, he notes also that these courses are 
optional (voluntary). Equally, while intercultural education may play an important role in 
policy documents and curricula, in practice the topic may not receive high priority in 
teacher education.45 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur particularly welcomes initiatives, such as those by the 
Government of Portugal, whose National Plan for the Integration of Immigrants 2007&#8211;2009 
contains 12 measures in the field of education, including: &#8220;Training of Teaching Staff in 
Interculturality&#8221;.46 In Finland, the teacher training programme introduced in 2001 declares 
training related to linguistic minorities and immigrants to be a priority area for teachers&#8217; 
professional development.47 The Government of Korea states that multicultural education is 
an integral component of teacher training programmes: as of 2009, 10 teacher colleges offer 
the &#8220;Introduction on Multicultural Education&#8221; course. 
</p>
<p>56. Many national school systems are resistant to, or are making slow progress in, 
adapting teaching and learning methods to the needs of migrant, refugee and asylum-
seeking students. There are also structural impediments, making national coordination 
difficult. Many teacher education and training programmes are decentralized, while 
universities seek to exercise their autonomy. Such structural impediments make concerted, 
coordinated national or subnational curricular and pedagogical initiatives difficult to 
implement.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. Accreditation 
</b></p>
<p>57. Accreditation &#8212; the recognition of learning, skills and experiences &#8212; touches on 
joint past, present and future initiatives and directly affects national education and 
qualification systems. The Special Rapporteur is aware that some States and regions48 
promote the reciprocal recognition of learning. In large measure, however, the tendency is 
to focus on formal, certified and academic qualifications.49 As such, non-formal learning is

<p>overlooked. Even when recognized, equivalency is often problematic. This can lead to 
denial of access to schools50 and/or inappropriate placement levels, as well as in 
unemployment or underemployment. 
</p>
<p>58. The disadvantages implicit in this situation are felt at the individual, local, 
community, national, regional and international levels, serving also to inhibit integration 
and social cohesion.51 
</p>
<p>59. Equally, inadequate attention to the quality and impact of mutual recognition 
systems risks further discrimination and disadvantage of already precarious, marginalized 
populations. For instance, the requirement for presentation of national documentation 
directly discriminates against refugees (who may have fled their homes) and irregular 
migrants when they seek opportunities for education and training.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Learning for life 
</b></p>
<p>60. The legal and normative framework discussed above has led to the increased 
reduction of education to compulsory primary and secondary schooling in developed 
countries and compulsory primary schooling in the developing world. Yet, paradoxically, 
there is a parallel and broadening policy consensus on the value of &#8220;lifelong learning&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes this focus because of the possibilities it offers to the notion of 
collective learning,52 while aware that critics also point to the narrowing of this ideal to 
economic instrumentalism and a focus upon credentials rather than learning competences. 
If migrant, refugee and asylum-seeker populations are excluded from opportunities for 
learning over their lifetime, this might add a cumulative process of marginalization. If 
learning is viewed in terms of formal credentials and not competences that reflect prior 
learning, then considerable pools of knowledge are ignored, talent is wasted and 
opportunities for social inclusion are jeopardized. Unless lifelong learning programmes can 
focus on the emancipatory potential of learning and collective learning, then they risk 
leaving significant populations behind.53 Low socio-economic status, migration, disability 
and gender are key characteristics for those at risk of exclusion from lifelong learning.  
</p>
<p>61. Lifelong learning cannot be disassociated from immigration law, which often forces 
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers into illegality and which may take precedence over 
and/or be in conflict with the right to education. Indeed, a number of questionnaire 
respondents supported the claims in wider literature on the issue pointing to such tensions. 
The attention of the Special Rapporteur has been drawn to the practice of migrant children 
being detained by police on the grounds of their immigration status while travelling to 
school and the dependence on permanent legal residence for education access and 
opportunity. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Refugees states:  &#8220;the Contracting States shall accord to refugees treatment as favourable as possible, 
and, in any event, not less favourable than that accorded to aliens generally in the same 
circumstances, with respect to &#8230; the recognition of foreign school certificates, diplomas, degrees&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>

 Related is the lack of official accreditation from migrant and refugee-run schools, created as a

<p>response to lack of mainstream educational opportunity and access. See Marisa O&#8217;Ensor, &#8220;Education

</p>
<p>62. Irregular migrants may be barred from access to formal and non-formal education, 
as they may face the same registration requirements as nationals or even additional ones, 
such as having to present authentic birth certificates or evidence of legal residence status.54 
Legislative, policy and practical barriers, such as to community inclusion and participation 
in education, teach individuals that they are unwelcome and, moreover, ought to survive 
without inclusion.55 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur consequently prompts States that have not included the 
unconditional right to education in their Constitution to take steps to do so. Two examples 
are indicative of best practice in this regard. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, defined 
by its Government as traditionally a migrant-receiving country, guarantees the unrestricted 
right to education at all levels through its Constitution and migrants are entitled to free 
education from early childhood care to higher education. Furthermore, its schools are 
explicitly obliged to permit the registration of undocumented children. The Government of 
Portugal emphasizes that national legislation also explicitly includes irregular and 
undocumented migrant and refugee children in the right to education with the concomitant 
creation of a special registry for irregular minors. 
</p>
<p>64. It is clear that in some contexts migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers have the 
opportunity to participate in non-formal and vocational education programmes, some of 
which are provided by States but also frequently by NGOs. NGO initiatives on the Thai-
Myanmar border, for example, include vocational training for unskilled migrant women, 
health-worker education programmes and teacher training for migrants to become teachers 
in migrant schools. In South Africa, NGOs offer language and vocational skills training 
and, in Morocco, language and information technology courses and welcome orientation 
workshops are offered to women, again by NGOs.  
</p>
<p>65. The value of such programmes, particularly if appropriately funded, sustained, 
monitored and evaluated, is widely recognized. Nonetheless, such non-formal education 
programmes are not a legal right and are often geographically and temporally limited, with 
more remote refugee camp settings being particularly underserved. This suggests that 
universally accessible, State and intergovernmental agency-provided, non-formal (adult) 
education programmes (including vocational training) are necessary.  
</p><p>66. It has already been noted that lifelong learning is understood in different ways. 
However, when considered holistically, there are relatively few established models or 
traditions for implementing socially inclusive forms of lifelong learning,56 particularly 
when viewed through the lens of migration. Such learning is perceived by the Special 
Rapporteur, however, as having the potential to address the individual&#8217;s capacity for 
learning for and through life and an imperative to inclusion57 and social cohesion at a time 
of economic recession. It must be comprised of a balance of interlocking and mutually 
supportive opportunities for vocational, social and individual learning.58 
</p>
<p>67. Lifelong learning transcends formal schooling and moves beyond post-compulsory 
education and vocational training. In this regard, the intrinsic value of culturally and 
linguistically appropriate early childhood learning, particularly when sustained through 
follow-up programmes, is well noted, as is its role in offsetting social, economic and

<p>language-based disadvantage.59 The Special Rapporteur notes with interest that all children 
in Germany from the age of 12 months will, from 2013, have the right to early childhood 
education.  
</p>
<p>68. Of concern, however, is the inconsistency of policy and provision, most notably in 
refugee camps, the result of a lack of funding in quality and quantity of early childhood 
education programmes. This inconsistency contributes directly and indirectly to lifelong 
marginalization.  
</p>
<p>69. The normative and related investment focus on primary education, directly and 
negatively, impacts upon the quality, accessibility and availability of post-primary and 
tertiary education. Two contrasting examples illustrate this point. First, and markedly 
visible in refugee camps dependent upon international cooperation and investment, is a lack 
of appropriate infrastructure, learning materials and qualified specialized teachers for post-
primary education. Second, and a recurrent individual perspective offered by questionnaire 
respondents seeking post-primary and tertiary education, were the almost insurmountable 
barriers to, or lack of, individual support.  
</p>
<p>70. Systemic and individual barriers to post-primary and tertiary education contribute to 
the perpetuation and consolidation of disadvantage in education generally, in post-primary60 
and tertiary education specifically and of course in life. Correlated with this is the 
increasing perception that good quality post-primary and tertiary education for migrants, 
refugees and asylum-seekers in post-conflict States, and those who are particularly fragile, 
is fundamental to recovery from the aftermath of conflict and longer-term, more stable 
development.61 
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur consequently urges States, donors and intergovernmental 
agencies to look beyond the provision of primary education. Crucially, they should work 
collaboratively, creatively, and in participation with civil society, towards overcoming these 
and other barriers so as to make this possible.62 In this latter respect, the Special Rapporteur 
draws attention to the frequent absence of tertiary education from the migration and 
education dialogue, which should be remedied.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>72.<b> The Special Rapporteur reminds States that their education systems should 
conform to the obligations set forth in the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the objectives of 
the Education for All programme. Critically, these systems must also be able to 
respect and promote diversity on the basis of a global understanding of human needs.

<p><b>measures&#8221; and &#8220;it is largely unclear which distinctions between migrants and the 
citizens are admissible and which are not&#8221;.</b>63<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> However, the Special Rapporteur is convinced that the human right to 
education for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers should not be contentious. 
Nevertheless, this right is sometimes disputed. The dispute centres upon the nature of 
the right itself. Despite being an &#8220;enabling right&#8221;, the right to education has become a 
de facto derivative right; just as, for instance, the right to development, economic 
security and the right to life per se are subordinated to the primary rights of private 
property and the profit rate.</b>64<b> This situation highlights the two conflicting (and 
irreconcilable) legal regimes for education: on the one hand, international human 
rights law defines education as a human right, while on the other hand, international 
trade law views education as a service, i.e. a commodity.</b>65<b> The latter regime offers 
little scope for advancing mechanisms for realizing the objectives of a human rights 
responsive education system.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Special Rapporteur recognizes that governmental compliance with the 
obligations involved in guaranteeing the right to education depends on political will.</b>66<b> 
Resource scarcity, debt servicing or &#8220;consecutive economic crises&#8221; &#8212; generally stated 
as reasons for non-compliance of Governments with their responsibility to realize the 
right to education</b>67<b> &#8212; are unsatisfactory and unacceptable excuses.  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The Special Rapporteur recalls that adaptability and acceptability are a 
fundamental component of the human right to education. For this reason, it is 
essential that all States advance the implementation of intercultural and inclusive 
education models that make possible the establishment of pedagogical practices which 
encourage respect for diversity. It is also crucial that learners understand, validate 
and respect diversity in culture and, in this way, form the basis for substantive change 
in the struggle against discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> Fundamental also is the need for all States to foster the view in all learning 
settings, whether formal or non-formal, that cultural and linguistic diversity is a 
resource from which individuals and groups can build strong and supportive 
sustainable communities.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The mechanisms for the enforcement of the right to education are still at an 
embryonic and fragile stage of development. Absent in this early phase are 
opportunities for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers to represent their issues and 
concerns in ways that might lead to changes in teaching practices and curricula 
content.  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The right to education should transcend primary and/or compulsory education, 
especially if systematic discrimination can be measured between particular social 
groups in society, as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 
suggests, with respect to migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The exercise by migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers of their human rights 
(i.e. to work, housing, and education) &#8220;is significantly limited or made impossible if 
the State, through its laws or administrative practices, disadvantages them in these

makes access to the housing market more difficult for extended families).</b>68 <b> 
</b>80.<b> It is clear that the provision and exercise of inclusive education cannot alone 
meet the challenge to social justice inherent in migration. It is but one central 
component of the required national and international response. Its absence, however, 
ensures that social justice remains beyond our reach. 
</b>81.<b> As such, the recommendations below must be accompanied by, and meet, the 
powerful need for the development and implementation of social policies to protect 
migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers against the adverse economic and social 
consequences inherent to their vulnerability in the realization of their right to 
education.</b>69 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Regarding the legal and normative framework, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
view that: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To ensure the elimination of discrimination, and the successful integration and 
social justice for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers, the normative 
boundaries of the right to education have to be shifted towards the inclusion of 
all types and levels of education. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Although there may be States which grant the right to education for migrants, 
refugees and asylum-seekers although they have not ratified the respective 
international instruments discussed earlier,</b>70<b> the Special Rapporteur urges 
Governments of immigration countries in particular to sign and ratify these 
existing, relevant legal instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>There is a need for the development of mechanisms that permit the monitoring 
of the implementation of binding legislation and obligations regarding the right 
to education for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>As the International Conference on Population and Development (1994) 
identified migration as a consequence of significant global economic 
transformations,</b>71<b> the Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned by the fact 
that half of the world&#8217;s out-of-school children &#8212; 39 million &#8212; live in conflict-
affected areas.</b>72<b> Moreover, as 80 per cent of all refugees are hosted by countries 
of the developing world, which figure shows that a disproportionate burden is 
carried by those least able to afford it,</b>73<b> increased international cooperation 
and sharing of responsibility is required, as called for in the International 
Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Dakar Framework

</p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur perceives a crucial need for States, donors, 
international agencies and civil society to work collaboratively together, as substantial 
movement and migration across national borders will continue to define our 
globalized world. Their joint aim should be to build and sustain cohesive and resilient 
communities able to adapt in response to change.</b>75<b> To this end, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that exchange of good practice is increased and, at a 
minimum, all should look to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Foster the view in all learning settings, both formal and non-formal, that 
cultural and linguistic diversity is a resource from which individuals and 
groups can build strong and supportive sustainable communities.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Develop educational strategies which strengthen the capabilities of 
marginalized communities as a whole, while addressing the specific educational 
needs of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Such strategies should look to 
embedded and coordinated mainstream lifelong learning which prioritizes 
early integration and the recognition of prior learning. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Pay increased attention to quality linguistic and culturally appropriate early 
childhood, primary, post-primary and tertiary education that is responsive to 
the developmental needs of a region and the value of regional understanding 
and tolerance.

<p>&#8226; <b>Integrate the human rights framework (protection issues including teachers&#8217; 
code of conduct)</b>76<b> into curricula and the learning environment.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish individual curricula or tutoring programmes that support majority 
language acquisition and, if necessary, other subject areas, so that majority 
language learning and subject matters can be learned at the same time. These 
should be offered in mainstream schools and without creating segregated 
adaptation groups and classes.

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Prompt development of regional and international qualification systems,

</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that teachers and other personnel working 
with migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers are in need of strong support such as new 
organizational structures and new teaching forms; this requires action beyond the 
teacher/school meso-level, towards a more active State, and desegregationist measures

involve: 
</b></p>

migrant backgrounds to facilitate more effective individualized pedagogical 
support (individual curricula), especially at the nursery/kindergarten and 
primary levels with respect to language acquisition.</b>78<b>  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Multi- and intercultural education (awareness-raising, socio-linguistics, 
communication skills and intercultural competence) made integral to teacher 
education curricula. In-service specialist training should be obligatory and take 
place during working hours to avoid increasing the workload of teachers.

<p>&#8226; <b>Team-teaching and the support of the classroom teacher by a specialist, as well
