<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The right to food is a human right recognized under international law, which 
protects the right of all human beings to feed themselves in dignity, either by producing 
their food or by purchasing it. FAO plays a vital role in supporting its member States in the 
design of their food security laws, policies and programmes; it conducts programmes and 
projects at country level which enable its member States to benefit from its experience; and 
it generates knowledge that impacts vast areas of thematic debates on global food security. 
This report explores how the normative and analytical framework of the human right to 
adequate food is integrated into the activities of FAO, and it identifies areas in which the 
contribution of FAO to the realization of the right to food could be further strengthened. 
The recommendations are addressed not only to the FAO Secretariat, but also to FAO 
member States, institutional bodies and donors, and are intended as a contribution to their 
ongoing deliberations on ways and means to further strengthen the Strategic Framework 
and Medium Term Plan 2014-17 for the Organization. As the report highlights, the right to 
food principles and requirements are essential to attaining the core goals of FAO.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 13/4.  
The Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur on the right to food &#8220;to 
promote the full realization of the right to food and the adoption of measures at the national, 
regional and international levels for the realization of the right of everyone to adequate food 
and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger&#8221; (A/HRC/RES/6/2, para. 2) 
and to collaborate with the United Nations Rome-based agencies, including FAO, &#8220;in order 
to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further within these 
organizations&#8221; (A/HRC/RES/13/4, para. 32). In fulfilment of this mandate, the Special 
Rapporteur conducted a visit to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO), through a series of meetings with FAO staff and other stakeholders during 
</p><p>2012. 
</p>
<p>2. The objectives of the mission were to take stock of the efforts of FAO in promoting 
the right to food; to explore how the right to food normative and analytical framework is 
integrated into FAO policies and programmes; and how such integration contributes to the 
attainment of its core goals.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with staff of all Departments of FAO from 9 
to 10 and 16 to 17 January 2012, with Director-General Jos&#233; Graziano da Silva, in January 
and in May 2012, with the President of the FAO Council, with representatives of 
Permanent Missions to FAO, with staff of the FAO Regional Office for Africa in Accra, as 
well as with other stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations and farmers&#8217; 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur has an ongoing collaboration with FAO. He took part in 
various conferences convened by FAO, including the June 2008 High-Level Conference on 
World Food Security, the October 2008 Right to Food Forum, and the November 2009 
World Summit on Food Security. He delivered the 26th McDougall Memorial Lecture on 
18 November 2009. On 4-5 April 2012, he convened a workshop in Nairobi on the 
implementation of the right to food in Eastern and Southern Africa, with the support of the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the FAO Right to Food 
team. This workshop followed a regional seminar convened in Bogota in June 2011, also in 
collaboration with the FAO Right to Food team, to assess the progress of the right to food 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. These various activities, as well as his participation in 
the work of the Committee on World Food Security, and consultations held with local FAO 
representatives in each of the 10 country missions he has conducted to date in the fulfilment 
of his mandate, provided the Special Rapporteur with a range of opportunities to familiarize 
himself with the role of the right to adequate food in the work of FAO and in its 
relationships with external stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to express his deep appreciation to all those who 
generously made available their time, knowledge and expertise. The level of dedication of 
all FAO staff he met impressed him, as well as their interest in understanding how a deeper 
integration of the right to food could contribute to their substantive areas of work. He 
would like to mention, in particular, the cooperative spirit in which FAO and its Director-
General provided assistance to the visit.  
</p>
<p>6. This report outlines the relevance of the right to food in the fight against hunger and 
malnutrition (section I). It then briefly reviews specific efforts of FAO to promote the right 
to food since the 1996 World Food Summit (section II). It shows the relevance of the right 
to food framework for the sectoral policies of FAO, examining possible ways of 
mainstreaming a right to food approach throughout FAO (section III) and in country </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3

</p>
<p>programmes (section IV). It discusses the relationships of FAO with civil society 
organizations and the private sector (section V). Finally, it analyses the contribution of 
FAO to global governance, including through its standard-setting activities (section VI). 
The recommendations contained in this report are directed towards the FAO Secretariat, the 
FAO Council and other institutional bodies, member States, and donors. The Special 
Rapporteur is aware that certain recommendations would be costly to implement, both in 
terms of time and of financial resources. He is also fully informed about the current 
financial constraints of FAO, and understands that these recommendations, if agreed upon, 
could only be progressively implemented. However, his mandate is precisely to make such 
recommendations as to inform the future strategic and operational choices to be made by 
the Organization and its Members. This is the constructive spirit in which the report has 
been prepared.     
</p>
<p><b> II. The significance of the right to food in combating hunger and 
malnutrition 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to adequate food is a human right recognized under international law. It is 
realized &#8220;when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, has 
</p>
<p>physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement.&#8221;1 
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has authoritatively defined the 
core content of the right to adequate food and the corresponding obligations of States to 
respect, protect and fulfil the right to food (E/C.12/1999/5). These prescriptions are 
complemented by the <i>Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the 
Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security</i> (Right to Food 
Guidelines), adopted by member States at the FAO Council in 2004. 
</p>
<p>8. The right to food provides an important tool for combating hunger and malnutrition. 
Rather than understanding accessible, available and adequate food as a form of charity or 
handout, the right to food recognizes food as a legal entitlement. Legal entitlements protect 
the rights of people to live with dignity and ensure that all have either the resources 
required to produce enough food for themselves or purchasing power sufficient to procure 
food from the market. They place obligations on the State, and provide individuals and 
communities with recourse mechanisms when these obligations are not met.  
</p>
<p>9. The right to food also requires that we identify the hungry and malnourished by 
adequate food insecurity and vulnerability mapping, and that we then design policies that 
remove the obstacles to its enjoyment by each individual. Food security strategies should 
comply with the principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, 
transparency, human dignity and empowerment, and should follow the rule of law &#8211; 
excluding no individual or household without justification.  
</p>
<p>10. Recognizing that some elements of the right to food can only be realized 
progressively over time, the Right to Food Guidelines call for the adoption of multi-year 
national strategies that define which actions should be taken, by whom, within which 
precise time frame, and according to which process. Such national strategies or action plans 
serve to ensure that the appropriate resources will be mobilized. They seek to improve 
coordination across different branches of government, ensuring that all the many (and 
interrelated) causes of hunger or malnutrition are addressed. They also enhance 
accountability: by assigning role players and defining responsibilities, they allow civil 
society organizations and independent bodies &#8211; such as national human rights institutions or 
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/C.12/1999/5, para. 6.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>courts &#8211; to better hold State agencies to account. They favour collective learning: since 
progress is monitored through appropriate indicators, policies that are misguided and fail to 
achieve results can be corrected at an early stage. Finally, because such strategies are 
participatory and inclusive, they contribute to democratization and empowerment, 
particularly when they are institutionalized into framework laws. They therefore limit the 
risk of arbitrariness or favouritism in decision-making, and they ensure that the decisions 
are made in the light of the real needs, as expressed by the ultimate beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>11. The importance of the right to food to efforts to combat hunger and food and 
nutrition insecurity has been repeatedly reaffirmed, including by the United Nations 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who called in his closing remarks to the Madrid 2009 
High-Level Meeting on Food Security for All to have the right to food as &#8220;a basis for 
analysis, action and accountability&#8221; in promoting food security.  
</p>
<p><b> III. The work on the right to food since the 1996 World Food 
Summit  
</b></p>
<p>12. Since its founding in 1945, a core objective of FAO has been to eradicate hunger. In 
the early years, international policy debates and the work of FAO focused on increasing 
agricultural production and assuring the availability of basic foodstuffs at the international 
and national levels. However a fundamental shift in the way the core mandate of FAO is 
understood has occurred in recent years. The increasing focus on the right to food is an 
essential part of this new thinking, which crystallized at the 1996 World Food Summit in 
the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action. 
In the opening paragraph of the 1996 Rome Declaration, Heads of State and Government 
reaffirmed &#8220;the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>13. One of the specific commitments made in the 1996 World Summit Plan of Action 
was &#8220;to clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of 
everyone to be free from hunger&#8221; (objective 7.4). This spurred a number of initiatives, 
including the adoption by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of its 
general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to food and the adoption of the Right to Food 
Guidelines, the only intergovernmental text clarifying the concrete measures States should 
take to implement the human right to adequate food. FAO played a crucial role in 
supporting the intergovernmental negotiations on these guidelines.    
</p>
<p><b>  Supporting the right to food at country level 
</b></p>
<p>14. Upon their adoption, member States called upon FAO to support the implementation 
of the Right to Food Guidelines (CL/127/REP, para. 59). Since then, FAO has been 
promoting the Guidelines, including through the establishment of dedicated staff; the 
delivery of policy assistance to States; the conduct of a number of specific operational 
projects at regional and country levels; and the publication of a number of studies and 
toolkits, including online courses.2 These publications provide detailed guidance and 
examples of how to identify vulnerable groups and the reasons for their vulnerability; how 
to craft national legislative action; or how to conduct training and advocacy with 
stakeholders. These activities were mostly led by the Right to Food Team within the 
Economic and Social Development Department.  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>15. This normative work has also to some extent been integrated into FAO activities at 
country level. However, country-level support activities on the right to food have generally 
been in the form of specific projects dependent on limited extra budgetary funding from a 
few donor countries. Current projects include the integration of the right to food in national 
food and nutrition security legal and policy frameworks in Mozambique, Bolivia, Nepal 
and El Salvador; support to Governments and civil society in Uganda, Sierra Leone and 
Tanzania in applying the right to food framework through district and sub-district 
development planning; and the promotion of right to food principles in food security 
governance at international, regional and national levels. 
</p>
<p><b>  Regional alliances and initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>16. A comprehensive review of these activities is beyond the scope of this report. 
However, the work of FAO in Latin America deserves specific mentioning. The Hunger-
Free Latin America and the Caribbean 2025 Initiative (Iniciativa Am&#233;rica Latina y el 
Caribe sin Hambre 2025) has been remarkably successful in promoting the right to food 
across the continent. The initiative is supported by the FAO Regional Office for Latin 
America and the Caribbean in Santiago (until 2011 headed by the current Director-
General), and has been instrumental to the important progress made over recent decades in 
integrating the right to food in legal, policy and institutional frameworks. For example, the 
Initiative has supported the establishment of a regional Parliamentary Front against Hunger 
in Latin America and the Caribbean (Frente Parlamentario contra el Hambre), as well as an 
Observatory on the Right to Food, inaugurated in 2011 as a collaborative effort by more 
than 20 universities in the region and with the participation of FAO and OHCHR staff.3  
</p>
<p>17. FAO rightfully highlights the important achievement &#8220;in giving Right to Food 
considerations due prominence in the political agenda throughout the region&#8221;.4 Even more 
recently, FAO also supported the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) in 
developing a joint strategy and action plan for the incorporation of the right to food in 
national food and nutrition security policies and programmes, and in establishing a 
Regional Food Security and Nutrition Council (CONSAN). The launch of the Hunger-Free 
Initiative for West Africa in October 2012 is another very welcome new step; and it is the 
hope of the Special Rapporteur that it will provide a platform for a stronger implementation 
of the right to food in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States 
(ECOWAS). 
</p>
<p><b>  Promotion of the right to food within the United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>18. FAO also plays an important role in translating the right to food framework in 
operational guidance within the United Nations system. In 2012, FAO contributed to 
recalling the importance of the right to food in the Outcome Document of the Rio+20 
Summit. In its contribution &#8220;Towards the Future We Want: End hunger and make the 
transition to sustainable agricultural and food systems&#8221;, FAO identified the Right to Food 
Guidelines and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of 
Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security as &#8220;the overarching 
frameworks for achieving food security and equitable sustainable development.&#8221; FAO also 
</p>
<p>contributed to drafting the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) Guidance Note to 
United Nations Country Teams, &#8220;Integrating Food and Nutrition Security into Country 
Analysis&#8221; (October 2011), a document that sets out some basic requirements for a human 
rights-based approach to food security and nutrition. The Updated Comprehensive

</p>
<p>Framework for Action (UCFA) of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security 
Crisis (HLTF) also refers to a rights-based monitoring methodology, including the use of a 
set of illustrative indicators on the right to food, based upon the work of FAO and 
OHCHR.5 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The right to food: a </b>&#8220;<b>compass</b>&#8221;<b> and a practical tool 
</b></p>
<p>19. Despite the encouraging outcomes of the dedicated right to food activities depicted 
above, a main challenge is to overcome the &#8220;silo effect&#8221; whereby the right to food is 
primarily promoted through discrete projects carried out by only one part of the 
organization. For gender and nutrition, FAO has concluded that embedding them as a 
separate set of activities, rather than adopting a more integrated approach, was ultimately 
ineffective, and consequently opted to have an integrated approach on both objectives.6 
</p>
<p>20. Certain steps have been taken in this regard, such as the inclusion of national 
implementation of the Right to Food Guidelines as a specific Organizational Result (H2) in 
the FAO Strategic Framework 2010-19;7 and the collaboration between the Integrated Food 
Security Support Service (TCSF) and the Right to Food staff within the Agricultural 
Development Economics Division (ESA) to produce guidance on how to integrate the right 
to food into food and nutrition security programmes.  
</p>
<p>21. However, more can be done. The right to food approach should permeate all core 
activities of FAO, including food and agricultural policies, nutrition, land, and trade. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that integrating a right to food perspective into these sectoral 
policies is the vital next step for FAO to support its member States in fulfilling their 
obligations to progressively realize the right to food. Strengthening the implementation of 
the right to food normative and analytical framework across its activities will also enable 
FAO to better reach its goals, as already highlighted in a 2011 FAO report on its nutrition 
activities.8  
</p>
<p>22. The Strategic Thinking Process launched in January 2012 by the Director-General to 
review the Strategic Framework 2010-2019 and to prepare the next Medium Term Plan 
(MTP) for 2014-17 provides an important opportunity to further integrate the right to food 
across the work of FAO.9 Among the important innovations being considered for the 
Medium Term Plan 2014-17 are specific action plans to guide the achievement of each 
Strategic Objective and the identification of cross-cutting areas of work to be incorporated 
and mainstreamed across the Strategic Objectives.10 The Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the right to food be included as a cross-cutting area of work and the key components of 
its normative and analytical framework reflected in the action plans for the implementation 
of strategic objectives. This would respond to one of the key lessons learned from the 
implementation of the FAO Strategic Framework during 2010-11 that &#8220;To secure the 
achievements and investments made in 2010-11 and to scale-up action and impact, FAO

<p>will give specific attention to: (&#8230;) adopting gender and nutrition focuses, as well as right to 
</p>
<p>food perspective throughout the project cycle.&#8221;11  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur notes that FAO has all the building blocks to go in that 
direction. However more clarity and procedural improvements are required.  
</p>
<p><b> A. The building blocks for a right to food strategy 
</b></p>
<p>24. Several FAO departments and divisions have already integrated right to food 
principles, such as participation, cross-sectoral coordination, empowerment, or a focus on 
marginalized groups, in some of their projects. For instance, the Forestry Department in 
collaboration with the National Forest Programme Facility has supported Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Philippines and Uganda in the formulation of national forestry strategies that 
create cross-sectoral coordination and are built through a substantive participatory process 
with civil society and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>25. Since 1997, the Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) has provided capacity 
building in the analysis of agricultural and trade policies and models of agriculture for 
national producers&#8217; platforms in a number of countries, including Burkina Faso, Burundi, 
Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Farmers&#8217; organizations and cooperatives were 
identified as prime partners of FAO from the time of its establishment in 1945, and, over 
the years, FAO has provided important strategic support for the development of the 
autonomous producers&#8217; movement.   
</p>
<p>26. In 2009, the Gender, Equality and Rural Employment Division (ESW) developed a 
model for integrating legal empowerment into the Farmer Field Schools methodology, 
based on experience from Kenya, to enable FAO to respond to farmers&#8217; demand in the area 
of access to land and property, women&#8217;s and orphans&#8217; inheritance, child labour in 
agriculture and access to credit facilities and entrepreneurship skills.  
</p>
<p>27. The FAO Policy on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples presented in 2010 &#8211; the result of 
a consultative process led by an interdepartmental working group on indigenous issues &#8211; is 
also an important contribution to the implementation of the right to food by FAO given that 
the Policy is grounded in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, and focuses on a group representing globally about 15 per cent of the food 
insecure. 
</p>
<p>28. These examples show that the integration of the right to food principles in the 
activities of other departments is not only feasible, but that this integration contributes to 
the fulfilment of the key objectives of FAO. This may become the rule across all sectoral 
areas.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The right to food as a compass for the design of sectoral policies 
</b></p>
<p>29. We are currently witnessing a renewed interest in investing in agriculture. The 
question of what kind of agriculture to invest in, and how, is therefore even more central to 
the work of FAO than in the past. From a right to food perspective, the question is not only 
whether certain forms of agricultural development increase the volumes of production, but 
also what their distributional impacts will be. Who will gain most? Who will not gain, and 
who may even lose? These questions are crucial in current debates on agricultural 
development models.  
</p>
<p>  
 11 See FAO doc. C 2013/8, &#8220;Programme Implementation Report 2010-11&#8221;, para. 150. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>30. The following sub-sections focus on trade, agriculture and food policies, and land. 
No attempt is made to provide a comprehensive review of the activities of FAO in these 
areas. Instead, examples of potential mismatches between FAO programmes and policy 
advice are highlighted, and it will be suggested that relying on the right to food can bring 
greater coherence to the work of FAO. 
</p>
<p><b>  Trade  
</b></p>
<p>31. FAO has made a most valuable contribution to the field of trade negotiations and 
food security during the last decade. This has included training of national staff and the 
design of dedicated Units at Ministries of Agriculture in many countries, including Burkina 
Faso, Kenya, Mozambique, Nicaragua and Tanzania (Zanzibar). The FAO Import Surges 
Project, which resulted in the publication of the Briefs on Import Surges in 2006, also 
remains a landmark achievement in assessing the possible negative impacts on unregulated 
trade on food security at national level, highlighting the importance for developing 
countries of protecting local industries and small food producers from dumping.12 FAO 
continues to support developing countries in better understanding the advantages and 
drawbacks of bilateral or international trade agreements. Its report &#8220;Agriculture, Trade 
</p>
<p>Negotiations and Gender&#8221; is an example of integrating a right to food approach to trade, by 
</p>
<p>assessing the possible positive and negative impacts of trade liberalization on certain 
groups particularly vulnerable to discrimination.13  
</p>
<p>32. The conclusions of these reports are unfortunately only partially and insufficiently 
reflected in the discourse promoted by FAO at global level, which does not systematically 
indicate the conditions under which trade can improve food security at the local, national 
and international levels. Given the new context since the historic downwards trend of 
agricultural prices has been interrupted and the deadlock currently facing trade negotiations 
at the multilateral level, FAO could express its views more clearly on the question of trade 
and food security; building not only on its experience with a wide range of situations at 
country level, but also on its past attempts to ensure food security is always prioritized in 
the organization of trade in agricultural commodities.14  
</p>
<p><b>  Agriculture and food policies 
</b></p>
<p>33. FAO supports various agricultural paradigms that many stakeholders consider to be 
incompatible, both at field level and in the setting of priorities in public policies. Observers 
note that FAO participated in the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, 
Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), which called in April 2008 for a 
fundamental shift in the way agriculture is supported, but that in June 2008, it signed a 
Letter of Agreement with the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), without 
any reference to IAASTD (nor to the Right to Food Guidelines), and without ensuring that 
this cooperation would be aligned with the IAASTD conclusions. In 2010, it convened the 
2010 Conference on Agricultural Biotechnologies for Developing Countries, co-sponsored 
by IFAD and supported by CGIAR, the Global Forum on Agricultural Research (GFAR), 
the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) and the

<p>World Bank, appearing to provide at least implicit support to an approach to agricultural 
research and development that is at odds with the IAASTD conclusions. Similarly, FAO 
supports national plans to provide subsidized fertilizers in many countries, an approach 
close to the first &#8220;Green revolution&#8221; approach, while at the same time supporting alternative 
agricultural development models with its Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System 
(GIAHS), which emphasizes the importance of local agrobiodiversity for local 
communities; and launching the &#8220;Save and Grow&#8221; initiative, which promotes the 
sustainable intensification of smallholder crop production. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Land  
</b></p>
<p>34. The question of land has been a contentious issue for decades, and FAO has always 
played an active role in the surrounding policy debates. It has played a part in the shaping 
of land policies since its creation, contributing to the discussions concerning the respective 
merits of State-led and market-led land reforms, and the relevance of the associated 
individual or collective titling schemes. FAO also organized, jointly with the Government 
of Brazil, the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development 
(ICARRD), convened in Porto Alegre in March 2006.  
</p>
<p>35. In 2012, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) adopted the Voluntary 
Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the 
Context of National Food Security. This marks a new era for international cooperation on 
land issues. The Special Rapporteur commends the work of FAO on these Guidelines: FAO 
initiated them, led a long consultative process, and is now preparing their implementation at 
country level. FAO has also recently played an important role in the context of the CFS 
Open Ended Working Group on principles for responsible agricultural investments, which 
will enable CFS to take ownership of the matter.  
</p>
<p><b>  Coherence and complexity 
</b></p>
<p>36. What is sometimes perceived as a mixed message from FAO as an organization 
reflects in part the sheer complexity of its mandate. This complexity has several sources. 
First, FAO aims to support Governments and is consequently open to their own priorities. 
This context-sensitive approach, while desirable in principle, leads it to support different 
policies in different countries. Second, FAO is also heavily influenced by donors&#8217; priorities 
in the implementation of extra-budgetary funded activities. Third, FAO must shape a 
consensus among its members when setting norms and defining priorities: 194 Members 
have different views on sectoral policies. Finally, FAO has to interact with many governing 
bodies. These factors lead FAO to conduct programmes and provide policy advice in 
various, sometimes opposite directions. This should be counterbalanced, however, by the 
need to improve coherence by relying on the framework based on the right to food. The 
next section explores how this could be achieved. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The elements of mainstreaming the right to food in the Strategic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Framework 
</b></p>
<p>37. A systematic consideration of the right to food normative and analytical framework 
ensures a continuous examination of approaches and programmes, enhancing the coherence 
of FAO policy recommendations. The Special Rapporteur considers that further efforts 
could be made in three directions. First, a series of procedural requirements of the right to 
food could be more systematically integrated into FAO activities. Secondly, FAO could 
consider measures to mainstream the right to food in the daily work of the Organization. 
Thirdly, the right to food calls for a more systematic consideration of agricultural and food 
policies that benefit the most marginalized, food-insecure population groups.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Integrating the procedural requirements of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>38. Integrating an approach grounded in the right to food in a more consistent and 
systematic way may imply the following:  
</p>
<p>(a) Comparative assessments could be conducted, proactively, of how different 
agricultural modes of production, in different contexts, are more or less conducive to food 
security and the right to food; as also recommended in an internal evaluation report,15 
alternative policy scenarios should be explored on the basis of such assessments, in 
particular when the preferred policy option of a State appears at odds with the priorities of 
FAO and the right to food normative framework ; 
</p>
<p>(b) Data could be systematically collected in a manner which captures the 
multidimensional nature of food insecurity and be adequately disaggregated to identify 
specific problems faced by the most vulnerable and food insecure groups; 
</p>
<p>(c) The procedural requirements of the rights-based approach could be integrated 
in the decision-making and implementation process of all programmes and policies, 
including the human rights principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, 
transparency, human dignity, empowerment and the rule of law, based on the UN Statement 
of Common Understanding on Human Rights-Based Approaches.16  
</p>
<p><b>  Mainstreaming the right to food within FAO  
</b></p>
<p>39. FAO may also wish to look inwards, with a view to strengthening mechanisms and 
procedures that could facilitate a more systematic integration of the right to food across its 
activities. Inspiration could usefully be sought from its own recent experience with 
mainstreaming gender and nutrition issues, which in themselves are important elements of a 
broader human rights-cum-right to food approach. Similar steps could be taken to more 
clearly integrate the right to adequate food in all FAO operations, by: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensuring adequate capacity within the organizational structure to support 
mainstreaming efforts. Despite the high-quality work done by the Right to Food team 
within the Agricultural Development Economics Division (ESA), the promotion of the right 
to food within FAO remains inadequately institutionalized. It mainly consists of time-
bound projects funded by individual donors. The promotion of the right to food across all 
FAO activities would gain from: (i) dedicated right to food support staff who could serve as 
&#8220;service providers&#8221; to other divisions; (ii) a network of senior-level focal points in the 
technical units at headquarters and in regional and national offices who would promote the 
mainstreaming effort; and (iii) strengthening the Development Law Service of the Legal 
Office to enable it to inject the right to food normative framework in all the legal advice it 
provides;   
</p>
<p>(b) Including right to food criteria in the programme and project clearance 
processes. As with the 2011 decision to make attention to gender-sensitiveness a necessary 
condition for approval of projects, the Programme and Project Review Committee (PPRC) 
could ensure that all FAO programmes and projects meet basic right to food principles and 
requirements. A set of simple standard questions could be included on a systematic basis, 
such as questions related to participation in the design of the project; the use of indicators 
broken down to take into account specific and marginalized groups; grievance mechanisms

<p>in the implementation process; and participation of the intended beneficiaries in the 
evaluation of outcomes. The Investment Centre should use similar processes for the 
projects it operates;  
</p>
<p>(c) Strengthening monitoring systems to assess the impact of its country-level 
programmes and policy assistance, for example when advising countries on specific trade, 
investment or agricultural policies and programmes. The establishment of an &#8220;impact 
assessment culture&#8221; is internally encouraged;17 it could make use of the rights-based 
structural, process and outcome indicators that have been conceptualized by FAO on the 
basis of Guideline 17 of the Right to Food Guidelines, which addresses monitoring, 
indicators and benchmarks;18  
</p>
<p>(d) Using the human resources policy<b> </b>as a lever to mainstream the right to food, 
by including criteria in the Performance Evaluation Management (PEM) system that would 
make senior and middle management accountable for mainstreaming right to food 
principles and objectives in their entities; and  
</p>
<p>(e) Considering the importance of the right to food to the work of FAO, it should 
be funded by the regular budget and not only by extra-budgetary allocations. Leaving the 
implementation of the right to food to the willingness of donors is a strategy that prevents 
FAO from becoming a stronger champion of its own Right to Food Guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b>  Supporting activities that have the highest impact on food-insecure people 
</b></p>
<p>40. An internal report on the work of FAO on agricultural and food policies 
recommended that the organization focus on activities &#8220;that have the highest impact on 
</p>
<p>food-insecure people&#8221;.19 The Special Rapporteur fully shares that view. Prioritizing the 
most marginalized segments of the population is a requirement of the right to food 
normative framework, which applies to all FAO member States.  
</p>
<p>41. In his thematic reports the Special Rapporteur has analysed a wide range of 
agricultural, land, and food security policies conducive to the right to adequate food, as they 
benefit the most marginalized segments of the population and support more resilient 
agricultural and food systems. The continued or enhanced support and guidance of FAO to 
States on these policies is vital to the realization of the right to adequate food. In particular, 
the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the importance of :  
</p>
<p>(a) Making national food systems inclusive of poor small-scale food producers, 
by way of, for example, investments in programmes, practices and policies to scale up 
agroecological approaches, support for farmers&#8217; access to means of production, including 
credit and extension services; support for farmers&#8217; cooperatives, and support for public 
procurement systems that benefit small farmers;  
</p>
<p>(b) Supporting farmers&#8217; seed systems, in addition to improving their access to 
commercial seeds, for instance by promoting local seed exchange systems such as 
community seed banks; supporting the inclusion of farmers&#8217; varieties in subsidized seed 
distribution programmes; and promoting farmers&#8217; rights, as defined in article 9 of the 
International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture;

</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>(c) Enhancing access to nutritious food, such as, for example, support for locally 
sourced, nutritious foods through public procurement schemes for school-feeding 
programmes and for other public institutions; and supporting farmers&#8217; markets and urban 
and peri-urban agriculture; 
</p>
<p>(d) Limiting excessive reliance on international trade in the pursuit of food 
security by building capacity to produce the food needed to meet consumption needs; and 
ensure that States maintain the necessary flexibilities and instruments to reduce the 
vulnerability of domestic food markets to food price volatility on international markets;  
</p>
<p>(e) Protecting small-scale food producers from the abuse of buyer power in food 
chains;  
</p>
<p>(f) Supporting social protection systems as a response to chronic poverty-related 
food insecurity.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that strengthened efforts in these areas would 
enable FAO to better fulfil its mandate, while remaining an authoritative and respected 
impartial actor, providing States with an international platform where the issues of hunger 
and malnutrition can be examined, keeping the right to food at their centre, and decisions 
taken for collective action.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The right to food in programmes at country and regional 
levels 
</b></p>
<p>43. FAO has demonstrated that it can play a key role in encouraging the adoption of 
legal, institutional and policy frameworks informed by the right to food. However, progress 
remains uneven across countries and regions.  Though FAO leads among United Nations 
agencies in supporting the implementation of the right to food at country level, there is 
considerable scope for doing more. This could be achieved through two complementary 
approaches. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Supporting legal, institutional and policy frameworks at country level 
</b></p>
<p>44. FAO could more systematically contribute to the realization of the right to food by 
fully integrating this objective into its Country Programme Frameworks (CPFs), which 
define priority areas and outcomes for Government-FAO collaboration over four to five-
year periods, and its Country Work Plans (CWPs), which operationalize the agreed upon 
CPF outcomes in two-year time frames. The CPF does not set priorities for the partner 
country, yet CPF does set priorities for FAO assistance. 
</p>
<p>45. Such a systematic approach would be consistent with the 2011 FAO Principles and 
Policy for Country Programming Guidelines. These Guidelines provide that CPFs should 
adhere to the five United Nations Country Programming Principles.20 The first of these 
principles is to adopt a human rights-based approach, a principle which &#8220;applies to FAO&#8217;s 
engagement with, and support to national development processes and frameworks, as well 
as its efforts in providing global public goods.&#8221;21 The right to food framework has been 
clarified through a series of guidance materials and operational manuals. It provides a 
ready-to-use tool to ensure that FAO policy assistance, programmes and projects are

<p>designed, reviewed, implemented and monitored in accordance with a human rights-based 
approach.  
</p>
<p>46. The Country Programming Guidelines (PC 108/2) currently provide no guidance as 
to the operational requirements of the right to food and the 2012 FAO Guide to the 
formulation of the Country Programming Framework merely states that &#8220;the Right-to-Food 
approach and the promotion of the right to decent work for rural people, particularly in the 
agricultural sector, are key concerns for the Organization.&#8221;22 The Special Rapporteur 
considers that it would be very important to include specific guidance as to the 
operationalization of the right to food in the CPF process. It is the hope of the Special 
Rapporteur that the Country Programming Guidelines will be complemented by an annex 
on the right to food, as has been done for gender and nutrition issues, providing a simple list 
of transversal, operational questions and principles. This could be based upon the FAO 
&#8220;Right to food assessment checklist&#8221; or the October 2011 UNDG &#8220;Guidance note on 
integrating Food and Nutrition Security into Country Analysis and UNDAF&#8221; to which FAO 
contributed and which sets out guidance for all United Nations country teams on the basic 
requirements for a human rights-based approach to food security and nutrition. Table 1 also 
summarizes a number of requirements linked to the right to food that relate to the 
establishment of frameworks at country level. 
</p>
<p>47. The promotion of the right to food at national level would also gain if FAO 
guidelines were to:  
</p>
<p>(a) Set minimal requirements for the process of drafting CPFs and CWPs to 
promote the participation and involvement of relevant civil society constituencies;  
</p>
<p>(b) Encourage the involvement/establishment of interministerial coordination 
mechanisms to support the drafting of CPFs and CWPs. Such mechanisms would also assist 
FAO in its efforts to reach out and respond effectively to demands from other ministries 
and national bodies, beyond ministries of agriculture, whose mandates intersect with that of 
FAO;23 
</p>
<p>(c) Encourage the creation of national parliamentarians&#8217; fronts and provide 
technical knowledge and support for such initiatives, so as to improve the capacity for 
parliamentarians to monitor progress towards the implementation of national strategies for 
the realization of the right to food.

<p><b> B. Taking stock of progress and sharing lessons learned 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur warmly welcomes the decision of the Committee on World 
Food Security to include, during its 41st Session in 2014, a session on progress made in 
implementing the Right to Food Guidelines. This commitment will not only encourage 
progress towards implementing these Guidelines in all regions, it will also offer a unique 
opportunity to assess the contribution the right to food can make to the effectiveness of 
national food security strategies. It will form a sound basis for South-South cooperation and 
transfers of experiences. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur encourages FAO to contribute to this review. In October 
2008, the Right to Food Forum took stock of the progress made in the implementation of 
the Right to Food Guidelines, four years after their adoption.24 However collective learning 
from pilot experiences can and must be accelerated: FAO could consider including a 
chapter on the &#8220;state of the implementation of the right to food&#8221; in its annual flagship 
publication <i>The State of Food and Agriculture </i>(SOFA) in order to increase the level of 
understanding of the benefits of adopting an approach guided by the right to food in setting

<p>and implementing policies in the area of food and agriculture. Moreover, 2014 will mark 
the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Right to Food Guidelines. A SOFA on the right 
to food could usefully map progress made during a decade of implementation of the Right 
to Food Guidelines, identify obstacles that remain, share good practices, and launch a 
debate. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. The relationships between FAO and external stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur shares the observation made in recent evaluation reports, 
that FAO should improve its capacity to foster partnership arrangements in FAO 
activities.25 He welcomes the recent initiatives to ensure that FAO is able to foster more 
efficient partnerships with a range of actors, including civil society, the private sector, 
cooperatives, and academia.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation of civil society 
</b></p>
<p>51. The realization of the right to food at national, regional and international levels will 
not be possible without the effective participation of organizations representing food-
insecure groups. Countries that made significant progress in the implementation of the right 
to food in their legal and policy frameworks have usually welcomed, accepted or actively 
encouraged participation by civil society.26 Within FAO, a number of innovative 
approaches to cooperation with CSOs followed the 1996 World Food Summit. They 
include the Letter of Agreement between FAO and the International Planning Committee 
for Food Sovereignty (IPC) in 2003,27 and the processes of negotiating the Right to Food 
Guidelines (in 2002-2004) and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of 
Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (in 2010-
2012). The Strategy for partnerships with civil society (JM 2012.3/3 Rev.1), submitted to 
the Joint Programme and Finances Committee at its 112th session (7 November 2012) and 
expected to be formally endorsed by the Committee at one of its forthcoming sessions, 
paves the way for stronger partnerships between FAO and civil society. This Strategy 
acknowledges the &#8220;catalytic role&#8221; played by civil society organizations in improving and 
furthering the work of FAO (para. 3).  It recognizes civil society as one of the key 
stakeholders in the fight to eradicate hunger, malnutrition and poverty. It also notes some of 
the achievements of civil society organizations, including their effectiveness in contributing 
to new governance areas for dialogue with governments and other actors established at 
regional and global levels. The Strategy acknowledges that civil society is more than just 
large non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with the identification of three main groups 
of civil society organizations (social movements; member-based organizations; and non-
governmental organizations), and the identification of different constituencies, including 
farmers; pastoralists and herders; fishers and fish workers; forest dwellers; consumers; 
landless; urban poor; NGOs; women; youth; agricultural workers; and indigenous peoples

</p>
<p>and ethnic minorities. The fact that the right to food is identified as one of the important 
mutual principles for collaboration (para. 24) is also welcome.  
</p>
<p>52. The implementation of the Strategy will rely a great deal on the capacity and 
readiness of FAO decentralized offices to enhance their work with civil society, as was 
done with some success in the Dominican Republic. Regional and Country Offices should 
receive further guidance and a clear mandate to recognize CSOs as partners in policy 
processes at country level, including when drafting Country Work Plans, and in developing 
genuine alliances and partnerships with CSO networks to promote the implementation of 
the Right to Food Guidelines. This will not be easy. As made clear by the FAO Office of 
Evaluation, CSOs are too rarely engaged in policy processes at country level, while they are 
frequently involved as partners in implementing FAO projects; too often, the engagement 
of FAO with national farmers&#8217; organizations does not go beyond the &#8220;validation-workshop&#8221; 
type of interaction; and the interaction of FAO with parliamentarians in charge of 
agriculture is generally low.28 The fact that certain governments discourage these types of 
engagement as politically sensitive should not be an obstacle. FAO itself notes that 
adopting an inclusive approach to policy assistance (including donors, other United Nations 
partners, academic institutions and NGOs) has made its work &#8220;considerably more 
</p>
<p>influential and effective&#8221;.29  
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>53. FAO interacts with the private sector in various areas, including in policy dialogue, 
norm- and standard-setting, development and technical programmes, and knowledge 
management. FAO also increasingly works with philanthropic foundations or associations 
such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in 
Africa.  
</p>
<p>54. In 2011, an FAO draft strategy for partnerships with the private sector (JM 
2011.2/5) was presented to a Joint Meeting of the Programme and Finance Committee, 
which requested further elaboration on specific aspects, including decentralization and 
alignment with strategic objectives. The Committee considered a revised version of the 
strategy (JM 2012.3/2) at its 112th session (7 November 2012) and is expected to formally 
endorse a final version at one of its next sessions. The strategy aims to proactively develop 
initiatives to collaborate with private sector entities to increase effectiveness in delivery of 
FAO strategic objectives (para. 9). This is a legitimate objective. However, concerns have 
been expressed about the influence of major corporations on the work of FAO, including in 
the drafting of policy papers;30 and about the lack of transparency over the conditions of 
deliberation, acceptance or funding of certain past partnerships and initiatives. Although 
less than five per cent of FAO resources have come from the private sector in the recent 
past, according to an internal evaluation, these questions deserve serious consideration. The 
private sector has rapidly expanded its interest in agriculture since the 2008 global food 
prices crisis, and it has consequently renewed its interest in the activities of FAO. While 
this situation creates opportunities for increasing the impact of FAO, it also creates risks 
and challenges. The question is whether FAO will remain credible as a guardian of the 
public interest and as an impartial body when it intervenes to shape global responses to 
food insecurity.

<p>55. In that context, the fact that the strategy on partnerships with the private sector is not 
articulated within the right to food normative and analytical framework is troubling: the 
right to food is not mentioned in the latest version, while a human rights-based approach is 
first among the five United Nations Country Programming Principles. The Special 
Rapporteur understands that the documents accompanying the strategy (principles and 
guidelines), which are under review at the time of writing, may include such a reference. 
He would welcome this, as it would ensure symmetry with the strategy on partnerships with 
civil society.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur makes the following comments to contribute to the 
preparation of the accompanying documents of the strategy:  
</p>
<p>(a) Private actors seeking to establish partnerships with FAO should be expected 
to endorse the overarching frameworks for achieving food security and equitable 
sustainable development which have been developed by CFS with FAO assistance, 
including the Global Strategic Framework but also the Right to Food Guidelines, the 
Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and 
Forests in the Context of National Food Security; when they will be adopted by the 
Committee on Fisheries (COFI), the International Guidelines on Securing Sustainable 
Small-Scale Fisheries will also be relevant. This would be a concrete way to meet the 
strategy&#8217;s objective of encouraging the private sector to implement standards set in 
international forums related to the FAO mandate (para. 20.b.); 
</p>
<p>(b) The Principles and Guidelines and the Implementation Plan that will 
supplement the strategy should provide practical guidance on the integration of the right to 
food normative and analytical framework in partnerships;31   
</p>
<p>(c) The selection of private sector partners, and the review, monitoring and 
evaluation done by the FAO Partnership Committee should fully take into account the right 
to food normative and analytical framework. Any collaboration with external stakeholders 
should be based on the principles of transparency and inclusiveness, and a permanent 
public register of meetings with the private sector and CFS could be held. Beyond ensuring 
transparency, FAO could consider establishing adequate consultative mechanisms before 
engaging in significant partnerships; including the consultation of relevant public 
authorities and organizations representing food-insecure groups; 
</p>
<p>(d) As the 2012 International Year of Cooperatives reaches an end, FAO should 
seek a balance between possible partnerships with the corporate private sector, and possible 
partnerships with cooperatives of small-scale food producers that adopt governance 
mechanisms empowering marginalized food producers to realize their right to food and 
ensuring that the search for profit is a means to improve livelihoods and not an end in itself. 
The opening of a liaison office for agricultural cooperatives is a welcome step in this 
regard.  
</p>
<p>57. The above suggestions should also ensure in the future that corporate influence on 
the normative work will not create a &#8220;mission drift&#8221; that could negatively affect the ability 
</p>
<p>of FAO to improve global governance in support of the realization of the right to food, and 
that it continues to be perceived as a voice representing the public interest, for instance, in 
debates concerning the regulation of new biotechnologies, of agricultural investments or the 
challenges created by concentration in the agrifood sector, as discussed by the Special 
Rapporteur in other contributions (see especially A/HRC/13/33).  
</p>
<p>  
 31 This proposal is consistent with the recommendations jointly made in 2011 by the Joint Programme 
</p>
<p>and Finance Committee that the implementation plan for the strategy be &#8220;aligned with FAO&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Strategic Framework&#8221; and &#8220;coherent with that of the UN system&#8221; (CL 143/9, para. 14). </p>

</p>
<p><b> VII. Global governance   </b> 
</p>
<p>58. FAO plays an important role in shaping global governance on food security issues. 
Particularly since 2007/2008, a consensus has emerged that food security could not be dealt 
with separately from other areas of international cooperation, such as climate change, trade, 
rural development or financial regulation. The Special Rapporteur has highlighted on 
numerous occasions the problem of fragmentation of global governance in the area of food 
and nutrition security. Reducing this fragmentation is not something FAO can do alone: 
member States, in particular donors, have a crucial role in building improved coherence and 
convergence, as do the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization.  
</p>
<p><b>  CFS and other FAO bodies 
</b></p>
<p>59. CFS has established itself as the foremost inclusive intergovernmental forum on 
global food and nutrition security issues. It offers an example of an innovative model of 
governance that recognizes the importance of policy convergence as a means to overcome 
the fragmentation of global governance and of a multi-stakeholder approach to address 
complex problems that require collective learning. Its Global Strategic Framework assigns 
a central importance to the right to food framework, and CFS has already taken important 
steps to integrate the right to food in its activities. The Special Rapporteur encourages FAO 
to replicate what has been achieved in CFS in other committees, such as the Committee on 
Commodity Problems, the Committee on Fisheries, the Committee on Forestry, or the 
Committee on Agriculture, as well as in regional conferences, and to include the right to 
food, as appropriate, in any new normative work of FAO, such as the development of 
international codes of conduct, agreements, policies and priorities. In particular, the 
mechanism establishing participation of the constituencies most affected by hunger in CFS 
&#8211; the Civil Society Mechanism &#8211; could usefully be replicated across other FAO 
Committees: there is general agreement that it improves CFS, increasing its legitimacy, 
relevance and effectiveness. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that FAO Regional 
Conferences could go in a similar direction. 
</p>
<p><b>  The role of FAO in the policy debate on global food security  
</b></p>
<p>60. The participation of FAO in many forums discussing global food security (both 
within and outside the United Nations system) is actively sought, given its unique expertise. 
FAO could mainstream the right to food perspective in these forums as well as in its 
relationships with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and non-United 
Nations institutions such as the World Trade Organization. It could also ensure that the 
priorities defined in these other forums are aligned with those identified within CFS, as the 
foremost inclusive intergovernmental forum on global food security issues.  
</p>
<p><b>  Cooperation with the United Nations human rights system 
</b></p>
<p>61. FAO played a key role in the formulation of the right to food as stated in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. However, cooperation 
between FAO and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as with 
the other human rights treaty bodies monitoring the implementation of the right to food is 
currently very limited.  
</p>
<p>62. FAO could improve its contributions to the Human Rights Council and its 
mechanisms by systematically providing relevant data and reports for the country reviews 
carried out under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism. It could also support 
follow-up on thematic or country-specific recommendations of the human rights bodies, 
including the United Nations human rights treaty bodies, UPR, and the special procedures 
of the Human Rights Council.  This would ensure that the expertise of FAO informs the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>work of United Nations human rights bodies or experts, and that, on the other hand, the 
advice and recommendations emanating from these bodies and experts inform the work and 
vision of FAO. For instance, in its resolution 16/27 adopted at its 16th session in March 
2011, the Human Rights Council &#8220;encourages States and donors, both public and private, to 
</p>
<p>examine and consider ways to integrate the recommendations [contained in the report 
&#8220;Agroecology and the right to food&#8221; (A/HRC/16/49)] in policies and programmes&#8221;: 
</p>
<p>recommendations of this kind should be considered by FAO in setting its priorities, as this 
would improve the consistency of global efforts towards food security. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>A more systematic reference to the right to adequate food as an operational tool 
to guide the definition of its priorities and the implementation of its policies at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels can help FAO to improve its work towards the eradication of hunger and 
</b></p>
<p><b>malnutrition. It could also ensure that FAO will deliver a more focused and more 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherent message to its various stakeholders, including its member States. This report 
</b></p>
<p><b>examines how this can be done.  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur invites the FAO Secretariat, the FAO Council and 
other institutional bodies, to support FAO Members in fulfilling their obligations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>progressively realize the right to food, and in particular to:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Promote a more integrated approach to implementing the right to food 
</b></p>
<p><b>across FAO, in particular by strengthening the right to food as a cross-cutting area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>work in the reviewed Strategic Framework and Medium Term Plan 2014-2017; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>by reflecting the key components of the right to food framework in the Action Plans 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the implementation of strategic objectives, so as to ensure that the right to food 
</b></p>
<p><b>normative and analytical framework permeates all core activities of FAO, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>support, guidance and knowledge generation on food and agricultural policies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>nutrition, tenure of land, and trade; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Focus on activities that have the highest impact on food-insecure people 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prioritize support and guidance to States on agricultural, land, and food security 
</b></p>
<p><b>policies that are conducive to the right to adequate food, as they benefit the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized segments of the population and support more resilient agricultural and 
</b></p>
<p><b>food systems; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Mainstream the right to food within the Organization by including right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to food criteria in the programme and project clearance processes, and strengthening 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring systems to assess the impact of its country-level programmes and policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance, including on the basis of structural, process and outcome indicators; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Integrate the procedural requirements of the right to food in a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent and systematic way across FAO activities at country and headquarters 
</b></p>
<p><b>level;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that all new norms and standards created by the FAO 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional bodies are aligned with the human right to adequate food normative 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework, and with States</b>&#8217;<b> obligations to respect, protect and fulfil this human 
</b></p>
<p><b>right;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Continue and expand its support to implement the right to food 
</b></p>
<p><b>normative framework at country and regional levels through dedicated activities 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at integrating the right to food in legal, policy and institutional frameworks; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(g) Ensure that guidance provided to establish Country Programme 
</b></p>
<p><b>Frameworks is informed by the right to food framework, and includes guidance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society participation and interministerial coordination in the process of drafting 
</b></p>
<p><b>such programme frameworks, to foster a comprehensive, coherent approach and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Provide practical guidance on the integration of the right to food 
</b></p>
<p><b>normative and analytical framework in partnerships with civil society and with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>private sector; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Recognize civil society organizations, including social movements, 
</b></p>
<p><b>member-based organizations and NGOs, as partners in policy processes at country-
</b></p>
<p><b>level; and strengthen the capacity of decentralized offices to establish partnerships at 
</b></p>
<p><b>country-level;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) </b>Consider including a chapter on the &#8220;state of the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>right to food&#8221; in its annual flagship publication <b><i>The State of Food and Agriculture 
</i></b></p>
<p><b>(SOFA).  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur expresses the hope that this report will stimulate 
further reflection on the contribution of FAO to the progressive realization of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to food and on the contribution of the right to food approach to the ability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>FAO to fulfil its core objectives.
