<p>GE.10-15022 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 63/162 
and 64/147, in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to prepare for the 
Human Rights Council a report on the implementation of the above-mentioned resolutions. 
In the present report, the Special Rapporteur provides an update to a previous report 
submitted to the Assembly (A/64/295) containing information on activities undertaken by 
States pertaining to resolution 63/162. The Special Rapporteur would like to inform the 
Council that a more detailed report, which will include contributions by States and other 
stakeholders, will be submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-fifth session. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur addresses the human rights and 
democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups, 
including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, as well as similar extremist ideological 
movements. He examines how these parties, movements and groups may pose challenges to 
the human rights principles of non-discrimination; the rights to life and to security of 
person; the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association; and to democracy. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements 
and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and 
similar extremist ideological movements 
</b></p>
<p>3. The ideology and activities of extremist political parties, movements and groups, 
including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and of similar extremist ideological movements, 
most often rely on, either in an overt or covert manner, intolerance, discrimination, 
exclusion and xenophobia. As such, their persistent existence poses major challenges to a 
number of fundamental human rights and freedoms, but also, more generally, to democracy 
itself. 
</p>
<p>4. Since the establishment in 1993 of the mandate on contemporary forms of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, mandate holders and the current 
Special Rapporteur have had the opportunity, through their country visits, to examine the 
question of extremist political parties, movements and groups. In this context, they have 
addressed the challenges posed by these groups to human rights, including acts of violence 
or discrimination based on racism and xenophobia, or incitement thereto, and have made 
concrete recommendations in this regard. These issues were for instance raised during 
country missions to the United States of America (E/CN.4/1995/78/Add.1), Brazil 
(E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.1), Germany (E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.2 and A/HRC/14/43/Add.2),<b> 
</b>France (E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.3), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland (E/CN.4/1996/72/Add.4), the Czech Republic (E/CN.4/2000/16/Add.1), the Russian 
Federation (A/HRC/4/19/Add.3), Italy (A/HRC/4/19/Add.4), Estonia (A/HRC/7/19/Add.2), 
Latvia (A/HRC/7/19/Add.3) and Lithuania (A/HRC/7/19/Add.4).<b> 
</b>5. For the purpose of the present report, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight 
some of the challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups. These 
include challenges to (a) the human rights principle of non-discrimination; (b) the rights to 
life and to security of person; (c) the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and 
association; and (d) democracy. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the 
list of issues addressed in the report should not be regarded as exhaustive. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-15022 
</p>
<p><b> A. The human rights principle of non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>6. Extremist political parties, movements and groups often defend and propagate an 
ideology that fosters racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and 
bring into question the overarching human rights principle of non-discrimination. Indeed, 
these parties, movements and groups frequently incite, either implicitly or explicitly, 
discrimination against certain groups of individuals in relation to, inter alia, their access to 
employment, education or housing, or to their rights to vote or to obtain nationality. 
</p>
<p>7. The rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups within a given society 
is often linked to the difficulty, or sometimes failure, of the traditional political parties to 
deal adequately with certain social and economic issues, such as immigration, 
unemployment and insecurity. Indeed, these parties, movements and groups frequently rely 
on general discontent within the population to blame specific groups of the population for 
the existing insecurity and socio-economic difficulties endured, and put forward often 
simplistic and populist solutions. In this context, through their ideology and activities, 
extremist political parties, movements and groups often exacerbate racist and xenophobic 
attitudes by designating certain vulnerable groups, such as migrants, refugees, asylum-
seekers or members of minorities, as the main source of the problems causing anxiety and 
uncertainty among the population. For instance, the Special Rapporteur notes that there are 
unfortunately deeply marked tendencies to characterize migration as a tangible threat to 
social cohesion, national identity or security. Indeed, in times of economic turmoil, the 
Special Rapporteur has, for instance, received reports indicating that migrants were being 
accused of &#8220;stealing&#8221; employment from nationals. 
</p>
<p>8. In addition to the above, extremist parties, movements and groups also frequently 
incite discrimination by emphasizing that they are the only legitimate holders of the 
national identity of a given country. History abounds with examples of extremist political 
parties, movements and groups claiming that they were the only legitimate holders of the 
national identity of a given country and which adopted a very divisive approach in this 
regard. Indeed, these parties, movements and groups often used the concept of national 
identity in a simplistic manner to determine which individuals could be considered part of 
the group and which ones were the outsiders. In doing so, the concept of &#8220;otherness&#8221; was 
strongly emphasized as a tool to differentiate or create artificial differences between certain 
groups of the population. In extreme cases, this unfortunately led to a strict, and sometimes 
irreversible, categorization of individuals and consequently to the social exclusion and 
discriminatory treatment vis-&#224;-vis certain individuals and groups of individuals. 
</p>
<p>9. The principle of non-discrimination is generally perceived as one of the most 
important in the field of human rights, and is therefore enshrined in all core international 
human rights conventions. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate 
that acts of discrimination, or incitement thereto, are clearly prohibited in international 
human rights law. As such, States have the duty to refrain from discriminating against 
individuals or groups of individuals based on, inter alia, colour, descent, national or ethnic 
origin; to prevent such discrimination, including from non-State actors; and to take steps to 
ensure that, in practice, every person on their territory enjoys all human rights without 
discrimination of any kind. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to incitement to discrimination in particular, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to recall that article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights states that &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. </p>


<p>GE.10-15022 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The rights to life and to security of person 
</b></p>
<p>11. In some cases, the rhetoric of extremist political parties, movements and groups may 
advocate more than discrimination against specific groups; it may publicly and directly 
incite people to commit acts of violence on behalf of extremist ideology, or may justify the 
use of violence against certain groups of the population or against buildings, monuments, 
historical or religious sites. Even when extremist political parties, movements and groups 
do not directly and publicly incite violence, their ideology and activities may contribute to a 
climate conducive to the escalation of violence. 
</p>
<p>12. In this context, the perpetration of racist and xenophobic crimes by individuals and 
groups of individuals closely linked to extremist movements constitutes a major challenge 
to societies, which are becoming increasingly diverse. The Special Rapporteur is indeed 
extremely concerned by reports of individuals being harassed, assaulted, attacked, beaten, 
stoned, stabbed or even murdered just because of their perceived national or ethnic origin, 
their skin colour or other physical attributes. Migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers and 
members of minorities appear to be among the vulnerable groups targeted by these acts, 
which constitute a blatant violation of the rights to life and to security of person, guaranteed 
by articles 6 and 9, respectively, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. The perpetration of racist and xenophobic crimes may ruin the lives of the targeted 
individuals, but it may also have a significant impact on society as a whole by instigating a 
climate of fear, in particular if the perpetrators go unpunished. The Special Rapporteur 
would therefore like to emphasize that these crimes ought to be recognized and addressed 
with resolve by States through legislative and other measures. For instance, it is essential 
that domestic laws criminalize acts motivated by racist hatred and xenophobia, or recognize 
racism or xenophobia as an aggravating factor warranting greater penalties. States should 
also ensure that those responsible are held accountable before the law. In addition, specific 
instructions and training should be provided to law enforcement officers and the judiciary 
to help them deal with racist and xenophobic crimes in an effective and appropriate manner. 
Accurate and up-to-date ethnically disaggregated data collection on racist and xenophobic 
crimes is also important, since it may help inform policy decisions to combat such crimes. 
Furthermore, States should ensure that victims are made aware of their rights and therefore 
have access to justice, including reparation. This is all the more important since victims of 
racial hatred and xenophobia are often part of marginalized groups in society, and may not 
know where to submit a complaint or be reluctant to report a crime to the police, owing to 
lack of trust or fear of reprisal, especially if they happen to be illegal immigrants. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association 
</b></p>
<p>14. States are faced with a complex dilemma when countering the intolerant, 
discriminatory or xenophobic rhetoric and activities by extremist political parties, 
movements and groups. While measures should be taken to counter this kind of rhetoric and 
activities, States must also ensure that, in accordance with international human rights law, 
all individuals and groups of individuals enjoy fully their right to freedom of expression, 
and they must also allow all political parties, movements and groups to exist and enjoy their 
right to freedom of assembly and association. As stated in the Durban Review Conference 
outcome document, &#8220;the right to freedom of opinion and expression constitutes one of the 
essential foundations of a democratic, pluralistic society and stresses further the role these 
rights can play in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance worldwide&#8221; (para. 58). The difficulty therefore consists in assessing when 
restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association may be 
warranted. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-15022 
</p>
<p>15. In this regard, international human rights law defines when restrictions are 
permitted. For instance, with regard to the right to freedom of expression, article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to 
certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are 
necessary: (a) for respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) for the protection 
of national security or of public order (<i>ordre public</i>), or of public health or morals. 
</p>
<p>Article 20 of the Covenant also imposes restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. 
As such, &#8220;any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to 
discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law&#8221;. With regard to the rights to 
freedom of assembly and association, articles 21 and 22 of the Covenant emphasize that no 
restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those prescribed by law 
and which are, in a democratic society, in the interests of national security or public safety, 
public order (<i>ordre public</i>), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the 
rights and freedoms of others. In addition to the above, article 4 of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination also determines when 
restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association are to be 
warranted by States, when they are faced with the dissemination of ideas based on racial 
superiority or incitement to racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur notes that determining which acts or expressions may meet 
the thresholds determined in articles 19 to 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, and in article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination, is ultimately a decision that is best made after a thorough 
assessment of the individual circumstances of each case. This decision should always be 
guided by well-defined criteria, in accordance with international standards, and be made by 
an independent and impartial court or tribunal, taking into account the local conditions, 
history, culture and political context. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Democracy 
</b></p>
<p>17. Democracy is notably characterized by the possibility of holding open debates and 
the free flow of ideas, which may contrast or even compete with one another. In this 
context, international human rights law ensures the right of all citizens to take part in the 
conduct of public affairs, directly or through chosen representatives, and to vote or to be 
elected at genuine elections guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors.1 
The Special Rapporteur takes the view that a democratic society must provide the 
opportunity to all people to participate in public affairs, discuss and even criticize the 
system in place, and to put forward ideas for change and progress, including those deemed 
as radical. Nonetheless it is also essential to introduce safeguards against activities of 
extremist political parties, movements and groups that flout democratic principles and 
human rights, including the principles of non-discrimination and equality. 
</p>
<p>18. The space left for public debate and participation in a democratic society 
undoubtedly allows for the constructive exchange of views and for its continued 
reinforcement. Extremist political parties, movements and groups have also, however, 
effectively learned to use this open space to disseminate their racist, xenophobic or 
intolerant ideologies, thereby posing a serious challenge to democratic polity. Indeed, these 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 25. </p>


<p>GE.10-15022 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>parties, movements and groups have proven their ability to influence or restrict the political 
debate around issues relating to their agenda often based on a racist or xenophobic 
ideology. By presenting simplistic and populist ideas to solve complex problems affecting a 
significant part of the population (relating for instance to unemployment, insecurity or 
immigration), these parties, movements and groups manage to gain electoral support. In 
doing so, they compel traditional political parties to react and focus on these sensitive 
issues, which may in turn foster racist, xenophobic or intolerant attitudes within society if 
dealt with inadequately, and thus have a negative impact on progressive policies designed 
to protect the rights of the vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>19. Democratic societies have developed various strategies to counter extremist political 
parties, movements and groups. Indeed, the Special Rapporteur would like to express his 
appreciation to the political parties that have decided not to associate themselves with 
extremist political parties. He notes that, in some cases, however, traditional political 
parties have accepted to build coalitions with extremist political parties, thereby providing 
them with political legitimacy and access to the conduct of public affairs, where they may 
then implement their discriminatory agenda. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes cases where an independent and impartial 
judiciary has decided that, owing to their illegal activities, extremist political parties, 
movements and groups have had their financing blocked, or, as a last resort, has been 
dissolved. The Special Rapporteur would nonetheless like to draw attention to the capacity 
of dissolved extremist political parties, movements and groups to return under other names 
and status, and therefore continue to propagate their agenda based on hatred. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur therefore would like to emphasize that it is essential for 
political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for fundamental human 
rights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law.<b> </b>In this regard, he would like to 
emphasize the role that, political leaders could and should play in the fight against racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. In particular, he highlights the 
fact that, because of the audience that they reach and the moral authority that they carry, it 
is all the more important for political leaders to condemn and counter all political messages 
fuelling racism and xenophobia. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>22. <b>Extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and 
skinhead groups, and similar extremist ideological movements, pose a major challenge 
to a number of fundamental human rights and freedoms, but also, more generally, to 
democracy itself. The Special Rapporteur takes the view, that even if these parties, 
movements and groups take different shapes, no region of the world is immune to the 
phenomenon. While the best responses should be country-specific and therefore take 
into account the political, historic, economic and sociocultural context of each State, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to make the general recommendations outlined 
below. 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to be more vigilant vis-&#224;-vis 
extremist political parties, movements and groups which promote, either explicitly or 
implicitly, the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement 
to racial discrimination and xenophobia, as well as acts of violence or incitement to 
such acts against specific groups of individuals. He emphasizes that a higher degree of 
vigilance might involve the adoption or more robust enforcement of legislative 
measures, as well as a wide-range of other complementary measures. </b></p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-15022 
</p>
<p>24. <b>With regard to legislative measures, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States 
parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination to comply fully with their international obligations. According to 
article 4 of the Convention, States parties: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas 
based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all 
acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of 
another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist 
activities, including the financing thereof; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Shall declare illegal and prohibit organizations, and also organized and 
all other propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination, and 
shall recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence 
punishable by law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Shall not permit public authorities or public institutions, national or 
local, to promote or incite racial discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>The Special Rapporteur also calls on States to implement fully articles 19 to 22 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantee the 
rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association and determine the 
limitations thereto. 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that public figures, and in particular politicians, 
have a greater capacity to influence the public debate owing to the large audience that 
they reach. He therefore stresses that public figures should be held politically 
accountable for bigoted words that encourage discrimination and violence and create 
a climate of fear for vulnerable groups. 
</b></p>
<p>27. <b>With regard to the perpetration of racist or xenophobic crimes by individuals 
and groups of individuals closely linked to extremist political parties, movements and 
groups, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States to guarantee the right to life and to 
security of person, as well as to protection against violence or bodily harm. In this 
regard, he urges States to take action against racially-motivated violence and ensure 
the access of victims to effective legal remedies, including the right to seek just and 
adequate reparation for any damage suffered as a result of such violence. He also 
urges States to introduce into their domestic criminal law a provision according to 
which committing an offence with racist or xenophobic motivation or aim constitutes 
an aggravating circumstance allowing for heavier penalties. 
</b></p>
<p>28. <b>Law enforcement bodies and members of the judiciary are major actors in the 
implementation of measures taken by States to prohibit and sanction racist or 
xenophobic crimes. As such, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States design 
mandatory human rights training, with a focus on violent acts based on racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. In particular, specific training 
aimed at providing law enforcement bodies with necessary instructions, procedures 
and resources to identify, investigate and register racist or xenophobic crimes should 
be provided. 
</b></p>
<p>29. <b>The Special Rapporteur also encourages States to increase their efforts to reach 
out to community groups, in particular vulnerable groups who are at particular risk 
of racist or xenophobic crimes. He therefore calls upon States to engage with 
concerned communities to reduce fears, instil a sense of trust between the police and 
the communities, encourage the reporting of such crimes to the police, and improve 
the quality of data collection in relation to racist and xenophobic crimes by law 
enforcement bodies. The Special Rapporteur indeed believes that such data help </b></p>


<p>GE.10-15022 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop effective policies and programmes to tackle racially-motivated crimes and 
incidents, assess and monitor the effectiveness of the measures taken, and review the 
legislation when necessary. 
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>As reaffirmed during the 2001 World Conference against Racism, political 
platforms and organizations based on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial 
superiority and related discrimination are incompatible with democracy and 
transparent and accountable governance. The Special Rapporteur similarly reiterates 
that the preservation of democracy is essential to prevent, combat and eradicate 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance effectively. He 
therefore emphasizes the key role that political leaders and political parties have to 
play, and calls upon them to provide answers to the populist and oversimplified 
statements of extremist political parties, movements and groups by re-establishing the 
facts associated with the issues posed by, inter alia, immigration, insecurity and 
unemployment, and by refuting illogical claims through reasoned argument. 
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>In addition, the Special Rapporteur recommends that political parties work 
towards fair representation of national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities 
within and at all levels of their party system, to ensure that their political and legal 
systems reflect the multicultural diversity of their societies. He also recommends that 
they base their programmes and activities on respect for fundamental human rights 
and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law. Political parties should, in this context, 
refuse to enter into any alliance with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic 
character to form majorities wielding political power in a given State. 
</b>32. <b>Responding to extremist political parties, movements and groups from a legal 
perspective only is far from sufficient. Indeed, restrictions on the rights to freedom of 
expression, assembly and association, or the strict regulation of activities of political 
parties will not bring about by themselves the changes needed in mindsets, 
perceptions and discourse to prevent the emergence of or challenge the existence of 
extremist political parties, movements and groups. It is indeed necessary to tackle the 
root causes of this phenomenon with a much broader set of policy measures aimed at 
curbing racism and xenophobia. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that States take concrete steps to raise the population&#8217;s awareness about the adverse 
effects of the ideology and activities of extremist political parties, movements and 
groups. Education is a key tool in promoting democratic values and human rights and 
instilling a sense of tolerance, understanding and respect at an early age. Other 
creative measures may also help to contribute to the construction of pluralistic and 
inclusive societies. Such measures might include initiatives in the field of intercultural 
dialogue, art exhibitions, performances or conferences. They might help open a space 
for various groups of the population to merge and debate specific issues of their 
choice. 
</b></p>
<p>33. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur strongly emphasizes the role played by civil 
society in fostering tolerance, understanding, democratic principles and human rights. 
As such, he recommends that States cooperate closely with all relevant civil society 
actors in developing and implementing measures aimed at countering extremist 
political parties, movements and groups and at fighting racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance more generally.</b>
