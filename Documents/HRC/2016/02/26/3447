</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and affirming the 
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that all States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, as stated in the Charter and elaborated in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
applicable instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human 
Rights Council, the Security Council and the General Assembly, reaffirming, inter alia, the 
illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> that Israel is a party to the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, which is applicable de 
jure to Palestinian and all Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and recalling the declaration adopted by the Conference of 
High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, held in Geneva on 5 December 
2001,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the transfer by the occupying Power of parts of its own civilian 
population into the territory it occupies constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention and relevant provisions of customary law, including those codified in 
Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the International Court of 
Justice on the <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied</i> 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p> <i>Palestinian Territory</i>, and its conclusion that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, were established in breach of international 
law,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004 and other 
relevant United Nations resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i> Affirming</i> that the Israeli settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including in East Jerusalem, are illegal under international law and constitute very serious 
violations of international humanitarian law and of the human rights of the Palestinian 
people therein, and undermine international efforts, including the Annapolis Peace 
Conference of 27 November 2007 and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian State of 17 December 2007, aimed at invigorating the peace process and 
establishing a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State by the end of 
2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the statement made by the Quartet on 21 September 2010 and its 
attachment to the implementation by the parties of their obligations under the Quartet road 
map to a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and noting 
specifically its call for a freeze on all settlement activities, 
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its grave concern</i> about the continuation by Israel, the occupying Power, 
of settlement building and expansion in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in 
East Jerusalem, in violation of international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations 
resolutions, including plans to expand and connect Israeli settlements around Occupied East 
Jerusalem, thus threatening the creation of a contiguous Palestinian State, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> that continuing Israeli settlement activity undermines the 
realization of a two-State solution, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing grave concern</i> about the continuing construction, contrary to 
international law, by Israel of the wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
in and around East Jerusalem, and expressing its concern in particular about the route of the 
wall in departure from the Armistice Line of 1949, which could prejudge future 
negotiations and make the two-State solution impossible to implement and which is causing 
the Palestinian people further humanitarian hardship, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that the wall&#8217;s route has been traced in such a way as to include 
the great majority of the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including 
East Jerusalem, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its concern</i> at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate fully 
with the relevant United Nations mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the Council of the European Union conclusions on the Middle East 
Peace Process of 8 December 2009, in which the European Union Council of Ministers 
reiterated that settlements, the separation barrier where built on occupied land, demolition 
of homes and evictions are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace 
and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible, and particularly its urgent call upon 
the government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities, in East Jerusalem and 
the rest of the West Bank, and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts 
erected since March 2001; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Welcomes with appreciation</i> the statements made by the majority of the 
States Members of the United Nations on the illegality of settlement activities in the 
Occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and reaffirming the urgent calls by </p>


<p>the international community upon the Government of Israel to stop immediately all 
settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the recent Israeli announcements of the construction of new 
housing units for Israeli settlers in the West Bank and around occupied East Jerusalem, as 
they undermine the peace process, constitute a threat to the two-State solution and the 
creation of a contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian State, and are in violation 
of international law,<b> </b>and calls upon the Government of Israel to reverse immediately its 
decisions, which would further undermine and jeopardize the ongoing efforts by the 
international community to reach a final settlement compliant with international legitimacy, 
including relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses its grave concern</i> at: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The continuing Israeli settlement and related activities, in violation of 
international law, including the expansion of settlements, the expropriation of land, the 
demolition of houses, the confiscation and destruction of property, the expulsion of 
Palestinians and the construction of bypass roads, which change the physical character and 
demographic composition of the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem and the 
Syrian Golan, and constitute a violation of the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the 
Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and in particular article 
49 of that Convention, and recalls that settlements are a major obstacle to the establishment 
of a just and comprehensive peace and to the creation of an independent, viable, sovereign 
and democratic Palestinian State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The increasing number of newly built structures, in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 
and 2012 amounting to several thousands, including a large number of permanent buildings 
and structures, which undermine the efforts of the international community to advance the 
Middle East peace process;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>)  The implications for the final status negotiations of Israel&#8217;s announcement 
that it will retain the major settlement blocks in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including the settlements located in the Jordan Valley; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>)  The expansion of Israeli settlements and the construction of new ones on the 
occupied Palestinian territory rendered inaccessible behind the wall, which create a fait 
accompli on the ground that could well be permanent, in which case it would be tantamount 
to de facto annexation; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>)  The Israeli decision to establish and operate a tramway between West 
Jerusalem and the Israeli settlement of Pisgat Zeev which is in clear violation of 
international law and relevant United Nations resolutions; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges </i>Israel, the occupying Power: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To reverse the settlement policy in the occupied territories, including East 
Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan, and, as a first step towards their dismantlement, to stop 
immediately the expansion of the existing settlements, including &#8220;natural growth&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>related activities, including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>)  To prevent any new installation of settlers in the occupied territories, 
including in East Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 6.  <i>Calls upon</i> Israel to take and implement serious measures, including 
confiscation of arms and enforcement of criminal sanctions, with the aim of preventing acts 
of violence by Israeli settlers, and other measures to guarantee the safety and protection of 
the Palestinian civilians and Palestinian properties in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem; </p>


<p> 7. <i>Demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, comply fully with its legal 
obligations, as mentioned in the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by the 
International Court of Justice; 
</p>
<p> 8.  <i>Urges</i> the parties to give renewed impetus to the peace process in line with 
the Annapolis Peace Conference and the Paris International Donors&#8217; Conference for the 
</p>
<p>Palestinian State, and to implement fully the road map endorsed by the Security Council in 
its resolution 1515 (2003) of 19 November 2003, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive 
political settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, including 
resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, 446 (1979) 
of 22 March 1979, 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979, 465 (1980) of 1 March 1980, 476 (1980) of 
30 June 1980, 478 (1980) of 20 August 1980, 1397 (2002) of 12 March 2002, 1515 (2003) 
of 19 November 2003 and 1850 (2008) of 16 December 2008,<b> </b>and other relevant United 
Nations resolutions, the principles of the Peace Conference on the Middle East, held in 
Madrid on 30 October 1991, the Oslo Accords, the Arab Peace initiative and subsequent 
agreements, which will allow two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to dispatch an independent international fact-finding mission, to be 
appointed by the President of the Human Rights Council, to investigate the implications of 
the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, 
with a mandate ending on submission of a report to the Council, and calls upon Israel, the 
occupying Power, not to obstruct the process of investigation and to cooperate fully with 
the mission; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide all administrative, technical and logistical assistance to enable 
the mission to fulfil its mandate promptly and efficiently; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the present 
resolution at its twentieth session; 
</p>
<p> 12.  <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the matter.
