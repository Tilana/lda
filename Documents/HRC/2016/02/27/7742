<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report describes the work undertaken by the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala (OHCHR-Guatemala) during 
</p><p>2013. In compliance with its mandate, OHCHR-Guatemala conducted monitoring activities 
in order to provide technical assistance and advice to State institutions and civil society in 
the implementation of international human rights obligations and the recommendations of 
human rights mechanisms. OHCHR-Guatemala concluded the first phase of the Maya 
Programme, which contributed to building judicial precedents related to indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>Effective coordination among State institutions enabled Guatemala to take 
unprecedented steps to combat impunity. Despite the fact that the Constitutional Court 
overturned, in May, the verdict against Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt, Guatemala made history by 
becoming the first country in the world to convict a former head of State for genocide in 
line with international standards. Proceedings will resume in 2015.

<p>High levels of violence, including against women, continued to affect the enjoyment 
of human rights. The report also describes the situation of indigenous peoples and their 
struggle for collective rights. Energy and extractive projects, particularly in indigenous 
territories,** were one of the main sources of unrest and, occasionally, violence. In most 
cases, the common denominator of social conflicts was the failure to inform and to consult 
with indigenous and other communities concerned. The High Commissioner recognizes 
some positive steps taken in the promotion of rural development and the fight against 
malnutrition, and welcomes the establishment of a Global Compact Local Network and 
encourages companies and other stakeholders to adhere to the Compact&#8217;s principles.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
signed an agreement with the Government of Guatemala for the establishment of a country 
office (OHCHR-Guatemala). Under the agreement, the functions of OHCHR-Guatemala 
are to monitor the human rights situation and provide advice to State institutions and civil 
society. The agreement was extended for a second time, for three years, on 
19 September 2011. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report provides an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala, 
with a special focus on the justice system and the fight against impunity. It also describes 
the work conducted by OHCHR-Guatemala and includes a series of recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National context 
</b></p>
<p>3. During the second year of his term, President Otto P&#233;rez Molina continued to 
prioritize the Covenant for Security, Justice and Peace, along with the Fiscal and 
Competitiveness Covenant and the Zero Hunger Covenant.  
</p>
<p>4. The questioning of the Minister of Culture and Sports paralysed the congressional 
agenda throughout most of 2013. By the end of the legislative session, a first package of 
laws on transparency in the management of public funds had been adopted.1 The approval 
of a second legislative package, which is crucial for strengthening the anticorruption 
mechanisms, is still pending. 
</p>
<p>5. Several allegations of corruption involving high-level officials in areas such as 
customs, ports and procurement were made public. In May, former President Alfonso 
Portillo was extradited to the United States of America on money laundering charges. 
Guatemala ranked 123rd out of 177 countries in Transparency International&#8217;s 2013 
Corruption Perceptions Index.2 
</p>
<p>6. Guatemala continued to implement a project for the consolidation of peace, with 
funding from the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund, which contributed to strengthening 
capacities in the administration of justice. The mandate of the International Commission 
against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) was renewed until 2015, and Iv&#225;n Vel&#225;squez, 
appointed as Commissioner by the United Nations Secretary-General, took office in 
October.  
</p>
<p>7. In November, the Government signed on to the second phase of the Maya 
Programme, jointly implemented by OHCHR-Guatemala, the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and financed by 
Norway. The programme will continue to promote indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the areas 
of education, political participation and justice. 
</p><p>8. Guatemala hosted the forty-third session of the General Assembly of the 
Organization of American States, and, in this setting, promoted a comprehensive policy to 
address the drug problem.

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Overall human rights situation 
</b>9. The High Commissioner welcomes the unprecedented steps taken by the State in the 
fight against impunity, led by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office (Ministerio P&#250;blico) (see 
para. 18 below). These were possible due partly to the effective coordination and 
cooperation between the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the Ministry of the Interior (Ministerio 
de Gobernaci&#243;n), the National Civil Police (PNC), and the National Institute of Forensic 
Science in Guatemala (INACIF), with the support of CICIG in some cases. 
10. In order to avoid setbacks, consolidate the achievements in the fight against 
impunity, and strengthen the independence of the judiciary it is critical that the nominating 
commissions &#8212; responsible for the selection of magistrates for the Supreme Court of 
Justice and the Courts of Appeal, the Attorney General and other authorities in 2014 &#8212; 
apply the principles of objectivity, suitability, transparency and accountability in this 
process.  
</p>
<p>11. Seventeen years after the signing of the Peace Agreements, the State continued to 
take steps to face its past as a prerequisite for strengthening the rule of law. As an 
illustration of this trend, a historic trial took place against former head of State Efra&#237;n R&#237;os 
Montt and former chief of military intelligence Jos&#233; Mauricio Rodr&#237;guez S&#225;nchez, on 
charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against the Ixil people in 1982 (see 
paras. 26&#8211;28 below).  
</p><p>12. Human rights defenders were subjected to media campaigns and attacks aimed at 
discrediting their work. These attacks were directed against the defenders of victims of 
human rights violations during the internal armed conflict; environmental rights defenders; 
and indigenous and peasant activists (see paras. 45&#8211;49 below). In some cases high-level 
State officials also questioned their work. 
</p>
<p>13. The enjoyment of the right to life continued to be affected by the high levels of 
violence and food insecurity. According to INACIF, there were 5,156 violent deaths, 
including 664 women, 356 boys and 122 girls.3 According to the PNC, 81 per cent of 
homicides were committed with firearms, compared to the world average of 42 per cent.4 
Despite the measures taken by the State to fight organized crime, three massacres were 
recorded by OHCHR-Guatemala: in Las Cruces, Pet&#233;n, 5 people died in April; in Salcaj&#225;, 
Quetzaltenango, 9 police officers were killed in June; and in San Jos&#233; Nacahuil, Guatemala, 
11 people were murdered in September. There were 43 deaths by lynching &#8212; an increase 
of 169 per cent.5 In 2013, 106 children under the age of 5 died due to causes related to acute 
malnutrition.6 
</p>
<p>14. The inequality gap persists throughout the country. According to the Rural Poverty 
Map, the majority of the 55 municipalities with poverty levels ranging between 85 and 97 
per cent are indigenous.7 These municipalities also account for more than 60 per cent of 
chronic malnutrition among children under age 5.8

<p>15. Although the recent Tax Update Law allowed for a substantial increase in income 
tax collection, other factors, such as the low rate of customs duty collection, the reduction 
in the vehicle circulation tax and the weakness of the Tax Administration System, limited 
the State&#8217;s revenue-raising capacity. With national tax revenue of under 11.5 per cent of the 
gross domestic product, social investment maintained the same levels as in 2012.  
</p>
<p>16. Energy and mining projects, especially those in indigenous territories, were one of 
the main sources of unrest. The conflicts related to these projects occasionally led to 
episodes of violence, such as in El Escobal and Santa Cruz Barillas (see para. 63 below). In 
May, a state of emergency (<i>estado de sitio</i>) was declared in some municipalities in the 
departments of Jalapa and Santa Rosa. A common denominator in these social conflicts was 
the failure to inform and to consult with indigenous and other local communities potentially 
affected by these projects.  
17. In line with the recommendations of the High Commissioner and the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, the President presented a bill that, if 
approved, would require a two-year moratorium on licences for the exploitation of metallic 
minerals. This could be a window of opportunity for a comprehensive process that should 
include not only a reform of the Mining Law, but also the strengthening of the 
environmental instruments and regulation of prior consultation, with the participation of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Justice  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>18. There was significant progress in the fight against impunity. Court decisions were 
issued in high-impact cases related to organized crime, including cases of corruption, 
kidnapping, extortion, rape and murder. The role of the high-risk courts was crucial in these 
decisions. Coordination among State institutions in criminal investigation and prosecution 
led to the dismantlement of several corruption networks, including one involving the mayor 
of La Antigua and members of the municipal council; the arrest of the alleged perpetrators 
of the above-mentioned massacres of Nacahuil and Salcaj&#225; (para. 13); and the arrest of 
alleged drug traffickers, among others.  
</p>
<p>19. However, there was little progress in the implementation of the Law of the General 
Directorate of Criminal Investigation, which would contribute to ensuring a sustained 
coordination among institutions.  
</p>
<p>20. In comparison to 2010, there was a 15 per cent increase in scientific evidence 
requests from the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to INACIF in the investigative phase, resulting 
in accusations that were no longer based primarily on witness testimony. This contributed 
to a 6.47 per cent increase in the number of accusations as compared to 2012, as well as to 
an increase of 9.4 per cent in the number of convictions.9 A positive development was the 
establishment, in January, of the Criminal Analysis Unit in the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, 
with the mandate to advise prosecutors on strategic decisions related to criminal 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>21. The purge within the Attorney General&#8217;s Office did not advance in the same way. 
Congress failed to appoint the members of the Council of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office &#8212;

<p>the body responsible for hearing appeals in disciplinary proceedings. As a result, it was not 
possible to execute sanctions in 87 per cent of the cases because they were under appeal.10 
</p>
<p>22. The new management model of the Judiciary (Organismo Judicial) helped reduce 
the judicial backlog. In Guatemala City, the percentage of cases solved (ending with a 
verdict or other forms of termination) between 2010 and 2013 increased by 48 per cent in 
first instance criminal courts and by 62 per cent in criminal sentencing tribunals.11 The 
Judiciary took important steps in the area of infrastructure and formulated proposals for 
legal and regulatory reforms, such as the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, aimed 
at reducing the backlog in non-criminal jurisdictions (civil, family, labour, children and 
adolescents).  
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights cases 
</b></p>
<p>23. OHCHR-Guatemala registered progress in the prosecution of human rights 
violations. In August, High-Risk Tribunal &#8220;B&#8221; convicted three police officers, including the 
former chief of criminal investigation, for the extrajudicial execution of 10 inmates in 2005 
and 2006, related to a breakout from the &#8220;El Infiernito&#8221; Detention Centre and the &#8220;Pavo 
Real&#8221; plan in the Pav&#243;n Detention Centre, respectively.12 Two people face prosecution in 
Spain and Switzerland for the same events, and one person was acquitted in Austria in 
October. 
</p>
<p>24. In January, an appeals judge issued a verdict, substantiated by international 
standards, which repealed a circular of the Penitentiary System Directorate preventing 
transsexual persons deprived of liberty from wearing female clothing or having long hair. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights, a judge for 
children and adolescents issued four verdicts recognizing the State&#8217;s responsibility for the 
violation of the right to food of two boys and three girls in Camot&#225;n, Chiquimula. The 
judge ordered the State to provide comprehensive measures of reparation, which were 
partially implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Transitional justice 
 1. The genocide trial 
</b></p>
<p>26. In May, High-Risk Tribunal &#8220;A&#8221; sentenced Efra&#237;n R&#237;os Montt to 80 years&#8217; 
imprisonment and acquitted former intelligence chief Jos&#233; Mauricio Rodr&#237;guez S&#225;nchez, 
demonstrating that it is possible to prosecute former high-level State officials for genocide 
in their own country. During the trial, the testimonies of nearly 100 indigenous victims 
were heard, in their own languages, and, for the first time, in an oral and public debate 
indigenous women spoke about the sexual violence they had suffered during the internal 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>27. However, the use of over 70 different delay tactics by defence lawyers, especially 
injunctions (<i>amparos</i>) in various instances, was aimed at obstructing justice. Only 10 days 
after the judgement was issued, the Constitutional Court nullified the sentence and reverted 
the process to an earlier stage. The resumption of proceedings has been tentatively 
scheduled for 5 January 2015. This situation has affected the victims&#8217; right to justice, after

</p>
<p>they waited for over 30 years. The plaintiffs then filed a case before the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>28. The debate outside the courts was marked by media campaigns to discredit judges, 
prosecutors, human rights defenders and members of the international community. There 
were also instances of racial hatred against indigenous peoples. Public statements by the 
private and other sectors tested the independence of the judiciary. However, the events 
described in detail by the witnesses during the proceedings, and confirmed by scientific 
evidence, were never refuted.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Other developments 
</b></p>
<p>29. In March, former military commissioner Isidro Cardona Osorio was convicted for 
the 1982 enforced disappearance of Edgar Leonel Paredes Cheg&#252;&#233;n. Two former directors 
of the now defunct National Police were convicted for the enforced disappearance, in 1984, 
of the student Edgar Fernando Garc&#237;a. In September, a commander of a non-State armed 
group was charged with murder and crimes against humanity in relation to acts committed 
in 1988 against civilians in the village of El Aguacate, Chimaltenango.  
</p>
<p>30. In an unequivocal statement, in August, the Constitutional Court affirmed the 
inadmissibility of amnesties and statutes of limitations in cases of serious human rights 
violations, in conformity with the State&#8217;s international obligations. The High Commissioner 
hopes that this line of jurisprudence will be maintained. In the R&#237;os Montt case, there is a 
pending judicial decision on whether to apply the Law on National Reconciliation, which 
rules out amnesty in relation to genocide, crimes against humanity and other international 
crimes, or an older law (Decree 8-86), which granted broad amnesty for political crimes. 
</p><p>31. Progress was made in the mapping of institutional archives, which is crucial both in 
terms of ensuring access to information and documenting paradigmatic cases from the past. 
However, there is still no legal framework to safeguard these archives, as mentioned in 
previous reports.13 
</p>
<p><b> C. Independence of the judiciary 
</b>32. The Supreme Court of Justice, with OHCHR-Guatemala&#8217;s support, presented to 
Congress a bill to reform the Law on the Judicial Career. Congress should give priority to 
the adoption of this bill, further incorporating OHCHR-Guatemala&#8217;s recommendations to 
ensure the separation of the administrative and jurisdictional functions, in accordance with 
the principle of judicial independence. The approval by the Supreme Court of internal 
mechanisms to strengthen due process guarantees in disciplinary proceedings, including 
regulations on ethical standards, is another positive step.  
</p>
<p>33. While threats against judicial personnel continued, there was little progress in 
investigating and prosecuting these cases, confirming the need to strengthen the Judicial 
Operators Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. Judges, prosecutors, victims and witnesses 
were subject to threats, particularly in the context of the genocide trial. The Attorney 
General also suffered constant attacks and media campaigns that sought to discredit her 
work. Three magistrates suffered public attacks as a result of decisions based on 
international standards on indigenous peoples (see para. 62 below). In February, attorney 
Lea de Le&#243;n, who had litigated high-impact cases, was murdered.

</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Justice and indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>34. Indigenous authorities and organizations continued to turn to the judicial system to 
defend their rights. Most of the cases questioned the granting of licences for mining or 
energy projects without prior consultation. In three cases related to the granting of 
hydroelectric licences in the Ixil region, the Human Rights Ombudsman (Procurador de los 
Derechos Humanos) filed amicus curiae briefs in the Constitutional Court in support of the 
plaintiffs&#8217; claims.14  
</p>
<p>35. The Constitutional Court handed down five sentences on the collective rights of 
indigenous peoples, in response to constitutional injunctions or <i>amparos</i> related to 
consultation (see para. 57 below), collective property (see para. 59 below), and the use of 
indigenous names (two cases against the National Registry Office15). Although in some 
cases the Court did not rule in favour of the plaintiffs, the progressive incorporation of 
international standards in the Court&#8217;s jurisprudence established important precedents for 
future litigation.  
</p>
<p>36. Given the lack of a specific legal framework, the coordination between the 
indigenous and the ordinary jurisdictions continued to face challenges. Despite this, two 
decisions by the Supreme Court&#8217;s Criminal Chamber acquitted K&#8217;iche&#8217; authorities of 
Totonicap&#225;n who had been detained after administering justice in their respective 
communities.16 These decisions followed &#8220;a process of development of jurisprudential 
doctrine that defines indigenous law as a set of principles and norms &#8230; coexisting with 
State law under a paradigm of legal pluralism&#8221;.17  
</p>
<p>37. In spite of these incipient advances in jurisprudence, indigenous peoples continue to 
face serious obstacles to access to the ordinary justice system. The establishment of the 
Judiciary&#8217;s Centre for Indigenous Legal Translation and Interpretation, in August, and the 
creation of the Department on Indigenous Peoples in the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, in July, 
could help overcome these obstacles. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>38. The penitentiary system registered an increase in the number of persons deprived of 
liberty, further exacerbating the overcrowding in jails (153 per cent above capacity). More 
than 50 per cent of detainees are in pretrial custody (7,445 men and 894 women). In the 
past five years, the number of women in detention doubled (from 650 in 2008 to 1,452 by 
31 August 2013).18  
</p><p>39. Despite the measures taken by the State to control detention centres and fight 
corruption within them, criminal networks continued to operate within and outside these 
centres. The case of a military officer convicted of murdering Bishop Juan Gerardi in 1998, 
who was found by authorities outside the penitentiary where he was serving his sentence; as 
well as the Nacahuil massacre (see para. 13 above), allegedly ordered from within a 
detention centre, were among the most notorious cases.

</p>
<p>40. Despite the creation, in 2012, of the inter-institutional working group to implement 
precautionary measures granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on 
behalf of people with mental disabilities confined in the Federico Mora National Mental 
Health Hospital, and the efforts of the Presidential Commission for Coordinating Executive 
Policy in the Field of Human Rights (COPREDEH), the infrastructure for and nutritional 
and health conditions of the inmates continue to be of concern. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Security  
</b>41. Important initiatives were introduced in the context of the Security, Justice and 
Peace Covenant,19 such as the creation in March of the Third Vice Ministry within the 
Ministry of the Interior, on the prevention of violence and crime. In addition, in accordance 
with proposals by the National Commission for Police Reform, two regional offices of the 
Police Academy and one school for PNC officers were established, incorporating about 
3,000 new police members.20 Due to its broad scope of application, some aspects of the 
Covenant are still in an incipient stage, in areas such as deprivation of liberty, local security 
committees, and prevention of armed violence. It is thus not possible to adequately assess 
its impact.  
</p>
<p>42. In response to the events in Totonicap&#225;n in October 2012,21 the High Commissioner 
recommended that the involvement of the military in internal security should be exceptional 
and temporary, and subject to civilian control.22 However, the use of joint military and 
police task forces increased, with limited effect on the improvement of security. 
Approximately 1,500 military were deployed in Escuintla, Huehuetenango and Zacapa.23 
The Maya Task Force, deployed in zone 18 of the capital, with more than 1,100 army and 
124 police officers,24 was able to reduce violent deaths locally by 32 per cent; however, 
property and sex-related offences increased.25 At the national level, the downward trend in 
violent deaths since 2010 was reversed in 2013. According to diverging statistics from 
INACIF and the PNC, the homicide rate in 2013 increased by between 4.3 and 6.5 per cent 
in comparison to 2012; the rate for women increased by between 17 and 26 per cent.26  
</p>
<p>43. Some progress was observed in compliance with the law on regulating private 
security companies (Decree 52-2010), including the adoption, in October, of a regulation to 
implement the law,27 and the granting of the first operating licences, in November. 
However, significant challenges persist in guaranteeing greater control of these companies, 
since the majority continue to operate without a licence and many individual security 
providers do not comply with the law.  
</p>
<p>44. Additionally, OHCHR-Guatemala registered new complaints of abuse by security 
company personnel during protests against mining projects. In May, a security official from

 Government Order 417-2013. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the San Rafael mine was charged with bodily injury and obstruction of justice during an 
attack by the company&#8217;s private security guards against a group of demonstrators (see 
para. 63 below). In July, the Superior Court of Ontario, Canada agreed to hear three cases 
against HudBay Minerals for homicide, bodily injury and sexual violence allegedly 
committed by security personnel in El Estor, Izabal. The absence of mechanisms within the 
business sector, particularly among extractive companies, to guarantee that company 
security practices are in compliance with international standards, is of concern. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>45. According to the Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders of Guatemala 
(UDEFEGUA), attacks and threats against human rights defenders increased in the past 
five years. By September, 18 murders had been reported. These included the killings of 
Carlos Hern&#225;ndez Mendoza, a member of the Camoteca Peasants&#8217; Association, 
in Chiquimula, in March; Excaltaci&#243;n Marcos Ucelo, a member of the Council of 
Santa Mar&#237;a Xalap&#225;n; and Daniel Pedro Mateo, leader of the Social Movement of Santa 
Eulalia in Santa Cruz Barillas, in April. These three cases took place in the context of 
conflicts related to the exploitation of natural resources.  
</p>
<p>46. During the year, the offices of the Association for the Advancement of the Social 
Sciences (AVANCSO) and the Central American Institute for Social Democracy Studies 
(DEMOS), the organization of the current Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, were broken into, and 
computers and documents stolen. According to preliminary investigations, these cases were 
common crimes, and the alleged perpetrators were detained. A break-in at the home of an 
attorney of the Centre for Legal Action in Environment and Social Issues (CALAS) was 
also reported; to date there has been no progress in the investigation.  
</p>
<p>47. OHCHR-Guatemala observed that protests by communities and social organizations 
against projects for the exploitation of natural resources frequently triggered criminal 
proceedings against protestors with charges such as terrorism and criminal conspiracy, 
which appear disproportionate to the gravity of the alleged offences.28 Several cases were 
dismissed by the judiciary due to the lack of evidence and the inability to prove individual 
responsibility. Examples include the case of Rub&#233;n Herrera, a member of the Assembly of 
Peoples of Huehuetenango for the Defence of Territory, charged on 12 counts (including 
terrorism), who was released in May, and the cases of 26 people detained in San Rafael las 
Flores, in April, on charges of &#8220;unlawful assembly&#8221; and attacks on public authorities, who 
were subsequently released due to lack of evidence.  
</p>
<p>48. In August, the Human Rights Ombudsman issued a resolution, based on human 
rights standards, in which he declared that all publications and speeches that stigmatize and 
discredit human rights defenders are an attack against their dignity, incite hatred and 
delegitimize their work.29 
</p>
<p>49. The Unit for the Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights Defenders lost 
relevance, despite efforts by several institutions to reclaim its role. The representatives of 
the institutions participating in the Unit were replaced by technical officers, which 
contributed to the decision by some civil society organizations to no longer participate in

<p>the Unit. After the murders of four journalists, the Government launched a protection 
mechanism for media workers with the support of UNESCO and OHCHR-Guatemala. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>50. The establishment of the Special Cabinet for Women under the Vice-President&#8217;s 
Office triggered a process of inter-institutional coordination in favour of women&#8217;s rights. 
Gender units, which are to provide advice to the President regarding the formulation of 
gender policies, were activated within ministries and secretariats.30 However, there were 
delays in the allocation of funds for the Comprehensive Support Centres for Women 
Survivors of Violence (CAIMUs).  
</p><p>51. In 2013, 198 reports of femicide and 31,836 reports of other forms of violence 
against women were filed.31 There is no disaggregated data for indigenous and Afro-
descendant women. Given the dimensions of the problem, the strengthening of the model 
for comprehensive assistance to victims in five units of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office 
throughout the country was an important step. 
</p>
<p>52. Specialized courts established to handle cases of femicide and other forms of 
violence against women proved effective in issuing verdicts. Of the 556 judgements in this 
area, 427 were delivered under this specialized jurisdiction.32 Despite the opening of new 
courts and tribunals in Escuintla and Izabal, the specialized tribunals face challenges 
regarding the expansion of their coverage, and regarding the standardization of policies 
with those of ordinary tribunals.  
</p>
<p>53. The Secretariat against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Human Trafficking 
(SVET) strengthened inter-institutional coordination for the implementation of the Law 
against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Human Trafficking. However, the lack of 
statistical information and the high degree of impunity in these crimes (93 per cent) is of 
concern.33  
</p>
<p><b> B. Sexual and reproductive rights  
</b></p>
<p>54. Despite recent legislative progress,34 data continue to reveal a disturbing reality. A 
total of 373 women died of pregnancy-related causes. Abortions performed under 
dangerous conditions continued to be the fourth leading cause of maternal death.35 
OHCHR-Guatemala is concerned about the State&#8217;s position regarding its &#8220;unqualified 
respect for the right to life from the moment of conception&#8221;,36 presented in response to the

<p>55. The Health Information Management System recorded 2,906 pregnancies among 
girls between 10 and 14 years old (January&#8211;June 2013), despite State efforts in that area. In 
this context, SVET reported 457 cases of rape to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office.37  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Rights of indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>56. The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples continued to be limited by 
inadequate legislation and the weakness of the institutions with mandates on indigenous 
issues. Funding for the Presidential Commission on Discrimination and Racism against 
Indigenous Peoples in Guatemala (CODISRA), the Office for the Defence of Indigenous 
Women (DEMI) and the Guatemalan Fund for Indigenous Development (FODIGUA) 
represented only 0.009 per cent of the national budget. In August, the President announced 
the creation of a Cabinet for Indigenous Peoples and Intercultural Affairs. This initiative, in 
addition to other commitments made by the Government in 2012,38 reflects the increasingly 
widespread perception of the need for a debate on the design and mandate of these 
agencies.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Participation and consultation 
</b></p>
<p>57. The obligation of the State to consult with indigenous peoples was reiterated, as a 
matter of principle, in two Constitutional Court judgements; however, the Court failed to 
overrule administrative and legislative measures that were adopted without prior 
consultation with indigenous peoples. In February, the Court dismissed an action 
challenging the constitutionality of the Mining Law, which alleged lack of consultation 
with indigenous peoples in the adoption of the Law. In its judgement, the Court confirmed 
its jurisprudence on the State&#8217;s duty to consult with indigenous peoples under International 
Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal 
Peoples in Independent Countries, but concluded that it was not applicable in relation to the 
Mining Law because its &#8220;scope is broad and not restricted to any particular territorial region 
or specific cultural or ethnic group&#8221;.39 Also in February, the Court granted an injunction 
(<i>amparo</i>) filed by Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217; communities that had not been consulted on the Entre R&#237;os 
hydroelectric project in Lanqu&#237;n, Alta Verapaz.40 However, the Court decided not to cancel 
the project, so as not to affect the country&#8217;s development policies.  
58. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare continued to coordinate an ad hoc inter-
ministerial committee established to draft a protocol for consultations with indigenous 
peoples. Without waiting for the results of this process, the Ministry of Energy and Mines 
simultaneously granted three new mining licences and four licences for hydroelectric 
projects41 without prior consultation. In response, indigenous peoples held eight new &#8220;good-

<p>faith community consultations&#8221;, which were not taken into account as starting points for 
broader consultation processes involving the State. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Lands, territories and natural resources 
</b></p>
<p>59. The land rights of indigenous peoples continued to be circumscribed by legislation 
that fails to meet international standards. In February, the Constitutional Court resolved a 
claim that challenged the constitutionality of part of the Civil Code because it did not 
regulate indigenous communal property.42 The Court recognized that this was an &#8220;issue that 
was pending in the legislative history of the country&#8221;.43  
</p>
<p>60. The reform of the administrative procedures of the Land Fund (FONTIERRAS) 
paved the way for the recognition of indigenous communities as direct collective rights 
holders, without resorting to formulas that are foreign to indigenous forms of organization, 
such as peasant associations. 
</p>
<p>61. The Secretariat for Agrarian Affairs continued to hold round-table discussions on 
ancestral land claims in the Xinka communities of Santa Mar&#237;a Xalap&#225;n, citing a Royal 
Decree from 1717. This unprecedented process highlights the importance of taking a 
historical approach to the resolution of indigenous land conflicts.  
</p>
<p>62. A number of development projects increased tensions between municipal authorities 
and communities over the ownership of and access to collective lands. Examples include 
the legal disputes between the Cofrad&#237;a de San Jos&#233; and the municipality of San Jos&#233; 
Poaquil, Chimaltenango, over the administration of a communal forest, and that of the 
Kaqchikel authorities in the municipality of Chuarrancho, Guatemala, in relation to the 
lands that were titled to the community in the nineteenth century. The decision by the Third 
Appeals Court of Civil and Commerce Law in the Chuarrancho case44 further establishes an 
important legal precedent in the recognition of collective lands and traditional authorities, 
demonstrating that justice for indigenous peoples can be achieved through the national 
justice system. These cases were supported by the strategic litigation component of the 
Norwegian-funded Maya Programme. 
</p>
<p>63. Approval of licenses for mining and energy projects continued to generate conflict. 
In the mining site of El Escobal (San Rafael las Flores, Santa Rosa), peaceful anti-mining 
protests involving neighbouring communities were held, but there were also recurring 
outbreaks of violence. In January, two private security guards were killed by armed 
persons. In April, six villagers were injured by security guards, one policeman was killed in 
San Rafael and 25 police officers were detained by the communities for 14 hours in 
Xalap&#225;n. These incidents led to the declaration of a state of emergency in May. In July, four 
cement-plant workers in San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez were attacked with machetes in Santa Fe 
Oca&#241;a. In August, during the visit of the Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, two children were shot dead by an 
unknown gunman in the Q&#8217;eqchi&#8217; community of Monte Olivo, Cob&#225;n, which opposes the 
Santa Rita hydroelectric project. In Santa Cruz Barillas, Huehuetenango, the detention in 
September of a leader opposed to a hydroelectric project led to renewed protests and 
roadblocks in the region &#8212; one soldier was killed and a community member injured. 
</p><p>64. Several initiatives were undertaken by the Government to solve conflicts, such as 
round-table discussions or the provision of voluntary royalties. Some of these initiatives

<p>succeeded, at least temporarily, in reducing tensions. In June, the President inaugurated a 
round-table discussion concerning the El Tambor mining project, in San Jos&#233; del Golfo and 
San Pedro Ayampuc, with the participation of the Human Rights Ombudsman and the 
Representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala. 
In October, a round-table discussion continued in Barillas. The Government took steps to 
strengthen the Presidential Commission for the National System of Dialogue, particularly 
through the adoption of Government Order 166-2013, which builds on a preventive 
approach and is aimed at strengthening the conflict-management capacities of authorities at 
local and departmental levels.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>65. In view of the concentration of poverty and extreme poverty in rural areas (71 per 
cent of the rural population is poor compared to 35 per cent of the urban population), and 
despite opposition by powerful sectors, the Government took decisive steps towards the 
implementation of the National Policy for Comprehensive Rural Development with the 
creation of the Rural Development Cabinet and the adoption of a plan of action targeted at 
rural populations living in poverty. This policy is recognition that private investment alone, 
in rural areas, is not sufficient to promote inclusive human development, and that 
comprehensive measures are needed to support family agriculture. 
</p>
<p>66. In compliance with the agreements reached as a consequence of the 2012 
Indigenous, Peasant and Popular March, monitored by OHCHR-Guatemala as honorary 
witness,45 the Government granted land for the relocation of 140 families that had been 
evicted from the Polochic Valley in 201146 and reiterated its commitment to relocate the 
remaining 628 families.  
</p>
<p>67. Regarding access to land, FONTIERRAS resolved 47 of the 123 cases of agrarian 
debt by granting subsidies that covered, on average, 77 per cent of individual debt. 
However, due to the low budget allocated to the fund, the land purchase programme has 
been discontinued. Such issues indicate the need to reformulate agrarian policies in 
accordance with the voluntary guidelines on land tenure prepared by the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.47 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>68. Malnutrition rates continue to be of grave concern. The 13,193 cases of acute 
malnutrition in children under five reflect a 15 per cent increase in comparison with 2012.48 
The coverage of the Zero Hunger Plan reached 166 priority municipalities and engaged 
local authorities in the implementation of the plan. The information and monitoring system 
on food security improved. The budget of the &#8220;1,000 Day Window&#8221; programme, the main 
component of the Plan, was doubled and implementation rates improved.49  
</p>
<p>69. Despite progress, the Human Rights Ombudsman confirmed the persistence of 
serious obstacles to the implementation of the Zero Hunger Plan in some of the poorest and

 According to the General Revenues and Expenditures Budget for Fiscal Year 2013, Q633 million

<p>most remote municipalities. Issues identified include a lack of medicine and micronutrients 
and insufficient numbers of health care workers.50 The &#8220;Mi bono seguro&#8221; programme, 
launched by the Ministry of Social Development, reported low budgetary execution (52 per 
cent as at November), as well as delays in the delivery of conditional cash transfers. In 
order to meet its goals, the programme must focus on the structural issues that contribute to 
malnutrition rates, such as impediments to food production, to income-generation, to the 
payment of minimum wages and to the improvement of rural infrastructure.51 The impact of 
the rust plague on coffee crops during 2013 has compounded the situation &#8211; an estimated 75 
per cent of temporary workers and 77 per cent of small coffee growers now face food 
insecurity.52  
</p>
<p><b> B. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>70. In the context of an ILO mission and the Dominican Republic &#8211; Central America &#8211; 
United States Free Trade Agreement, measures were taken to improve compliance with 
labour standards.53 The Ministry of Labour adopted regulations to improve monitoring 
practices in critical areas.54 However, if more resources are not allocated to the Labour 
Inspectorate, the implementation of the regulations will be limited.  
</p>
<p>71. The Ministry of Labour inspected agricultural, textile and security companies, as 
well as sectors with high levels of child labour. A total of 640 agricultural companies were 
inspected, of which 26 per cent did not pay the minimum wage, and 20 per cent did not 
enrol their workers in the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGSS).55 Out of the 1,386 
security companies inspected in 2013, 1,042 failed to pay the minimum wage and 843 
companies did not enrol their workers in the IGSS. 
</p>
<p>72. The situation of domestic workers did not improve during the year. It is estimated 
that 60 per cent of such workers earn salaries under the minimum wage, 98 per cent have 
no employment contract, and only 1 per cent were enrolled in the IGSS.56 The ratification 
of ILO Convention No. 189 (2011) concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers would 
contribute to eliminating discriminatory treatment.  
</p>
<p>73. In September, an ILO high-level tripartite mission visited the country to assess the 
need for a commission of inquiry on freedom of association.57 The mission noted the 
involvement of CICIG in the investigation of 20 of the 58 cases of killings of trade 
unionists previously brought before the ILO. The mission also noted the signing of an 
agreement between the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and trade unions to investigate the cases. 
However, the mission reported that no investigations had led to sentencing. Trade unions 
submitted eight additional cases of killings in 2013.

<p> 57 Conclusions of the high-level tripartite mission to Guatemala, September 2013.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.1 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>74. The President sent a bill to Congress proposing reforms to the Labour Code to 
establish a procedure by which only labour courts could sanction employers for breaches of 
labour standards.58 However, the ILO mission recommended that Congress adopt 
legislation enabling the Labour Inspectorate to directly impose administrative sanctions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to housing 
</b></p>
<p>75. Shortcomings in the enjoyment of the right to adequate housing were evidenced by a 
substantial housing deficit (1,501,166 homes),59 as well as in the number of irregular urban 
settlements (over 400). The budget allocation for the Housing Fund (FOPAVI) proved 
insufficient to address the situation.60  
</p>
<p>76. The case of La Palangana, involving the relocation of 470 families that were 
occupying a plot of land in the capital, illustrates the existing challenges in the 
implementation of the Housing Law.61 Only 254 of those families received subsidies 
through the Fund&#8217;s housing subsidy programme. Due to administrative problems the 
families were relocated to a plot of land with inadequate living conditions, as the planned 
construction work had not been undertaken. 
</p>
<p><b> X. Business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>77. In 2013, the organized business sector supported policies on education and the fight 
against malnutrition. In October, at the National Meeting of Business Leaders, the 
&#8220;Mejoremos Guate&#8221; initiative led to the signing of a human development pact involving the 
political parties represented in Congress. The High Commissioner hopes that this trend 
towards implementing corporate social responsibility will gradually incorporate the 
responsibility to respect human rights. This entails identifying, preventing, mitigating and 
accounting for the negative impacts of business activities on human rights, especially 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p>78. The process towards the establishment of a Global Compact Local Network 
continued. The High Commissioner welcomes this development and encourages business 
companies as well as civil society stakeholders to adhere to the principles of the Global 
Compact, particularly those related to the respect for universally recognized human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> XI. Activities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala  
</b>79. OHCHR-Guatemala conducted 46 missions throughout the country to monitor the 
human rights situation, and held meetings with authorities, social organizations, victims and 
their families, and witnesses to follow up on alleged or confirmed human rights violations. 
It also monitored judicial proceedings in paradigmatic cases.

<p>80. OHCHR-Guatemala provided technical assistance to Congress on reforms to the 
Law on Nominating Commissions; the creation of the Commission on the Search for 
Disappeared Persons; implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court; ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, and of the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance; and a bill on community media.  
</p>
<p>81. OHCHR-Guatemala provided training to criminal judges from around the country, 
judicial officers of tribunals for children and adolescents, judges focused on high-risk cases, 
and Supreme Court and Constitutional Court legal clerks. The Office continued to support 
the thematic compilation of international standards for the Constitutional Court&#8217;s website 
and organized seminars with magistrates of the Constitutional Court and of the Supreme 
Court&#8217;s Criminal Chamber.  
</p>
<p>82. OHCHR-Guatemala provided assistance to the Ministry of Labour in drafting an 
inspection protocol for agricultural workers and to the National Council for Persons with 
Disabilities (CONADI) in creating a legislative commission on persons with disabilities. 
The Office provided training on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to the Ministry of the 
Environment and Natural Resources and to the Ministry of Energy and Mining.  
</p>
<p>83. Technical assistance was provided to the Human Rights Ombudsman in order to 
strengthen the institution&#8217;s regional offices, improve methodologies and procedures for the 
investigation of human rights abuses, and foster the implementation of a human rights-
based approach in the analysis of social conflicts. Technical assistance was provided to the 
Amparos and Appeals Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in the areas of transitional 
justice, children&#8217;s rights, and rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex 
(LGBTI) persons, and to the Department for Indigenous Peoples.  
</p><p>84. Technical assistance was also provided to civil society organizations working in 
various areas, such as economic, social and cultural rights, transitional justice, the 
prevention of torture, the rights of persons with disabilities, LGBTI persons, migrants and 
indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>85. OHCHR-Guatemala facilitated dialogue between indigenous leaders and authorities, 
and provided technical assistance to the Council of Peoples of the West, to the 48 Cantones 
of Totonicap&#225;n, to the Coordinadora Nacional de Viudas de Guatemala, and to the Ixil 
indigenous authorities. 
</p>
<p>86. OHCHR-Guatemala concluded the first phase of the Maya Programme (funded by 
Norway), which included training on strategic litigation in indigenous rights cases. Partner 
organizations filed 18 cases before Guatemalan courts. 
</p>
<p>87. OHCHR-Guatemala convened a discussion group on transitional justice and 
provided advice to the UNDP Transitional Justice Programme in Guatemala; participated in 
working groups with United Nations agencies and donor countries, and provided technical 
assistance to the Peacebuilding Fund. Together with UNESCO, OHCHR-Guatemala 
organized a national consultation with indigenous peoples concerning the United Nations 
development agenda beyond 2015 and participated in the preparation of the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework for 2015&#8211;2019. 
</p>
<p>88. OHCHR-Guatemala organized public forums on weapons control, implementation 
of international standards, nominating commissions, LGBTI rights, and an inter-agency 
presentation of a report on evictions in the Polochic Valley. 
</p>
<p>89. In general, OHCHR-Guatemala promoted public debates on human rights-related 
issues through statements by the High Commissioner, press releases and public statements 
or interviews, messages from special procedures of the Human Rights Council, and the use 
of social networks. It presented and distributed the report of the High Commissioner on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19 
</b></p>
<p>situation of human rights in Guatemala (A/HRC/22/17/Add.1) at the twenty-second session 
of the Human Rights Council, and disseminated publications and educational material 
through its Documentation Centre. It continued to promote respect for diversity with the 
photo exhibit &#8220;Guatemala Diversa&#8221; nationwide, and in various forums and conferences. It 
collaborated with the Theatre Festival on Human Rights and the International Film Festival 
on Memory, Truth and Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Cooperation with human rights protection mechanisms 
</b>90. In March, the Human Rights Council adopted the outcome of the second universal 
periodic review of Guatemala (A/HRC/22/8). Guatemala received 138 recommendations, 
accepting 111 and taking note of 27 (A/HRC/22/8/Add.1). In particular, the State pledged 
to redesign the human rights institutional system and strengthen the specialized jurisdiction 
to protect women, to develop policies for the prevention of violence, and to develop a 
protection programme for journalists. It also committed to maintaining its permanent 
system for follow-up to recommendations, in cooperation with civil society, and to submit a 
mid-term implementation report. The High Commissioner reiterates her willingness to 
provide technical assistance to support the Government in implementing recommendations 
from all United Nations human rights mechanisms, including those of the universal period 
review. 
</p>
<p>91. The Committee against Torture adopted its concluding observations on Guatemala 
in May (CAT/C/GTM/CO/5-6), noting the lack of progress in the definition of the crime of 
torture, in accordance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, despite its previous recommendations and 
Constitutional Court resolution 1822-2011. The Committee further stated the need to 
designate the members of the national preventive mechanism. 
</p>
<p>92. With the involvement of CONADI and technical assistance of OHCHR-Guatemala, 
the State submitted its first report to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (CRPD/C/GTM/1). The report signalled serious difficulties in the 
implementation of the relevant instruments, such as the Law for Persons with Disabilities 
and the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities, due to limited budget allocation, the 
lack of social awareness, and the absence of specific data, among other reasons. 
</p>
<p>93. The Government will be providing dates for the visits requested by several special 
procedures mandate holders.  
</p>
<p><b> XIII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urges the State to 
implement, in a coordinated manner and</b> <b>in consultation with civil society, the

</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In the light of the situation, as observed by OHCHR-Guatemala, the High 
Commissioner would like to make the following recommendations.

strengthen them;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Encourages Congress to adopt the amendments to the Law on the

</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the State guarantee that human

<p>98. <b>The High Commissioner encourages the State, in the context of the debate on 
the Mining Law reform, to review, in consultation with indigenous peoples, the 
legislative and institutional framework related to resource development projects, in 
order to reinforce social and environmental safeguards.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women and girls 
</b></p>

upon Congress to adopt the draft law on rural development, in order to ensure 
sustainability. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The High Commissioner calls on companies, especially those whose activities 
may bear a greater risk of social conflict, to align their policies with the Guiding
