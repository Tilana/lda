Notes to Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
(US Dollars)
June 30, 2016 and 2015
(Unaudited – see Notice to Reader dated August 29, 2016)
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN
Portage Biotech Inc. ("the Company") was operating as an Ontario, Canada incorporated company, Bontan
Corporation Inc. ("Bontan"), until July 5, 2013. On July 5, 2013 Bontan changed its name to the current name
and was issued a certificate of Continuance by the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the British Virgin Islands
("BVI").
The Company now continues as a BVI incorporated company with its registered office located at FH
Chambers, P.O. Box 4649, Road Town, Tortola, BVI. Its Toronto agent, Portage Services Ltd.,  is located at
47 Avenue Road, Suite 200, Toronto, Ontario, M5R 2G3, Canada.
The Company is a reporting issuer with the Ontario Securities Commission and US Securities and
Exchange Commission and its shares trade on the OTC Markets under the trading symbol "PTGEF," and are
also listed for trading in US currency on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol "PBT.U".
The Company is engaged in researching and developing pharmaceutical and biotech products through to
clinical "proof of concept" with an initial focus on unmet clinical needs. Following proof of concept, the
Company will look to sell or license the products to large pharmaceutical companies for further development
and commercialization.
The Company is in the clinical stage, and as such no revenue has been generated from its operations. The
Company has accumulated losses of approximately $14 million and has negative cash flows from operating
activities of approximately $3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Management has secured sufficient equity financing which it believes will enable it to meet its operating
commitments. However, it will require additional resources to continue into clinical trials and/or for additional
acquisitions. The Company and its subsidiaries continue to obtain financing, although there are no
assurances that the management's plan will be realized. These conditions indicate the existence of a
material uncertainty that raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts, or the amounts and classification of liabilities, which might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue its operations.
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
(a)Statement of Compliance and Basis of presentation
These consolidated Interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"),
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations
Committee. These consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information required for
full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2016.
These consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for
stock based compensation and warrants which are measured at fair value as detailed in Notes 9 and 10 to
these financial statements.  In addition, these consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared
using the accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow information.
The Company has no requirement to report on segments as it operates as only one segment.
These consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Audit Committee
and Board of Directors on August 29, 2016.
b) Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and,
a.Portage Services Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Ontario on January 31, 2011.
b.
c.
Portage Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a wholly owned subsidiary resulting from a merger on July 23, 2013 and is
incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, as a BVI business company.
Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Limited ("Biohaven"), a private corporation incorporated in
BVI on September 25, 2013. The Company held approximately 54% equity in Biohaven on January 6,
2014. However, Biohaven issued additional shares to third parties since then and as a result, the
Company's equity in Biohaven was reduced to 49.18% as at June 30, 2016. The Company is still a single
majority equity owner and three of its directors are the directors in the five-member Board of Biohaven. As a
result, accounts of Biohaven are consolidated under the applicable IFRS.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.
(c) Functional and presentation currency
The Company's functional and presentation currency is US Dollar.
(d) Use of Estimates and judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Significant areas where estimation uncertainty and critical judgments are applied include valuation of
financial instruments, research and development costs, fair value used for acquisition, assessment of
impairment in goodwill and other intangible assets and measurement of share- based compensation.
3.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies are set out in Note 3 to the fiscal 2016 audited consolidated financial statements.
These policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated interim
financial statements,
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Company's consolidated interim
financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued which the
Company reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Company intends to adopt those
standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9 ‐ Financial Instruments
The IASB intends to replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements, with IFRS 9,
Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 will be published in six phases, of which the first phase has been published.
For financial assets, IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at
amortized cost or fair value, and replaces the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on
how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be
used. For financial liabilities, the approach to the fair value option may require different accounting for
changes to the fair value of a financial liability as a result of changes to an entity's own credit risk.
IFRS 9 (2014) is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning on April 1, 2018, but is available for
early adoption. The Company has yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15, issued by the IASB in May 2014, is applicable to all revenue contracts and provides a model for the
recognition and measurement of gains or losses from sales of some non-financial assets. The core principle
is that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for
transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and
contract modifications) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. IFRS 15 is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and is to be applied retrospectively, with earlier
adoption permitted. Entities will transition following either a full or modified retrospective approach. The
Company does not believe that the above standard will have any impact on its financial statements.
IFRS 16, Leases
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most
leases. Lessees will have a single accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. The new
standard is effective January 1, 2019, with limited early application permitted. The new standard permits
lessees to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach on transition for leases existing
at the date of transition, with options to use certain transition reliefs. The Company does not believe that the
above standard will have any impact on its financial statements.
4. CASH
Cash includes $ 6,506,361 (March 31, 2016: $3,408,458) held in trust by a US lawyer, pending opening of a
bank account by Biohaven. There are no restrictions on use of cash.
5.INVESTMENT
In August 2015, the Company acquired 210,210 Series A preferred stock in Sentien Biotechnologies Inc., a
Medford, MA based private company ("Sentien") for $ 700,000 in cash. The preferred stock is fully
convertible into equal number of common shares. The Company's holdings represent less than 20% of the
equity of Sentien. The Company has determined that it has no significant control or influence over the affairs
of Sentien and has therefore accounted for this investment at fair value as an available for sale financial
instrument, which at June 30, 2016 was considered equal to its carrying value. Sentien is planning Phase 1
study of its lead product, a cell-containing dialysis device for the treatment of Acute Kidney Injury.
As at June 30, 2016, the Company has determined that there was no evidence of any impairment in the
value of this investment and as a result no adjustment was considered necessary in its carrying value.
6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets comprise worldwide intellectual property rights to a portfolio of over 300 prodrugs,
classified as New Molecular Entities NMEs), including IP rights to all future therapeutic indications and are
amortized over twelve years effective April 1, 2016, when prodrugs were first put to use. The movements
during the three months ended June 30, 2016 were:

development

The current estimates of the present value of the drugs under development using the compounds covered
under the acquired NMEs based on the discounted cash flow valuation model indicates revenue expected to
be far in excess of the cost of acquisition of the NMEs.  As a result, the Company concluded that there was
no impairment in the carrying costs of the intangible assets.
7.   GOODWILL
The Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis as of March
31, and whenever events occur or when circumstances change that would, more likely than not, indicate that
the fair value of our reporting unit ( Biohaven) is below its carrying value.
As at June 30, 2016, no new information was available which would indicate that the fair value of goodwill is
below its carrying value.

Loss per share is calculated on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
three months ended June 30, 2016, which was 253,438,894 (Three months ended June 30, 2015:
219,663,492).
The Company had nil warrants (June 30, 2015: nil) and approximately 16.75 million options (June 30, 2015:
10.3 million) which were not exercised as at June 30, 2016. Inclusion of these options in the computation of
diluted loss per share would have an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share and are therefore excluded
from the computation. Consequently, there is no difference between loss per share and diluted loss per
share.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and
information about financial instruments. These estimates are subject to and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgment, therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates.
A summary of the Company's risk exposures as it relates to financial instruments are reflected below:
a)Fair value of financial instruments
The Company's financial assets and liabilities are comprised of cash, advances and receivable and,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
.
The Company classifies the fair value of these transactions according to the following fair value hierarchy
based on the amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument:
•
•
Level 1 – Values are based on unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 – Values are based on inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and
volatility factors, which can be substantially observed or corroborated in the marketplace. Prices in Level 2
are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 – Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that are not based on observable market data.
Investment is classified as level 3 financial instrument.
Assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and
may affect the placement within the fair value hierarchy.
•
The Company's financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks: credit risk and liquidity risk.
b)Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counter-party's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. The
credit risk is attributable to various financial instruments, as noted below. The credit risk is limited to the
carrying value amount carried on the statement of financial position.
a.
b.
Cash– Cash is held with major international financial institutions in Canada and a major law firm in the
USA and therefore the risk of loss is minimal.
Other receivable – The Company is not exposed to major credit risk attributable to customers. A significant
portion of this amount is a prepayment of Directors & Officers insurance premiums.
c)Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in satisfying financial obligations as they
become due.
The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking harm to the Company's reputation. The Company holds sufficient cash to
satisfy obligations under accounts payable and accruals.
The Company monitors its liquidity position regularly to assess whether it has the funds necessary to take
care of its operating needs and needs for investing in new projects. The Company believes that its existing
cash will allow it to finance the drug development work apart from meeting its operational needs for at least
another six months. However, the exact need for additional cash cannot be reasonably ascertained at this
stage  Should the Company require further funding, it intends to secure it through further rounds of  equity
financing.
However, as a biotech company at an early stage of development and without significant internally
generated cash flows, there are inherent liquidity risks, including the possibility that additional financing may
not be available to the Company, or that actual drug development expenditures may exceed those planned.
The current uncertainty in global markets could have an impact on the Company's future ability to access
capital on terms that are acceptable to the Company. There can be no assurance that required financing will
be available to the Company.
16. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES
The Company considers the items included in Shareholders' Equity as capital. The Company had payables
of approximately $ 1 million as at June 30, 2016 (approximately $ 0.3 million as at March 31, 2016) and
current assets, mostly in cash, of approximately $8.5 million (approximately $4.9 million as at March 31,
2016). The Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern in order to pursue new business opportunities and to maintain a flexible capital structure
which optimizes the costs of capital at an acceptable risk.
The Company manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic
conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. To maintain or adjust the capital structure,
the Company may attempt to issue new shares, issue new debt, acquire or dispose of assets or adjust the
amount of cash.
As at June 30, 2016, the shareholders' equity was approximately $ 11.7 million (approximately $ 10.3 million
as at March 31, 2016), $4.7 million ($ 1.7 million as at March 31, 2015) of it was held in the form of cash.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements and does not presently utilize
any quantitative measures to monitor its capital. There have been no changes to the Company's approach to
capital management during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
17. NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS
The Company's material non-controlling interests ("NCI") at June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 were
associated with Biohaven. There were no dividends paid by Biohaven during these periods. Summarized
financial information based on those amounts included in these consolidated financial statements for

looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to; the applicability of patents and proprietary
technology; possible patent litigation; approval of products in the Company's pipeline; marketing of products;
meeting projected drug development timelines and goals; product liability and insurance; dependence on
strategic partnerships and licensees;  concentration of the Company's revenue; substantial competition and
rapid technological change in the pharmaceutical industry; the publication of negative results of clinical trials

We caution that the foregoing list of important factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive. When
reviewing our forward-looking statements, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing
factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Additional information about factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, and about material factors or assumptions applied in

Portage develops pharmaceutical & biotech products through to clinical "proof of concept" focussing on
unmet clinical needs. Following proof of concept, Portage will look to sell or license the products to large
pharmaceutical companies for further development through to commercialization.
Portage seeks products & co-development partners in cancer, infectious disease, neurology and psychiatry
with novel targeted therapies, or reformulations that can be patented.
Portage will work with a wide range of partners, in all phases of development. The collaboration may include
direct funding or investing human capital/sweat equity from our extensive pool of talented scientists and
physicians to value-add by mitigating risks, clinical trial design and regulatory expertise.
Our research and development work is primarily carried out through two subsidiaries:
Portage pharmaceuticals Ltd ( PPL)
On June 4, 2013, following the acquisition of Portage Pharma Ltd, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary,
Portage Acquisition Inc. and Portage Pharma Ltd amalgamated. The amalgamated company was named
PPL, which has been incorporated in the BVI.
 
PPL's focus is in discovering and developing innovative cell permeable peptide (CPP) therapies to
normalize gene expression, restore function and improve medical outcomes. Its core technology involves
delivering biologically active "cargo" to intracellular and intranuclear targets to normalize cell and tissue
function, improve the immunogenicity of vaccines and enable better treatment of intracellular pathogens.
 
The CPP platform is protected by two suits of intellectual property:
 
a.         an exclusive license for all patents on Antennapedia–based cell permeable peptides for non-
oncology use and
b.         international patents for proprietary human-derived cell penetrating peptide structures without any
therapeutic restrictions. Patent is protected until 2034. In July 2014, PPL successfully validated this new
proprietary cell permeable peptide platform technology derived from human genes. This proprietary platform
technology has been shown to efficiently deliver an active pharmacological agent or cargo into a cell without
disrupting the cell membrane.  In a collaboration with the Pirbright Institute (UK), a conjugate utilizing this
proprietary cell permeable peptide and a CD8 T-cell antigenic epitope derived from mycobacterium
tuberculosis was demonstrated to provoke a specific CD8 T-cell immune response in Balb/c mice
suggesting possible application of this technology for vaccines.
Since its inception the PPL strategy has been three--‐fold.  First was the development, evaluation and
selection of our platform cell penetrating peptide (CPP).  We tested a number of different CPPs and found
one that we derived from human genes that was superior to the others we tested including the Antennapedia
fruit fly molecule we licensed from Trojantec and Imperial College in London. We selected this human-
-‐based CPP to be the basis of our CellPorter® platform.
Once we selected the CellPorter® platform, the second leg of our strategy was and still is exploring
the ways it can be used therapeutically.  We pursued collaborations to bring world--‐class subject-
-‐area expertise to some of our research questions.    For example, we collaborated with scientists at Yale to
evaluate its cell penetrating properties, with the Pirbright Institute in the UK to explore its potential for vaccine
use, with scientists at the National Eye Institute to evaluate its penetration into eye tissues when given as
eye drops, and with a scientist at the University of Michigan to investigate blood brain barrier penetration.
Through these collaborations we learned that CellPorter® enhances immune reactions to vaccines, did get
inside eye tissues, and did penetrate the blood brain barrier. PPL also conducted its own studies that
demonstrated CellPorter® can be used to dose peptides systemically by inhalation, and we
have ongoing work looking at the feasibility of topical skin use and of using CellPorter to deliver
nucleotide and peptide cargos that alter genes and regulate gene function.
We are always exploring new collaborations with other companies and academic research groups to
expand the uses of our platform.  From all of this work we learned a lot about our technology and initiated our
lead project.
The third leg of our strategy is developing our lead product, PPL--‐003, for Dry Eye Disease. Over the last
year and a half, our work was designed to move forward while reducing the risk of failure with each step and
husbanding our resources wisely.  There is a large unmet medical need and market potential for this
disease.  We recently completed a very positive animal dry eye study, where PPL--‐003 had steroid--‐like
efficacy and faster onset of action.  We presented this work in Seattle at the annual meeting of The
Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO), the largest international eye disease
meeting, where it was well received. In addition, our studies so far show that topical PPL--‐003 does not
have the characteristic steroid side--‐effects of glaucoma or cataracts. We selected a CRO and engaged
experts to help us plan PPL--‐003's clinical development to proof of concept.  An expert panel meeting is
scheduled for August 6th and we plan to hold a pre--‐IND meeting with the FDA later this year.
PPL is now looking at avenues to seek further funding or partnership to complete pre--‐clinical and GMP
process development work, and schedule human testing in 2018.
Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Limited (Biohaven)
As at April 1, 2016, Portage held 52.85% equity interest in Biohaven. During April 2016, Biohaven raised
approximately $6.9 million through private placements with third parties. As a result, Portage's equity in
Biohaven reduced to 49.18%.
Founder shareholders include originators at Yale University who discovered the therapeutic potential of
glutamate modulation in anxiety and depression and have track record of successful registration trials.
Biohaven is engaged in the identification and development of novel glutamatergic agents for treatment –
resistant neuropsychiatric disorders. Biohaven's drug development platform is based on modulating
glutamate for multiple therapeutic indications and represents the 1st new class of antidepressant in 30 years.
Biohaven intellectual property comprises patents licensed from Yale and Harvard Universities, exclusive
Zydis formulation license from Catalent Inc. and divisional patents pending for additional claims. In August
2015, Biohaven acquired the world-wide intellectual property rights to a portfolio of over 300 prodrugs owned
by ALS Biopharma, LLC ("ALSBio"). The prodrugs covered by the agreement were designed and prepared
by Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. ("FCCDC") through a research program funded, in part, by the
U.S. National Institutes of Health, through two peer-reviewed Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
grants awarded to FCCDC.  Most of the ALSBio prodrugs would be classified as New Molecular Entities
(NMEs), and the intellectual property rights acquired by Biohaven include all future therapeutic indications.
Overall clinical development progress during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and to date:
In March 2016, FDA granted Biohaven an orphan drug designation covering BHV -0223 for the treatment of

Business environment
Risk factors
Please refer to the Annual Report in the form F-20 for the fiscal 2016 for detailed information as the
economic and industry factors that are substantially unchanged.
Business plan
Portage is in the business of licensing, researching and developing potential drug candidates. The
Company would like to assemble a portfolio of products: diversified as to their stage of development and
pathology. Then inexpensively take them through to phase 2b clinical trial often called proof of concept
("POC").
Upon a successful POC we will monetize the products through sale or license to big Pharma.
We are seeking discovery and co-development partners in areas such as cancer, infectious disease,
neurology and psychiatry developing novel targeted therapies, stem cell therapy and even older marketed
products that have been found to have novel patentable characteristics that bring new value to patients.
The goal is to grow Portage by carefully selecting compelling products to license, acquire or position as a
joint venture. The product portfolio will be carefully selected to be at various stages in drug development but
with an overriding characteristic of being attractive to large pharmaceutical companies. Portage has a strong
team with extensive experience in drug development that will be leveraged to source the aforementioned
products, to undertake the due diligence and guide them through drug development to monetization.
Furthermore, the team's track record of drug development success will be utilized to gain equity in lieu of
cash in third party products.
Portage seeks products & co-development partners in cancer, infectious disease, neurology and psychiatry
with novel targeted therapies, or reformulations that can be patented.
Portage will work with a wide range of partners, in all phases of development. The collaboration may include
direct funding or investing human capital/sweat equity from our extensive pool of talented scientists and
physicians to value-add by mitigating risks, clinical trial design and regulatory expertise.

Three months ended June 30, 2016
Biohaven had significantly increased development activities with BHV-0223 and BHV-4157 securing orphan
drugs designations for Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and BHV_4157 getting clearance from FDA for the
treatment of SCA and commencement of first dosing to evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetics. Further,
Biohaven also expanded its staff with addition of a CFO and Chief Commercial Officer. These factors
resulted in increased charges from CROs and legal. Approximately 3.6 million or 95% of the R & D costs
related to Biohaven. PPL has also continued with its pre-clinical trials.
Further details are provided under "nature of operations and overview "section of this report.
Three months ended June 30, 2015:
Level of research and development costs remained consistent. Major cost being fee paid by Biohaven to a
third party research company under a Master Service Agreement. This is more fully explained in note 10 (c)
to the unaudited consolidated financials for the three months ended June 30, 2015. All other R & D costs
were incurred at PPL in their pre-clinical work on their product candidate PPL-003. Consulting fees include
cash fees of approximately $ 68,000 and value of vested options of $ 22,000 paid to the PPL chief executive
officer and chief scientific officer.
PPL is currently progressing into additional preclinical efficacy and safety studies which involve more animal
studies for PPL-003. Biohaven filed their IND in July and has now received clearance from FDA to proceed
to the clinical trial phase 1 on humans as explained elsewhere in this report.
Consulting fees and payroll
Consulting fees include cash fee and vested options as explained in note 13 to the unaudited consolidated
financials for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Major cost for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included value of 550 new options granted in April
2016 by Biohaven to certain consultants and employees, which were valued at approximately $1.6 million
using Black-Scholes option model. Of this value, approximately $821,000 being the value of options vested
during the quarter using graded option valuation method were expensed as consulting fee.
Cash fee for the three months to June 30, 2015 included fee of $ 45,000 paid to CFO. Value of vested
options granted to six consultants including the four directors of the Company totalled to approximately $
117,000 for the period. There were no payroll since the administrative assistant at PSL who resigned in July
2014 was not replaced.
Professional fees
Professional fees for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included legal fees of $239,086 – 90% of the
total cost- charged by the Biohaven lawyers. PPL initiated a lawsuit against a supplier for formulation error
and are seeking to recover the damages incurred as a result of this error. PPL incurred approximately $
12,000 in legal costs during the period in connection with this matter. The balance of the legal costs are for
general corporate legal advice.
Professional fees for the three months ended June 30, 2015 included legal fee of $ 6,324 incurred by the
Company and $ 31,816 incurred by Biohaven towards various corporate matters which included consultation
in connection with private placements being carried out at Portage and Biohaven and regulatory matters.
Audit fee of $ 10,000 has also been accrued and included in professional cost for the period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working Capital
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had a net working capital of approximately 7.5 million compared to a
working capital of approximately $ 4.6 million as at March 31, 2016.  Significant increase is due to additional
funds of approximately $ 6.9 million raised by Biohaven, while net funds used for operating activities were
approximately $3.1 million for the same period.
Cash on hand as at June 30, 2016 was approximately $7.5 million compared to $ 4.7 million as at March 31,
2016 due to raising of additional equity as explained above
As at June 30, 2015, the Company had a net working capital of approximately 5.3 million compared to a
working capital of approximately $ 1.1 million as at March 31, 2015.  Significant increase is due to additional
funds of approximately $ 5. 2 million raised through a private placement which closed on June 24, 2015,
while net funds used for operating activities were approximately $0.9 million for the same period.
Cash on hand as at June 30, 2015 was approximately $6 million compared to $ 1.7 million as at March 31,
2015 due to raising of additional equity as explained above.
Operating cash flow
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, operating activities required a net cash outflow of
approximately $3.1 million compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2015. The cash outflow primarily
included research and development costs which were met from additional cash raised through equity
financing by Biohaven and the existing cash.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, operating activities required a net cash outflow of
approximately $0.9 million compared to $0.4 million for the same period in 2014. The cash outflow included
research and development costs of approximately $ 0.7 million and balance included legal and consulting
fees. Costs were met from existing cash.
Biohaven is in clinical stage and PPL is in late stage of pre-clinical trials.  Both will need funding to support
further research and development  before either can generate its own revenues  The Company has not yet
determined whether costs incurred and to be incurred are economically recoverable. The Company's
continuing operations are dependent upon any one of:
1. the existence of economically recoverable medical solutions;
2. the ability of the Company to obtain the necessary financing to complete the research; or
3. future profitable production from, or proceeds from the disposition of intellectual property.
Although there are no assurances that management's plan will be realized, management believes the
Company and its subsidiaries will be able to secure the necessary financing to continue operations into the
future.
However, the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 include a going concern note which reflects need for further financing to continue our planned research
and development work and operating needs of all our subsidiaries.
Financing cash flows
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, Biohaven raised approximately $ 6.9 million in equity
financing through private placements with third parties.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company raised approximately $ 5.2 million through a
private placement of approximately 36.8 million restricted common shares issued at $0.14 per share
Key Contractual obligations
Details of contractual obligations, commitments and contingent liabilities are provided in note 12 to the
unaudited consolidated financials for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Off balance sheet arrangements
At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, including any
relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnership to enhance perceived liquidity.
Transactions with related parties
Transactions with related parties are incurred in the normal course of business and are measured at the
exchange amount, which is the amount of consideration established and agreed to between the related
parties. Related party transactions are detailed in note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financials for the
three months to June 30, 2016.

Carrying valueFair value
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and
information about financial instruments. These estimates are subject to and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgment, therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect the estimates.
A summary of the Company's risk exposures as it relates to financial instruments are reflected below:
b)Fair value of financial instruments
The Company's financial assets and liabilities are comprised of cash, advances and receivable and,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
.
The Company classifies the fair value of these transactions according to the following fair value hierarchy
based on the amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument:
•
•
Level 1 – Values are based on unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 – Values are based on inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and
volatility factors, which can be substantially observed or corroborated in the marketplace. Prices in Level 2
are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 – Values are based on prices or valuation techniques that are not based on observable market data.
Investment is classified as level 3 financial instrument.
Assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and
may affect the placement within the fair value hierarchy.
•
The Company's financial instruments are exposed to certain financial risks: credit risk and liquidity risk.
b)Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counter-party's inability to fulfill its payment obligations. The
credit risk is attributable to various financial instruments, as noted below. The credit risk is limited to the
carrying value amount carried on the statement of financial position.
c.
d.
Cash– Cash is held with major international financial institutions in Canada and a major law firm in the
USA and therefore the risk of loss is minimal.
Other receivable – The Company is not exposed to major credit risk attributable to customers. A significant
portion of this amount is a prepayment of Directors & Officers insurance premiums.
d)Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in satisfying financial obligations as they
become due.
The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking harm to the Company's reputation. The Company holds sufficient cash to
satisfy obligations under accounts payable and accruals.
The Company monitors its liquidity position regularly to assess whether it has the funds necessary to take
care of its operating needs and needs for investing in new projects. The Company believes that its existing
cash will allow it to finance the drug development work apart from meeting its operational needs for at least
another six months. However, the exact need for additional cash cannot be reasonably ascertained at this
stage  Should the Company require further funding, it intends to secure it through further rounds of  equity
financing.
However, as a biotech company at an early stage of development and without significant internally
generated cash flows, there are inherent liquidity risks, including the possibility that additional financing may
not be available to the Company, or that actual drug development expenditures may exceed those planned.
The current uncertainty in global markets could have an impact on the Company's future ability to access
capital on terms that are acceptable to the Company. There can be no assurance that required financing will
be available to the Company.
Use of Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
Significant areas where estimation uncertainty and critical judgments are applied include valuation of
financial instruments, valuation of property, plant and equipment, impairment losses, depletion and
depreciation, and measurement of stock based compensation.
Future Accounting Pronouncements
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Company's consolidated interim
financial statements are listed below. This listing is of standards and interpretations issued which the
Company reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Company intends to adopt those
standards when they become effective.
IFRS 9 ‐ Financial Instruments
The IASB intends to replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurements, with IFRS 9,
Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 will be published in six phases, of which the first phase has been published.
For financial assets, IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at
amortized cost or fair value, and replaces the multiple rules in IAS 39. The approach in IFRS 9 is based on
how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the financial assets. The new standard also requires a single impairment method to be
used. For financial liabilities, the approach to the fair value option may require different accounting for
changes to the fair value of a financial liability as a result of changes to an entity's own credit risk.
IFRS 9 (2014) is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning on April 1, 2018, but is available for
early adoption. The Company has yet to assess the full impact of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15, issued by the IASB in May 2014, is applicable to all revenue contracts and provides a model for the
recognition and measurement of gains or losses from sales of some non-financial assets. The core principle
is that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. The standard will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for
transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and
contract modifications) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements. IFRS 15 is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and is to be applied retrospectively, with earlier
adoption permitted. Entities will transition following either a full or modified retrospective approach. The
Company does not believe that the above standard will have any impact on its financial statements.
IFRS 16, Leases
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most
leases. Lessees will have a single accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. The new
standard is effective January 1, 2019, with limited early application permitted. The new standard permits
lessees to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach on transition for leases existing
at the date of transition, with options to use certain transition reliefs. The Company does not believe that the
above standard will have any impact on its financial statements.
Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer ("the Management") are primarily responsible in
establishing and maintaining controls and procedures concerning disclosure of material information and
their timely reporting in consultation and under direct supervision of the audit committee which comprises
two independent directors plus the CFO.. We have also instituted controls involving dual signatures and
approval processes. We plan to introduce more rigorous controls as our activities expand. However, given
the size and nature of our current operations and the involvement of independent directors, significantly
reduces the risk factors associated with the inadequate segregation of duties.
The Management has instituted a system of disclosure controls for the Company to ensure proper and
complete disclosure of material information. The limited number of consultants and direct involvement of the
Management facilitates access to real time information about developments in the business for drafting
disclosure documents. All documents are circulated to the board of directors and audit committee according
to the disclosure time-lines.
