<p><i>Summary 
</i>At the invitation of the Government, two members of the Working Group on the

<p>issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises 
undertook an official visit to Ghana from 8 to 17 July 2013. The Working Group experts 
appreciated the open and frank discussions that they had with members of the Government, 
Parliament, business enterprises and industry associations, affected stakeholders, civil 
society organizations, the Ghana Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice 
and with other stakeholders, during their visit. In the present report, the Working Group 
presents key findings regarding potential and actual negative impacts of business activities, 
as well as examples of good practices and progress in ensuring business respect for human 
rights in Ghana.  
</p>
<p>During their visit, the experts found that the fast pace of economic growth in Ghana 
necessitates heightened focus on strengthening institutions to oversee business activities 
effectively; in particular, there is a need to improve the capacity of the judiciary and the 
agencies tasked with monitoring compliance with regulations and legislation relating to 
such activities. They also found that challenges exist in relation to legacy issues in the 
mining sector, child labour in the informal sector and in the cocoa supply chain, and access 
to land and resettlement. Meaningful consultation with affected communities and access to 
information by those communities are central issues across sectors.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Further to Human Rights Council resolution 17/4, the Working Group is mandated 
by the Council to conduct country visits. At the invitation of the Government, two experts 
from the Working Group, Alexandra Gu&#225;queta and Pavel Sulyandziga, visited Ghana from 
8 to 17 July 2013. The objectives of the visit were to raise awareness of, and advocate for, 
implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31, 
annex)1 (hereafter the Guiding Principles); identify current initiatives, developments, 
opportunities, challenges and good practices to prevent and identify adverse impacts of 
business activities on human rights; and identify any particular challenges faced by groups 
at risk of being in vulnerable situations. 
</p>
<p>2. The experts met with Government authorities, including the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Minister of Justice, who is also the Attorney General, as well as officials 
from departments of the Ministries of Lands and Natural Resources, Trade and Industry; 
Employment and Social Welfare; Gender, Children and Social Protection; and the 
Environmental Protection Agency. The Working Group experts further met with members 
of the Parliamentary Select Committees on Trade, Industry and Tourism; Lands and 
Forestry; Mines and Energy; Food, Agriculture and Cocoa Affairs; and Youth, Sports and 
Culture. They also met with the Ghana Commission on Human Rights and Administrative 
Justice and with representatives of business enterprises, civil society, trade unions and 
United Nations agencies. The experts heard directly from affected persons and victims, 
both at the Accra meetings and during the field visits. In addition to holding meetings in 
Accra, the experts travelled to the Central and Ashanti regions to meet with communities 
and business enterprises to more closely examine the mining and cocoa sectors. The experts 
visited cocoa-growing communities in Assin Fosu and New Edubiase, and the Obuasi mine 
operated by AngloGold Ashanti, and met with communities living near the mine. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group thanks the Government of Ghana for the invitation and for the 
valuable assistance before, during and after their visit to the country. The experts also thank 
the organizations and individuals with whom they met during their visit, and who facilitated 
site visits and meetings with stakeholders and communities. The experts appreciated the 
genuine willingness and openness on the part of all stakeholders in discussing progress and 
challenges in the protection of human rights in the context of business activities.  
</p>
<p>4. The experts focused in particular on extractives, including gold mining, the nascent 
oil and gas sector and the cocoa production sector, as these sectors are important to the 
Ghanaian economy. They also examined issues such as land tenure and acquisition, child 
labour, labour rights and access to remedy and observed challenges related to informality in 
the economy. 
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Working Group experts describe their findings and make 
recommendations for actions that may assist in remedying the challenges identified. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>6. Ghana&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 14.4 per cent in 2011, and around 8 per 
cent in 2012, significantly outperforming the average for sub-Saharan Africa, and enabling

  Also published as Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR),

Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework</i> (New York/Geneva, 2011). </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>Ghana to make the transition to a &#8220;lower middle-income country&#8221; in 2011.2 That stable 
growth has been fuelled primarily by the commercialization of oil and gas production and 
strong cocoa and gold outputs, together with high commodity prices for those exports.3 
Other sectors, including construction and services, have also shown strong growth, and now 
account for more than half of Ghana&#8217;s economic output.4 Ghana&#8217;s economic growth has 
been enabled, and is reinforced by, a strong multiparty political system, stable institutions, 
and a vibrant civil society sector. However, around 80 to 90 per cent of the population is 
still employed in the informal sector,5 many in subsistence or near-subsistence small-scale 
agriculture and small trade. 
</p>
<p>7. Ghana&#8217;s rapid economic growth poses both opportunities and challenges related to 
business impacts on human rights. As previously noted by the Working Group,6 all 
countries, and particularly those undergoing rapid economic development, need to 
maximize the positive effects of business (including economic development, building 
infrastructure and employment) while minimizing the negative impacts (such as damage to 
the environment, violation of labour rights, reduced access to economic, social and cultural 
rights). With economic growth and diversification, State institutions will come under 
pressure to keep up with effectively preventing and addressing negative impacts on human 
rights. Within a constrained resource environment, the Government will necessarily need to 
prioritize those areas where risks are severe or may impact large numbers of people. A 
national action plan for implementing the Guiding Principles should help the Government 
of Ghana to identify areas of particular risk so as to prioritize the strengthening of laws, 
regulations, policies and oversight.  
</p>
<p>8. However, business enterprises, both foreign and local, also have independent 
responsibilities to respect human rights, meaning that they need to have in place systems for 
identifying, preventing, mitigating and remedying potential and actual impacts. An active 
civil society engaged on these issues is also critical for advocating for progress as well as 
for monitoring implementation by Government and business of their respective duties and 
responsibilities. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Ghana has signed all nine of the core international human rights treaties and has 
ratified eight of them.7 Ghana has also ratified all eight fundamental International Labour 
Organization (ILO) conventions, as well as 44 of the 177 ILO technical conventions in

<p>force as of 2013. Ghana has a dualist legal system; treaties to which Ghana is a party 
becomes part of national law only through an express Act or resolution of Parliament.8  
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of 1992 protects a number of human rights, including the right to 
life, liberty of the person, dignity (including prohibition on torture and cruel and unusual 
punishment), equality before the law and prohibition on discrimination on the basis of 
gender, race, colour, ethnic origin, religion, creed or social or economic status. The 
Constitution also protects the rights to property and privacy, fair trial, freedom of speech, 
free and compulsory education, prohibits appropriation of property, except in certain 
limited circumstances, and provides for the right of workers to form and join trade unions.9 
Custom is recognized by the Constitution as a source of law; it is applied by customary 
authorities as well as by State courts, unless it is found to violate the Constitution. 
Customary law is subject to statute law. 
</p><p>11. Chapter 18 of the Constitution provides for the establishment of a national 
Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), with a broad mandate 
to investigate complaints of violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, injustice, 
corruption, abuse of power and unfair treatment by public officers, as well as complaints 
relating to the activities of individuals and private enterprises that allege violations of the 
rights contained in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impact of business activities on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strategic frameworks for business activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policy coherence on human rights in the context of private-sector-driven development 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (2010-2013)10 provides a 
framework for medium-term economic and social development for Ghana, with the 
overarching goal of attaining a per capita income of at least US$3,000 by 2020, and with 
economic growth and private sector development as the main vehicles. 
</p>
<p>13. The Guiding Principles prescribe that States should ensure that governmental 
departments, agencies and other institutions that shape business practice are aware of and 
observe the State&#8217;s human rights obligations when fulfilling their respective mandates.11 In 
that context, the Working Group appreciates that the 2010-2013 development framework 
recognizes the need to strengthen the regulatory framework regarding shareholder rights 
and corporate social responsibility, as well as corporate accountability mechanisms, and in 
particular, that it explicitly aims to &#8220;ensure that corporations act as good corporate entities 
with regard to human rights, social responsibility and environmental sustainability.&#8221;12 
However, the Working Group noted a lack of specific implementation steps taken to date to 
ensure that businesses respect human rights.  
</p>
<p>14. Specifically, the Working Group noted that business enterprises and industry 
associations did not appear to have received any information about the Guiding Principles

<p>from the Government, nor any other kind of communication about human rights 
responsibilities. It found, however, that some business associations, notably the Ghana 
Chamber of Mines, have taken steps to promote responsible business conduct. Overall, the 
Working Group found that there was very low awareness among local businesses and 
industry associations about human rights and business responsibilities as defined in the 
Guiding Principles. 
</p>
<p>15. The Working Group emphasizes that the Guiding Principles prescribe a &#8220;smart mix&#8221; 
of measures to ensure business respect for human rights. It recommends that the 
Government use existing business networks, including the local Global Compact, to 
actively disseminate information and communicate its expectations regarding the Guiding 
Principles. In particular, the Working Group recommends the involvement of high-level 
government officials, including those officials working on economic policy, in such 
communication efforts. This may counter the perceptions noted by the experts among some 
business enterprises that human rights are only the concern of specialized Government 
departments or a &#8220;luxury&#8221; that is irrelevant in the context of Ghana&#8217;s economic 
development.  
</p>
<p>16. In June 2011, the Government of Ghana approved the National Policy on Public 
Private Partnership (NPPPP)13 to increase private-sector involvement in infrastructure and 
public service delivery. The NPPPP recognizes the need for public-private partnerships to 
have in place safeguards, especially for vulnerable groups, and such partnerships should be 
undertaken with the highest standards of environmental, climate and social safeguards. The 
Working Group stresses that States maintain their human rights obligations when they 
contract with the private sector for delivery of public services, as clarified in the Guiding 
Principles,14 and urges the Government of Ghana to ensure that all public-private 
partnerships integrate robust impact assessments and ongoing human rights due diligence.  
</p>
<p>17. At the time of the experts&#8217; visit, a new Ghana Investment Promotion Centre bill was 
being debated in Parliament. The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act governs 
investment in all sectors of the economy, except minerals and mining, oil and gas, and the 
free zones. The experts discussed this bill with members of Parliamentary committees, and 
noted that the bill did not contain any provisions on respecting human rights or responsible 
business conduct.15 The Working Group notes that, in line with the State&#8217;s duty to protect 
human rights, as set out in the Guiding Principles, legislation designed to attract and 
facilitate foreign investment should include appropriate safeguards to prevent negative 
impacts from such investment and to facilitate business respect for human rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group also emphasizes that bilateral trade and investment treaties 
should not constrain the Government of Ghana&#8217;s policy space for evolving the regulatory 
framework to protect rights or for ensuring the progressive realization of economic and 
social rights. As Ghana pursues foreign investment, there is an acute need to ensure that 
investment agreements integrate human rights concerns from the outset. The Ghana 
Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice could potentially play a role 
during the review processes of draft investment and trade agreements.  
</p>
<p>19. The Working Group was encouraged to learn that the Ministry of Trade and Industry 
was drafting a national policy on corporate social responsibility (CSR), although from the 
information received by the Working Group experts, it was not yet known if this policy

<p>would address the corporate responsibility to respect all internationally proclaimed human 
rights. The Working Group recommends that the policy set the Guiding Principles as the 
minimum benchmark for foreign and domestic businesses. Special attention should be paid 
to labour rights across all economic sectors (including agribusiness, construction, 
extractives, finance and manufacturing), and to issues related to land use and tenure. It 
notes that risks of causing or contributing to adverse impacts in these areas are likely to 
increase in the supply chain as it stretches into the informal sector.  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group further recommends that institutions charged with protecting 
rights and those promoting foreign investment and exports enter into regular dialogue on 
corporate governance and business conduct with Ghanaian civil society organizations and 
with business leaders as well as industry umbrella organizations, including Ghana 
Employers&#8217; Association, Ghana Association of Industries, the Chamber of Commerce and 
the Chamber of Mines, around human rights impacts and on the promotion of responsible 
business conduct that is respectful of national laws and international norms.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Strengthening institutions to prevent adverse impacts 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Working Group received information that while the Government has 
strengthened State institutions promoting economic activity and investment, some key State 
institutions charged with protecting rights, including departments in the Ministry of 
Employment and Social Welfare &#8211; in particular the Labour Commission and the Labour 
Inspectorate &#8211; and the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, have not 
benefited from similar investment, which constrains their capacity to follow-up on 
compliance with legislation and regulations effectively. 
</p>
<p>22. In that context, the Working Group also notes the need to ensure that human rights 
standards are effectively integrated into the institutions that aim to promote foreign 
investment and facilitate links to global markets in new sectors &#8211; such as oil &#8211; as well as in 
traditional sectors. In that way, prevention can be strengthened and the increasing pressure 
on monitoring and dispute-resolution bodies could be eased. The Ghana Investment 
Promotion Centre should be given the mandate to encourage and, where appropriate, 
require foreign business enterprises wishing to enter Ghana to respect all internationally 
proclaimed human rights. Other agencies that aim to attract investment, such as the Ghana 
Free Zones Board, should also implement measures to require and facilitate business 
respect for human rights, such as requiring human rights due diligence, reporting and 
monitoring the performance of business enterprises. Human rights norms should guide the 
work of such agencies in the development of labour policies specific for export processing 
zones, and not contribute to the lowering of standards in such environments.  
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group was encouraged to learn about the AKOBEN16 programme 
under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a creative exercise of public 
benchmarking in corporate conduct that appears to be taken seriously by business. The 
AKOBEN programme covers the 16 largest mining companies and the 100 largest 
manufacturing companies. It ranks companies on a scorecard based on business self-
reporting against more than 100 indicators, data collected through site inspections as part of 
the EPA&#8217;s enforcement protocol and field audits. EPA&#8217;s role of granting environmental 
permits makes it a key technical gatekeeper for prevention and compliance in the area of 
business and human rights and the AKOBEN programme is a positive measure for 
maximizing the effectiveness of limited resources. However, EPA will need the appropriate 
resources to scale up this initiative as Ghana&#8217;s private sector continues to grow. Strategic 
sectors requiring environmental impact statements, such as oil and infrastructure, should

</p>
<p>also be rated through this programme. The Working Group particularly recommends that 
the planned update of the AKOBEN framework integrate the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific issues and industries of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Access to effective remedy  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Judicial remedy 
</i></p>
<p>24. During its visit, the Working Group received information of multiple obstacles 
encountered by victims of human rights abuses by business enterprises in accessing judicial 
remedy. According to information received, economic, social and cultural rights are 
difficult to enforce through the courts. Practical obstacles include the costs of pursuing a 
claim and the difficulty of obtaining affordable legal assistance, as well as the lack of 
capacity of judges and local courts in matters relating to business impacts on human rights. 
The experts also received reports that courts at the local level, in particular, were subject to 
political and business influence, which hampered the ability of victims to obtain effective 
remedy.  
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group notes that the Government of Ghana has, in response to a report 
of the Constitution Review Commission,17 committed to increasing legal aid, particularly 
for persons who face monetary and other obstacles in accessing justice. This should also 
benefit access to judicial remedy for persons whose rights have been violated as a result of 
business activity. The Government has also established &#8220;Human Rights Courts&#8221; specifically 
to hear cases related to violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. However, 
from the information received by the Working Group experts, in some instances, judges of 
those courts lack adequate training.  
</p>
<p><i>  Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice 
</i></p>
<p>26. The Constitution provides for the establishment of a national Commission on 
Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ), with a broad mandate to investigate: 
complaints of violations of fundamental rights and freedoms, injustice, corruption, abuse of 
power and unfair treatment of any person by public officers; complaints relating to the 
functioning of the administrative organs of the State; and complaints of violations of 
fundamental rights and freedoms by individuals, private enterprises and other institutions.18  
</p>
<p>27. CHRAJ receives around 13,000 complaints per year relating to its three main 
functions. According to information received, in 2012, 314 complaints received by CHRAJ 
related to business activities. This relatively low percentage is not necessarily 
representative as CHRAJ typically only initiates investigations in response to complaints; 
therefore it could also be indicative of lack of awareness among communities.  
</p>
<p>28. The experts learned that mediation is generally the preferred process for resolving 
complaints related to business conduct, due to cultural acceptance and its ability to improve 
company-community relations. In 2011, CHRAJ reportedly successfully reached agreement 
through mediation in around 90 business-related complaints. Aspects of mediated outcomes 
may include ensuring that the State is held accountable, compensation (including restoring, 
replicating or improving conditions), agreements on the provision of vital resources such as

<p>water, transition support in the context of resettlement, addressing sources of sustainable 
livelihoods, and other forms of remedy. If mediation fails, CHRAJ can initiate an 
investigation; this provides a vital incentive to companies to engage in mediation.  
</p>
<p>29. The Working Group was encouraged that CHRAJ has developed considerable 
expertise in business and human rights, and provides assistance in obtaining remedy to 
people adversely impacted by business activities. CHRAJ can also play an important role in 
ensuring that Government and business enterprises learn from incidents, address root 
causes and modify policies and practices to prevent further harm.  
</p>
<p>30. However, the Working Group received information that, while the process of 
mediation appears to lead to positive outcomes, in cases where companies do not comply 
with CHRAJ&#8217;s recommendations, CHRAJ must seek the Minister of Justice-Attorney 
General&#8217;s intervention to enforce its decisions, and there is often a significant delay in that 
process. The Working Group also learned that CHRAJ&#8217;s funding is not sufficient for it to 
be able to carry out its mandate nationwide, and that retention of qualified lawyers is a 
significant issue.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Impacts from the oil and gas sector  
</b></p>
<p>31. The experts noted high expectations and a lively public debate regarding the 
potential socioeconomic benefits of growth in the oil sector. In order to translate natural 
resource wealth into social benefits, several safeguards need to be in place, one of which is 
a robust system to identify and address the adverse impacts of oil and gas operations on the 
environment and on people, which should be grounded on transparent participatory 
processes.19 The Working Group recommends that the Government make explicit the 
expectation that oil and gas companies implement the Guiding Principles and that it build 
on existing international industry best practice on human rights20 in developing reporting 
and monitoring requirements. In that regard, Ghana could build on best practices from the 
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.  
</p>
<p>32. The experts met with representatives of canoe owners&#8217; associations, who related 
how the exclusion zones around oil rigs, which are partly related to safety standards, and 
the movements of oil vessels, are negatively impacting the livelihoods of local fishermen. 
Some stakeholders noted that while the oil companies were required to conduct 
environmental impact statements prior to licensing, impacts on fisheries and rights of local 
fishermen and were not taken into account and the local fishermen were not consulted. The 
Working Group notes that local canoe owners&#8217; associations would be a relevant entry point 
for dialogue between oil and gas companies and the communities concerned.

<p>33. The Constitution21 protects the right to own property and against compulsory 
possession or appropriation of property by the State, except in certain limited 
circumstances, with provisions for fair and adequate compensation and due process. 
Administration and access to lands are regulated by a complex network of legislation, 
including the Administration of Land Act 1962 (Act 123), the Administration of Lands

</p>
<p>34. Ghana&#8217;s system of land ownership, governance and tenure comprises various forms 
of customary ownership and stewardship of land as well as enacted legislation.24 Public and 
State lands are held in trust by the Government of Ghana for the people of Ghana; private 
lands are generally held in communal ownership or in trust by a stool, skin, clan, family or 
individual, on behalf of a community.25 A general feature of the customary land governance 
system is that many land <i>users</i> are not land <i>owners</i>, which may leave them more vulnerable 
to negative impacts from land acquisitions and resettlements. 
</p>
<p>35. As the agricultural, infrastructure, manufacturing and extractives sectors of Ghana 
continue to grow, the demands for access to land will grow correspondingly (by the private 
sector as well as by the State granting leases of publicly owned land to business 
enterprises), which may lead to the displacement or resettlement of communities. The 
Working Group emphasizes that deprivation of access to land without adequate 
compensation or lack of tenure security for individuals or communities can have numerous 
negative impacts on their right to housing, food, work, education, health and other rights.26  
</p>
<p>36. The experts noted that the EPA&#8217;s regulations on environmental impact assessments27 
require that business enterprises consult with persons who may be affected and, in the case 
of activities that may lead to displacement or resettlement, conduct a public hearing. 
However, according to information received, it appears that, in practice, access to 
information is often inadequate, with notices of planned projects that would affect land use 
and ownership being displayed in English only (and not in local languages) and for the 
shortest time possible, in only district assemblies and not in the actual communities. The 
experts also received information that communities are sometimes not adequately consulted 
before planned projects, and therefore do not have the opportunity to participate in 
decision-making about changes that would affect them. The Working Group emphasizes 
the requirements in the Guiding Principles for business enterprises to engage with 
stakeholders concerned in a meaningful way in order to assess potential impacts and 
address risks.28  
</p>
<p>37. The experts noted that most of the stakeholders appeared to focus on the cash 
compensation element of resettlement packages to the exclusion of other important aspects 
of the resettlement process that are aimed at ensuring that communities would not be worse 
off than prior to resettlement &#8212; including participatory planning processes standards for 
disclosure of information, verification of community understanding of the information 
given to them, quality and location of resettlement housing, access to health, education, 
transport, services and livelihoods &#8212;, despite the provisions in the legal framework to 
address such issues. The experts met with communities that had been resettled in the past 
and found that some communities were still struggling to stay self-sufficient many years

<p>after the resettlement. Community members reported that contributing factors included 
resettlement on land with less favourable access to farmland or waterways, distance from 
markets and few transport links or lack of public services, such as water delivery. That has 
resulted in long-term responsibilities for the businesses involved to take on a semi-public 
role in providing water, health clinics and other services. The Working Group emphasizes 
that transitional support to resettled communities should be comprehensive and may require 
business enterprises to support communities over an extended period; however, it should 
not result in long-term dependency on the business.  
</p>
<p>38. In that context, the Working Group encourages the Government to review the 
Environmental Assessment Regulations (1999), as well as other relevant regulations 
governing access to land and compensation for deprivation of land and land use, to align 
them with the requirements set out in the Guiding Principles, and to strengthen the mandate 
of the Environmental Protection Agency to enable it to effectively monitor compliance. The 
Working Group notes the ongoing project on land administration,29 the aims of which 
include making land acquisition easier, more flexible and transparent for businesses; it 
stresses that the project should be aligned with the Government&#8217;s obligations to protect 
human rights and its stated ambition to improve tenure security and reduce poverty through 
better land administration.30  
</p>
<p>39. The Working Group also encourages the Government to refer to established 
standards in this regard, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, 
Fisheries and Forests31 as well as the World Bank&#8217;s social safeguards32 and the performance 
standards of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)33 with respect to land acquisition, 
resettlement and compensation. Business enterprises wishing to acquire land for their 
economic activities should also refer to those standards. Furthermore, the Government 
should build the capacity of local authorities to apply such standards, and ensure that the 
rights of communities, including those of land users &#8212; including women &#8212; are respected. 
</p>
<p><i>  Role of customary land ownership 
</i>40. Outside of the cities, the experts noted that the role of the Chiefs is strong and that 
those customary authorities wield considerable influence. The Working Group experts 
received information that negotiations with regard to land acquisition and resettlement often 
involved primarily the local Chiefs. While acknowledging customary land ownership and 
management, the Working Group learned, through its fact-finding work, that some Chiefs 
have not been able to identify the rights of all those who use or rely on community lands 
nor to communicate transparently with communities.

<p>41. The Working Group stresses that business enterprises negotiating with communities 
over land acquisition or land use have a responsibility to consult with all stakeholders and 
pay particular attention to potentially vulnerable or marginalized groups in their due 
diligence processes, whether or not the negotiations result in voluntary resettlement.34  
</p>
<p><i>  Impacts of land acquisitions on women  
</i>42. The experts received information that women in particular were more likely to 
receive insufficient compensation for loss of access to land, and were at heightened risk of 
not being able to adequately replace former agricultural activities with new sustainable 
livelihoods. The experts were informed that, in the traditional land tenure system, Chiefs 
distribute lands to men only, as the &#8220;heads of household&#8221;. According to the information 
received, in many traditional systems, men are the primary growers of cash crops, whereas 
women frequently grow food crops on communally held land or in the forests surrounding 
communities. When business enterprises calculate compensation for loss of access to or use 
of land in the context of resettlement, women may not receive appropriate compensation. 
Business enterprises seeking to acquire land need to assess how women and men may 
experience impacts of loss of access to land or settlement differently, and consult with all 
members of the affected community, including women.35 Due regard should be given not 
only to replacement of cash crops and economic trees, but also to food crops.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Addressing impacts from the mining sector 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Large scale mining 
</i></p>
<p>43. Ghana has a long history of mining, with the oldest mines having been in operation 
continuously for more than 100 years. This has created a complex legacy of social and 
environmental impacts.  
</p>
<p>44. A central breeding ground for company-community conflict is the emergence and 
growth of towns in the immediate vicinity of mining operations, leaving few or no &#8220;buffer 
zones&#8221; between the communities and the mines. Those communities may be more 
vulnerable to negative impacts on health or access to food and water, due to pollution of 
soil and waterways, and dust and air pollution caused by mining operations, as well as to 
resettlement when mine operations change or expand.  
</p>
<p>45. The granting of mining licences is regulated by the Minerals and Mining Act and 
administered by the Minerals Commission. Environmental permits are issued by the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with the Environmental Impact 
Assessment Regulations.36 Environmental impact assessments must include assessment of 
potential impacts on land and livelihoods, as well as on health. The Minerals and Mining 
Act (No. 703) of 2006 also requires that applications for mining licences be made public for 
at least 21 days, during which communities can raise objections to the project. Notices are 
posted on boards at district assemblies, trade councils, local information centres, with 
copies sent to the land owners concerned. Resettlement of communities is also covered in 
the Minerals and Mining Act (No. 703). The Act provides for resettled communities to be 
furnished with appropriate housing of a similar standard as that which the community 
members had prior to resettlement. It also states that resettled communities should not be 
worse off economically.

</b></p>
<p>46. The Working Group notes that while the legal framework to prevent negative 
impacts from mining activities is relatively strong, there are gaps in the implementation by 
both public- and private-sector actors.  
</p>
<p>47. The experts heard reports of long-term legacy issues faced by communities: for 
example, during their visit, they met with communities which claimed that they had not 
received any information on planned mining activities prior to the start of operations, and 
that waterways had been blocked off without warning by backfill and blasts, which severely 
impacted their farms. The Working Group also heard reports that companies dumped toxic 
waste in streams and that mining blasts negatively impacted the health of the communities. 
The effects of those acts were still being felt, even many years later, and dialogue with the 
companies have not succeeded in addressing systematic issues, such as lack of viable 
livelihoods, dependence and claims of health impacts. 
</p>
<p>48. Older mining operations frequently face significant legacy issues when neither the 
technical knowledge nor the normative frameworks in existence today were in place at the 
start of operations. The Working Group witnessed serious efforts made to address 
environmental consequences of older mining operations with regard, for example, to waste 
and tailings treatment; however, challenges remain, especially regarding social issues 
related to land and security.  
</p>
<p>49. The experts also saw and heard reports that many mining companies in Ghana were 
attempting to address the negative impacts of mining systematically. The Ghana Chamber 
of Mines, a member of the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM), has been 
active in shepherding efforts in the sector to address human rights impacts. The Working 
Group found a higher level of awareness of the Guiding Principles in this sector than in 
other sectors considered during the visit.  
</p>
<p>50. At the same time, the experts also received information that mining companies had 
been lobbying strongly against the progressive improvement of regulations by EPA in areas 
such as waste and tailings management. The Working Group notes that the responsibility to 
respect human rights applies to all corporate activities and that business enterprises should 
not seek to undermine the legitimate exercise of environmental and social oversight by the 
State. 
</p>
<p>51. The experts were informed that the Minerals Commission requires every company in 
the mining sector to have a corporate social responsibility policy in place. The policy 
should provide for the communities concerned to form a committee to agree, based on 
consultations with the company, on the types of project that they want. The Working Group 
stresses that while social investment projects can bring benefits to communities, corporate 
responsibility is about identifying, preventing, mitigating and redressing potentially 
negative impacts on individuals and communities from the company&#8217;s activities. The 
Guiding Principles state that failure to respect human rights cannot be &#8220;offset&#8221; through 
social investments.37 
</p>
<p><i>  Impacts of legal and illegal small-scale mining  
</i>52. The Working Group experts received information about the impacts of legal as well 
as illegal small-scale mining, which reportedly accounts for 34 per cent of Ghana&#8217;s gold 
output.  
</p>
<p>53. The experts were informed that while legal small and medium-size mining 
operations (typically around 25 acres) are regulated by the Minerals and Mining Act, they 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37

</p>
<p>frequently lack the capacity and knowledge to effectively comply with environmental and 
social standards. In that context, the Working Group stresses that the Guiding Principles 
apply to all business enterprises, regardless of size,38 and that small and medium-size 
mining enterprises need to have in place systems that are appropriate to their size and risks. 
In order to prevent adverse impacts, the Government should provide legal small-scale 
mining activities with support and capacity-building with regard to health and safety, 
environmental and labour norms, as well as the Guiding Principles. The experts noted the 
capacity-building initiative by the Chamber of Mines to recognize small-scale mining 
operations that operate responsibly. The Working Group encourages further private-sector 
initiatives in cooperation with the authorities. 
</p>
<p>54. The experts were informed of persistent problems associated with illegal mining. 
Illegal mining exists in two main forms: mechanized mining carried out by local or foreign 
mining concerns; and artisanal mining carried out by <i>galamseys</i> (local gold miners). The 
experts were informed that the mechanized mining concerns extract gold from the ore in 
rivers and streams, thereby polluting the waterways with cyanide and other toxins. The 
experts also heard reports of violence associated with mechanized illegal mining on 
concessions granted to large-scale legal mines, including reports of armed illegal miners 
attacking and shooting unarmed mine security personnel, as well as instances in which 
illegal miners had been shot during police crackdowns. The Working Group encourages 
Ghana to integrate human rights with respect to the use of security forces in its response to 
the problem of illegal mining.39 
</p>
<p>55. Artisanal mining by <i>galamseys</i> is largely a poverty-driven, informal activity; 
however, it is associated with severely adverse impacts, including the use of child labour 
and contamination and destruction of land, forests and rivers used by nearby communities. 
The experts heard reports of, as well as observed, children engaged in <i>galamsey</i> mining on 
land that had already been damaged and contaminated by illegal miners using mechanized 
equipment. In that context and with a view to addressing the negative impacts of the 
activity, the Working Group encourages the Government to review the possibility of 
regularizing some forms of artisanal <i>galamsey</i> mining, in cooperation with large and 
medium-size mining companies, so as to enable such operations to enter the formal 
economy.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Child labour in the cocoa and fishing sectors 
</b></p>
<p>56. Ghana&#8217;s economy is still highly reliant on small-scale operations in agriculture, 
especially cocoa exports,40 and fishing. Small family-owned operations predominate in the 
cocoa sector, and despite significant progress, child labour remains an issue. Statistics on 
the scale of child labour in the sector vary; in 2003, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) estimated that 20 per cent of children between the ages of 5 and 14 were 
engaged in some form of child labour.41

</b></p>
<p>57. The Children&#8217;s Act of 1998 sets the minimum employment age at 15 years, or 13 
years for light work that is not likely to be harmful to the child and which does not affect 
the child&#8217;s attendance at or capacity to benefit from school. The law also specifies the types 
of work that is considered &#8220;hazardous labour&#8221;. In addition, the Hazardous Child Labour 
Activity Framework for the Cocoa Sector42 prohibits children under 18 years from being 
engaged in certain activities defined as hazardous, including exposure to pesticides while 
carrying water to spray cocoa trees; carrying heavy loads; working with dangerous tools, 
such as machetes used to clear underbrush; working with fire to burn underbrush; and 
felling trees. 
</p>
<p>58. The experts noted that the causes of the persistent problem of child labour on cocoa 
farms are multifaceted, and combine poverty, lack of access to quality education, the price 
of cocoa, farming practices, lack of economic opportunity, but also cultural practices that 
prevent communities from seeing children&#8217;s work on cocoa farms as &#8220;child labour&#8221;, or as 
being harmful to the child. The experts were told that, traditionally, children are seen as the 
property of their parents and that it is the parents who decide whether the child should 
work. The Working Group notes that while the tradition of passing on knowledge and skills 
from parents to children is important in Ghanaian society, parents need to know how to 
recognize activities that are harmful to children&#8217;s development. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2006, Ghana established the National Programme for the Elimination of the 
Worst Forms of Child Labour in Cocoa (NPECLC), which combines sensitization, 
education, development of institutional capacity, development of the legal framework, 
efforts to improve the knowledge-base of child labour in the sector, interventions at the 
community level and other actions.43 In 2010, the Government adopted the National Plan of 
Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, which provides a 
framework to reduce the worst forms of child labour by 2015. Notably, the plan aims to 
provide better coordination among various initiatives aimed at addressing child labour. 
Central to the implementation of those efforts is the Ghana Child Labour Monitoring 
System (GCLMS), which aims to provide a holistic system for identifying child labour, 
removing child labourers and referring them to remediation services, and ensuring that 
removed child labourers are not replaced with new ones. ILO, the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) and UNICEF support the implementation of this 
system.44  
</p>
<p><i>  International supply chains 
</i></p>
<p>60. Almost all of Ghana&#8217;s cocoa is exported. The Government-controlled COCOBOD 
(Ghana Cocoa Board) sets the price of most forms of cocoa,45 which is bought by 
international cocoa processors and confectionary companies. Following significant 
international attention to the issue of child labour in the cocoa industry in the early 2000s, 
the cocoa industry signed the Harkin-Engel Protocol, an agreement to eliminate the worst 
forms of child labour in the cocoa supply chain.46 Since the signing of the Protocol, a 
number of initiatives to identify and reduce child labour in the cocoa supply chain have 
been established, including industry initiatives and multi-stakeholder efforts.

</p>
<p><i>  Interventions at the community level: multi-stakeholder initiatives and law enforcement 
</i>61. The Working Group experts visited cocoa communities and supporting non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) in New Edubiase and Assin Fosu to see examples of 
interventions to address child labour. Communities in these districts had participated in 
interventions supported by multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as the International Cocoa 
Initiative, as well as interventions supported by individual companies and foundations. The 
Working Group also met with farmers who had participated in certification schemes, such 
as the Rainforest Alliance.  
</p>
<p>62. Several good practices were noted, including holistic approaches that address both 
the issue of human rights violations and poverty with measures that complement and 
reinforce each other as well as combine business, State, development-oriented NGOs and 
community action, including families with children at risk. Successful interventions 
combine, at the local level, education and awareness-raising with regard to families and the 
community, including traditional authorities, in the areas of child protection and rights, 
technical assistance in agriculture to help farmers increase crop yields; community 
ownership of interventions through the creation of Community Action Plans to address the 
practices leading to child labour, community self-monitoring through Child Protection 
Committees to address instances of child labour with the family in question; and 
coordination with district-level local government representatives who reinforce compliance 
through communication with the communities, and who also act as a liaison to obtain 
supporting resources from the local authorities for education, health services and other 
forms of support. Technical assistance and support are also provided to communities to 
increase cocoa yields and diversify to other crops, including oil palm for extraction. Such 
efforts appeared to have achieved significant results in changing attitudes to child labour 
and in reducing the worst forms of child labour in the target communities.  
</p>
<p>63. Despite those positive efforts, however, the Working Group notes that there are 
close to 800,000 farmers in Ghana and current initiatives cover only a fraction of them. The 
national Government, district and municipal authorities, international brands, cocoa buyers, 
and the international community should step up their efforts to close the gap. International 
buyers and brands can, for example, set yearly targets to make sure that their supply chain 
in Ghana and internationally is free of child labour.47 States in which buyers are based can 
contribute by requiring businesses to conduct appropriate due diligence in their supply 
chain and exercise leverage in the industry. The Working Group also notes that successful 
community transformation methodologies in the cocoa industry can inform initiatives in 
other sectors in Ghana, for example the fishing industry, where serious violations have led 
to the death of children.  
</p>
<p><i>  Trafficked child labour in fisheries 
</i>64. The Working Group notes with great concern the information it received about 
children as young as 6 years old being engaged in hazardous labour in the fishing industry 
in Lake Volta, including children employed to untangle fishing nets under water, at great 
risk to their lives. Moreover, the International Organization for Migration reported that 
some of the children working in the industry were victims of trafficking &#8211; an additional 
grave violation of their rights that renders them especially vulnerable to abuse.48 Such 
trafficking normally takes place in the informal sector, where families living in extreme

<p>poverty may sell their child to a relative or stranger in exchange for a sum of money and/or 
promise of employment of the child. The Working Group urges the Government to address 
this situation as a matter of urgency, in cooperation with development partners and 
organizations such as the IOM. Business enterprises, such as hotels, restaurants and food 
retailers that buy fish or fish products from the Lake Volta region should seek to prevent 
and mitigate the risks of child and trafficked labour in the supply chain. Both the 
Government and business enterprises should seek to identify relevant entry points for 
dialogue with the fisheries sector, such as fishermen&#8217;s associations. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Ensuring respect for labour rights across all business sectors 
</b></p>
<p>65. Article 24 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana establishes basic labour 
rights, including the right to form and join trade unions (with some exceptions). The Ghana 
Labour Act of 2003 elaborates on the provisions contained the Constitution and provides 
for other labour rights, including the right to collective bargaining.49 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group experts were informed that foreign and local small and 
medium-size companies in sectors such as plastics and chemicals, rubber, foam and other 
small-scale manufacturing often lack effective standards. In particular, the experts received 
information about substandard health and safety conditions in such factories, excessive 
working hours and pay that did not enable a decent standard of living for the worker and 
his/her family. The experts received information that some employers made excessive use 
of short-term contracts and so-called casual workers (employed for less than six months) to 
circumvent protections in the Labour Act. Although temporary and casual workers still 
enjoy some protections under the Act, their contracts are not required to be formalized, 
which leaves many workers effectively unable to assert their rights. 
</p>
<p>67. While the Labour Act prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment, the 
Working Group experts heard that women are frequently discriminated against in 
recruitment and eligibility for promotion. Furthermore, in some sectors, women of child-
bearing age face discrimination; for example, the experts were informed that some financial 
services companies actively discouraged female employees from becoming pregnant, or 
threatened them with reprisals, such as losing their job or opportunities for promotion if 
they did so. Such practices run counter to the principles of equality and non-discrimination 
that are core to all human rights, as well as to Ghana&#8217;s labour rights obligations under the 
fundamental ILO conventions and the Guiding Principles.  
</p>
<p>68. The experts also received information that some companies, including in the 
telecommunications, manufacturing and road construction sectors, employed measures to 
discourage workers from forming legitimate trade unions and from collective bargaining. 
Such measures include informal incentives, such as the promise of higher pay or a bonus, 
for workers to choose not to join a trade union. Those measures are illegal under the Labour 
Act of 2003.50 The Government also prohibits unionization in a number of industries that 
are deemed &#8220;essential&#8221;, including fuel distribution, public transportation and the prison 
system.51  
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group notes that Ghana has a strong trade union movement and 
encourages the Government to further strengthen Ghana&#8217;s tradition of tripartite dialogue 
and cooperation, in order to ensure that rights are respected across sectors.

<p>70. The Labour Act provides for the establishment of a Labour Commission,52 with a 
mandate to hear and settle industrial disputes, investigate labour-related complaints, 
promote effective cooperation between labour and management and facilitate access to 
mediation and arbitration. The Labour Inspectorate, situated within the Ministry of 
Employment and Social Welfare, has the mandate to oversee observance of labour laws and 
regulations in workplaces and to provide technical assistance and advice to employers and 
workers. The experts received information that, while the Inspectorate aims to inspect all 
factories twice a year under the new inspection policy, it is currently not able to fully meet 
its mandate to effectively oversee workplaces.  
</p>
<p>71. Addressing labour conditions and other impacts on human rights in the informal 
sector is a challenge, and the Working Group was pleased to see efforts by the Ghana 
Trades Union Congress and others to work with informal sector associations to address the 
challenges with regard to labour conditions, health and safety, child labour and other labour 
concerns in several sectors of the informal economy. The Government should encourage 
such efforts, and should also strengthen outreach and awareness-raising at the local level to 
ensure that people employed in the informal sector are aware of their rights and have 
information about available redress mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Corruption, transparency and participation 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Working Group experts received information that corruption is a concern in 
Ghana.53 The Working Group has previously noted54 that corruption has the effect of 
weakening State authorities&#8217; accountability and effectiveness in preventing and addressing 
human rights violations, including those linked to business activities.  
</p>
<p>73. To ensure that agencies tasked with enforcing and monitoring compliance with laws, 
regulations and policies that require business enterprises to respect human rights are 
effective and accountable, the Working Group particularly encourages anti-corruption 
efforts focused on the integrity of officers involved in law enforcement at the district or 
municipal levels and in the judicial sector. In addition, the Government should support 
access to information regarding business activities through transparency measures so as to 
increase the potential for civil society organizations and human rights defenders to act as 
effective checks on both business enterprises and public officials. The Working Group 
appreciates that Ghana has a National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) developed by 
CHRAJ;55 it urges the Government to fully implement the plan, and to prioritize 
implementation of the activities indicated for following up on the recommendations of the 
first universal periodic review of Ghana.56

<p>78. <b>On issues pertaining to land and consultation with affected stakeholders, the 
Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure respect for human rights in relation to land acquisition, land 
tenure, land use, displacement and resettlement of communities, in line with FAO&#8217;s
