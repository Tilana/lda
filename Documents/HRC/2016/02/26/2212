Republic with the commission of inquiry, in particular the persistent denial of access to 
members of the commission to the Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Notes with concern</i> that the lack of access by the Commission of Inquiry to

mandate, and stresses in this regard the need to collect evidence directly from all of the 
Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>

law by the Syrian authorities and the government-affiliated <i>Shabbiha</i> militias, as well as 
any human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law by armed

amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages</i> members of the international community to ensure that there is

consultations, should determine, within the framework provided by international law, the

Syrian population; 
</p>

the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and international humanitarian organizations, as 
requested in the humanitarian appeal on the Syrian Arab Republic, so that they can 
implement more actively the humanitarian response plan inside the country; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Demands</i> that the Syrian authorities facilitate the access of humanitarian 
organizations to all people in need through the most efficient routes, including by providing 
authorization for cross-border humanitarian operations as an urgent priority, encourages all 
parties in the Syrian Arab Republic to facilitate the delivery of assistance in areas under 
their control, including across conflict lines, in order to implement fully the humanitarian 
response plan, and calls on all sides to respect the safety of humanitarian workers and
