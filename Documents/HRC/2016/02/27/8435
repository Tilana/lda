<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 14/12, 
in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) to &#8220;prepare a compilation of good practices in efforts aimed at 
preventing violence against women, in consultation with the Special Rapporteur [on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences], States, civil society and other 
relevant stakeholders, and to present a report thereon&#8221; at its seventeenth session. Two notes 
verbales were sent to States, United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions and 
civil society organizations on 28 June 2010 and 11 August 2010 respectively, soliciting 
input to inform the report. Written contributions were received from 42 States1, one 
observer2, seven United Nations agencies and entities3, two national human rights 
institutions4 and 36 civil society organizations and other institutions, groups or individuals5. 
Submissions can be viewed under &#8220;documentation&#8221; on the main page for women&#8217;s rights and 
gender of the OHCHR website (see www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/ListOfIssues.aspx). 
</p>
<p>2. The report is structured as follows: in section II, the High Commissioner provides a 
comprehensive summary analysis of the replies received from stakeholders, drawing upon 
and referring to the many examples of good practices. The examples cited are not 
exhaustive but are aimed at providing a good overview of the practices reported. The 
section is organized around three categories: legal measures, policy measures and 
operational measures. In section III the High Commissioner identifies some of the major

<p>challenges to preventing violence against women as drawn from an analysis of the 
information submitted. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Good practices in efforts to prevent violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>3. In its resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993, the General Assembly recognized that 
&#8220;violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between 
men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by 
men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against 
women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a 
subordinate position compared to men.&#8221; This understanding was reiterated in numerous 
resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human 
Rights Council, and was also articulated by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, including in its general recommendation No. 19 (1992) on 
violence against women. In the context of the present report, a large majority of respondents 
indeed reaffirmed that violence against women is a human rights violation which needs to 
be dealt with specifically within the larger context of combating discrimination against 
women. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>4. Several respondents qualified their ratification of international and other regional 
treaties and conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women or the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;), as 
a demonstration of their commitment to eliminating violence against women and gender-
based discrimination. In addition, reference was made to the draft convention on preventing 
and combating violence against women of the Council of Europe, which was adopted in 
April 2011. Discussions on a European protection order to avoid re-victimization across 
borders were also noted. 
</p>
<p>5. Most stakeholders, however, focused on describing their domestic legislation, 
emphasizing the importance of a solid domestic framework to prevent violence against 
women, punish perpetrators, provide support, protection and remedies for victims, and 
avoid re-victimization. There seems to be no standard approach on legislative measures for 
violence against women, but two trends, often present in parallel, can be detected: adopting 
specific legislation on violence against women, or specific forms of violence against 
women, such as domestic violence or violence related to trafficking, and including specific 
provisions on violence against women in more general legislation, such as criminal codes, 
family laws, or non-discrimination or equality laws. 6 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Specific legislation 
</b></p>
<p>6. Many respondents underlined the enacting of specific legislation on violence against 
women as a good prevention practice. Guatemala and Mexico, for example, have recently 
</p>
<p>  
 6 A study based on a mapping of the relevant legislation and/or policies in all European Union member 
</p>
<p>States was carried out recently to assess opportunities to standardize national legislation on gender 
violence. The study found no clear-cut answer as to the feasibility of standardization at the European 
Union level due to the diversity of the legal areas in which the range of proposed measures to tackle 
violence against women were embedded. The study concluded, however, that an overall policy at the 
European Union level is possible and timely. </p>


<p>adopted specific laws against femicide and other forms of violence against women. Several 
respondents, including Greece, were in the process of drafting such a specific law. 
</p>
<p>7. In Argentina, the law on integral protection to prevent, sanction and eradicate 
violence against women stresses the integral and multisectoral treatment of the phenomenon 
of gender-based violence. The law was accompanied by a biannual project on the promotion 
and generation of the necessary conditions for effective implementation of the law with the 
participation of civil society, the United Nations Development Programme and relevant 
State institutions and departments. 
</p>
<p>8. The existence of laws focusing on domestic or family violence was also emphasized 
by many respondents, including in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Georgia, Guatemala, 
Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mauritius, Panama, the Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Thailand, 
Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. Many of these laws are fairly recent, and the older ones often had been or were 
being reviewed and revised for improvements, such as in Panama, where the scope of 
domestic violence was widened, and in Malaysia, where expanding the definition of 
domestic violence to include emotional, mental and psychological harm is currently being 
considered. In Brazil, the &#8220;Maria da Penha&#8221; law to combat domestic and family violence 
established, inter alia, a tribunal for domestic and family violence against women. In 
Indonesia, the Law on Elimination of Domestic Violence underlines the obligation of the 
central and local governments to effectively address the issue. Contrary to the majority of 
the laws and other regulations which have a focus on women as the main victims of 
domestic violence, the domestic violence law in Suriname is gender neutral. 
</p>
<p>9. Mauritius, the Republic of Korea, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom, 
among others, referred to specific laws on forms of sexual violence and offences. Slovenia, 
for example, has a specific act to prohibit sexual harassment in employment and a decree to 
protect workers in the State administration. The Ministry of Human Resources in Malaysia 
has developed codes of practice on prevention and guidelines on handling sexual 
harassment at the workplace for both the private and public sectors. 
</p>
<p>10. Several respondents also emphasized their legislation on human trafficking, such as 
Belarus, Cambodia, Guatemala, Mexico, Thailand and Turkmenistan, among others. In 
Malaysia, under the Anti-trafficking in Persons Act of 2007, trafficked victims will not be 
prosecuted for illegal entry in the country, which should facilitate reporting cases of 
violence. The European Union also mentioned its Directive on trafficking in human beings. 
Finally, the United Kingdom mentioned its acts against female genital mutilation and forced 
marriage. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Specific provisions in general legislation and legislation on gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>11. The common understanding of violence against women as a manifestation of 
discrimination against women was clearly reflected in the replies, as legislation relating to 
gender equality and/or non-discrimination was also underlined by Georgia, Mauritius, 
Mexico and Slovenia, among others, as one of the main tools to prevent violence against 
women. Reviews of gender equality and non-discrimination legislation are under way in 
several States. In Mexico, there are currently 73 initiatives to reform and harmonize 
legislation in the field of discrimination and equality, and a reform of the Constitution is 
being considered to revise all discriminatory language. Madagascar has undertaken 
legislative reforms to conform national legislation to its international human rights 
obligations. A few respondents referred to laws focusing on women in general that include 
provisions on violence against women, such as the Law on the Dignity and Integral 
Promotion of Women of Guatemala, and Singapore&#8217;s Women&#8217;s Charter. </p>


<p>12. Criminal legislation was specifically mentioned by respondents as a field where the 
inclusion of provisions on violence against women is deemed to have a preventive effect. In 
this context, several States, including Madagascar, Malaysia, Panama, Singapore and 
Suriname, underlined reforms undertaken to improve protection of women in their penal 
code, such as the inclusion of measures to combat human trafficking and sexual tourism, 
greater deterrence for sexual related offences, or the inclusion of marital rape as a crime. In 
Slovakia, the Police Act was amended in 2008 to allow police officers to ban alleged 
domestic violence offenders from the shared household. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the Division for the Advancement of Women (now part of the United 
Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women)), early 
legislative responses to violence against women tended to focus solely on criminalization 
and thus did not attempt to address the root causes of violence against women. Over time, 
however, the importance of including preventive measures in legislation has been 
increasingly emphasized. The <i>Handbook for Legislation on Violence against Women</i>, 
prepared by the Division, states that legislation should prioritize prevention of violence 
against women and include provisions on measures of awareness-raising activities regarding 
women&#8217;s human rights, gender equality and the right of women to be free from violence; 
use of educational curricula to modify discriminatory social and cultural patterns of 
behaviour; and sensitization of the media regarding violence against women.7 A 
comprehensive approach to legal reform on violence against women should include a 
revision of existing laws, adoption of specialized legislation, and development of policies 
and procedures to implement and evaluate the laws. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Policy measures 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Institutions 
</b></p>
<p>14. Many respondents noted that the establishment of State institutions focusing on 
policy development relating to gender equality and/or violence against women had yielded 
positive results. The institutions mentioned are of various kinds, with either a general or 
very specific function and purpose, of a temporary or more permanent nature, located in 
different State institutions (governmental, legislative, administrative, judiciary), and with 
varying degrees of decision-making power. Ensuring inter-institutional coordination and 
partnerships with other stakeholders, especially civil society and community-based groups, 
is often indicated as the main objective behind the establishment of institutions dedicated to 
women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Examples of such national bodies include a gender observatory in Argentina, the 
National Inter-Agency Committee to Combat Gender-based Violence in Armenia, the 
national Technical Working Group on Gender, provincial gender focal points and gender 
mainstreaming action groups in Cambodia, the National Coordinator for the Prevention of 
Domestic Violence and Violence against Women in Guatemala, the National Commission 
on Violence against Women in Indonesia, the National Women&#8217;s Institute in Mexico, the 
Myanmar National Committee for Women&#8217;s Affairs and the Myanmar Women&#8217;s Affairs 
Federation, an observatory on gender-based violence and the National Women&#8217;s Institute in 
Panama, and the Government Delegation on Gender Violence and the State Observatory on 
Violence against Women in Spain. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2005, Turkey formed an inquiry commission to research the causes of acts of 
violence against children and women and &#8220;honour killings&#8221; and identify measures to 
</p>
<p>  
 7 United Nations publication, Sales No. E.10.IV.2. </p>


<p>prevent such acts. Recommendations from the commission are at the basis of Turkey&#8217;s 
policy on combating violence against women. 
</p>
<p>17. Some institutions focus on specific types of violence against women, such as the 
National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking in Bahrain, the Commission of the 
President of the Republic against Femicide in Guatemala, a national committee to fight 
against gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation, in Mauritania, the 
National Domestic Violence Committee in Mauritius, the Family Violence Dialogue Group 
in Singapore, and the Forced Marriage Unit in the United Kingdom, a joint initiative of the 
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office. In Guatemala, the Office for the 
Defence of Indigenous Women was created on the basis of the recognition that indigenous 
women are victims of multiple discriminations because of their gender, ethnic origin and 
socio-economic situation. 
</p>
<p>18. Some respondents, including Argentina, Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Mexico and Panama, mentioned the creation or existence of special units or offices in the 
judiciary branch and courts, including special prosecution units, dealing with women, and 
violence against women and/or human trafficking. Spain created specific courts and public 
prosecutors to deal with violence against women. The United Kingdom has established 
special domestic violence courts. Finally, Serbia and Mauritius, among others, mentioned 
the creation of special police units to deal with domestic violence and violence against 
women and to provide specific services to victims of such violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National action plans and strategies 
</b></p>
<p>19. National action plans and strategies are deemed to constitute good practice to 
prevent, combat and eradicate violence against women, providing for overall policy 
guidance and direction. Most plans or strategies are multifaceted and involve a variety of 
both governmental and non-governmental actors. Several plans and/or strategies include a 
specific focus on the prevention of violence against women, such as the Second Plan of 
Action to Combat Violence against Women of Germany. Very often these plans and 
strategies have a limited duration and set out specific objectives to be attained, such as the 
implementation of the national law. Yet very few respondents clearly stated how these plans 
and strategies are being monitored and assessed to measure their impact. These plans are 
sometimes replicated with more specific plans at the provincial (especially in federal States 
such as Canada) or local level, or within different State ministries. 
</p>
<p>20. Cambodia, Germany, Greece and Guatemala, among others, have integral national 
action plans, strategies or programmes to eliminate violence against women. The National 
Action Plan of Argentina was elaborated by a multidisciplinary team of experts taking into 
account data analysis. In 2007, the Government of Brazil launched a national pact to combat 
violence against women with a specific focus on vulnerable women, such as rural, black and 
indigenous women. This pact has four comprehensive strategic objectives: (a) strengthening 
the network of attention to women and implementing the Maria da Penha law; (b) protecting 
sexual and reproductive rights and implementing the Integrated Plan to Combat the 
Feminization of AIDS; (c) combating the trafficking and sexual exploitation of women; and 
(d) promoting the human rights of women in detention centres. In Lithuania, an annual 
report is produced on the implementation of measures from the national strategy on violence 
against women, and an assessment of the strategy prior its finalization is planned. 
</p>
<p>21. Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Mauritius, Panama, Slovenia and Turkey, among others, have 
national action plans or programmes on family or domestic violence. In Latvia, the 
programme for reducing domestic violence for 2008-2011 presents three strategies: (a) the 
study of the prevalence of domestic violence to ensure a sufficient level of knowledge of the 
issue; (b) awareness-raising and information; and (c) the establishment of a unified system 
for service provision for victims of domestic violence through the cooperation of various </p>


<p>institutions. Latvia produced an interim report on the implementation of this programme 
that describes actions undertaken in the areas of legislation, statistics, research, training of 
specialists and awareness-raising. 
</p>
<p>22. Mauritania created a national strategy to combat female genital mutilation 
articulated around four axes: the institutional framework; capacity-building; social 
mobilization and communication; and follow-up, evaluation and research-based action. 
Some respondents also mentioned their national programme or plan to combat human 
trafficking, including Belarus, Brazil and Latvia. Brazil further mentioned the memorandum 
of understanding signed with Argentina and Paraguay creating a centre of attention for 
migrant women victims of violence within the centre of migrants of the tri-border city of 
Foz do Iguazu, and the bilateral memorandum signed with the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela for the creation of common services of attention for women at the border 
between the two countries. 
</p>
<p>23. A few respondents, including Serbia, Spain and Switzerland, cited their national 
plan to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Following its examination by 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2009, Switzerland 
also elaborated a national action plan to implement the Committee&#8217;s recommendations and 
will report on progress. 
</p>
<p>24. Some respondents referred to more general action plans or strategies that include a 
focus on women, gender equality, and/or measures on violence against women, including 
Madagascar, Malaysia, Mexico, Myanmar, the Republic of Korea, Serbia and Slovenia. 
Cambodia also tailored its own Millennium Development Goals, including indicators and 
targets on reducing violence against women by 2015, which are included in the Cambodian 
National Strategic Development Plan. The Republic of Korea developed a basic plan for 
women&#8217;s policies which secures specific funds for measures to prevent and combat sexual 
violence and provide support for victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Information and data gathering 
</b></p>
<p>25. Several respondents explicitly acknowledged the importance of available, reliable 
and comprehensive data and information, as well as common indicators, to inform the 
design of public policies and legislation aimed at preventing and eradicating violence 
against women and to assess their impact. The dimensions of violence against women 
prevalent in a society, including its underlying causes, different manifestations and types, 
must be properly researched and understood so as to craft effective, adequate and acceptable 
responses. 
</p>
<p>26. In Argentina, developing indicators and strategies to collect information is a priority 
area for the gender observatory. In Guatemala, the National Institute of Statistics is working 
to put in place an effective national system of information on violence against women. 
Indonesia has introduced a technical mechanism for recording and reporting cases of 
violence in hospitals, police stations, and immigration offices. In 2002, the Council of the 
European Union adopted indicators on domestic violence to monitor progress towards the 
strategic implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. 
</p>
<p>27. Studies and surveys were mentioned by several respondents as a positive method for 
gathering information and data and measuring progress. In Cambodia, the Ministry of 
Women&#8217;s Affairs initiated a survey on violence against women in 2005, gathering a broad 
spectrum of data to help assess the situation and formulate effective solutions. In 2009, the 
Ministry conducted a follow-up study to assess progress; compared to the 2005 study data, 
the follow-up study showed that the percentage of Cambodian men and women considering 
violence justified had dropped significantly. In 2003, Singapore conducted a study on public 
perception of, awareness of, and attitudes towards family violence, and on knowledge of </p>


<p>existing avenues for seeking help and redress. In 2007, a follow-up study indicated positive 
shifts in public perceptions and an increased awareness of what constitutes emotional 
violence, suggesting, inter alia, better knowledge of the protection offered under the law. 
Finally, Slovakia noted that the European Union was conducting a comparative study to 
analyse the size and quality of services provided to women victims of violence, including 
social assistance and support services, medical care and housing services. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Operational measures 
</b></p>
<p>28. The majority of operational measures and initiatives provided as examples in the 
submissions are aimed at preventing re-victimization of survivors of violence and dealing 
with the short and longer term consequences of the violence on their lives. Examples 
focusing on the prevention of violence against women before it occurs were scarce and 
mainly mentioned awareness-raising and education initiatives. Very few examples provided 
details on addressing the underlying determinants of violence against women, such as the 
economic, social and political situation of women, to prevent violence from occurring in the 
first place. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Help and support services 
</b></p>
<p>29. Many coordinated responses to violence against women were underlined by 
respondents, such as &#8220;one-stop&#8221; centres, multidimensional crisis centres that integrate 
various forms of service provision for women (and often children) who have been victims 
of violence, such as medical, psychological, legal and investigation services. These centres, 
which can be found in, inter alia, Belarus, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand, 
are usually the result of multisectoral collaboration across the State, and between State 
authorities and local communities and civil society. In Indonesia, the one-stop centres also 
include training and business and enterprise advice in order to economically empower 
survivors. Indonesia has also developed a set of minimum standards for the provision of 
integrated services for women and children who have been victims of violence. 
</p>
<p>30. The Saartjie Baartman Centre pioneered the one-stop partnership approach for 
tackling violence against women in South Africa. In Tajikistan, the Gulrukhsor Women&#8217;s 
Center combines a crisis centre and the only temporary shelter for women victims of 
violence. With the organization of trainings, seminars and information campaigns, the 
Centre increased awareness of violence against women in the society. The Centre also 
created research and statistical databases on issues related to violence against women in 
Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p>31. Direct telephone lines, most of the time free of charge8 and available 24 hours a day, 
called hotlines or helplines, exist in many respondent States, including Azerbaijan, Belgium, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Georgia, Mauritius, New Zealand and Thailand. The Republic of Korea 
has an emergency call centre with 9 languages available, and Thailand a phone service in 11 
languages, with another 42 languages offered from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., to target migrant and 
trafficked women. These helplines provide access to information on violence against 
women, advise callers and direct them to adequate support services. 
</p>
<p>32. In Georgia, UN-Women has been implementing a national project entitled &#8220;SHiEld&#8221; 
to enhance prevention and response to domestic violence, with a particular focus on 
internally displaced and conflict-affected women. The project provides relevant partners 
</p>
<p>  
 8 A notable exception is Serbia. It reported that several phone lines exist but are mostly run by NGOs, 
</p>
<p>social centres and local authorities, and only a few of them are free of charge. </p>


<p>with technical and financial assistance to facilitate work on simultaneous levels: policy and 
decision-making; institutional service providers; and civil society and grassroots 
communities. As a result, victims of domestic violence have gained access to particular 
State-provided services not previously available, such as shelters, legal counselling, and a 
country-wide helpline. To ensure the sustainability of the services established in the 
framework of the SHiEld project, UN-Women concluded a memorandum of understanding 
with Georgia which foresees a commitment to maintain services and products established in 
the framework of the SHiEld project. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Awareness-raising campaigns 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Division for the Advancement of Women affirmed that public awareness-
raising campaigns are critical to prevent violence against women. They serve not only to 
inform on what constitutes violence, expose and convey its unacceptability and raise 
awareness about existing laws and available protection measures and remedies, but also to 
uncover the underlying causes of violence and challenge the attitudes which support it.9 
Such campaigns can take a variety of titles, have different themes, target specific groups of 
persons, involve different types of stakeholders and activists, and include the use of many 
different tools, such as conferences, trainings, the media, production and dissemination of 
support material, and the organization of contests. 
</p>
<p>34. New Zealand&#8217;s long-term campaign entitled &#8220;It&#8217;s not OK&#8221; focused on action against 
family violence. The campaign used an audience-driven approach to challenging and 
changing attitudes and behaviours that tolerate any kind of family violence, and was 
grounded in thorough research and continuous evaluation. The campaign used tools such as 
television advertisements, media advocacy, a community-based action fund supporting 
community-led activities, new partnerships, and the voices of repenting perpetrators or 
survivors of violence. Three tracking surveys have been conducted since the campaign was 
launched (with another already undertaken in November 2010) to measure the reach of the 
campaign messages. A community study exploring the impact of the campaign in four 
communities and a face-to-face study measuring attitude change of more than 2,000 people 
were conducted. These evaluations evidenced that family violence is no longer considered a 
private issue, media coverage is more accurate and responsible, raising family violence-
related issues is easier for police, health and social agencies, and there had been a 
significant increase in people, particularly men, seeking help to change behaviours. The 
campaign has reportedly had a strong impact on Maori and Pacific Peoples communities. 
</p>
<p>35. In Belgium, an awareness-raising campaign on &#8220;dating violence&#8221; entitled &#8220;Love 
without Violence&#8221; and directed at youth was launched in 2007 using the Internet, a short-
film contest and a rap video clip. The campaign was aimed at enabling youth to recognize 
signs of psychological, verbal, physical and sexual violence in their relationships, and 
providing them with advice and contacts for support and help. In Singapore a &#8220;dating 
violence awareness week&#8221; was organized in 2008, and in Mexico, the Reinas Chulas 
Theatre-Cabaret sensitizes teenagers about dating violence through a monologue play and 
group discussions. In France, the organization Filactions has been leading a campaign of 
prevention and awareness-raising on dating violence using workshops, films and 
discussions in schools, universities and other youth-oriented structures targeting boys and 
girls aged 15 to 25. 
</p>
<p>36. In 2008, Mauritania organized an awareness-raising campaign on female genital 
mutilation, targeting three cities where the practice was prevalent. In Spain, an awareness-

</p>
<p>women&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr. 1), para. 339. </p>


<p>raising campaign on sexual exploitation was designed on the basis of an agreement with the 
country&#8217;s federation of hotels and restaurants and included the distribution of material for 
denouncing and informing on trafficking in the establishments associated with the 
federation. After a 2006 study on the prevalence of forced marriage in Switzerland, the 
SURGIR Foundation launched an awareness-raising campaign in the French-speaking part 
of Switzerland to shed light on the problem and put in place a telephone helpline for 
victims. 
</p>
<p>37. Awareness-raising campaigns targeting vulnerable groups of women were also 
reported by Azerbaijan (internally displaced women), Belgium (migrant women) and Brazil 
(rural and forest women), among others. An awareness-raising campaign targeting remote 
areas was reported by Lithuania as a successful practice: advertising messages encouraging 
women victims of violence to speak up and seek assistance were posted on trucks and 
broadcasted as videos in supermarkets; the slogan and logo of the campaign with the 
number of a free helpline were printed on food packages; and experienced professionals 
from women&#8217;s crisis centres visited remote places in person to deal directly with violence 
situations. 
</p>
<p>38. The Native Women&#8217;s Association of Canada developed a research, education and 
policy initiative entitled &#8220;Sisters in Spirit&#8221; to raise awareness on the high rates of violence 
against aboriginal women and girls in Canada. The campaign was grounded on research that 
gathered data and information on the situation of aboriginal women and investigated the 
root causes of violence against them. The Yukon Aboriginal Women&#8217;s Council recently 
developed a spin-off campaign entitled &#8220;Yukon Sisters in Spirit&#8221; to research the 
circumstances of violence against aboriginal women in Yukon and raise awareness and 
educate the public. This campaign was reported to have triggered large national media 
interest. 
</p>
<p>39. The importance of mobilization strategies at the community level for the prevention 
of violence against women &#8211; with the involvement of local government representatives, 
community leaders, NGOs and women&#8217;s groups &#8211; was acknowledged in the in-depth study 
of the Secretary-General on violence against women (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 
344). The Women against Violence campaign was launched in Malaysia in 2001. After 
realizing the importance of community involvement in combating violence against women, 
the campaign was re-launched in 2006 to increase community awareness and promote the 
role of the community in preventing violence. Groups of trained community volunteers 
were created to provide guidance and services to victims of violence. In the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, the We Can campaign invited individuals to become actors of 
change and encouraged them to share their reflections and experiences. The campaign 
focused on social transformation using social mobilization and public education, awareness-
raising and simple and interactive communication tools. 
</p>
<p>40. Engaging men and boys to play a role in preventing violence against women, 
promoting positive masculinities and helping shape respectful attitudes and behaviours has 
been recognized as a critical component of prevention efforts. According to the Secretary-
General, &#8220;the struggle to transform gender relations and to eliminate violence against 
women cannot be successful without the involvement of men&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, 
para. 346). There are promising examples of campaigns led by or targeting men and boys, 
some referred to by the respondents. The national campaign for the elimination of violence 
against women launched in Turkey in 2004 with the collaboration of the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) was composed of a wide range of activities, which included the 
involvement of football players who wore shirts with the logo &#8220;Stop Violence against 
Women&#8221;, and a label reading &#8220;End violence against women&#8221; was attached to the price label 
on men&#8217;s garment products. In Cambodia, men and boys were engaged in a process of 
social attitudes changes through programmes and projects targeting them as &#8220;agents of </p>


<p>change&#8221; in the prevention of violence against women. UNFPA produced a football video 
game on violence against women disseminated during the last FIFA World Cup in South 
Africa. 
</p>
<p>41. The White Ribbon Campaign, which &#8220;encourages men and boys to wear white 
ribbons on November 25 &#8211; the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against 
Women &#8211; as a personal pledge to never commit, condone or remain silent about violence 
against women&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 347) originated in Canada and is now 
conducted in dozens of States around the world, including Ecuador, Singapore and 
Thailand. In the United Kingdom, the White Ribbon Campaign works with men and boys 
using five avenues: (a) sports; (b) music (including leading rock bands, venues, individual 
performers, record labels and recording studios); (c) schools; (d) an &#8220;ambassadors&#8221; 
programme whereby individual men and boys work for the campaign in their workplace, 
educational institution, and/or community; and (e) an awareness-raising merchandizing 
campaign every 25 November. 
</p>
<p>42. Using the news media and information technologies is a promising practice as it can 
enhance the quality of reporting and contribute to increased awareness and understanding of 
the general public (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 349). The Division for the 
Advancement of Women also reported that media representations significantly influence 
societal perceptions of acceptable behaviour and attitudes, and therefore training journalists 
and other media personnel on women&#8217;s human rights and the root causes of violence against 
women may influence the way in which the issue is reported and thereby influence societal 
attitudes. 
</p>
<p>43. In Malaysia, the Media and Publicity Committee under the Council for Anti-
Trafficking in Persons launched various public-awareness campaigns and programmes 
through mass media (radio and television). In Spain the recent campaign entitled &#8220;Give a 
red card to the abuser&#8221; had a large impact in the media. In Bangladesh, at the request of the 
Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit developed a multimedia campaign addressing various forms of violence 
against women, such as early marriage and sexual harassment/stalking, not through the 
conventional showing of violence itself, but by illustrating positive actions as a result of 
prevention or a well-managed violence case. The campaign included announcements for 
radio and television, posters, telling the stories of real-life heroes under the slogan &#8220;Let&#8217;s 
stop violence against women, let&#8217;s make society a happier place&#8221;. In the United States of 
America a campaign was based on the documentary film <i>Sin by Silence </i>which focused on 
worst-case scenarios where women victims of domestic violence felt obliged to resort to the 
killing of their abusers. The film premiered in 2009 and has been used since as a compelling 
communication vehicle to connect domestic violence agencies with their communities, to 
promote the understanding of the reality of domestic violence, the cycle of violence and the 
signs of an abuser. 
</p>
<p>44. Finally, the Canadian Federation of University Women reported on a civil society 
campaign on gun control targeted at a bill tabled before the Parliament of Canada to 
suppress compulsory registration of &#8220;long guns&#8221; in the firearms inventory. The Federation, 
referring to a study of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, stated that long 
guns were used in 88 per cent of all intimate partner homicides against women in Canada. 
The Federation undertook research to gather information and statistics, launched a postcard 
campaign leading to the commemoration of the Montreal Massacre of 1989 where 14 
women were killed with a long gun, and led a media campaign highlighting the value of the 
gun registry. The main outcome was that the bill failed to pass, but the Federation also 
reported positively on the coordination of women&#8217;s groups who worked together on the 
campaign. </p>


<p><b> 3. Education and training 
</b></p>
<p>45. As noted by the Secretary-General, &#8220;the formal education system can be used as a 
key site for raising awareness about violence against women and challenging and 
eradicating gender stereotypes&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 353). Initiatives to 
prevent violence against women will be more effective when derogatory stereotypes and 
discriminatory attitudes toward women are eliminated from educational curricula and when 
content promoting women&#8217;s human rights and gender equality and condemning violence 
against women is incorporated at all levels of education. A majority of respondents referred 
to education and training initiatives carried out in formal school settings, but also to 
capacity-building activities conducted in the wider community, targeting men and boys, 
law-enforcement, judiciary and other State officials, health and other service providers, and 
religious leaders, as good practice to prevent and help detect violence against women. 
</p>
<p>46. Belgium, Cambodia and the Republic of Korea referred to training and guidance kits 
on violence against women for students and educational personnel, while Slovenia set the 
world record for a public &#8220;oath of non-violence&#8221; by secondary-school graduates. In 
Germany, the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth 
supports a research project that tests methods of preventing domestic violence and 
supporting affected children and their parents in the interface between school and youth 
services authorities, noting that services offered to parents can have an important preventive 
function. 
</p>
<p>47. The SURGIR Foundation implemented a project in Palestine, where local university 
student volunteers were trained to hold human rights workshops in schools and raise 
awareness of the society on violence against women and its consequences. In the borough of 
Islington, London, a full-time officer is employed to work with the entire school community 
(pupils, parents and staff) on gender-based violence, bullying, domestic violence prevention 
and child protection issues. In Spain, a specific project promotes reflection of educators on 
the way love and sexuality are dealt with in education curricula. 
</p>
<p>48. Respondents also noted that leadership from regional or local authorities or 
organizations can constitute a positive practice to drive prevention activities on violence 
against women at the grass-roots level. Local actors are well placed to tailor prevention 
activities to meet local needs and can work directly with affected people. Human Rights 
Watch noted that prevention efforts tend to be more effective and more sustainable where 
local communities are invested and involved. For instance, the organization had positive 
feedback from a programme training women as &#8220;paralegals&#8221; in rural areas of Nepal. The 
women are taught the basic legal mechanisms and recourses, and mediation skills on issues 
including domestic violence, rape or forced child marriage. These women have reportedly 
become valuable resources for those who need protection or help, and who would otherwise 
be unwilling or unable to seek help from the police. Mauritania reported that a three-year 
programme promoting the abandonment of practices harmful to women through human 
rights education had been carried out in partnership with an NGO and the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in 30 communities. No new cases of excision had been reported 
by health personnel in the communities targeted by the programme for the last two years. 
Also, girls&#8217; school attendance reportedly improved considerably in the areas concerned. 
</p>
<p>49. The Independent Commission for People&#8217;s Rights and Development from New 
Delhi referred to the Youth Forums Against Gender Based Violence project, a movement of 
young men aged 14 to 24 who advocate for girls and women&#8217;s rights, including freedom 
from violence, in their communities. The project is rooted in the notion that as long as 
women are not able to lead a life of dignity and equality free of violence, men and society at 
large will not be able to attain their full potential. Human Rights Watch reported that in 
South Africa the evaluation of the Stepping Stones programme, which is aimed at 
improving sexual health by building more gender-equitable relationships, showed that </p>


<p>young men who participated in the programme for two years were 33 per cent less likely to 
commit acts of physical and sexual violence against their intimate partners. 
</p>
<p>50. Respondents highlighted the existence of education trainings for law enforcement 
and other State officials on issues related to violence against women and gender equality, 
including specific trainings for the police (in Belgium, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Georgia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Malawi and Spain, among others), State border officials (in Latvia and 
Switzerland, for instance), personnel from migration offices and consulates (in Spain and 
Switzerland), personnel in detention facilities (in Thailand), and military and other civil 
personnel sent on peace missions (in Serbia and Switzerland, among others). 
</p>
<p>51. The Women Prisoners Welfare Society reported on a gender and juvenile 
sensitization programme carried out in the province of Sindh, Pakistan, to train judiciary, 
police and prison officials with the core purpose of raising awareness on the prejudices that 
perpetuate injustices faced by women. The Society insisted on the audience-driven selection 
of trainers, who were well-respected figures of authority and expertise, such as judges and 
professors. Some respondents, including Cambodia, Georgia, Latvia, Serbia and the Malawi 
Human Rights Commission, reported specific trainings for judges and prosecutors as good 
practice. 
</p>
<p>52. Many respondents considered the sensitization training of service providers, in 
particular health-service providers and social workers, on issues relating to violence against 
women to be essential for preventing re-victimization when women seek help and treatment. 
States where such trainings are taking place include Belgium, Latvia, Mauritania (focus on 
female genital mutilations/cutting), Serbia, Tajikistan and Thailand. Such trainings allow 
health and social professionals to improve the detection of cases of violence and intervene 
adequately, improve understanding of violence against women, its causes and 
consequences, and improve the collection of evidence for legal and investigative purposes; 
they also create networks of experts who can in turn train other professionals. 
</p>
<p>53. Finally, several respondents stressed the importance of working with and training 
religious leaders on issues relating to violence against women. In Mauritania, imams were 
educated on the consequences of female genital mutilations; this culminated in ulemas 
(Islamic scholars) emitting a national fatwa prohibiting female genital mutilations in 2010. 
Suriname reported the organization of training for priests on domestic violence, and Turkey 
similar trainings for imams, while in 2009, UNFPA launched a two-year project for priests 
in Armenia, in cooperation with the Armenia Inter-Church Charitable Round Table 
Foundation of the World Council of Churches. The project developed a manual for priests 
and a brochure for parishioners on gender-based violence; capacity-building for clergy on 
the development of community plans; and cooperation with Christian education centres for 
delivering courses on gender-based violence prevention for school children and their 
parents. UNFPA reported that this project had greatly increased the trust and readiness of 
community members to approach priests to seek support regarding concerns relating to 
gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>54. The Interfaith Center of New York carried out a project in 2010 where 25 religious 
leaders, diverse in gender and religion, were selected to attend a six-month training on 
domestic violence. The curriculum of the training was shaped through prior conversations 
with over 60 religious leaders. The objective was to educate the leaders on the impact of 
domestic violence on their community, how to recognize domestic violence, and how to 
negotiate legal and other resources. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Other projects, programmes and activities 
</b></p>
<p>55. Respondents referred to specific projects, activities and other programmes which 
develop and/or use a variety of tools to contribute to the prevention and elimination of </p>


<p>violence against women. For instance, the use of new technologies was reported as a good 
way to encourage the reporting of violence and to avoid re-victimization, including by 
Slovenia (where an anonymous domestic violence e-report system was set up) and 
Singapore (where victims who fear direct confrontation with perpetrators can use a remote 
videoconferencing system to apply for a protection order or to testify at case hearings in 
Family Courts).<b> 
</b></p>
<p>56. Femmes Solidaires has a project to mentor non-excised girls in a region in Ethiopia 
and support the girls&#8217; families against social pressure, including by helping them to send the 
girls to school. The last evaluation trip, which took place in November 2010, coincided with 
the first baby delivery by a non-excised young woman in the community. The delivery 
showed the benefits of the absence of excision and contributed to refuting prejudices against 
non-excised women.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>57. The World Food Programme underlined that food assistance can be used as a direct 
protection tool. Extreme poverty often forces women and girls to resort to negative survival 
mechanisms, including transactional sex, to feed themselves and their children, and food 
assistance can prevent such practices and decrease the related risk of exposure to violence. 
Using food rations as an incentive to keep girls in school also reduces their exposure to 
violence, by protecting them from early marriage and pregnancies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. Human Rights Watch referred to the Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and 
Gender Equity (IMAGE) programme, a trial intervention that combined microfinance 
support with training sessions on gender, HIV/AIDS and intimate partner violence, targeting 
women living in poor rural areas in South Africa. The programme also encouraged wider 
community participation and the involvement of men and boys. It was reported, two years 
after completing the programme, that participants had experienced 55 per cent fewer acts of 
violence by their intimate partner in the previous 12 months. The IMAGE project was 
qualified as &#8220;one of the most rigorously evaluated and successful microfinance and 
women&#8217;s empowerment programmes to date&#8221; by the World Health Organization.10<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the prevention of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>59. An analysis of submissions showed that preventing violence against women requires 
a spectrum of strategies accompanied by political and financial commitments, at all levels 
of the State and involving a large range of actors and stakeholders. Submissions also clearly 
showed increased awareness about the need to prevent and combat violence against women. 
Some of the responses clearly related violence against women to discrimination against 
women and linked the struggle against violence against women to efforts to promote gender 
equality. In many States a legal framework to protect women from violence, and to 
discourage and punish perpetrators, is in place. However, such frameworks are not always 
comprehensive, adequate and accessible to women, and their prevention aspects, if they 
have any, are not clearly emphasized. Legislation is also often not systematically and 
properly implemented. 
</p>
<p>60. The responses also referred to a proliferation of specific institutional entities in 
many States which have contributed to the establishment of national action plans and 
initiatives to combat and prevent violence against women. However, the status and 
decision-making power of such entities is not always clear and issues regarding their 
funding not acknowledged. Nevertheless, coordination across the State and with other 
</p>
<p>  
 10 World Health Organization, <i>Preventing Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence against Women: 
</i></p>
<p><i>Taking Action and Generating Evidence</i> (Geneva, 2010), p. 48 </p>


<p>partners, such as civil society, is an issue whose importance was noted in many responses. 
The programmes and initiatives reported were varied, and often presented a combination of 
different tools and strategies, which renders a precise categorization of practices difficult. 
</p>
<p>61. Some main challenges were also highlighted in the responses, whether directly 
raised as such by the respondents or stemming from an analysis of the replies. First, there 
seems to be a lack of understanding on the definition and scope of prevention of violence 
against women. In his in-depth study, the Secretary-General explained that &#8220;prevention 
efforts fall into three categories: primary &#8211; stopping violence before it occurs; secondary &#8211; 
an immediate response after violence has occurred to limit its extent and consequences; and 
tertiary &#8211; longer-term care and support for those who have suffered violence,&#8221;11 yet the 
strategies presented by the respondents do not distinguish between prevention categories.12 
WHO recently argued that because the prevalence of violence against women is so high, no 
State has the resources to provide services to so many victims, and thus the major focus 
should be on primary prevention &#8211; preventing violence from happening in the first place.13 
Even if it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between the three levels of 
prevention, considering them before shaping legislation, policies and other strategic 
programmes to prevent violence against women should improve both the effectiveness and 
adequacy of these actions. 
</p>
<p>62. The second main challenge which appears clearly in the analysis of the responses is 
the lack of monitoring and evaluation of measures taken. Not all respondents mentioned 
how the practices they referred to had been evaluated and their impact assessed. Of those 
who did, not all explained what standards or measures were used to assess impact and 
change. Also, the majority of the initiatives referred to are fairly recent, therefore not 
allowing for long-term and/or regular assessments to have taken place. Furthermore, many 
of the specialized projects detailed are limited short-term projects, whose impact in the 
longer term might not be sustainable. Evaluation and monitoring of practices should 
constitute the cornerstone of every legislative, policy and operational measure undertaken. 
</p>
<p>63. The challenge of evaluating practices is further linked to two corollary issues, 
namely the lack of reliable information and data on violence against women, and the lack of 
sustained funding for supporting practices aimed at implementing the practices. 
</p>
<p>64. The Secretary-General stated: &#8220;Despite the progress in recent years, however, there 
is still an urgent need to strengthen the knowledge base on all forms of violence against 
women to inform policy and strategy development. Many countries still lack reliable data 
and much of the existing information cannot be meaningfully compared.&#8221;14 While some 
respondents mentioned their recent efforts to address this lack of information, they also 
affirmed that they were aware of the difficulties and challenges they faced in obtaining 
reliable data and putting in place comprehensive information systems. The need for 
disaggregated data was also highlighted by several respondents, who noted, inter alia, that 
information was lacking on women facing multiple forms of discrimination, such as 
disabled women, widows and female domestic workers. The European Union, for instance, 
recognized that the lack of timely, reliable, accurate and comparable data both at the 
national and European Union levels limited the understanding of the real extent of such 
</p>
<p>  
 11 A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 336. For the definition of prevention with examples see also 
</p>
<p>Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, &#8220;Preventing violence before it occurs: a framework and 
background paper to guide the primary prevention of violence against women in Victoria&#8221; (December 
2007). 
</p>
<p> 12 A notable exception is the submission of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation. 
 13 World Health Organization, <i>Preventing </i>(note 10 above), pp. 34-35. 
 14 A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 184. </p>


<p>violence and impeded the further development of effective responses and strategies. 
Nevertheless, efforts to set up reliable systems to collect accurate information on violence 
against women should not be overlooked, since it is part of every State&#8217;s obligation to 
address violence against women.15 
</p>
<p>65. The lack of consistent State funding for initiatives and policies aimed at preventing 
violence against women is also problematic. It prevents sustainable implementation of 
programmes and activities over time and greatly affects the impact policies and legislative 
measures will have on effectively contributing to preventing violence against women. 
Evaluation and monitoring measures are also greatly affected by lack of funding. Yet 
project-driven funding is often favoured by donors, thereby greatly limiting the 
sustainability and viability of practices over time. 
</p>
<p>66. It is also very difficult to generalize about good practices at the international level. 
In a recent publication, OSCE noted that &#8220;despite attempts to identify best practices so that 
they can be studied and replicated, there are no agreed-upon principles or criteria of what 
constitutes such practices&#8221;.16 Both the standards of evaluation and specific local context in 
which the practice was used play an important role. Already in 2006, the Secretary-General 
noted that &#8220;what works well is influenced by the form of the State, its commitment to 
women&#8217;s equality, its relationship with NGOs and civil society and the resources it has to 
draw on&#8221; (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1, para. 286). 
</p>
<p>67. Finally, the replies showed a lack of focus of prevention initiatives on the underlying 
causes of violence against women. The role of economic power and structures in reinforcing 
gender inequalities which make women more vulnerable to violence, and poor, migrant, 
indigenous, young and elderly women particularly vulnerable, seemed to be overlooked. 
Since primary prevention essentially &#8220;relies on identifying the &#8216;upstream&#8217; determinants and 
then taking action to address these&#8221;,17 it seems of the utmost importance that legislation, 
policy and operational measures address underlying causes, such as gender inequality and 
the feminization of poverty. Moreover, the causes of violence need to be accurately known 
to respond to that violence and end it in the long term. It seems there is a lack of research on 
the economic, political and social determinants of violence against women. A few initiatives 
on economic empowerment or political participation of women were mentioned by the 
respondents, but most of these were lacking detailed explanations on the precise measures 
taken and assessment of these measures&#8217; impact on violence against women.
