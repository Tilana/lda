<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The present report addresses the topic of State responsibility for eliminating 
violence against women. As a general rule, State responsibility is based on acts or 
omissions committed either by State actors or by actors whose actions are attributable to 
the State. A longstanding exception to this rule is that a State may incur responsibility 
where there is a failure to exercise due diligence to prevent or respond to certain acts or 
omissions of non-State actors. The due diligence standard serves as a tool for rights holders 
to hold States accountable, by providing an assessment framework for ascertaining what 
constitutes effective fulfilment of a State&#8217;s obligations, and for analysing its actions or 
omissions. For due diligence to be satisfied, the formal framework established by the State 
must also be effective in practice.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 16/7 
by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, 
Rashida Manjoo. Chapter II summarizes the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities since her 
</p>
<p>previous report to the Council up until 4 March 2013. Chapter III addresses the topic of 
State responsibility for eliminating violence against women.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>2. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur requested invitations to visit 
Azerbaijan, Colombia, Cuba, Israel, South Africa and the State of Palestine. Earlier 
requests for country visits were also reiterated to the Governments of Bangladesh, Nepal, 
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Solomon Islands, from 12 to 16 March 2012 
(A/HRC/23/49/Add.1); Papua New Guinea, from 18 to 26 March 2012 
(A/HRC/23/49/Add.2); Bosnia and Herzegovina, from 29 October to 5 November 2012 
(A/HRC/23/49/Add.3), and Croatia, from 7 to 16 November 2012 (A/HRC/23/49/Add.4). 
The Special Rapporteur would like to thank these Governments for their cooperation 
before, during and after the visit, and urges the Governments that have not yet done so to 
provide a favourable response.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Communications and press releases  
</b></p>
<p>4. The communications sent to Governments during the reporting period 
(A/HRC/21/49, A/HRC/22/67, A/HRC/23/51) concerned arbitrary detention; torture or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; summary and extrajudicial 
executions; sexual violence, including rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation; and other 
forms of violence grounded in discrimination against women.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur issued numerous press statements, either individually or 
jointly with other mandate holders. 
</p>
<p><b> C. General Assembly and Commission on the Status of Women  
</b></p>
<p>6. In October 2012, the Special Rapporteur presented her second written report to the 
General Assembly (A/67/227). It discusses the issue of violence against women with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>7. In the report, the Special Rapporteur highlights how women with disabilities 
experience many of the same forms of violence that all women experience, yet violence 
against them takes on unique forms, has unique causes, and results in unique consequences. 
Women with disabilities experience both the stereotypical attitudes directed towards 
women, and those directed towards persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur argues that in addressing violence against women with 
disabilities, States should ensure an empowerment perspective, as opposed to a </p>


<p>vulnerability perspective, and must also apply a social model of disability, as opposed to a 
medical or charity model, within their prevention and response work.  
</p>
<p>9. In March 2013, the Special Rapporteur participated in the fifty-seventh session of 
the Commission on the Status of Women. She presented an oral statement on her activities 
for the past two years; convened two side events, on gender-related killings of women and 
on violence against women in custodial settings; and participated in a number of events 
organized by United Nations agencies and civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur participated in a number of conferences, workshops and side 
events on diverse topics related to her mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> III. State responsibility for eliminating violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>11. As a general rule, State responsibility is based on acts or omissions committed either 
by State actors or by actors whose actions are attributable to the State.1 A long-standing 
exception to this rule is that a State may incur responsibility where there is a failure to 
exercise due diligence to prevent or respond to certain acts or omissions of non-State 
actors.2 In the seventeenth century, Grotius articulated principles that can be seen as a 
precursor to contemporary notions of State responsibility. The principle of <i>patientia</i> would 
hold a community or ruler responsible where there is knowledge of a crime committed by a 
subject, but there is a failure to prevent it in circumstances where it can and should be 
prevented.3 In the early twentieth century, Oppenheim advanced the theory of vicarious 
State liability, in which a State is responsible for acts of private individuals in its territory 
where it has failed to disown or disapprove of the impugned conduct.4 Triepel articulated a 
doctrine of State responsibility that would hold States responsible in circumstances where 
they fail to exercise due diligence.5  
</p>
<p>12. The last 25 years has seen developments in legal rules governing State responsibility 
in general and due diligence in particular as regards the obligations of States to protect 
individuals within their territory or jurisdiction from human rights violations. The modern 
approach to State responsibility is set out in the International Law Commission draft 
articles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts. Articles 2 and 12 
broadly provide that a State is responsible for an act or omission attributable to it under 
international law where the conduct breaches an international obligation of that State and 
when an act of that State is not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation, 
regardless of its origin or character. The standard of fault that applies, whether intent, 
negligence or the failure to exercise due diligence, depends on the applicable international 
</p>

<p>legal rule.6 The commentary to the articles notes that the standard of due diligence is 
context specific and is dependent on the substantive international legal rule at issue.7  
</p>
<p>13. The due diligence standard serves as a tool for rights holders to hold States 
accountable, by providing an assessment framework for ascertaining what constitutes 
effective fulfilment of a State&#8217;s obligations, and for analysing its actions or omissions. An 
assessment framework is especially important where the potential infringement comes 
through a State&#8217;s failure to act, as it can be difficult for rights bearers to assess if an 
omission constituted a violation of their right, in the absence of a normative basis for the 
appraisal.  
</p>
<p>14. With regard to non-State actors, it has been argued that: &#8220;International human rights 
law requires a state to take measures &#8211; such as by legislation and administrative practices &#8211; 
to control, regulate, investigate and prosecute actions by non-state actors that violate the 
human rights of those within the territory of that state. These actions by non-state actors do 
not have to be attributed to the state, rather this responsibility is part of the state&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligation to exercise due diligence to protect the rights of all persons in a state&#8217;s 
territory.&#8221;8 
</p>
<p>15. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights was the first human rights body to hold 
that the American Convention on Human Rights requires States to exercise due diligence to 
prevent attacks on a person&#8217;s life, physical integrity or liberty on its territory and punish 
</p>
<p>perpetrators and to restore the right violated and provide compensation for damages 
resulting from the violation.9 This was premised on the State obligation to ensure the 
applicant&#8217;s human rights. The duty to prevent entails the use of all means of a legal, 
political, administrative and cultural nature to promote the protection of human rights and 
ensure that violations are considered and treated as illegal acts, leading to the punishment of 
responsible parties and the indemnification of victims.10 For due diligence to be satisfied, 
the formal framework established by the State must also be effective in practice.11  
</p>
<p>16. One of the debates within the context of due diligence is whether it is an obligation 
of conduct/means or an obligation of result.12 The general opinion is that it is one of 
conduct, however, failure of conduct will likely constitute failure of result. Thus it can be 
argued that it is the type of conduct which is important. Treaties that establish obligations to 
protect against rights violations often require States to take appropriate measures, without 
explicitly defining what measures are appropriate. Similarly, due diligence standards 
require States to exercise whatever diligence is due; they do not define such diligence.13  
</p>
<p>17. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women has for nearly 
two decades observed and paid attention to the responsibility of the State in general and to 
the principle of due diligence in particular. In assessing State responsibility to act with due

<p>diligence to address violence against women, it was suggested by the first Special 
Rapporteur in 1999 that the following questions needed to be asked:<b> 
</b></p>
<p>(a) Has the State party ratified all the international human rights instruments 
including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women? 
</p>
<p>(b) Is there constitutional authority guaranteeing equality for women or the 
prohibition of violence against women? 
</p>
<p>(c) Is there national legislation and/or administrative sanctions providing 
adequate redress for women victims of violence? 
</p>
<p>(d) Are there executive policies or plans of action that attempt to deal with the 
question of violence against women? 
</p>
<p>(e) Is the criminal justice system sensitive to the issues of violence against 
women? In this regard, what is police practice? How many cases are investigated by the 
police? How are victims dealt with by the police? How many cases are prosecuted? What 
types of judgements are given in such cases? Are the health professionals who assist the 
prosecution sensitive to issues of violence against women? 
</p>
<p>(f) Do women who are victims of violence have support services such as 
shelters, legal and psychological counselling, specialized assistance and rehabilitation 
provided either by the Government or by non-governmental organizations? 
</p>
<p>(g) Have appropriate measures been taken in the field of education and the media 
to raise awareness of violence against women as a human rights violation and to modify 
practices that discriminate against women? 
</p>
<p>(h) Are data and statistics being collected in a manner that ensures that the 
problem of violence against women is not invisible?14 
</p>
<p>18. The meaning of State responsibility to act with due diligence was further examined 
by the second Special Rapporteur on violence against women in a 2006 report 
(E/CN.4/2006/61, para. 19 ff). One of the primary problems she found was that the due 
diligence standard focused primarily on violence against women as an isolated act and 
failed to take into consideration the connections between violence and the violation of other 
human rights, including general principles of gender equality and non-discrimination. She 
also addressed the need to move away from a public/private dichotomy in viewing violence 
against women. Her argument is that categorizing some forms of violence against women 
as part of the private sphere tends to have a normalizing effect, and it makes States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>intervention seem to be different in such situations, as opposed to where there are &#8220;public&#8221; 
incidents of violence.  
</p>
<p>19. The previous mandate holder argued that principles of non-discrimination require 
States &#8220;to use the same level of commitment in relation to prevention, investigation, 
punishment and provision of remedies for violence against women as they do with regards 
to other forms of violence&#8221; (ibid., para. 35). She noted that due diligence had until then 
&#8220;tended to be limited to responding to violence against women when it occurs and in this 
context it has concentrated on legislative reform, access to justice and the provision of 
services. There has been relatively little work done on the more general obligation of 
prevention, including the duty to transform patriarchal gender structures and values that 
perpetuate and entrench violence against women&#8221; (ibid., para. 15).   
</p>
<p>  
 14  E/CN.4/1999/68, para. 25. </p>


<p>20. The previous mandate holder also highlighted the lack of State accountability for 
social structural deficiencies, such as ongoing gender discrimination, that create 
environments that are conducive to acts of violence against women. This theme was 
addressed in more detail by the current mandate holder in the 2011 report on multiple and 
intersecting forms of discrimination that contribute to and exacerbate violence against 
women (A/HRC/17/26). In that report the Special Rapporteur argues that while laws, 
policies and resources are crucial to address effectively violence against women and girls, 
efforts must be coupled with renewed will and actions to combat the structural and systemic 
challenges which are a cause and consequence of such violence. Also, in order to prevent 
and eliminate violence against women and girls, such violence has to be understood as an 
element which affects women through their life cycle and is underpinned by a complex 
interplay of individual, family, community, economic and social factors. This requires 
recognizing that State responsibility to act with due diligence is both a systemic-level 
responsibility, i.e. the responsibility of States to create good and effective systems and 
structures that address the root causes and consequences of violence against women; and 
also an individual-level responsibility, i.e., the responsibility of States to provide each 
victim with effective measures of prevention, protection, punishment and reparation.  
</p>
<p>21. In his 2006 study (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1), the Secretary-General recalled that 
violence against women is a form of discrimination and a violation of human rights. He 
endorsed the principle of State responsibility to act with due diligence in the context of 
violence against women. In addition, resolutions on violence against women emanating 
from the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly have called upon States to 
exercise due diligence to prevent and investigate acts of violence against women and girls 
and punish the perpetrators.15 These resolutions broadly call upon the State to put in place 
civil and criminal measures to address offender accountability, to ensure victim safety and, 
importantly, to provide redress and justice measures that victims can access effectively. 
States are also urged to adopt laws, policies and programmes that recognize the 
consequences of multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination which lead to increased 
vulnerability for some categories of women.  
</p>
<p>22. One specific area in which the due diligence principle has been developed and 
applied to human rights violations is in the area of transnational corporations. In 2008, the 
Special Representative of the Secretary General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises issued a report entitled &#8220;Protect, 
Respect and Remedy: a Framework for Business and Human Rights&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5). This 
Framework is focused on States&#8217; &#8220;duty to protect&#8221; and transnational corporations&#8217; 
&#8220;responsibility to respect&#8221;. The duty to protect is a standard of conduct, not result, meaning 
that States are expected to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress 
abuse by private actors (A/64/216, para. 7). In 2011, the Special Representative presented 
to the Human Rights Council the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
(A/HRC/17/31, annex), which articulate foundational principles that clarify and expand on 
what is entailed by the State duty to protect and the corporate responsibility to respect. 
These Guiding Principles were endorsed by the Council in its resolution 17/4, and a 
Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises was established to, inter alia, promote their effective and 
comprehensive dissemination and implementation. There are four elements to human rights 
due diligence concerning transnational corporations: (a) identification and assessment of 
actual or potential adverse human rights impacts; (b) appropriate actions being taken based 
on information from the assessment; (c) tracking the effectiveness of the response; and (d) 
effective communication with relevant stakeholders concerning the response. These four 
</p>
<p>  
 15  See General Assembly resolutions 64/137 and 65/187, and Human Rights Council resolution 14/12. </p>


<p>elements could serve as a useful assessment tool in the violence against women sphere, 
whereby States can examine whether their responses are meeting the due diligence standard 
of responsibility and, more importantly, whether they are also effective in practice. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Existing normative standards   
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. International standards  
</b></p>
<p>23. Many human rights instruments, whether legally binding or &#8220;soft law&#8221;, include an 
interpretation and/or basic guiding elements in respect of the State responsibility to act with 
due diligence. Among others, these include: recognizing the problem; reviewing current 
policies to identify problem areas; modifying laws and policies to prevent harm or protect a 
right; punishing and/or rehabilitating the perpetrator; providing the victim with 
compensation and other remedial measures; reporting to an international body in respect of 
measures taken towards compliance; and, occasionally, monitoring cases and indicators to 
follow up and further modify policies. Reparation is a step in the process that is too often 
neglected, as confirmed in reports of the present mandate. Nevertheless, in general, a due 
diligence framework is clearly recognizable and coherent in both international and regional 
human rights instruments, with differing provisions that may impact the realization of the 
obligations of States parties.   
</p>
<p>24. As regards the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, article 2 refers to the obligation of States to pursue by all appropriate 
means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women. However, 
there is no specific provision pertaining to a State&#8217;s responsibility to act with due diligence 
in eliminating violence against women. In an attempt to address the defect, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women issued interpretative guidelines in the 
form of two general recommendations. General recommendation No. 12 (1989) highlights 
the obligation of States to protect women from violence in the family, workplace, or any 
other area of social life under articles 2, 5, 11, 12 and 16 of the Convention. In general 
recommendation No. 19 (1992), the Committee stated that &#8220;gender-based violence may 
breach specific provisions of the Convention, regardless of whether those provisions 
expressly mention violence&#8221; (para. 6). The Committee reiterated &#8220;that discrimination under 
the Convention is not restricted to action by or on behalf of Governments&#8221; and that &#8220;States 
may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence to prevent 
violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing 
compensation&#8221; (para. 9). Interpreting within specific articles in the Convention a 
cumulative prohibition on gender-based violence, the Committee recommended in its 
general recommendation No. 12 that States include in their periodic reports information 
concerning legislative and other measures in force to protect women from violence, the 
existence of support services for women, and statistical data on the prevalence of all forms 
of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>25. The same Committee reaffirmed the due diligence standard in 2007 through its 
consideration of two complaints which alleged a failure on the part of the State to 
investigate and prosecute acts of violence against women, in violation of articles 1, 2, 3 and 
5 of the Convention.16 In a dissenting opinion in an inadmissible communication, three 
members of the Committee made reference to the due diligence standard in a complaint 
against a State for its failure to grant an asylum petition, based on a claim of trafficking, in 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Banu Akbak et al</i>. v. <i>Austria</i>, views, 6 August 2007. </p>


<p>violation of article 6 of the Convention.17 It is argued that such decisions/opinions reflect 
that &#8220;a state may be liable under international law not only for its officials&#8217; actions but also 
</p>
<p>for its officials&#8217; inaction. It is unlawful for the state: to refrain from assistance where 
assistance is so clearly required; to fail to investigate and thereby guarantee women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights; and, to discriminate in the manner in which it enforces human rights (even where 
such discrimination is not intentional).&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>26. In 2010, the Committee provided further interpretive guidance on State 
responsibility with the addition of general recommendation No. 28 (2010). It broadly 
reframed the principle of State responsibility under the Convention as a legal obligation to 
respect, protect and fulfil women&#8217;s right to non-discrimination and to the enjoyment of 
equality.  
</p>
<p>27. In paragraph 18 of its general comment No. 2 (2007), the Committee against Torture 
argues that due diligence generally, and specifically as far as violence against women is 
concerned, occurs when State authorities or others acting in an official capacity or under 
colour of law, know or have reasonable ground to believe that acts of torture or ill-
treatment are being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials 
or private actors consistently with the Convention. It also argues that the State bears 
responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise 
responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible 
acts. Since the failure of the State to exercise due diligence to intervene to stop, sanction 
and provide remedies to victims of torture facilitates and enables non-State actors to 
commit acts impermissible under the Convention with impunity, the State&#8217;s indifference or 
</p>
<p>inaction provides a form of encouragement and/or de facto permission. The Committee has 
applied this principle to States parties&#8217; failure to prevent and protect victims from gender-
based violence, such as rape, domestic violence, female genital mutilation and trafficking. 
</p>
<p>28. The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women was adopted by the 
General Assembly in 1993. It reflects provisions found in Committee on the Elimination of 
Violence against Women general recommendation No. 19, but provides a more thorough 
and explicit statement on violence against women. The Declaration incorporates State 
responsibility to act within a due diligence standard, which requires States to &#8220;prevent, 
investigate and, in accordance with national legislation, punish acts of violence against 
women, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State or by private persons&#8221; (art. 4 
generally and 4 (c) specifically).  
</p>
<p>29. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action has a list of due diligence steps to 
be taken by States, including to: adopt and/or implement and periodically review and 
analyse legislation to ensure its effectiveness in eliminating violence against women, 
emphasizing the prevention of violence and the prosecution of offenders; and take measures 
to ensure the protection of women subjected to violence, access to just and effective 
remedies, including compensation and indemnification and healing of victims, and 
rehabilitation of perpetrators.19 
</p>
<p>30. In its resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council emphasized the responsibility of 
States to end impunity and hold accountable those responsible for war crimes concerning 
sexual and other types of violence against women. The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United

<p>Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, also places emphasis on due 
diligence. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2011, the General Assembly adopted resolution 65/228 on strengthening crime 
prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. In the resolution, the 
Assembly reaffirmed the 1997 Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination 
of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and 
adopted the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures, as developed by the 
Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The Model Strategies and Practical 
Measures are underpinned by notions of State responsibility to act with due diligence, and 
Member States are urged to be guided by the overall principle that effective crime 
prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women are human rights-
based, manage risk and promote victim safety and empowerment while ensuring offender 
accountability (para. 13 (a)). 
</p>
<p>32. The campaign of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;UNiTE to End Violence against 
Women&#8221; brings together a host of United Nations agencies and other partners to galvanize 
action across the United Nations system to respond to and prevent violence against women. 
UNiTE calls on governments, civil society, women&#8217;s organizations, young people, the 
private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing 
the global pandemic of violence against women and girls. UNiTE aims to achieve, by 2015, 
the following five goals in all countries: adopt and enforce national laws to address and 
punish all forms of violence against women and girls; adopt and implement multisectoral 
national action plans; strengthen data collection on the prevalence of violence against 
women and girls; increase public awareness and social mobilization; and address sexual 
violence in conflict.20 
</p>
<p>33. In 2010, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (now integrated into the 
United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-
Women)) produced the National Accountability Framework to End Violence against 
Women and Girls as a tool to assist Member States in their national-level efforts at 
monitoring laws, policies and programmes.21 This framework draws on and expands on 
many of the issues raised in the 1999 report of the first Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women. It includes a checklist of key elements for promoting national 
accountability to end violence against women. The 10 broad questions are:  
</p>
<p>(a) Are various forms of violence against women and girls addressed? 
</p>
<p>(b) Are data collection, analysis and dissemination systems in place? 
</p>
<p>(c) Do policies and programmes reflect a holistic, multisectoral approach? 
</p>
<p>(d) Are emergency &#8220;Frontline Services&#8221; available and accessible? 
</p>
<p>(e) Is national legislation adequate and aligned with human rights standards? 
</p>
<p>(f) Do decrees, regulations and protocols establish responsibilities and 
standards? 
</p>
<p>(g) Is there a National Action Plan and are key policies in place and under way? 
</p>
<p>(h) Are sufficient resources regularly provided to enforce laws and implement 
programmes?

<p><b> 2. Regional standards 
</b></p>
<p>34. In contrast to the international level, at the regional level, the development of 
specific legally binding instruments, or provisions in other instruments, as regards violence 
against women, has strengthened the existing human rights frameworks in the African, the 
Inter-American and the European human rights systems. These instruments include, among 
others, enforcement mechanisms, and emphasize the incorporation of the responsibility of 
the State to act with due diligence, as central components.  
</p>
<p>35. The 1994 Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and 
Eradication of Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;) represents a 
regional response to the call for the recognition of violence against women as a human 
rights issue and the need for stronger enforcement of human rights obligations in respect of 
women&#8217;s human rights. The Convention not only imposes a negative duty on States to 
</p>
<p>refrain from violating rights but also a positive obligation to prevent, investigate, punish, 
and provide a remedy.22 The State obligation to act with due diligence means that a State 
can be found liable for an illegal act, even when it is not an act perpetrated by the State, 
because of a failure to prevent the violation or to respond appropriately.23 
</p>
<p>36. The Bel&#233;m do Par&#225; Convention is the first human rights instrument on violence 
against women which incorporates the due diligence standard, with chapter III outlining the 
duties of States parties, including the obligation to apply due diligence to prevent, punish 
and eradicate violence against women. States parties must take legal measures to give effect 
to the objectives of the Convention. The obligations are listed but are not exhaustive, and 
they include obligations to address specific forms of violence, including harassment and 
customary practices that sustain violence against women. Article 7 calls on States to 
establish fair and effective legal procedures for victims, including timely hearings and 
access to restitution, reparations and other remedies.   
</p>
<p>37. The preamble of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating 
violence against women and domestic violence states that the State responsibility to act 
with due diligence is not an obligation of results, but an obligation of means. Parties are 
required to organize their response to all forms of violence covered by the scope of the 
Convention in a way that allows relevant authorities to diligently prevent, investigate, 
punish and provide reparation for such acts of violence. Article 5, paragraph 1, of the 
Convention addresses the State obligation to ensure that its authorities, officials, agents, 
institutions and others acting on behalf of the State refrain from acts of violence against 
women. Article 5, paragraph 2, sets out State parties&#8217; obligations to exercise due diligence 
in relation to acts perpetrated by non-State actors. In both cases, failure to do so will incur 
State responsibility.   
</p>
<p>38. The obligation to ensure civil law remedies is set out in article 29, paragraph 2 of the 
Council of Europe Convention. This provision allows victims to seek justice and 
compensation against State authorities, if they have failed in their duty to diligently take 
preventive and protective measures. Failure to comply with this obligation can result in 
legal responsibility and civil law remedies, including damages for negligent and gross 
negligent behaviour. The extent of State authorities&#8217; civil liability remains governed by the

<p>internal law of the parties and they have the discretion to decide what kind of negligent 
behaviour is actionable.24   
</p>
<p>39. The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of 
Women in Africa (the Maputo Protocol) entered into force in 2005. It draws heavily on 
international law instruments, particularly the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence 
against Women and the Beijing Declaration. The Protocol defines violence against women 
and creates a number of positive State obligations in the area of violence against women. 
Article 2 addresses the elimination of all forms of discrimination through appropriate 
legislative, institutional and regulatory measures. The due diligence standard is 
incorporated in several provisions, including in article 4, para. 2 (a), which calls on States 
to enact and enforce laws to prohibit all forms of violence against women, including 
unwanted or forced sex, whether the violence takes place in private or public. Article 4, 
para. 2 (b), broadly directs States to adopt any other measures necessary to ensure the 
prevention, punishment and eradication of all forms of violence against women.   
</p>
<p>40. Article 4, paragraph 2 (c) and (d), of the Protocol places a positive obligation on 
States to study the causes of violence and promote awareness and other measures to 
eliminate these causes, while paragraph 2 (i) calls on States to fund all appropriate 
measures. Paragraph 2 (e) and (f) refer to punishment and effective reparations. Article 25 
sets out the positive obligation of States to provide all appropriate remedies for women 
whose rights have been violated. Article 26 addresses implementation issues and calls on 
States to undertake all necessary measures, and notes in particular the necessity of funding 
and providing resources for effective implementation. The primary enforcement mechanism 
for the Protocol is through the reporting process to the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Analysis of information received  
</b></p>
<p>41. In continuity with the analysis already undertaken by the mandate over the past 19 
years, the current Special Rapporteur attempted, through an evidence-based approach to 
research and theoretical and practical knowledge, to analyse the extent to which States are 
fulfilling their responsibility to act with due diligence to eliminate violence against women. 
The research was conducted through a call for information to Member States and civil 
society organizations, and consultations in a few regions. The goal was to collect country 
experiences, from the perspective of both State and non-State actors, on the interpretation, 
application and effectiveness of the measures being taken by States in their efforts to 
eliminate violence against women.  
</p>
<p>42. Unfortunately, providing substantive findings and recommendations on 
interpretation, application and effectiveness of measures has been limited by a number of 
factors: there was a low response rate of both State and non-State sectors; the low response 
rate was further impacted by the quality of responses received; the mandate faced 
challenges due to the lack of resources for substantive and specialized empirical research 
and analysis; and the information gathered at regional consultations was impacted by 
resource and knowledge constraints. Furthermore, another barrier is the fact that there is no 
legally binding instrument under international law, specifically on violence against women, 
to effectively monitor State responsibility to act with due diligence in their efforts to 
respond to, prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>  
 24  Ad Hoc Committee on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence 
</p>
<p>(CAHVIO), Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic 
Violence: Draft Explanatory Memorandum, Strasbourg, 28 January 2011.  </p>


<p>43. Despite the existence of interpretative guidelines and monitoring on violence against 
women, through the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and 
universal periodic review processes, the limitations of a large and varied monitoring 
mandate, coupled with time constraints when examining State party reports, results in the 
insufficient interrogation of the information relating to violence against women, its causes 
and consequences, and the insufficient assessment of effective compliance with existing 
standards. Thus these challenges, among others, have an impact on assessing the efficacy of 
measures developed for addressing all forms of violence against women. The current 
reality, globally, is one where most Member States have acknowledged that violence 
against women is the most prevalent human rights violation facing countries, with 
spousal/partner violence as the most common manifestation of such violence. However, this 
acknowledgement has not led to the adoption of necessary solutions that are coherent and 
sustainable, and which would lead to elimination of all forms of violence against all 
women. In fact, the view from civil society is that the prevalence rates are increasing and 
also manifesting in new forms in many parts of the world. Also, that impunity for both 
perpetrators and State officials who fail to protect and prevent violence against women 
continues to be the norm.    
</p>
<p>44. Forty-three responses (22 per cent) were received from Member States25 and 17 
responses were received from civil society organizations. Approximately half the State 
responses directly addressed the issues raised in the call for information. All State 
responses reflect information on existing national laws, policies and plans; some responses 
refer to future initiatives at the national level; and some responses refer to State efforts 
outside of the national context. Less than 10 per cent of States articulate their responsibility 
to act with due diligence as emanating from legally binding international human rights law, 
despite the widespread ratification of treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also convened and/or participated in five regional 
consultations.26 The consultations gathered between 10 and 20 experts from within the 
region, and representatives of United Nations agencies were also invited to attend selected 
sessions. Participants were provided with a short submission prior to the meeting 
highlighting national approaches and challenges identified through a desk research process. 
</p>
<p>  
 25  The Special Rapporteur thanks the following Member States for responding to her call for 
</p>
<p>information: Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, Iran (Islamic Republic 
of), Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New 
Zealand, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, 
Suriname, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Togo, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, and Venezuela (Bolivian Republic of).  
</p>
<p> 26  The initial mapping exercise and research on State responsibility to act with due diligence was funded 
by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Further voluntary research was carried out by 
Jonathan Strug (University of Cape Town) and students in the International Human Rights Law Clinic 
at the University of Virginia, under the supervision of Deena Hurvitz. The Middle East and North 
Africa consultation was held in Tunisia, on 20 and 21 June 2012 (funded by the Government of the 
United Kingdom). The Central and South-Eastern Europe consultation was held in Slovakia on 9 and 
10 December 2012 (funded by UN-Women). The Pacific Islands consultation was held in Fiji on 27 
and 28 January 2013 (funded by UN-Women). The sub-Saharan Africa consultations, attended by the 
Special Rapporteur on violence against women, were hosted by different organizations and were held 
in South Africa on 8 and 9 December 2011 and in Uganda on 2 and 3 April 2012. The South Africa 
meeting was organized and funded by the African Network of Constitutional Lawyers, which is 
hosted by the Democratic Governance and Rights Unit, University of Cape Town. The Uganda 
meeting was hosted by the Uganda Association of Women Lawyers (FIDA Uganda) and the Centre 
for Applied Legal Studies, University of Witwatersrand. </p>


<p>The format of the consultations included a broad overview of the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on violence against women, and of the theme of the State responsibility to act 
with due diligence, a discussion on country case studies and, lastly, general discussions on 
the implementation of the due diligence standard in the participants&#8217; respective countries. 
Participants discussed legal, policy and institutional challenges at the national level in the 
application of the due diligence standard and the identification of good practices and 
lessons learned in different countries of the region. 
</p>
<p>46. To differing degrees, all State responses reflect a focus on legislative and policy 
developments. Highlighted below are a few areas as reflected in the responses received 
from States; some of the concerns articulated in civil society responses/contributions, as 
well as in the regional consultations; and information from country missions that the 
Special Rapporteur conducted. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legislation 
</b></p>
<p>47. States have amended or passed new laws at the criminal and civil law levels, either 
relating to gender equality in general with violence against women as one aspect, or 
specific laws on violence. The latter laws use a range of terminology and are applicable to 
family violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, trafficking, sexual violence, 
and female genital mutilation respectively. Most responses reflect developments in the 
sector of domestic violence, both civil and criminal law remedies, and trafficking. The 
trend towards gender neutrality in laws, as well as a shift in focus from violence against 
women specifically, is visible in developments in some countries. Also, law reform 
initiatives do not necessarily reflect international law developments, whether in respect of 
equality, non-discrimination, or bodily integrity rights, among others. Despite the existence 
of laws, reporting, prosecution and conviction rates remain low for acts of violence against 
women.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National strategies and action plans 
</b></p>
<p>48. The development of national strategies and action plans is also common across 
regions, with domestic violence and trafficking being the focus of most such measures. 
Some States lack a strategy or plan on violence against women, but have a strategy/plan on 
gender equality which includes violence against women. There is generally a lack of 
information and awareness on the importance of a holistic approach in respect of policy 
frameworks that address all forms of violence against women in an overarching manner, 
with specificity then emanating from the larger focus. Also, the achievement of 
complementary and mutually reinforcing protection and prevention measures, which take 
into account multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and the consequences 
thereof, are not reflected in such strategies and plans.  
</p>
<p>49. The lack of information on monitoring and evaluation processes and outcomes in 
respect of strategies/plans was the norm in State responses. Concerns by civil society 
organizations include: the existence of strategies without implementation plans; plans that 
do not set out the responsibility of different State agencies, benchmarks, timelines and 
budget allocations; the lack of adequate funding and specialized staffing for the 
implementation of such strategies and plans; the dependence on donors for funding for the 
implementation of plans; the lack of public education campaigns to generate information 
and knowledge about such strategies/plans; the lack of research on the effectiveness of such 
measures; and the lack of coherence and sustainability. While the Special Rapporteur 
encountered encouraging examples of joint protocols of action, referral systems and 
multidisciplinary mobile teams, adequate coordination among State service providers and 
between them and non-State services continues to be a main challenge. Also, the lack of </p>


<p>sensitivity and of a women&#8217;s rights perspective by these services often results in a lack of 
substantive protection for women victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Policing 
</b></p>
<p>50. The expansion of the role and/or powers of the police services is addressed in some 
responses received, including in relation to removal/exclusion of perpetrators and the 
issuing of police protection orders. Despite some positive developments, some of the main 
failures in the adequate protection of women victims of violence emerge in the initial 
response by authorities to an emergency call, and the police are often the first authority that 
women call on. There is no doubt that the manner in which police officers respond, their 
attitude toward victims and the protection they provide are a vital first step in ensuring 
victim safety and offender accountability. A common complaint made by both survivors 
and activists interviewed by the Special Rapporteur is that police often do not treat cases of 
violence against women with the same seriousness as other crimes, particularly when it is a 
case of partner/spousal violence. Another is that police often fail to respond to reports of 
private violence, and when they do respond, they do so inappropriately.  
</p>
<p>51. It is common for police officers to encourage informal resolution between the parties 
instead of arresting perpetrators, or they carry out dual arrests, by accusing victims of also 
behaving violently. Police officers sometimes allow their own personal gendered views to 
influence their decisions on whether to detain perpetrators or dismiss a case. In addition to 
lack of sensitivity and specialized gender training, police officers responses are also greatly 
limited in some cases simply by the lack of necessary resources to carry out their duties.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur interviewed police officers who have shared their frustration 
at being unable to assist women victims of violence due to a lack of basic resources, 
including vehicles or fuel in some instances. While in some countries specialized police 
units have been put in place to address domestic violence and/or sexual violence cases, and 
officers have undergone specialized training, these units are often understaffed and 
underresourced, and they are not available in all police stations or at all hours. The first 
responding officers end up being generalist police officers who have no specialized training 
on violence against women. Thus positive developments are being hampered by the lack of 
sufficient resources to provide specialist services on a full-time basis.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Prosecution and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>53. The expansion of power and discretion to prosecutors and judges, in addressing 
violence against women, is not necessarily accompanied by appropriate training on the 
issue or on how to effectively interpret and implement new laws. Furthermore, the 
investigation of cases and the sanctioning of perpetrators is underpinned by patriarchal 
notions linked to myths and stereotypes about women and men and their gendered roles. 
Prosecutors also often rely heavily on testimonies of victims and witnesses, rather than 
collecting the necessary evidence during the investigatory phase. This challenge is linked to 
the deficiencies in police investigation, in the first instance. Women victims often undergo 
criminal proceedings without adequate social, psychological and legal assistance and are at 
risk of re-victimization during these processes. While free legal aid is often available for 
victims, it is difficult to access, either because application forms are complicated, or due to 
low-income level requirements, or a lack of awareness about the availability of such 
assistance. 
</p>
<p>54. The challenges faced by women victims of violence are also reflected in the 
classification of crimes and charging patterns. This then affects which cases actually 
manage to get into the court system. With regard to spousal/partner/domestic violence, even 
in countries in which it is a criminal offence, such violence is often tried as a misdemeanor 
and treated in the same way as other minor offences. A common excuse for this is that these </p>


<p>&#8220;easier&#8221; cases will be processed and finalized more quickly. Although the misdemeanor 
</p>
<p>system is recognized to be faster than the general criminal justice system, the Special 
Rapporteur received reports indicating unacceptable delays in the issuing and execution of 
protective measures and also the completion of trials.  
</p>
<p>55. Courts rarely have the required levels of specialization in respect of violence against 
women cases. These cases are often decided without the best interest of women in mind, 
and without due consideration of the particular elements of gender inequality and 
discrimination rooted in such violence. It is common for only the most serious cases, that is, 
those that involve serious bodily harm, or death, to be identified as criminal offences. 
Judicial practices frequently do not reflect an understanding of the dynamics of domestic 
violence nor sensitivity to victims of long-term, repeated violence. Judges sometimes 
discredit victims&#8217; experiences, doubt the testimony of women who delay reporting the 
violence, or accuse them of lying in order to abuse the system or obtain financial gains or 
property. In addition, due to the allocation of minimum resources and personnel, the 
possibility of specialization by judges is impossible.  
</p>
<p>56. In some countries, judicial sentences focus on treatment for perpetrators rather than 
on the protection of victims. Psychosocial and addiction treatment programmes are ordered 
along with suspended sentences, even in high-risk cases in some instances. The Special 
Rapporteur heard testimonies of court decisions being influenced by patriarchal views 
among judges who feel that they need to be sensitive with men when deciding on a 
spousal/partner violence case, due to men&#8217;s roles as &#8220;breadwinners&#8221; and the need to take 
into account the financial support needs of the family. This is a consideration for some 
judges when they are deciding on whether to incarcerate a male perpetrator. However, these 
kinds of considerations or concerns regarding the offenders&#8217; family finances are not 
considered in cases involving drug offences, robbery or other crimes; which the criminal 
justice system apparently deems much more serious than violence against women crimes. 
These challenges indicate an urgent need for comprehensive judicial training on violence 
against women. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Social services 
</b></p>
<p>57. The provision of social services by State authorities is common to all regions, but 
there is no information on whether this is underpinned by human rights norms and 
standards, especially in respect of women&#8217;s rights to equality, non-discrimination and 
bodily integrity. The general consensus, in many regions, is that in cases relating to 
violence against women, a social welfare approach is the norm. In many country missions 
the Special Rapporteur witnessed how State-run services, particularly social services or 
&#8220;social-work centres&#8221;, often operate with an explicit focus on family reconciliation or 
reunification. In such countries, the norm is to resolve cases of partner/spousal/domestic 
violence through reconciliation and not through accountability measures, such as through 
prosecution and punishment of perpetrators. These institutions often show inadequate and 
inappropriate responses to the protection needs of women victims, with employees lacking 
understanding of the complex nature of abusive relationships and failing to respond 
adequately, sometimes to the point of jeopardizing victims&#8217; safety.  
</p>
<p>58. Employees have often not undergone any training on violence nor on risk-
assessment which would enable them to identify situations of risk in order to decide on 
suitable preventative measures to protect the victims of violence, if necessary. The focus on 
preserving the family unity results in employees advising the victims to return home to 
perpetrators, or warning them that they will be separated from their children should they go 
to a shelter. The priority given by such services to family reunification is worrying, as the 
mediation or reconciliation processes followed rarely acknowledge or have any 
methodology to address the power imbalances which exist between victims and abusers.  </p>


<p>59. The Special Rapporteur has also received information on how these social-work 
authorities sometimes facilitate family visits or even care of children by perpetrators, in 
cases in which no child abuse was reported. Thus, if a perpetrator is violent towards a 
woman, but not towards her children, he may still be deemed capable of caring for them 
and authorities will actually promote and facilitate continued contact between the 
perpetrator and the children. This practice has devastating consequences, as it minimizes 
not only the experiences of the battered victim, but also the negative consequences in 
respect of a child who may have been a witness to the abuse of the mother by the father.   
</p>
<p>60. In some countries these centres or social workers act as gatekeepers between victims 
and shelters, particularly NGO-run shelters which are funded by the State. Victims who 
reach out to the police or to shelters directly will usually need to be referred back to the 
social workers in order to be registered and approved for accommodation in a shelter. 
Onerous regulations of shelter access should not result in victims having to face 
unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy to access urgent and much needed services. While 
the monitoring and oversight of women&#8217;s shelters is important in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>appropriate standards, the Special Rapporteur believes that civil society organizations 
should continue to operate women&#8217;s protection centres/shelters independently. The mix of 
publicly and privately run shelters is in the best interests of women, and is indeed an 
international best practice.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Data collection 
</b></p>
<p>61. Information on data and recording systems was provided in some instances, but with 
no detail on how information is used to track trends and patterns and how it shapes laws, 
policies and programmes. The lack of monitoring and evaluation systems, which would 
include data collection and indicators, among others, does make it difficult to assess 
effectiveness and also the impact of measures and interventions adopted. Even in countries 
with statistical agencies, the lack of analytical disaggregated data on violence against 
women is a major source of concern to this mandate and also to relevant treaty bodies. 
Coherence and sustainability in data collection is essential for the effective development 
and implementation of laws, policies and programmes. It is also essential to include both 
quantitative data, to measure prevalence and forms, and qualitative data, to assess the 
efficacy of measures. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Cooperation with civil society  
</b></p>
<p>62. State responses also reflect the important collaboration and partnerships between the 
State and civil society organizations, in particular relating to legal and counselling service 
provision and shelter services. The information provided does not reflect the reality that 
civil society organizations carry the burden and costs of providing services in many 
instances; that some States impose burdensome regulations in respect of funding 
applications and reporting; that bias and preference does play a role in decisions on funding 
to civil society organizations; and that funding cuts (linked to austerity measures) are 
having a huge impact on service provision.  
</p>
<p>63. Furthermore, the shift in focus to men and boys is having a negative impact on 
holistic service provision to women and children; and men&#8217;s programmes are in fact 
competing for funds with established and experienced organizations that provide 
specialized services for women and children. Also, many of these new men&#8217;s programmes 
have not been assessed and evaluated for effectiveness &#8211; especially with respect to victim 
safety and offender accountability. There are views that the recent development towards a 
shift in focus and funding is a further indicator of the perpetuation of male privilege within 
already existing patriarchal societies. </p>


<p><b> 8. Awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>64. Awareness-raising programmes in the different sectors is a common feature of 
measures undertaken by Member States. The question of impact in respect of social 
transformation, empowerment of women, peer effects and behavioural changes is unclear 
from the submissions received. Also, it is unclear whether awareness-raising measures take 
into account and reflect the need for a more sustainable educative process. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Political obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>65. The challenges of political structures, whether federal systems or decentralization 
measures, do have an impact on law, policy and programmatic design, on the provision of 
financial support and service provision, and on responsibility and accountability, among 
other issues. Fragmentation, lack of coherence and consistency, and the possibility of 
politicization of issues is a reality in some contexts. This has an impact on State 
responsibility in the provision of substantive services in an equitable manner to all citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> 10. Failure to act with due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>66. Considering that the mandate&#8217;s request for information was on the responsibility of 
States to act with due diligence to eliminate violence against women &#8211; through the 
promotion of the right to a life free of violence; prevention, protection, investigation and 
punishment; and the provision of reparations &#8211; very little information was provided on the 
measures in place to address failure of State authorities to act with necessary due diligence 
in meeting these obligations. The enforcement of standards and sanctioning for non-
compliance is a reflection of the acceptance of a State of its responsibility to act with due 
diligence. The view of victims and civil society organizations is that impunity is the norm, 
both for non-State perpetrators of violence and for officials who either perpetrate violence 
and/or fail to protect and prevent violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Usage and/or value added of international standards and educative interventions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>materials and trainings 
</b></p>
<p>67. Considering the numerous documents generated through expert group consultations 
and access to technical cooperation, especially from United Nations and other international 
agencies on the issue of violence against women, it is a source of concern that there is no 
information on the usage and/or the value added by the generation of such standard-setting 
and educative interventions, materials and training. 
</p>
<p>68. Furthermore, a crucial point of reflection concerns the role of United Nations and 
other international agencies who are involved in formulating research reports, guidelines 
and other tools. The questions that come to mind include: What is their role and 
responsibility in follow-up work once they have generated relevant tools and other 
materials on standards, norms and best practices? Do these agencies have an obligation to 
conduct educative work in order to disseminate such materials? Do they have an obligation 
to monitor and assess the usage of such documents, including conducting research at the 
national level, to assess whether there are barriers to effective usage of such tools and 
standards? Do they have a role in conducting research on outcomes, through empirical 
research projects involving both State and non-State actors? Also, do they have a role in 
identifying best practices and disseminating such information generally and to Member 
States in particular?   </p>


<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> Despite numerous developments, violence against women remains endemic, and 
the lack of accountability for violations experienced by women is the rule rather than 
</b></p>
<p><b>the exception in many countries. Some challenges as regards State responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>include: lack of acceptance of violence against women as a human rights issue; 
</b></p>
<p><b>inadequate State responses; minimum effort to deal with the problem in a systematic, 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive and sustained manner; minimum time, effort and resources are 
</b></p>
<p><b>devoted to the problem; inadequate attention is devoted to investigating patterns, 
</b></p>
<p><b>causes and consequences of violence; where cases are reported, few perpetrators are 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecuted, and even fewer convicted; and sanctions often do not reflect the 
</b></p>
<p><b>seriousness of the crime perpetrated. Also there continues to be a lack of response to 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressing both individual and structural aspects of inequality and multiple and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersecting forms of discrimination, which are a cause and a consequence of violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> There is a need to create a framework for discussing the responsibility of States 
to act with due diligence, by separating the due diligence standard into two categories: 
</b></p>
<p><b>individual due diligence and systemic due diligence. This adaptation challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b>previous formulations of due diligence, which merged the obligations that States owe 
</b></p>
<p>to individual victims of violence with States&#8217; obligations to create a functioning system 
</p>
<p><b>to eliminate violence against women. Individual due diligence refers to the obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>States owe to particular individuals, or groups of individuals, to prevent, protect, 
</b></p>
<p><b>punish and provide effective remedies on a specific basis. Individual due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires flexibility, as procedures taken in these instances must reflect the needs and 
</b></p>
<p><b>preferences of the individuals harmed. States can fulfil the individual due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation of protection by providing a woman with services such as telephone 
</b></p>
<p><b>hotlines, health care, counselling centres, legal assistance, shelters, restraining orders 
</b></p>
<p><b>and financial aid. Education on protection measures and access to effective measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>can also help fulfil protection and prevention obligations that an individual is owed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the State. Individual due diligence places an obligation on the State to assist victims in 
</b></p>
<p><b>rebuilding their lives and moving forward, and can include monetary compensation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as assistance in relocating or in finding a job. Individual due diligence also 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires States to punish not just the perpetrators, but also those who fail in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>duty to respond to the violation. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Systemic due diligence refers to the obligations States must take to ensure a 
holistic and sustained model of prevention, protection, punishment and reparations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for acts of violence against women. At a systemic level, States can meet their 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility to protect, prevent and punish by, among other things, adopting or 
</b></p>
<p><b>modifying legislation; developing strategies, action plans and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p><b>campaigns and providing services; reinforcing the capacities and power of police, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutors and judges; adequately resourcing transformative change initiatives; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>holding accountable those who fail to protect and prevent, as well as those who 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrate violations of human rights of women. Also, States have to be involved more 
</b></p>
<p><b>concretely in overall societal transformation to address structural and systemic 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender inequality and discrimination.  
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> A general comprehensive system of protection and prevention must be 
established, and that system must be implemented in practice in a reasonable manner, </b></p>


<p><b>and be generally effective in individual cases.</b>27<b> The obligation is one of means and not 
</b></p>
<p><b>results, but it requires States to take reasonable measures that have a real prospect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>altering the outcome or mitigating the harm.</b>28<b> Ultimately, the general system and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>application to specific cases should have an adequate deterrent effect to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence against women. While due diligence does not require perfect deterrence in 
</b></p>
<p><b>fact in each case, it requires the State to act in a way to reasonably deter violence.</b>29 
<b>Due diligence will look to whether protective measures available in domestic law are 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate to respond to the situation, and whether they were employed.</b>30<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ultimately, </b>&#8220;<b>it is not the formal existence of judicial remedies that demonstrates due 
</b></p>
<p><b>diligence, but rather that they are available and effective</b>&#8221;<b>.</b>31<b> 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The State has an obligation to investigate all acts of violence against women, 
including systemic failures to prevent violence against women. Where a specific 
</b></p>
<p><b>incident of violence takes place in the context of a general pattern of violence against 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, there is a wider scope required to comply with the due diligence obligation.</b>32<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>The investigation should also be conducted with a gender perspective</b>33<b> and consider a 
</b></p>
<p>victim&#8217;s special vulnerability.34<b> The investigation element has two aims: to prevent 
</b></p>
<p><b>future repetition as well as to provide justice in individual cases. This should address 
</b></p>
<p><b>both State structures and the actions of the specific public officials involved.</b>35<b> Such an 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation must be impartial, serious and exhaustive and hold public officials 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountable either administratively, disciplinarily or criminally where the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p><b>is contravened.</b>36<b> The due diligence requirement is not limited to the way in which an 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation is conducted, but also encompasses a right for victims to access 
</b></p>
<p><b>information about the status of an investigation.</b>37<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> Due diligence requires the establishment of an independent and efficient 
judicial system.</b>38<b> In the partner/spousal violence context in particular, there is an 
</b></p>
<p><b>overlap between the prevention and punishment obligation. Because of the ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator, effective sanctions for past 
</b></p>
<p><b>violent conduct are necessary to prevent future conduct of a similar nature. Due 
</b></p>
<p><b>diligence requires that penalties for violence against women be sufficiently severe to 
</b></p>
<p><b>act as a deterrent to future conduct.</b>39<b> In addition, while a State retains a degree of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discretion to determine what criminal sanctions to impose, due diligence requires that 
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Women as well as the Inter-American System and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

<p><b>sanctions that are imposed to restrain and deter an offender (for example, psychiatric 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment) are actually enforced.</b>40<b> The failure of the judiciary to impose statutorily 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandated sanctions for specific offences can also contravene the due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligation.</b>41<b> Judicial proceedings aimed at preventing violence against women must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>finalized within a reasonable period of time.</b>42<b>  
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The due diligence standard requires that remedies not only formally exist, but 
that they are available and effective.</b>43<b> The due diligence obligation in respect of 
</b></p>
<p><b>remedies cannot be just about returning women to the situation they were in before 
</b></p>
<p><b>the individual instance of violence, but instead should strive to have a transformative 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential. This implies that remedies should aspire, to the extent possible, to subvert 
</b></p>
<p><b>instead of reinforce pre-existing patterns of cross-cutting structural subordination, 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender hierarchies, systemic marginalization and structural inequalities that may be 
</b></p>
<p><b>at the root cause of the violence that women experience. As the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>argued in her 2010 report, the notion of a right to reparation is located within the 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework of the law of remedies and can serve both individual and societal goals, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>underlying purposes of which include corrective justice, deterrence, retribution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>restorative justice (A/HRC/14/22, para. 12). Reparations should include a gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>perspective, more so when dealing with women victims of acts of discrimination and 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence, including in the spheres of satisfaction, rehabilitation, guarantees of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>repetition and compensation.</b>44<b>  
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The foundation for dealing with violence against women is laid down by the 
general principles that define the nature of human rights, i.e., universality, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inalienability, equality, non-discrimination, indivisibility, interdependence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>interrelatedness; and the principles related to the respect, protect and fulfil goals of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. Thus participation, inclusion, the rule of law, and accountability should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be core values underpinning the State</b>&#8217;<b>s response when it acts with due diligence to 
</b></p>
<p><b>meet its obligations to eliminate violence against women.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The State responsibility to act with due diligence must continue to evolve in a 
cumulative and inclusive approach. Relevant factors can include: measuring States</b>&#8217;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations and duties to prevent violence; ensuring both State and non-State actor 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability; and addressing root causes of violence and the sources of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination that intersect in the actual experiences of women. Eliminating violence 
</b></p>
<p><b>against women requires a multi-stakeholder approach to accountability that includes 
</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring State and non-State actors for compliance and including them as direct 
</b></p>
<p><b>duty bearers for prevention, protection and change. Human rights due diligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires an investigation and evaluation to assess whether universally accepted 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights principles apply in a S</b>tate&#8217;s own behaviour and in a <b>S</b>tate&#8217;s monitoring 
</p>
<p><b>of third party behaviour </b>&#8211;<b> be they individuals or organizations.
