<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human

</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In this document the Independent Expert reports on his sixth visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>from 11 to 24 February 2014. He presents an assessment of changes in the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in the country since his previous report, which followed his fifth visit to the 
</p>
<p>country from 14 to 23 October 2013 (A/HRC/25/73). The bulk of the report concerns a 
</p>
<p>proposed programme of action for addressing the needs of the victims of the Ivorian crisis, 
</p>
<p>which is the outcome of the international conference on the situation of victims of the 
</p>
<p>Ivorian crisis, organized in Abidjan from 12 to 14 February 2014 on the initiative of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert draws attention to the fact that the situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</p>
<p>is at a crossroads and is becoming ever more complex with the approach of the 2015 
</p>
<p>presidential elections. This complexity is compounded by a regional context that is still 
</p>
<p>fragile on account of the emerging conflicts. 
</p>
<p> In the report, the Independent Expert re-examines a number of constant concerns 
</p>
<p>connected, inter alia, with the increase in sexual violence, the persistence of the abuses 
</p>
<p>committed by the Forces r&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI) and the dozos, the 
</p>
<p>population&#8217;s socioeconomic circumstances and with concerns about freedom of expression 
</p>
<p>and association. The Independent Expert at one and the same time confirms the progress 
</p>
<p>made by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire towards consolidating the rule of law, while underscoring the major 
</p>
<p>challenges that still remain. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Late submission.

</p>
<p> This report by the Independent Expert is a plea for the situation of the victims to be 
</p>
<p>taken up as a national cause. The Independent Expert also recalls that the schedule of cases 
</p>
<p>before the courts is weighed down by the number and sensitive nature of the cases 
</p>
<p>outstanding. The looming 2015 presidential elections also require that human and material 
</p>
<p>resources be made available to the judicial system and that its work be speeded up. 
</p>
<p> This report will be updated when it is presented orally by the Independent Expert to 
</p>
<p>the twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in accordance with resolution 23/22 of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent Expert for one year 
</p>
<p>and requested him to submit a report at is twenty-fifth session and recommendations at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-sixth session. 
</p>
<p>2. This report covers the period between December 2013 and April 2014. It is based on 
</p>
<p>information gathered from government authorities, specialized United Nations agencies, 
</p>
<p>national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), political actors and 
</p>
<p>detainees. The Independent Expert wishes once again to express his gratitude to the 
</p>
<p>Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for facilitating his stay in the country and his meetings with 
</p>
<p>the national and local authorities. He met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of the 
</p>
<p>Economy and Finance, the Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Civil Liberties, the 
</p>
<p>Secretary of State and the Minister of the Interior and Security, the Minister of Higher 
</p>
<p>Education, the Minister for Solidarity, the Family, Women and Children, the Deputy 
</p>
<p>Minister of Defence and the Minister of Tourism. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert held meetings with the Army Chief of Staff, the chairperson 
</p>
<p>of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the attorney-general of the Abidjan 
</p>
<p>Court of Appeal, the district attorney of the Abidjan court of first instance, the Government 
</p>
<p>commissioner at the military court, the head of the Disarmament, Demobilization and 
</p>
<p>Reintegration Authority, the chairperson of the National Press Council and members of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission. 
</p>
<p>4. He also met with the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-
</p>
<p>General for C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and her deputies and members of the various components of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI). 
</p>
<p>5. He also held meetings with the country&#8217;s partners, including the United Nations 
</p>
<p>system and a number of diplomatic missions, such as those of Canada, the European Union, 
</p>
<p>France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of 
</p>
<p>America. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert wishes once again to express his gratitude to the chief of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Division of UNOCI and his team, whose support was instrumental in the 
</p>
<p>success of his mission and the preparation of this report. 
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert visited Simone Gbagbo in Odienn&#233; and Michel Gbagbo in 
</p>
<p>Abidjan. He travelled to the short-stay prison and correctional facility in Abidjan and the 
</p>
<p>National Surveillance Directorate. 
</p>
<p>8. He met with the leaders of political parties, including the Front Populaire Ivoirien 
</p>
<p>(FPI) (Ivorian Popular Front), the Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</p>
<p>(Republican Rally of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire), the Parti D&#233;mocratique de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (Democratic 
</p>
<p>Party of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire) and the party Libert&#233; et D&#233;mocratie pour la R&#233;publique (LIDER) 
</p>
<p>(Freedom and Democracy for the Republic). 
</p>
<p>9. He held meetings with a number of civil society organizations, including 
</p>
<p>organizations for the defence of women&#8217;s and victims&#8217; rights. In order to hear their views 
</p>
<p>and advice, he also met with civil society leaders, including Mr. Amara Essy, former 
</p>
<p>President of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and Mr. Bernard Dadi&#233;, a 
</p>
<p>distinguished Ivorian writer. </p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Elections 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert welcomed the adoption, on 9 April 2014, of a bill amending 
</p>
<p>Act No. 2001-634 of 9 October 2011 on the membership, organization, mandate and 
</p>
<p>operations of the Independent Electoral Commission. He believes that this reform should be 
</p>
<p>integrated into the national reconciliation and democracy building processes, through 
</p>
<p>consultations with political actors and civil society, with a view to increasing its credibility 
</p>
<p>and organizing peaceful and democratic elections. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Security 
</b></p>
<p>11. Notwithstanding the undeniable progress the Government has made in improving 
</p>
<p>security, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has seen a number of armed attacks over the past five months, 
</p>
<p>including one against the 16th district&#8217;s police station in December 2013 and against the 
</p>
<p>Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI) (Republican Forces of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire) in the 
</p>
<p>area of Grabo (68 km from Tabou) during the night of 22&#8211;23 February 2014. Incidents 
</p>
<p>involving dozos may have tapered off, but they have not completely stopped. The security 
</p>
<p>situation is further destabilized by the involvement in recent incidents of former soldiers 
</p>
<p>who have yet to be disarmed. 
</p>
<p>12. The Independent Expert particularly wishes to draw the authorities&#8217; attention to the 
</p>
<p>risk of land-related intercommunity tensions, such as the incident on 18 April 2014 in 
</p>
<p>Bouak&#233;, in which approximately 10 Fulani herdsmen were killed during an altercation with 
</p>
<p>the local communities of Koulakaha village that erupted after a Fulani herdsmen allegedly 
</p>
<p>killed a dozo on 6 April. 
</p>
<p>13. He noted with concern the information contained in the previous report of the Group 
</p>
<p>of Experts on C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, submitted under paragraph 19 of Security Council resolution 
</p>
<p>2101 (2013), concerning the involvement of former area commanders (&#8220;com&#8217;zones&#8221;) in 
</p>
<p>smuggling activities likely to foster insecurity.1 
</p>
<p><b> C. National reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Independent Expert noted that the pilot hearing phase of the Dialogue, Truth 
</p>
<p>and Reconciliation Commission, held from 27 February to 12 March 2014 in Bondoukou, 
</p>
<p>Yopougon II, Korhogo, Agboville, Adzop&#233;, Bouak&#233;, Du&#233;kou&#233; and Gagnoa, took place 
</p>
<p>without incident. He hopes that the lessons learned during the pilot phase will be put to use 
</p>
<p>in the national phase, and calls for greater awareness-raising and protection. He also calls 
</p>
<p>on all political actors to support the Commission&#8217;s efforts. 
</p>
<p>15. The Independent Expert warns against attempts to bring partisan rhetoric back into 
</p>
<p>universities, as demonstrated by the tensions that arose at Felix Houphou&#235;t-Boigny 
</p>
<p>University and Nangui Abrogoua University in Abidjan between the end of February and 
</p>
<p>early March 2014. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 S/2014/266, paras. 172 and 173. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional trends 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Independent Expert welcomes and supports the efforts to roll out the 
</p>
<p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, and especially the positive 
</p>
<p>developments such as the return of exiles, particularly military personnel who have 
</p>
<p>answered the Government&#8217;s invitation to return and are contributing towards national 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. In response to the rumours of corruption marring the programme, which the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert mentioned in his previous report (A/HRC/25/73, para. 31), the director 
</p>
<p>of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Authority described a number of 
</p>
<p>steps taken to make the process more reliable, including the expulsion and prosecution of 
</p>
<p>fraudsters. The urgency of supporting the programme is made starker still by the worrying 
</p>
<p>fact that former soldiers have allegedly been involved in recent acts of violence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Independent Expert strongly reiterates his call for the authorities to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the independence of the Commission and enable it better to fulfil its key mandate to protect 
</p>
<p>and promote human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in keeping with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Independent Expert repeats his call for a review of the provisions of the Code of 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure, in particular those whereby assize courts do not allow for appeals, 
</p>
<p>which are fundamental to the principle of effective remedy, as set forth in article 2, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>19. He welcomes the adoption of Decree No. 2013-915 of 30 December 2013 on the 
</p>
<p>special investigation unit, which is responsible for &#8220;investigations into offences committed 
</p>
<p>during the crisis that followed the 2010 presidential election&#8221;.2 He notes with interest the 
</p>
<p>changes made to the unit&#8217;s mandate, in particular the definition of its <i>rationae temporis</i> 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction as from the 2010 post-election crisis and no earlier. He hopes that these changes 
</p>
<p>will not unduly increase the prosecution&#8217;s caseload as it already has a backlog. The unit 
</p>
<p>remains insufficiently staffed and hiring commitments have yet to be honoured. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Persistent human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Independent Expert remains concerned at the prevalence of rape in the country 
</p>
<p>and regrets the fact that the justice system is not in a position to punish perpetrators as 
</p>
<p>severely as it should, many of whom, thanks to their status, have benefited from a climate 
</p>
<p>of impunity. He is further concerned at the practice, often by armed men, of extorting rape 
</p>
<p>victims and at the rape of girls and gang rape, such as in Aboisso, Bondoukou, Bouak&#233;, 
</p>
<p>Daloa, Daoukro, Divo, S&#233;gu&#233;la and Yamoussoukro. 
</p>
<p>21. The Independent Expert was informed of the case of a 35-year-old pregnant woman 
</p>
<p>who was brutally beaten by a police officer in Bouak&#233; on 11 April 2014. On 17 April, 
</p>
<p>UNOCI reported that seven women had been brutally beaten and had their lives threatened 
</p>
<p>during an eviction operation led by police officers and members of the Forces 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 <i>Journal officiel de la R&#233;publique de C&#244;te d</i>&#8217;<i>Ivoire</i>, No. 17, 31 December 2013. The Decree abrogates 
</p>
<p>the ministerial order of 24 June 2011 on the establishment of the special investigation unit whose 
</p>
<p>mandate had ended on 30 December 2013. </p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in Washington shantytown in the Cocody district of 
</p>
<p>Abidjan. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Torture 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Independent Expert was informed of acts of torture committed in various 
</p>
<p>detention centres, including beatings and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, at 
</p>
<p>the hands of members of the National Surveillance Directorate, the Operational Decisions 
</p>
<p>Coordination Centre and the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire.  
</p>
<p>23. On 1 January 2014, officers of the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire broke into 
</p>
<p>a man&#8217;s home in San P&#233;dro, arrested him and brutally beat the other four occupants of the 
</p>
<p>house, including a woman. The officers were arrested and released on 95,000 CFA francs 
</p>
<p>bail. Cases of ill-treatment by officers of the Forces, including extortion and death threats, 
</p>
<p>were also reported in the area of San P&#233;dro on 14 January. Some detainees arrested in 
</p>
<p>February for breach of State security and held at the short-stay prison and correctional 
</p>
<p>facility in Abidjan were allegedly beaten in the course of their arrest and during their stay at 
</p>
<p>the Forces camp in Grabo. The Human Rights Division of UNOCI observed that 15 of them 
</p>
<p>had severe injuries.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Situation of detainees 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert welcomes the country&#8217;s efforts to regularize the legal 
</p>
<p>situation of certain detainees. Over 1,000 prisoners were released under the presidential 
</p>
<p>pardon of August 2013. Several detainees close to former President Laurent Gbagbo, who 
</p>
<p>were imprisoned at the headquarters of the fourth infantry battalion of Korhogo (formerly 
</p>
<p>the Compagnie territoriale de Korhogo), were transferred to either the military short-stay 
</p>
<p>prison or the short-stay prison and correctional facility in Abidjan.3 
</p>
<p>25. Nevertheless, the Independent Expert remains concerned by the situation at the 
</p>
<p>short-stay prison and correctional facility in Abidjan, where banned objects and products, 
</p>
<p>such as knives, drugs and alcohol, can apparently be procured. In February 2014, during a 
</p>
<p>routine check by the country&#8217;s various security forces, a mutiny broke out, resulting in the 
</p>
<p>deaths of two inmates.  
</p>
<p>26. He wishes to express once again his grave concern for the persons detained by the 
</p>
<p>National Surveillance Directorate, sometimes in private buildings. He recalls that 
</p>
<p>incommunicado detention is incompatible with a democratic society governed by the rule 
</p>
<p>of law and that any prolonged detention by the Directorate that exceeds statutory limits is 
</p>
<p>unlawful and arbitrary. He also learned that in some cases, despite a duly signed judicial 
</p>
<p>authorization, Directorate agents decide on a discretionary basis whether or not to authorize 
</p>
<p>visits. 
</p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert is concerned at the situation of some 147 minors being held 
</p>
<p>in the same buildings as adults at the short-stay prison and correctional facility in Abidjan, 
</p>
<p>in flagrant violation of the relevant international norms. He is further concerned that a 
</p>
<p>certain number of people, including Simon Pierre Ehivet and Captain Antoine Kangbe, 
</p>
<p>whom he met at the facility, remain in detention. 
</p>
<p>28. On 14 February 2014, Michel Gbagbo was banned from leaving the country; the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert has taken note of the diverging views expressed by the parties in this 
</p>
<p>regard. The prosecution service justified the measure, stating that the defendant, having 
</p>
<p>chosen his domicile4 upon his release pending trial, required prior judicial authorization for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Ten of them have been tried and acquitted by the Abidjan Military Court. 
</p>
<p> 4 In accordance with article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p>any travel outside the country. The defence attorney pleaded that this formality was not 
</p>
<p>required under the law and that the defendant, having duly chosen his office as his 
</p>
<p>domicile, should have freedom of movement. The Independent Expert has been told of 
</p>
<p>cases of persons having been released pending trial who are authorized to travel outside the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p>29. Regarding the attempts by the judicial authorities to adjudicate the merits of Simone 
</p>
<p>Gbagbo&#8217;s case in Odienn&#233; from 4 to 6 February 2014, the Independent Expert regrets the 
</p>
<p>fact that only a token hearing took place given that the defendant requested <i>in limine litis 
</i></p>
<p>that her parliamentary immunity be waived before answering the prosecutor&#8217;s questions. He 
</p>
<p>is of the opinion that a just, fair and swift trial leading to definitive judicial decisions in the 
</p>
<p>cases of Michel and Simone Gbagbo could end the controversy surrounding their status. In 
</p>
<p>this connection, he recalls his recommendation regarding the need to combat impunity and 
</p>
<p>prosecute all those who have committed serious human rights violations (A/HRC/25/73, 
</p>
<p>para. 88 (a)). 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Freedom of expression and of assembly 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Independent Expert is concerned at a communication released on 11 April 2014 
</p>
<p>by the National Press Council whereby it decided to suspend the dailies <i>Aujourd</i>&#8217;<i>hui</i>, the 
</p>
<p><i>Quotidien d</i>&#8217;<i>Abidjan</i> and the <i>Temps</i> for 12 issues, the weekly <i>B&#244;l</i>&#8217;<i>Kotch</i> for 4 issues and the 
</p>
<p><i>Quotidien</i> for 3 issues, on the grounds that they infringed the Act of 14 December 2004, on 
</p>
<p>the legal status of the press, and the national journalists&#8217; code of conduct. He laments the 
</p>
<p>fact that all the publications concerned are aligned with the opposition. He also urges 
</p>
<p>journalists to be mindful of the profession&#8217;s code of ethics in their treatment of information. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that leaders of the Front Populaire 
</p>
<p>Ivoirien have been able to tour the country. However, the ban on their rallies in Oum&#233;, 
</p>
<p>Bouna and Abobo could compromise the authorities&#8217; ability to guarantee the security and 
</p>
<p>free movement of political leaders nationwide. 
</p>
<p>32. He regrets the fact that, on 27 February 2014, security forces prohibited, with no 
</p>
<p>legal basis, a seminar of the Ivorian Civil Society Federation in Abidjan. On 7 March, he 
</p>
<p>called on the authorities to take the necessary steps to enable human rights organizations in 
</p>
<p>general, and the Federation in particular, fully to play their part and contribute to 
</p>
<p>consolidating progress in the country.5 He welcomes the attendance of the Ministry of the 
</p>

<p>33. The Independent Expert is concerned by the situation of Alternative, an NGO that 
</p>
<p>works to protect persons living with HIV/AIDS and homosexuals and whose premises and 
</p>
<p>staff in a neighbourhood of Abidjan were attacked between December 2013 and January 
</p>
<p>2014. He regrets the absence of an adequate reaction from the authorities to uphold the 
</p>
<p>rights of this NGO. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Situation of exiles 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Independent Expert welcomes the Government&#8217;s ongoing efforts to encourage 
</p>
<p>the gradual return of exiles, including soldiers and militia members. He recalls that this 
</p>
<p>initiative should go hand in hand with withdrawal from returnees&#8217; homes and their return to 
</p>
<p>work. 
</p>
<p>35. Furthermore, the Independent Expert was informed that on 17 February 2014, a 
</p>
<p>group of 21 refugees from Little Webbo camp in Liberia were arrested by the Liberian

<p>authorities and forcibly transferred to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for allegedly taking part in attacks 
</p>
<p>against security forces. Six of them were released after a preliminary hearing. Some stated 
</p>
<p>that they had been mistreated by Liberian law enforcement officers. The Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert insists on the principle of voluntary return and is concerned at the way in which this 
</p>
<p>operation was carried out. If these facts are corroborated, he calls on Liberia and C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire, pursuant to their partnership in security matters, better to honour their 
</p>
<p>commitments under international refugee law. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Economic and social rights 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Prime Minister informed the Independent Expert of the State&#8217;s investment in the 
</p>
<p>social sector, including the opening of approximately 36,000 classrooms, the targeted 
</p>
<p>assistance programme in the health sector, the building of over 100,000 social housing 
</p>
<p>units, the construction of bridges and roads, the raising of wages and support for the 
</p>
<p>national agricultural investment programme. According to the Prime Minister, the best way 
</p>
<p>of improving Ivorians&#8217; quality of life is to create wealth through growth. 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert welcomes the decision, on 6 March 2014, to adopt a law on 
</p>
<p>universal medical insurance and invites the authorities to take specific steps to put the law 
</p>
<p>into effect. 
</p>
<p>38. Trade unions have reported that public sector employees have been dismissed 
</p>
<p>without the benefit of redundancy programmes. The Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</p>
<p>continue to occupy the headquarters of the Federation of Autonomous Trade Unions of 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The Independent Expert encourages the State to ensure a balanced dialogue 
</p>
<p>between the Government, employers and trade unions for the country&#8217;s long-term 
</p>
<p>prosperity. 
</p>
<p>39. He draws the authorities&#8217; attention to the fate of street children, known as &#8220;germ 
</p>
<p>children&#8221;, especially in the Abobo neighbourhood of Abidjan, who are the product of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s difficult socioeconomic circumstances. They are both the perpetrators and victims 
</p>
<p>of serious acts of violence. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Cooperation with the international community 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Independent Expert draws the attention of senior United Nations officials to the 
</p>
<p>importance of not withdrawing ONUCI forces too soon, given the fragile situation in the 
</p>
<p>lead-up to the 2015 elections. 
</p>
<p>41. He has taken note of Security Council resolution 2153 (2014), in which it voted to 
</p>
<p>relax the sanctions against C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, including the weapons embargo. 
</p>
<p>42. He commends the Government for authorizing the visits of the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence and of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and 
</p>
<p>impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>43. He has taken note of the fact that Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233; was transferred to The Hague 
</p>
<p>on 22 March 2014 at the behest of the International Criminal Court. He once again urges 
</p>
<p>the Court to bring to justice all those who committed serious human rights violations in 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire during the post-election crisis. </p>

</p>
<p><b> III. Proposed programme of action for assistance to victims of the 
Ivorian crisis 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>44. In order to promote victim-centred national reconciliation and efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>impunity, the Independent Expert organized an international conference on the situation of 
</p>
<p>the victims of the Ivorian crisis, held in Abidjan from 12 to 14 February 2014. Amid 
</p>
<p>political polarization and a stalled political dialogue, the conference addressed the urgent 
</p>
<p>need to highlight the situation of victims as a national cause that transcends the political and 
</p>
<p>partisan divides that have long fuelled the Ivorian crisis. The goal was to remove the cloak 
</p>
<p>of invisibility and silence from victims and to give the various actors of the crisis &#8212; 
</p>
<p>including political parties and civil society &#8212; the opportunity to share their solutions to the 
</p>
<p>situation of victims. Through a comparative approach, participants also learned about 
</p>
<p>victim assistance policies that have been used in other African and South American 
</p>
<p>countries that have experienced similar crises. 
</p>
<p>45. The event followed the conference on impunity and equitable justice in C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire, held at the initiative of the Independent Expert in Yamoussoukro in February 
</p>
<p>2013. In his report to the Human Rights Council following the conference, he 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission &#8220;[e]mphasize the 
</p>
<p>central importance of victims&#8217; situation and expectations and encourage the provision of 
</p>
<p>material, social, psychological, medical and legal support for them&#8221; (A/HRC/23/38, para. 
</p>
<p>88 (g)). Thus, the conference on the situation of the victims of the Ivorian crisis fulfilled 
</p>
<p>many of the earlier recommendations made by the 2004 and 2011 international 
</p>
<p>commissions of inquiry and by the Independent Expert himself. 
</p>
<p>46. Various State entities took part in the conference, including the Office of the 
</p>
<p>President, the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Education and Technical 
</p>
<p>Education, the Ministry for Solidarity, the Family, Women and Children, the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice, Human Rights and Civil Liberties, the Ministry of Planning and Development, the 
</p>
<p>Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the National Human Rights Commission, 
</p>
<p>the special investigation unit, members of the judiciary, the Disarmament, Demobilization 
</p>
<p>and Reintegration Authority, the National Programme for Social Cohesion, the Solidarity 
</p>
<p>and Social Cohesion Observatory and the Directorate for War Victims. The conference also 
</p>
<p>brought together representatives of political parties (Front Populaire Ivoirien, Libert&#233; et 
</p>
<p>D&#233;mocratie pour la R&#233;publique and Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire), 
</p>
<p>civil society, international organizations, United Nations institutions and international 
</p>
<p>experts. Victims&#8217; associations actively guided and informed the discussions. 
</p>
<p>47. The speakers analysed the situation of victims, assessed State efforts and suggested 
</p>
<p>possible solutions, providing the Independent Expert with a basis from which he was able 
</p>
<p>to put forward a series of recommendations to inform and promote a national assistance 
</p>
<p>programme for victims of the crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ethical and legal basis for providing victims with reparation 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Ethical basis 
</b></p>
<p>48. It is the State&#8217;s duty to ensure that all perpetrators of human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed in its territory are brought to justice. Its sovereignty is closely linked to its 
</p>
<p>ability to institute the rule of law, grounded partly in an effective, fair and impartial justice 
</p>
<p>system. State responsibility in terms of the reparation of human rights violations is based on </p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>objective criteria regarding both those who wield public authority and the victims. Its 
</p>
<p>responsibility includes reparation of the harm suffered by all victims. Accordingly, the 
</p>
<p>main duty of the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is to support the victims of the long crisis 
</p>
<p>that undermined the country, irrespective of their political affiliation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal basis 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Constitution safeguards human dignity, respect and protection of fundamental 
</p>
<p>liberties, the inviolability of human rights (art. 2) and the right of all individuals to free and 
</p>
<p>equal access to justice (art. 20). Although national law does not define the notion of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;victim&#8221;, the Code of Criminal Procedure sets forth the conditions for bringing a civil suit, 
</p>
<p>which is the basis for victim status and rights under national criminal law.6 
</p>
<p>50. The Constitution recognizes duly ratified international treaties and agreements as 
</p>
<p>being legally binding. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has ratified a number of international conventions on 
</p>
<p>the State&#8217;s duty regarding reparation for victims of human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law violations, including the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination, in 1973; the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 
</p>
<p>1991; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on 
</p>
<p>Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, in 1992; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
</p>
<p>Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, in 1995; and the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court, in 2013. The Independent Expert draws attention to General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution 40/34 on the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of 
</p>
<p>Crime and Abuse of Power and resolution 60/147 on the Basic Principles and Guidelines on 
</p>
<p>the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Situation of the victims of the crisis 
</b></p>
<p>51. Since the end of the post-election crisis, victims have repeatedly expressed their 
</p>
<p>frustration with the sluggishness of judicial proceedings to obtain reparation. The human 
</p>
<p>rights violations they suffered are perpetuated by the impunity of the alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>and the failure to bring them to justice. The victims continue to suffer from the physical and 
</p>
<p>mental pain and considerable material and financial loss they incurred. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Material and personal harm 
</b></p>
<p>52. This loss and pain includes over 3,000 dead,7 physical/bodily injuries (e.g. torture, 
</p>
<p>abrasions, deep wounds, broken bones, severe burns), social damage (e.g. family 
</p>
<p>dislocation, social divides, deep divisions in some communities) and a profound sense of 
</p>
<p>solitude, injustice, vulnerability and helplessness. The crisis also caused material and 
</p>
<p>financial losses (such as the destruction, theft or confiscation of material and financial 
</p>
<p>goods); massive population displacement; the destruction of homes, sometimes of entire 
</p>
<p>villages, especially in the west; the loss of livelihoods and means of production for rural 
</p>
<p>populations who fled their villages; and limited access to basic social services, which were 
</p>
<p>already unreliable before the crisis. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 Article 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: &#8220;A civil action to seek redress for harm 
</p>
<p>caused by a crime, offence or misdemeanour may be brought by anyone who has suffered personally 
</p>
<p>from the harm directly caused by the offending act.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 7 See the national commission of inquiry, &#8220;Report of the inquiry into the violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law during the period 31 October 2010 to 15 May 2011&#8221;, July 2012, p. 12. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Impact of the crisis on the most underprivileged population groups 
</b></p>
<p>53. The heaviest burden of the Ivorian crisis over the past 10 years has been borne by 
</p>
<p>marginalized social classes, in particular those living in low-income neighbourhoods in 
</p>
<p>cities, towns and villages across the country, especially in Yopougon, the south-west and 
</p>
<p>west. They have seen their houses destroyed, their wives and daughters raped and their 
</p>
<p>husbands killed, tortured or imprisoned. For more than 10 years &#8212; although a large number 
</p>
<p>of them have been direct victims &#8212; the social and political elites have often managed to 
</p>
<p>lessen, at least for themselves, the effects of the cyclical crises that have beset C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire, either by going into exile or by obtaining amnesties through political wrangling.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. The mental state of victims 
</b></p>
<p>54. The psychological harm caused by the Ivorian crisis includes loss of self-esteem, 
</p>
<p>loss of identity and values and the feeling of helplessness, which can lead to indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>hatred, blind impulses to seek revenge and even suicide. Many victims suffered, and 
</p>
<p>continue to suffer, post-traumatic stress disorder owing to the various forms of violence to 
</p>
<p>which they were exposed, such as murder, torture, rape, humiliation and disappearance. 
</p>
<p>Doubts as to the outcome of the legal proceedings under way cause a sense of helplessness 
</p>
<p>that locks victims in their situation, removes them from society, prevents them from having 
</p>
<p>faith in the justice system and the law and robs them of the ability to be full citizens and 
</p>
<p>thereby build their personal and social resilience.8 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Impact of the crisis on the situation of children 
</b></p>
<p>55. Children have experienced repeated trauma as a result of the violence they suffered 
</p>
<p>and the numerous horrific events they witnessed. Worse still, they themselves were often 
</p>
<p>forced to perpetrate acts of violence. Their parents&#8217; and relatives&#8217; suffering, compounded 
</p>
<p>by their own anguish, has &#8220;robbed them of part of their childhood&#8221;.9 Many had to interrupt 
</p>
<p>their studies because of attacks on their schools or teachers&#8217; flight. Some suffered sexual 
</p>
<p>violence while others were denied access to hospitals and humanitarian aid.10 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Specific situation of women 
</b></p>
<p>56. The physical, material, social and economic impact of the crisis is particularly 
</p>
<p>severe and long-lasting for women. The socioeconomic situation of girls and women is 
</p>
<p>weakened, making them even more vulnerable in a country that has not been immune to the 
</p>
<p>feminization of poverty that has affected the entire subregion. Thousands of women who 
</p>
<p>were in the informal sector (crafts, small-scale retail, etc.) were forced to flee their homes 
</p>
<p>and abandon their work. UN-Women has drawn attention to heightened gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, including many rape cases. Many victims of sexual violence were unable to file 
</p>
<p>complaints and received neither medical nor psychological care because of cultural 
</p>
<p>attitudes characterized by shame and social rejection.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Actions on behalf of victims 
</b></p>
<p>57. Measures on behalf of victims can be taken by either State or non-State actors.

</b></p>
<p><b> 1. State efforts 
</b></p>
<p>58. In the wake of the crisis, the Government established a series of mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>provide victims with assistance, including the Directorate for War Victims, the post-conflict 
</p>
<p>assistance project, the National Programme for Social Cohesion, the Solidarity and Social 
</p>
<p>Cohesion Observatory, the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission, the special investigation unit and the National Commission of 
</p>
<p>Inquiry. These mechanisms and institutions, which are described in the detail below, are 
</p>
<p>entirely dedicated to victims. 
</p>
<p>59. The Directorate for War Victims is attached to the Ministry for Solidarity, the 
</p>
<p>Family, Women and Children and is responsible for identifying and assisting &#8220;war 
</p>
<p>victims&#8221;. Since it was set up, it has helped to resettle internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>immediately after the crisis (May 2011) and has raised awareness of voluntary return, 
</p>
<p>provided subsidies, distributed food kits to displaced persons and financed the creation of 
</p>
<p>income-generating activities. The Directorate has also conducted a census of war victims,11 
</p>
<p>provided psychological and medical care to 143 victims, supported victims of gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence, awarded 200 scholarships and provided legal assistance to victims. In addition, 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Education and Technical Education has ensured that child victims receive 
</p>
<p>an education. 
</p>
<p>60. The post-conflict assistance project, set up in 2007, is financed by the World Bank 
</p>
<p>and headed by the Office of the Prime Minister. Its mission is to enhance employment 
</p>
<p>opportunities and access to social services for the communities and individuals affected by 
</p>
<p>the conflict. Efforts already under way include quick-impact income-generating activities, 
</p>
<p>the construction and refurbishment of infrastructure in the departments of Du&#233;kou&#233;, Guiglo, 
</p>
<p>Tai, Blol&#233;quin, Toul&#233;pleu and Soubr&#233;. The project has helped selected communities to 
</p>
<p>establish some 131 &#8220;Peace Committees&#8221; for conflict prevention and management. It has 
</p>
<p>funded a training and settlement programme for 1,000 young people in Du&#233;kou&#233;, Bangolo 
</p>
<p>and Guiglo in the areas of agriculture, herding, trade and services as well as an emergency 
</p>
<p>return project for internally displaced persons in five villages in Du&#233;kou&#233;. 
</p>
<p>61. The National Programme for Social Cohesion is an interministerial programme to 
</p>
<p>mend the social fabric, foster coexistence, create the conditions for durable social peace and 
</p>
<p>resolve the major problems that jeopardize national cohesion. Since its establishment, the 
</p>
<p>programme has been working to set up a framework for exchange and collaboration with 
</p>
<p>victims&#8217; associations as well as community and intercommunity counselling services for the 
</p>
<p>population of Anonkoua-Kout&#233;, Angbovia and Bocanda. It is also implementing an 
</p>
<p>agreement with the Directorate-General for Employment regarding the social and 
</p>
<p>professional reintegration of vulnerable groups, the reception of returning refugees, the 
</p>
<p>development of economic projects to provide employment for voluntary repatriates and the 
</p>
<p>design, with UNOCI, of projects to refurbish community infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>62. The Solidarity and Social Cohesion Observatory works to strengthen solidarity and 
</p>
<p>social cohesion by developing early warning mechanisms and decision-making tools. 
</p>
<p>Headed by the Ministry for Solidarity, the Family, Women and Children, the Observatory&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>mission includes defining and updating solidarity and social cohesion indicators, taking 
</p>
<p>steps to promote and protect solidarity and social cohesion, conducting research and 
</p>
<p>assessing relevant national policies and programmes. Its activities include strengthening the 
</p>
<p>operational capacity of relevant government bodies and guiding the formulation of the 
</p>
<p>national solidarity and social cohesion policy. The policy will catalogue the harm suffered 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 In March 2013, their number stood at 70,000. See international conference on the situation of the 
</p>
<p>victims of the Ivorian crisis, Abidjan, 12&#8210;14 February 2014, presentation by the Directorate for War

</p>
<p>and design and implement policies and mechanisms for reparation, early warning and the 
</p>
<p>refurbishment of basic social and economic infrastructure. 
</p>
<p>63. The Presidential Emergency Programme intervenes in emergency situations rapidly 
</p>
<p>to restore specific public services to minimal levels and swiftly meet the basic needs of the 
</p>
<p>affected population. 
</p>
<p>64. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission has, after holding national 
</p>
<p>consultations from 1 January to 28 February 2013, entered the quantitative phase of its 
</p>
<p>mandate and surveyed 48,561 individuals between 21 August and 21 September 2013. 
</p>
<p>Nearly 30,000 people took part in an inclusive and interactive dialogue during the 
</p>
<p>qualitative phase. Ivorians were thus able to express their views on this initial phase. Those 
</p>
<p>surveyed were able to comment on what types of violations should be included and what 
</p>
<p>forms reparation should take. The next steps will be crucial to the Commission&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>consideration of the situation of victims and will consist of counselling for victims, 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising, investigations and public hearings.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Efforts by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>65. In order to assist women victims of the crisis, UN-Women, the International Rescue 
</p>
<p>Committee, the Association des Femmes Juristes de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (the Association of 
</p>
<p>Women Lawyers of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire) and the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding &#8211; C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire, with the support of the European Union, have launched a project to restore the 
</p>
<p>rights of women victims of sexual violence committed during the post-election crisis with a 
</p>
<p>view to ensuring that 70 victims who have not received any assistance are provided with 
</p>
<p>medical, psychosocial and legal support. Thanks to the project, these women have received 
</p>
<p>legal and psychological assistance. Five &#8220;peace huts&#8221; have been set up in Abobo, 
</p>
<p>Yopougon, Du&#233;kou&#233;, Danan&#233; and Man, where the population can learn about gender-based 
</p>
<p>violence and women&#8217;s rights. Two projects for the economic empowerment of women are 
</p>
<p>under way in these areas, benefiting 800 women, including victims of violence, war 
</p>
<p>widows, female heads of households, displaced women and returnees. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Barriers to reparation for victims 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Dispersal of State resources for victim assistance 
</b></p>
<p>66. The various statements and presentations made during the February 2014 
</p>
<p>international conference revealed that State expenditure on victims is widely dispersed. 
</p>
<p>More than six public institutions overlap in this area and their efforts do not necessarily 
</p>
<p>match victims&#8217; expectations. The competitiveness stemming from their various 
</p>
<p>responsibilities potentially hinders and dilutes their efforts, whereas a balanced policy, 
</p>
<p>carefully crafted and coordinated by a central body, would have enabled the State to 
</p>
<p>rationalize its already meagre resources and ensure that its efforts had a greater impact. The 
</p>
<p>various statements made by the institutions responsible for victims also revealed the 
</p>
<p>absence of institutional partnership which would allow them to draw on each other&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>mandates and activities in order to build greater synergy. The multiplicity of bodies 
</p>
<p>confuses and discourages victims, who are faced with several points of contact and multiple 
</p>
<p>registration systems. 
</p>
<p>67. Furthermore, the various State and non-State projects do not always have a 
</p>
<p>noticeable impact because they are sporadic and fragmented. Hence the need for an 
</p>

</p>

</b></p>
<p>actors of economic reconstruction and to rebuild their trust in the State. The State would 
</p>
<p>then be in a position to credibly shoulder its key responsibility towards victims. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Persistence of impunity 
</b></p>
<p>68. Obtaining justice for the victims of the Ivorian crisis is one of the driving forces of 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. Despite the establishment of the National Commission of Inquiry, the 
</p>
<p>publication of its report and the establishment of the special investigation unit, the 
</p>
<p>impression of impunity remains palpable. Notwithstanding repeated commitments by the 
</p>
<p>political authorities and the clear readiness of justice officials, the issues of impunity and 
</p>
<p>equitable justice remain unresolved. Very few proceedings have been brought against the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of violence during the post-election crisis. To date, only those closest to the 
</p>
<p>former regime have been prosecuted. The situation is partly to blame for stalling national 
</p>
<p>reconciliation and undermines trust in the restored justice system. The fact that alleged 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of human rights violations have recently been released pending trial makes it 
</p>
<p>unlikely that any precise dates will be set for their trials and could be construed as a de 
</p>
<p>facto amnesty. The participants in the 2013 conference on impunity and equitable justice 
</p>
<p>recalled that the amnesties granted to those who had committed violent acts between 2002 
</p>
<p>and 2010 yielded nothing more than tenuous political accords that not only failed to prevent 
</p>
<p>renewed violence but also fuelled a culture of impunity and exacerbated the crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Absence of victim protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>69. Legal proceedings against the perpetrators of serious human rights violations in the 
</p>
<p>aftermath of the 2010 elections should go hand in hand with special protection measures for 
</p>
<p>victims, witnesses and other persons concerned, including judges. The latter&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>independence cannot be guaranteed because of the threats to their careers and persons. 
</p>
<p>Victims&#8217; fear of filing a complaint against the alleged offenders, several of whom work in 
</p>
<p>law enforcement agencies, is compounded by the lack of information on the bodies to 
</p>
<p>whose attention cases should be brought in order to obtain justice and reparation. Speeding 
</p>
<p>up the adoption of the bill on the protection of victims and other persons concerned is 
</p>
<p>therefore crucial. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Fragility of the legal system 
</b></p>
<p>70. The legal system, which has been rebuilt despite a long history of legal vacuum, is 
</p>
<p>nonetheless undermined by several factors. The independence of the judiciary needs to be 
</p>
<p>strengthened, given the culture of political control over the justice system that prevails in 
</p>
<p>post-crisis situations in Africa. The credibility of the national legal system also poses a 
</p>
<p>significant challenge, owing to the pressure exerted by its international counterpart with 
</p>
<p>regard to the frequent allegations of crimes against humanity made throughout the Ivorian 
</p>
<p>crisis. The fact that the courts have ordered the release pending trial of many detainees held 
</p>
<p>in relation to the post-election crisis is symptomatic of a system keen to address the issue of 
</p>
<p>prolonged detention without trial. However, this measure also reflects the complexity of the 
</p>
<p>legal stakes for the victims of the Ivorian crisis: victims who self-identified as having been 
</p>
<p>close to the former regime welcomed the releases, while other victims interpreted them as a 
</p>
<p>sign that the State was more interested in the fate of the &#8220;persecutors&#8221; than in that of the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;real victims&#8221;. The conference provided an opportunity for victims&#8217; representatives to vent 
</p>
<p>their frustration at the authorities. 
</p>
<p>71. During the national consultations led by the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission, 72 per cent of respondents stated that the justice system could not be trusted 
</p>
<p>&#8212; a figure that reflects a troubling perception that could erode faith in the courts &#8212; as a 
</p>
<p>guarantor of the rule of law in the future. In a democracy, justice is the last defence against 
</p>
<p>the loss of the belief that republican ethics transcend all individual and partisan interests. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Weak commitment by political actors 
</b></p>
<p>72. The national political discourse, which is increasingly characterized by partisan 
</p>
<p>invectives and power struggles, reveals that the situation of victims is not yet seen as 
</p>
<p>central to the national reconciliation process. The 2014 conference demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>political actors take a broadly politicized stance towards the situation of victims. It is 
</p>
<p>therefore urgent to turn the situation of victims into a national cause, drawing on three 
</p>
<p>elements that underpin a robust national reconciliation process: national solidarity, a 
</p>
<p>national policy that includes all victims without political, ethnic or religious distinction and 
</p>
<p>a comprehensive approach that addresses every aspect (social, medical, material, 
</p>
<p>educational and psychological) of victims&#8217; suffering. The goal is to transform the situation 
</p>
<p>of victims into the driving force of a national catharsis in order to resolve the root causes of 
</p>
<p>the crisis and give renewed meaning and substance to the battered humanity of the Ivorian 
</p>
<p>people.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Guiding principles of an effective reparation policy 
</b></p>
<p>73. The provision of reparation for the victims of the Ivorian crisis requires an 
</p>
<p>operational framework that legitimizes, structures and maximizes the efforts of the State 
</p>
<p>and other relevant partners. The suggested reference document is based on the Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
</p>
<p>Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Law, set forth in resolution 2005/35 of the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and reproduced in General Assembly resolution 60/147, which suggest guidelines for a 
</p>
<p>victim assistance policy. 
</p>
<p>74. <i>Responsibility</i> &#8211; The fundamental principle of State responsibility reflects the 
</p>
<p>stability of the State in its highest form, as guarantor of the well-being, equality and 
</p>
<p>security of all citizens, including victims. This inalienable principle entails the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligation to uphold and enforce ratified international conventions, customary international 
</p>
<p>law and national law, including the obligation to investigate serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law and bring the perpetrators to justice. This responsibility 
</p>
<p>extends to the violence and omissions of previous political regimes. 
</p>
<p>75. <i>Definition</i> &#8211; According to the aforementioned basic principles and guidelines:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;[V]ictims are persons who individually or collectively suffered harm, including 
</p>
<p>physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial 
</p>
<p>impairment of their fundamental rights, through acts or omissions that constitute 
</p>
<p>gross violations of international human rights law, or serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law. Where appropriate, and in accordance with domestic 
</p>
<p>law, the term &#8216;victim&#8217; also includes the immediate family or dependants of the direct 
</p>
<p>victim and persons who have suffered harm in intervening to assist victims in 
</p>
<p>distress or to prevent victimization.&#8221; (A/RES/60/147, Annex, para. 8.) 
</p>
<p>This comprehensive definition effectively prohibits the State from discriminating against 
</p>
<p>perpetrators or victims on grounds of their ethnicity, religion, political affiliation or social 
</p>
<p>background.  
</p>
<p>76. <i>Access to justice, remedy and assistance</i> &#8211; Victims should have access to justice, i.e. 
</p>
<p>an effective remedy, relevant information, counsel and protection, including for their 
</p>
<p>relatives during proceedings, and steps should be taken to enable groups of victims to 
</p>
<p>present claims for and receive reparation (ibid., paras. 11&#8211;14). Adequate, effective and 
</p>
<p>prompt reparation should be proportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm 
</p>
<p>suffered (ibid., para. 15) and the State should ensure that reparation decisions handed down 
</p>
<p>by the courts are enforced (ibid., para. 17). </p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>77. <i>Fairness</i> &#8211; All victims having suffered harm should be included in the reparation 
</p>
<p>process, without discrimination (ibid., para. 25). Fairness entails the adoption of targeted 
</p>
<p>measures for victims for whom applying for relief is most difficult or who suffered the most 
</p>
<p>from the violations. 
</p>
<p>78. <i>Humanity and dignity</i> &#8211; Victims should be treated with humanity and dignity in their 
</p>
<p>efforts to seek justice and reparation. 
</p>
<p>79. <i>Access to information</i> &#8211; It is the State&#8217;s duty to ensure that victims have access to the 
</p>
<p>requisite information on available remedies and counselling services (ibid., para. 24). 
</p>
<p>80. <i>Access to appropriate reparation</i> &#8211; Reparation may take the following forms: 
</p>
<p>restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition (ibid., 
</p>
<p>para. 18). 
</p>
<p>81. <i>Restitution</i> &#8211; Victims should, whenever possible, be restored to their original 
</p>
<p>situation before the violation. Restitution includes: the restoration of liberty, identity and 
</p>
<p>employment, the enjoyment of human rights, the return to one&#8217;s place of residence and the 
</p>
<p>return of property (ibid., para. 19). 
</p>
<p>82. <i>Compensation</i> &#8211; Insofar as the human rights violations suffered are quantifiable, 
</p>
<p>victims should be compensated for physical or mental harm, lost opportunities, material or 
</p>
<p>moral damage, loss of earnings and medical and legal costs (ibid., para. 20). 
</p>
<p>83. <i>Rehabilitation</i> &#8211; This measure &#8220;should include medical and psychological care as 
</p>
<p>well as legal and social services&#8221; (ibid., para. 21).  
</p>
<p>84. <i>Satisfaction</i> &#8211; Steps taken by the Government to this end should include: effective 
</p>
<p>measures aimed at the cessation of continuing violations, public disclosure of the truth, the 
</p>
<p>search for the whereabouts of the disappeared, the restoration of the dignity of the dead, 
</p>
<p>public apology, the prosecution and punishment of persons liable for the violations, 
</p>
<p>commemorations and tributes to the victims and the inclusion of an accurate account of the 
</p>
<p>violations in educational material (ibid., para. 22). 
</p>
<p>85. <i>Guarantees of non-repetition</i> &#8211; Such measures should include: effective civilian 
</p>
<p>control of security forces, the harmonization of civilian and military proceedings with 
</p>
<p>international standards of fairness and impartiality, the strengthening of the independence 
</p>
<p>of the judiciary, the protection of victims, witnesses and persons concerned, the provision 
</p>
<p>of human rights education to security forces, the promotion of mechanisms for preventing 
</p>
<p>and monitoring social conflicts and legal reforms to take greater account of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitments towards international human rights law (ibid., para. 23). 
</p>
<p><b> G. Recommendations for a comprehensive approach to assistance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>A comprehensive approach should be taken to the provision of assistance for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims on the basis of their actual needs and taking into consideration the full 
</b></p>
<p><b>restoration of their rights and citizenship. Bearing in mind that the provision of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation is first and foremost the State</b>&#8217;<b>s responsibility, the Independent Expert 
</b></p>
<p><b>makes the following recommendations for each of the three specific levels of 
</b></p>
<p><b>intervention, i.e. legislative, institutional and operational. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>From a legislative standpoint, the Independent Expert recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The adoption of a law on protection mechanisms for victims, witnesses 
</b></p>
<p><b>and concerned persons, including judges, prosecutors, lawyers, human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>defenders and medical experts; </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p><b> (b) The adoption of an objective and specific legal definition of victim that 
</b></p>
<p><b>takes into account the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (resolution 60/147, annex); 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The adoption of legislation to implement the Rome Statute of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Criminal Court; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The establishment of a special fund for victims. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> From an institutional standpoint, the Independent Expert recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The formulation of a national vision on victims of the crisis in the form 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a countrywide programme, prepared in consultation with victims</b>&#8217;<b> associations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant civil society organizations, which provides for specific actions, financial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>material and human resources and a time frame that includes specific and realistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>objectives. The programme should be adopted through a law enacted by a National 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly that is representative of Ivorian political diversity, thereby adopting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>situation of victims as a national cause;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The streamlining of State institutions and resources to provide assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>to victims, including enhanced synergy among the National Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission, the National Programme for Social Cohesion, the Solidarity and Social 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cohesion Observatory, the post-conflict assistance project and the Directorate for 
</b></p>
<p><b>War Victims. As a moral and popular symbol of national unity and given its 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersectoral dimension and its impact on society as a whole and on economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>recovery, the situation of victims should be addressed by a national institution under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) The establishment of a single institution to receive victims</b>&#8217;<b> complaints 
</b></p>
<p><b>and grievances and provide them with the information they need to obtain medical, 
</b></p>
<p><b>psychological, socioeconomic and legal assistance; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The decentralization of this national victims institution to enable victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>throughout the country to express their grievances and concerns and receive replies 
</b></p>
<p><b>suited to their local sociocultural context; and 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The harmonization of available victim databases, ensuring that those run 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the National Programme for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Social Cohesion, the Directorate for War Victims, the National Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission and all other victim assistance systems are interconnected and are 
</b></p>
<p><b>overseen by the central victim assistance institution. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> From an operational standpoint, the Independent Expert recommends that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>operational phase of the victim assistance programme be structured around the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following three areas of support: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Medical and psychological care: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Immediate care for victims whose situation requires urgent attention, 
</b></p>
<p><b>such as those still suffering from serious physical and psychological effects of 
</b></p>
<p><b>physical violence and from the loss of their home or employment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Establishment throughout the country of accessible, free and 
</b></p>
<p><b>confidential psychological and social services for victims of rape and sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Definition of categories of loss and trauma, publication of this 
</b></p>
<p><b>information in order to demonstrate the scale of the harm caused by the crimes </b></p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed during the crisis and identification of victims and assailants 
</b></p>
<p><b>(determining each actor</b>&#8217;<b>s responsibility prevents general victimization); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) A public apology by the Government in which it admits its responsibility 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the serious harm suffered by the victims of the long Ivorian crisis and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expresses its commitment to ensuring that all victims obtain reparation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>irrespective of their political affiliation, social status or ethnicity; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Establishment of places where victims may share their stories and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobilization of religious and traditional leaders to give meaning and substance 
</b></p>
<p><b>to traditional and spiritual healing practices for minds and bodies of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals, and communities and to the values of solidarity and reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Socioeconomic assistance: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Formulation of a public policy on restitution and compensation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of relevant measures for victims, such as free education for 
</b></p>
<p><b>orphans, housing for widows and orphans, the restitution of occupied premises 
</b></p>
<p><b>and measures to facilitate professional reintegration, including income-
</b></p>
<p><b>generating activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Allocation of reliable funding for implementation and adoption of 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures for its strict monitoring by a Government-mandated public 
</b></p>
<p><b>institution; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Incorporation of gender-specific aspects in the reparation process for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims, including the establishment of counselling and psychological assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>units for women and girl victims of sexual violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Socioeconomic reintegration and/or social and professional integration 
</b></p>
<p><b>of victims in the private sector or the civil service, based on their skills and 
</b></p>
<p><b>motivation and the country</b>&#8217;<b>s socioeconomic situation; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Use of the data generated by the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission and of its recommendations as a basis for the drafting of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national policy on assistance for victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Legal assistance: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Protection of victims who wish to take part in the proceedings before the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Criminal Court against reprisals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Training and information for victims regarding their rights and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>possibility of individual or collective participation in proceedings before the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national courts and the International Criminal Court; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Advice for victims on how to bring a case before the national and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international courts and provision of free and competent lawyers to defend 
</b></p>
<p><b>them before those courts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Adoption of more comprehensive reparation measures for victims, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including legal and non-legal reparations, based on the experience of countries 
</b></p>
<p><b>that have experienced social disruption similar to that of the crisis in C&#244;te 
</b></p>
<p><b>d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Acceleration of legal proceedings to ensure that alleged offenders receive 
</b></p>
<p><b>a fair trial while taking care not to sacrifice victims</b>&#8217;<b> interests on the altar of 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation and the ongoing political dialogue. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that the international community</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>support for the national programme of assistance for the victims of the Ivorian crisis </b></p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.14-02949 
</p>
<p><b>be incorporated into cooperation policies with that country and encourage the 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement of victims</b>&#8217;<b> organizations and human rights advocates. Its support may be 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the form of specialized technical expertise and contributions to a consolidated 
</b></p>
<p><b>victim-assistance fund. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the victims of the crisis establish a 
</b></p>
<p><b>national victims federation that bring together all victims, without political, ethnic or 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious distinction. The federation should respect their diverse backgrounds and 
</b></p>
<p><b>serve as spokesperson before the Government and the international community. 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The international conference on the situation of the victims of the Ivorian crisis, 
</b></p>
<p><b>held in February 2014, highlighted the initiatives taken by the Government on behalf 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the victims. However, the proliferation of institutions and the lack of coordination 
</b></p>
<p><b>among them, as well as the lack of information on their missions and mandates, were 
</b></p>
<p><b>repeatedly pinpointed as causes of dissatisfaction among victims with the State</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts, which are nonetheless real. Taking up the situation of victims as a national 
</b></p>
<p><b>cause will ensure that the victims of the crisis do not become victims of the current 
</b></p>
<p><b>political polarization in Ivorian society. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The State has the overriding duty to ensure that the victims</b>&#8217;<b> frustration does 
</b></p>
<p><b>not degenerate into a social crisis whose magnitude may well jeopardize national 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconciliation and social cohesion. Failing to reintegrate victims economically and 
</b></p>
<p><b>socially could force them to take desperate steps to survive, including unlawful 
</b></p>
<p><b>activities. The perception that offenders benefit from impunity could spark a desire 
</b></p>
<p><b>for personal revenge that might undermine the rebuilding of social peace. The thirst 
</b></p>
<p><b>for justice and reparation, if not addressed appropriately by the authorities, could 
</b></p>
<p><b>push Ivorian society into instability that the slightest electoral challenge or incident 
</b></p>
<p><b>between communities could exacerbate. Thus, fulfilling the victims</b>&#8217;<b> right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reparation is both an ethical and political duty. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>In that connection, the Independent Expert advises all political actors to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>an ethical commitment. It is their responsibility to assume the moral initiative before 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Ivorian nation, to shoulder their historic responsibility in the long and deep 
</b></p>
<p><b>tragedy into which the Ivorian people have been cast and to strive to put the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of victims in the forefront of the process of national reconciliation and reconstruction 
</b></p>
<p><b>of democracy. They should make the plight of victims a national cause that transcends 
</b></p>
<p><b>political divides. 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. General recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Independent Expert notes that C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire has taken significant steps to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement the recommendations made in his previous reports (A/HRC/19/72, 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/22/66, A/HRC/23/38 and A/HRC/25/73).  
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Nevertheless, he repeats his recommendations to the Government regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>inter alia the need to align the National Human Rights Commission with the Paris 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles; the impartiality of the justice system vis-&#224;-vis those of all political 
</b></p>
<p><b>persuasions who committed gross human rights violations; the harmonization of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Criminal Code with the country</b>&#8217;<b>s international obligations; the improvement of 
</b></p>
<p><b>prison conditions; the definitive and lasting resolution of the issue of dozos interfering 
</b></p>
<p><b>in security operations; the continuation of the inter-Ivorian political dialogue; the 
</b></p>
<p><b>consensus-based reform of the Independent Electoral Commission and the electoral </b></p>


<p>GE.14-02949 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>list; the rational management of the return of exiles and evictions; and a more 
</b></p>
<p><b>convincing response to issues of sexual violence. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> He also repeats his recommendation that the international community continue 
</b></p>
<p><b>and strengthen its support to C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire for the consolidation of democracy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic and social reconstruction and national reconciliation. Lastly, he reiterates 
</b></p>
<p><b>his recommendation to fully lift the arms embargo against the country.
