<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance

</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Peru: Republic of Moldova, Maldives and 
Mexico. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mr. &#193;vila Herrera, Deputy Minister of Human Rights and Access to Justice 
introduced the Peruvian report to the Human Rights Council. Peru highlighted that the 
policies implemented by the present Government were aimed at consolidating democracy 
and the rule of law to ensure a climate of stability and political cooperation. Peru reaffirmed 
the State&#8217;s commitment to the international human rights protection systems and the 
country&#8217;s openness to scrutiny both at the international level and from civil society. 
</p>
<p>6. Peru informed the Human Rights Council that its national report was the result of a 
broad consultation process which included the National Human Rights Council made up of 
Government institutions and representatives of civil society. 
</p>
<p>7. Peru then provided information regarding to legal and institutional developments 
concerning human rights. It was highlighted that, in Peru, the international human rights 
treaties are at the same hierarchical level as the Constitution and that the country had 
recently ratified important international instruments, notably the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Forced Disappearance (CPED) and the Convention 
on Cluster Munitions. </p>


<p>8. Peru also informed the Human Rights Council of the creation of various institutions 
which should help to ensure various human rights. These included the Ministry of 
Development and Social Inclusion; the Ministry of Culture, and its Vice-Ministry of 
Interculturality; the Ministry of the Environment; and the Office of Management of Social 
Conflict, which now functions under a new title, &#8220;Office of the High Commissioner for 
Dialogue and Sustainability&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>9. Peru expressed its confidence that the creation of these institutions would result in 
the provision of more efficient and inclusive services and contribute to a more just and 
coherent society. 
</p>
<p>10. Peru then provided information regarding the implementation of the 
recommendations received during the first UPR. 
</p>
<p>11. On the protection and promotion of the human rights of vulnerable persons, Peru 
highlighted developments in protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, persons with 
disabilities and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>12. With regards to indigenous peoples, it underscored the adoption, in 2011, of the Act 
on the Right of Indigenous Peoples to Prior Consultation (hereinafter, Prior Consultation 
Act) and the corresponding regulations, both of which were realized with the participation 
of representatives of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>13. Peru also informed the Council that the Plan for Equal Opportunities for Persons 
with Disabilities 2009&#8211;2018 had been approved and that the Congress was also debating a 
new Law on Persons with Disabilities, inspired by the United Nations convention. 
</p>
<p>14. Peru noted that a national policy on older persons had been adopted to strengthen 
policies for the social protection of this population group. A national assistance and 
solidarity programme, &#8220;Pension 65&#8221;, was set up with the aim of giving economic subsidies 
and medical aid to people over 65 living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>15. Peru provided information on measures adopted to combat discrimination and stated 
that since 2000 the offence of discrimination was included in the Peruvian Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the de facto moratorium on the death penalty, Peru highlighted that 
the Constitution established the death penalty solely for especially grave offences (terrorism 
and betrayal of the nation in time of war). It was recalled that the death penalty was last 
pronounced and carried out in 1979 and that, in that sense, the country was de facto an 
abolitionist State. 
</p>
<p>17. Regarding the investigation of cases of human rights violations, Peru stated, that 
since 2004, the Public Prosecution Service and the judicial power had been using 
specialized human rights machinery with competence to investigate, prosecute and penalize 
the crimes of genocide, forced disappearance and torture. From 2005 to 2011, 81 sentences 
had been handed down by the National Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>18. Additionally, major progress has been made in recovering, identifying and restoring 
to family members the bodies of victims of forced disappearance and extrajudicial 
execution. From 2002 to 2012, the remains of 2,109 individuals had been recovered, of 
which 1,074 had been identified and returned to family members. 
</p>
<p>19. Peru also underscored that the Supreme Court had found that former President 
Alberto Fujimori Fujimori bore criminal responsibility for the killings in Barrios Altos and 
La Cantuta, and sentenced him to 25 years of deprivation of liberty in a procedure which 
respected all rules of due process. This sentence was a landmark decision in the protection 
of human rights and the fight against impunity, as it is the first time in Peru or Latin 
America that a former president, democratically elected had been found guilty of human 
rights violations under the domestic judicial system. </p>


<p>20. With regard to the issue of military justice, Peru explained that the military criminal 
justice system had jurisdiction solely over members of the Armed Forces and the national 
police force with respect to the legal property of the military, and that excluded ordinary 
offences, including offences against human rights that were of exclusive jurisdiction of 
ordinary courts. 
</p>
<p>21. On recommendations regarding women&#8217;s rights, Peru indicated that under the 
National Plan for Equal Opportunities of Men and Women, 2006&#8211;2010, regional equal 
opportunity plans were being developed. With regard to the involvement of women in 
politics, it was indicated that for the purpose of ensuring sufficient representation of women 
in parliament, in addition to the Quotas Act, the National Electoral Board had submitted a 
draft law that aimed to introduce an electoral quota for women. 
</p>
<p>22. Regarding protection of women from violence, Peru noted that the country now had 
a total of 148 women&#8217;s emergency centres, which constituted specialized public services for 
the provision, free of charge, of care and protection against domestic and sexual violence. 
The establishment of &#8220;L&#237;nea 100&#8221;, the national telephone helpline and of women&#8217;s police 
</p>
<p>units, which now numbered 28 nationwide, was also noted. Peru also highlighted the 
adoption of the Second National Plan to Combat Violence against Women, 2009&#8211;2015. 
Additionally, Peru noted the incorporation of the crime of femicide in the Criminal Code, 
which constituted the State&#8217;s firm and clear response to concerns about the increase in 
murders of women at the hands of their spouses. 
</p>
<p>23. Regarding trafficking in persons, Peru referred to the adoption of the Act to Combat 
Trafficking in Persons and Illegal Smuggling of Migrants, in conformity with the definition 
set out in the Palermo Protocol. The adoption of the National Plan of Action to Combat 
Trafficking in Persons 2011&#8211;2016 was also noted. 
</p>
<p>24. Peru informed the Council that, in order to address child labour, in September 2012 
a law had been published through which the National Strategy for the Prevention and 
Eradication of Child Labour 2012&#8211;2021 had been approved. This strategy contained 
objectives such as the eradication of the worst forms of child labour of those below the 
minimum legal age for work, which is 14 years. 
</p>
<p>25. Peru stated, regarding cooperation of public entities with the Ombudsman, that the 
reports of that institution indicated that, although there did not seem to be a great variation 
between 2009 and 2010, there had been an increase of 9 per cent in 2011 compared to 2010. 
</p>
<p>26. With relation to the issue of reparations to the victims of the violence from 1980 to 
2000, Peru informed the Council that it was complying with the Comprehensive 
Reparations Plan which had several areas. Economic reparations were being made to a 
group of over 10,000 victims of violence. At the end of the year, two new lists would be 
compiled benefiting more victims. In addition to those, collective reparations were also 
being made to those communities that were the most affected by the violence. Moreover, 
reparations in the area of health, education and symbolic reparations were also envisaged. 
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the penitentiary system, the Government had approved a plan with 
three main components: improving the infrastructure, improving security in penitentiaries 
and eliminating corruption and developing a treatment policy that was adequate and 
respectful. To that end, the Government was allocating funds to build new penitentiaries 
and improve living conditions. Reference was also made to measures to improve the 
quantity and quality prison staff. It was added that, although there were still concerns 
regarding overcrowding, the Government had been making serious efforts and had adopted 
measures to improve the system. 
</p>
<p>28. Peru indicated, regarding measures to protect victims and witnesses of human rights 
violations and human rights defenders, that a national programme for assistance to victims </p>


<p>and witnesses now existed in support of the work of the prosecution services and that the 
system included victims and witnesses of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>29. On the environment, mining and human rights, Peru noted that, with the 
establishment of the Ministry of the Environment, the State had reorganized its 
environmental policy. In 2009, after public consultations, the National Policy on the 
Environment and the National Plan for Environmental Action, 2011&#8211;2021, had been 
approved. In the past several years, 19 million hectares of forest, 15 per cent of the national 
territory, had been protected. 
</p>
<p>30. On the right to personal identity, it was highlighted that by June 2012, 91.6 per cent 
of minors had been provided with an identification document. As for adults, 99.2 per cent 
of all those over 18 had an identification document. However, registration of adults in 
forested rural areas had still not been achieved, which was the reason for a strategic alliance 
between the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the National Registry of 
Identification and Civil Status, to intervene in 69 communities so as to identify and register 
all persons in those areas. 
</p>
<p>31. With regards to gender perspective, the delegation indicated that the Government 
continued to implement affirmative measures to benefit women. The National Plan for 
Gender Equality 2012&#8211;2017 would be the strategic axis of the programmes for equality and 
equity implemented by the Executive. 
</p>
<p>32. On participation of civil society in domestic human rights policies, it was noted that 
civil society had been actively participating in the country&#8217;s domestic human rights policy, 
in particular in the National Human Rights Council and the elaboration of the National 
Human Rights Plan. 
</p>
<p>33. Peru then provided information on the follow-up to the commitments undertaken in 
the first cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>34. With regards to the National Preventive Mechanism against Torture, Peru explained 
that there were currently two bills to create this mechanism. The State would endeavour to 
find a consensus in order to propose a law to Congress and ensure the allocation of the 
necessary funds so as to be able to comply with this international obligation within the next 
year. 
</p>
<p>35. Peru then highlighted measures for the eradication of poverty and social inequality. 
It was indicated that notwithstanding the sustained growth in the economy, there was still a 
need to fight against poverty and extreme poverty. Nonetheless, it was noted that, between 
2004 and 2011, the poverty rate was reduced from 58.7 per cent to 27.8 per cent and 
extreme poverty fell from 16.4 per cent in 2004 to 6.3 per cent in 2011. Peru provided 
details on improvements achieved in access to basic services, drinking water and sanitation. 
It was also noted that, as part of its commitment to combating poverty and reducing 
existing gaps, the Government of Peru had set up the Ministry of Development and Social 
Inclusion. 
</p>
<p>36. Peru then noted the significant budget increase provided in the area of health, and 
stated that, following the implementation of the Universal Health Insurance Act of 2009, 
the proportion of people enjoying health insurance coverage had risen from 53.7 per cent in 
2008 to 64.5 per cent by 2011. 
</p>
<p>37. Peru then referred to statistics provided in its national report indicating 
improvements in the areas of neonatal, maternal and infant mortality and the level of 
chronic child malnutrition among children under 5. 
</p>
<p>38. Peru indicated, regarding the right to education, that the budget for education had 
been increasing significantly. The literacy rate had improved and in 2011 was at 92.9 per </p>


<p>cent. Additionally, the gross school attendance rate had markedly improved between 2004 
and 2011. On the specific issue of the right to education of vulnerable groups, Peru noted 
the implementation of 461 special basic education centres designed to cater for students 
with special educational needs. 
</p>
<p>39. Regarding forced labour, Peru informed the Council that the National Committee 
against Forced Labour has been making efforts to draw up and implement &#8211; with the 
assistance of the International Labour Organization (ILO) &#8211; the second National Plan to 
Combat Forced Labour for 2012&#8211;2016. 
</p>
<p>40. As for the right to adequate housing, it was noted that in the period between August 
2006 and May 2012, some 308,000 housing units had been either built or improved. 
</p>
<p>41. On access to justice and due process, Peru indicated that the justice system had been 
significantly overhauled and that Peru was witnessing a new way of approaching the 
criminal justice system. Peru had a new Criminal Procedure Code which was already 
implemented in 24 judicial districts of the 31 existing districts. 
</p>
<p>42. Peru concluded that these significant achievements were part of efforts demanded by 
the United Nations of all States. Peru added that it believed that stability and progress 
would only be achieved in the context of respect for human rights.
