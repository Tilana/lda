<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Kiribati was held at the 2nd meeting, on 3 May 2010. The delegation of 
Kiribati was headed by the Minister for Internal and Social Affairs, The Honourable 
Kouraiti Beniato. At its 6th meeting, held on 5 May 2010, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Kiribati. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kiribati: Brazil, Jordan and the Russian 
Federation. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Kiribati: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/1) and its corrigendum 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/1/Corr.1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KIR/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
Latvia, Slovenia, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Kiribati through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Kiribati stated that Kiribati was committed to the universal 
periodic review process. It thanked all stakeholders involved in the preparation of the 
national report. Kiribati also reaffirmed its appreciation for the support provided by the 
Government of the Netherlands, the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team, the secretariat 
of the Pacific Communities and the Regional Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights for the Pacific, based in Suva, Fiji. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation of Kiribati briefly outlined the key challenging<b> </b>factors that, in many 
respects, restrict Kiribati&#8217;s efforts to fully fulfil the requirements set out in the Bill of 
Rights of the Constitution. The delegation noted that Kiribati faced an acute scarcity of 
natural resources. Traditional aid sources included the bilateral aid programmes of 
Australia and New Zealand. Several donor countries, in addition to regional and 
international organizations, formed a group of development partners for Kiribati. It further 
noted that the geographical smallness and fragmentation of the islands made internal 
communications and transportation difficult and costly. Furthermore, isolation from major 
international markets rendered international trade uneconomical. Kiribati was a net exporter 
of food items and much-needed building material. Infrastructure required a great deal of 
development, and maintenance work on roads, the airport and port facilities were costly and 
thus below international standards. </p>


<p>7. The delegation stated that there was no human rights institution in Kiribati. If there 
were one, additional financial and specialized human resources would be required for its 
services. Kiribati would need capacity-building to sustain such an institution. Public 
awareness of the importance and relevance of its functions was essential to justify the 
establishment of such an institution. Therefore, the existence and the use of resources 
allocated to human rights institutions would be highly dependent on the international 
community. Kiribati would thus encourage the international community to look into 
providing technical and financial assistance that would enable it to establish one in the 
future. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation further noted that a human rights commission within the region 
would be a step in the right direction. In addition, the services of such a regional 
commission would be fully utilized by a group of island Governments, particularly the 
smaller island States that could not afford to finance one on their own. Accordingly, 
Kiribati was supportive of the proposal of the Pacific Islands Forum secretariat, which was 
currently looking into the merits of establishing a regional human rights mechanism. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation stated that Kiribati did not see any harm in ratifying the core human 
rights conventions. The delegation, however, noted that the resource requirements for 
reporting and implementation purposes with regard to many of these international 
conventions were quite substantial, especially for least developed countries. It further noted 
that, although not all conventions would be applicable to Kiribati, if the international 
community could ensure that such resources were available, Kiribati should take the 
necessary steps towards the ratification of existing and appropriate international 
conventions. These would include the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that the Government of Kiribati recognized the need to amend 
the Constitution to improve the provisions regarding discrimination on the basis of sex, 
gender and disability. However, the procedure for amending the Constitution required the 
approval of a two-thirds majority of the entire voting population through a referendum and 
a two-thirds-majority vote in Parliament. The Government had faced such a challenge in 
1998 when it held a national consultation to review the Constitution. At the time, 
participants from throughout the nation did not support the initiative to amend the 
provisions of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights. Later, in 2004, the 
Government could not achieve two-thirds-majority support among members of parliament 
for amending the provision on citizenship. In addition to the procedural requirements for 
amending the Bill of Rights, the Government requires further financial support in order to 
conduct a referendum and advocate support for the amendment initiative. Therefore, the 
Government recognized that, until amendments could be made to the Constitution, all other 
laws that were discriminatory in nature and effect would continue to be applied.   
</p>
<p>11. The delegation noted that violence against women was pervasive in Kiribati. It noted 
a recent report on a Kiribati family health study conducted in 2008, which found that 68 per 
cent of women in Kiribati had experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by 
their intimate partners. The delegation stated that the Government was very committed to 
working with regional bodies to propose solutions to the problem,  including: training 
counsellors to assist victims in recovering physically and psychologically; the financing of 
awareness-raising programmes such as White Ribbon Days, &#8220;safe-nets&#8221; and a crisis centre; 
an intervention programme to combat domestic violence in all islands of Kiribati; 
supporting police initiatives by working with communities and creating a domestic violence 
and sexual offence unit within the police; and embarking on a legislative review. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation further stated that, through the various committees existing within 
Government ministries, both the Government and non-governmental organizations were </p>


<p>working together on various strategies to address issues related to women, children and 
disability. The Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Project supported the police 
service with initiatives on domestic violence and sexual offences. The Office of the 
Attorney-General worked on the Child Protection Baseline Study for 2008-2009 to review 
existing legislation on child protection and juvenile justice. Furthermore, the Child 
Protection Legislative Reform Project, which was part of the broader study on gender-based 
violence and intervention programmes, was a Government initiative to address the issues 
surrounding violence against women. The Government was also currently working closely 
with regional organizations to study some of the legislation affecting women. However, 
financial constraints and a lack of capacity limited the implementation of proposed plans 
and activities. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation stated that, although the Government had incorporated compulsory 
education into its laws and ensured free education through the junior secondary school 
level, it was the duty of parents and guardians to comply with the law and ensure that their 
children attended school. It stated that the Government was faced with that challenge and 
believed that the responsibility for compliance rested mostly with parents and guardians. 
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that parliament had repealed corporal punishment in 
educational institutions only. The Government was working in partnership with UNICEF 
on the possible reform of child protection legislation. The Kiribati National Advisory 
Committee on Children had been established in 2003; however, financial assistance to 
support its activities was required.  
</p>
<p>15. The delegation stated that Kiribati was finalizing its national policy on disability, 
which would be effective from 2010 to 2013.  An action plan had also been drafted and had 
been attached to the policy. Kiribati was committed to the Biwako Millennium Framework. 
The national plan had been developed in response to the growing need to address disability 
issues in the wider community; it was also an attempt  to ensure the fulfilment of the 
Government&#8217;s commitments to international and regional endeavours.  
</p>
<p>16. The delegation noted that national statistics regarding people living with disabilities 
had been issued as recently as last year. It had been difficult to take useful decisions to 
facilitate the movement and the education of people living with disabilities. Each island 
might have a few disabled persons, but their disabilities needed to be documented. The 
Government continued to support people living with disabilities, through the provision of 
government land, a &#8220;home&#8221; and financial resources for the building of a &#8220;centre for people 
living with disabilities&#8221; in South Tarawa. 
</p>
<p>17. The delegation noted that the decline in the standard of quality education throughout 
Kiribati had been highlighted in several forums. The Education Sector Strategic Plan had 
been launched in 2008 as a comprehensive Government response whose priority objective 
was to address the decline. The Government accepted the fact that the training and up-
skilling of teachers was slow and required further work in order to meet international 
standards. Several consultations aimed at improving the teaching standards system and 
appraisal systems had been completed.  
</p>
<p>18. The delegation further stated that the revision of school curriculums for the primary 
and secondary levels had been necessary in order to complement university entrance 
requirements and advanced information technology. Several reports and recommendations 
had been passed through the Ministry of Education; a number of them addressed the Policy 
Statement for Early Childhood Education, including primary to secondary education. The 
Government subsidized education costs, including transportation  costs for students. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that the Government had sought to consult its stakeholders on 
climate change through various gatherings. Those consultations had included traditional 
leaders, women, youth, council clerks and mayors from each island. Special consideration </p>


<p>had yet to be given to vulnerable groups such as children and people living with disabilities, 
since those individuals were being looked after by their parents and relatives. However, 
public awareness programmes regarding climate change had been delivered to all citizens 
through the mass media, village dramas and presentations for the general population and 
organized youth groups. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegation stated that tangible outcomes of climate change adaptation 
programmes had been slow to come about in Kiribati, owing primarily to limited resources. 
Dependence on external assistance, especially from developed countries, had been the norm 
at the national level. In recent decades, only enabling activities had been carried out by 
donor communities for studies, assessments and additional consultations. Only in the past 
three years had Kiribati been given more than $1 million by multilateral mechanisms of the 
Global Environment Facility, which had financed pilot projects related to water and coastal 
protection at selected sites. But those sites did not even cover whole islands. Furthermore, 
as a result of the country&#8217;s limited human resources, the bulk of the funds had been spent 
on costly technical assistance from abroad.   
</p>
<p>21. The delegation further stated that the involvement of vulnerable groups in the 
adaptation projects had been limited. Vulnerable groups shared the benefits of adaptation 
projects equally with the general public, through water, road and coastal infrastructure. The 
costs of implementing specialized programmes for vulnerable groups were excessively 
high. It emphasized once again that, once additional resources had been made available to 
Kiribati, the Government would be in a better position to design specific programmes 
targeted at vulnerable groups. For the time being, the Government was prioritizing its 
proposals in order to respond appropriately to climate change. The Government had already 
begun with the protection of public and community assets, which required urgent and 
immediate intervention. In the long term, Kiribati would continue to face adverse the 
effects of climate change owing to losses and damage caused by both extreme and slow-
onset events. However, in the short to medium term, Kiribati would continue to move 
forward with adaptation strategies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegation concluded that Kiribati would fully honour its responsibilities in 
safeguarding the rights of its citizens and non-citizens alike. However, the Government was 
also acutely aware of inherent limitations, in particular in its efforts to strengthen the 
capacities of individuals, professions and institutions. Kiribati therefore appreciates and 
will seriously consider all recommendations of the Human Rights Council. The level of its 
success will depend to a large extent on the availability of technical and financial assistance 
from all its development partners, including the United Nations and its specialized 
agencies. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, 28 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>24. A number of delegations expressed appreciation for the efforts made by Kiribati to 
participate in the review, given the travelling distance and the logistical difficulties. Some 
delegations thanked Kiribati for the quality and the presentation of the national report, as 
well as for the open and inclusive process of its preparation. Some delegations were pleased 
by the consultation of civil society stakeholders in the production of the national report. 
Some delegations also expressed appreciation for Kiribati&#8217;s open acknowledgement of its 
specific human rights challenges. Kiribati was also commended for having ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and for its efforts to bring its </p>


<p>legislation into line with those conventions, as well as for having endorsed the Kiribati 
Development Plan 2008-2011.  
</p>
<p>25. Algeria referred to the national report, highlighting the fact that the domestic laws 
were not in compliance with the CEDAW and the CRC. It also referred to the listing of 
several challenges impeding the effective realization of human rights. However, the 
national report had also described the encouraging steps taken by the Government to 
promote children&#8217;s rights. Algeria noted with interest the National Development Plan for 
2008 -2011. Algeria made recommendations<b>.</b> 
</p>
<p>26. Norway expressed concern about the situation of women&#8217;s rights in law and 
practice, and stated that there was an imminent need to strengthen the legal and practical 
protection of those rights. It also expressed concern that most schools would not accept 
girls as students once they had become engaged, married or pregnant, asking whether the 
basis for such rejection was law or practice. Norway made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>27. Turkey<b> </b>encouraged the Kiribati authorities to address the concerns regarding 
violence, discrimination against women, and child abuse. It inquired whether the 
Government intended to increase the number of human rights treaties to which it was a 
party. It concluded by highlighting the importance of raising awareness with a view to the 
sustainability and enhancement of the human rights situation in the country. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Germany indicated that, according to a 2009 report by the World Health 
Organization, inadequate water supplies, unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation had 
contributed to a high number of cases of disease and respiratory infection, which were the 
major causes of mortality among children. Germany asked what measures, if any, Kiribati 
was taking to install an effective system for sewage disposal and to promote  new practices 
in the use of water and sanitation. Germany made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Cuba referred to the National Development Plan for 2008-2011, highlighting health, 
economic growth, poverty reduction, environmental and other issues. Cuba welcomed the 
fact that the population had free access to medical services. It also noted access to free and 
mandatory primary education, as well as the 2008 Strategic Plan for education. Cuba 
further noted the important actions and programmes aimed at countering the effects of 
climate change .Cuba made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>30. France indicated that, even though Kiribati was a party to CEDAW, women and girl 
children continued to be victims of unequal and discriminatory treatment. France noted that 
Kiribati was in the process of bringing its law into line with its international obligations, 
requesting further information about the measures taken in that regard. It also asked for 
further information about the 2010 reforms of the law relating to the protection of children. 
France made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>31. Hungary emphasized that widening the scope of treaty obligations would benefit 
various segments of Kiribati society and would assist the state&#8217;s activities in the area of 
human rights. It noted with regret that Kiribati was &#8220;patrilineal&#8221; and that that principle 
transcended its legal system. Hungary took note with satisfaction of steps taken by the 
Government to reduce the very high rate of violence against women, and welcomed the 
preparation of the Draft National Action Plan for 2008- 2011. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Slovenia observed that Kiribati was a party to only two of the core universal human 
rights treaties and asked whether it planned to ratify other international human rights 
treaties. Slovenia noted that there was no specific disability legislation and asked whether 
the Government planned to adopt such legislation in the future. It also asked about the 
Government&#8217;s plans to improve teaching and learning facilities for its schools. Slovenia 
made recommendations.    </p>


<p>33. Spain expressed support for Kiribati&#8217;s determination to combat the negative 
consequences of climate change, including its impacts on the enjoyment of most 
fundamental human rights. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>34. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya inquired about the reasons that Kiribati had not ratified 
core human rights instruments, except for the CEDAW and the CRC. It also inquired about 
the National Development Plan and its objectives. Libya asked about the progress made in 
amending the laws protecting women and children. It also asked whether a regional 
mechanism for human rights had been established and, if so, whether that mechanism was 
supported by Kiribati. Libya made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>35. China praised Kiribati&#8217;s positive progress in the area of human rights, despite the 
challenges faced. It also acknowledged that the Government provided free health care and 
compulsory primary education to its people. China posed two questions: the first concerned 
the specific human rights affected by climate change, and the second concerned the short- 
and medium-term plans for coping with it. 
</p>
<p>36. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s willingness to set up a national commission for human rights as early as 
possible. It requested further information about the Government&#8217;s plans to promote gender 
equality. It also requested information about the timetable for implementing the National 
Development Plan. In addition, it expressed interest in the Government&#8217;s Action Plan on 
Disability. It made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>37. Mexico recognized the efforts made by Kiribati to fight poverty and to prevent and 
eradicate discrimination against people with disabilities, through a national plan of action 
based on respect for and the promotion of human rights. With regard to Kiribati&#8217;s accession 
to international human rights instruments, it inquired about the need for technical assistance 
from the international community to permit the ratification of those treaties to which 
Kiribati was not yet a party, as well as the need to implement those already ratified. Mexico 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Canada appreciated the open acknowledgement in the national report of the specific 
human rights challenges faced by Kiribati. Canada was concerned at the fact that schools 
for people with disabilities did not receive Government support. It also noted that 
discrimination against women and gender-related violence remained problems, and that 
physical violence against women in permanent relationships was prevalent. Canada made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. The delegation stated that raising public awareness was the key to understanding the 
human rights situation in Kiribati.  
</p>
<p>40. In relation to non-accession to core international human rights treaties, the 
delegation reaffirmed that Kiribati&#8217;s accession to such conventions and treaties would be a 
costly exercise.  Kiribati would therefore need to assess the costs, benefits and obligations 
associated with acceding to such treaties.  Kiribati was in the process of reviewing existing 
conventions and treaties, and the Government had submitted a list of those conventions to 
the Cabinet for its consideration. The delegation reaffirmed the need for financial assistance 
from the international community in that regard. 
</p>
<p>41. Concerning the issue of discrimination against women, the delegation acknowledged 
that there was a high rate of such discrimination. Kiribati had been collaborating with civil 
society organizations to come up with a legislative response to domestic violence. The 
delegation confirmed that Kiribati would need to come up with specific legislation that 
would deal with domestic violence, and that the country was making progress in that 
direction. For victims of domestic violence, counselling services and assistance would be 
required.  </p>


<p>42. With respect to the key element of eliminating discriminatory clauses in Kiribati 
laws, in particular laws relating to land distribution and the political participation of 
women, the delegation reiterated that an amendment to the Bill of Rights in the Constitution 
was a precondition for the achievement of that goal. However, the delegation reaffirmed the 
difficulty of adopting such an amendment and emphasized that the Government intended to 
come forward with another proposal for such an amendment.  
</p>
<p>43. The delegation confirmed that corporal punishment had been banned in schools, but 
had not yet been banned in homes. It noted that, although the issue was being debated, the 
biggest obstacle was cultural. Public awareness and assistance were required in order to 
send to parents and guardians the message that corporal punishment was not acceptable. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to the issue of climate change, the delegation noted that the impacts of 
climate change posed human rights problems for low-lying countries such as Kiribati. 
Climate change was a matter of survival and security. It had already damaged Kiribati&#8217;s 
infrastructure. Coastline erosion and sea-level rise had created many problems for Kiribati. 
The lack of capacity and resources was exacerbating those problems. Kiribati, as part of its 
short-term and medium-term strategy, needed an assessment of the level of coastline 
erosion in order to protect from further degradation. Kiribati was seeking financial and 
technical assistance from the international community in that regard. 
</p>
<p>45. Concerning the issue of safe drinking water and sewerage, the delegation noted that 
the population living on the outer islands normally used boiled water for drinking.  In urban 
areas, there were water catchments for rainfall; the challenge was to ensure a storage 
facility for such catchments. The Government continued to provide assistance so as to 
improve access to clean water. The Government also continued to provide assistance in 
meeting community-based needs for water tanks in order to improve water quality. The 
delegation stated that Kiribati had established a water and sanitation policy, whose 
implementation, it was hoped, would improve the situation at the national level with regard 
to sanitation and water.  
</p>
<p>46. The delegation stated that the Government planned to improve education, teaching 
and learning facilities, and resources. The Government had launched a comprehensive 
education sector strategy plan in 2008 to improve the quality of education, teaching and 
learning facilities, and resources.  Kiribati continued to provide assistance in that regard and 
would require further financial support from development partners, which would help the 
Government to provide free education to children. 
</p>
<p>47. Maldives noted the severe technical and financial capacity constraints faced by 
Kiribati and its knock-on effects in terms of the promotion and the protection of human 
rights. It encouraged the Government in its endeavour and its commitment to provide 
access to free education and health care for all its citizens. Maldives urged Kiribati to 
proceed with the implementation of its National Action Plan to eliminate gender-based 
violence. Maldives made a recommendation.   
</p>
<p>48. The Netherlands commended Kiribati for the ratification of the CRC and the 
CEDAW, as well as the efforts made to bring national legislation into compliance with 
those conventions. It noted with concern the results of a 2009 study showing that 68 per 
cent of the female population had been victims of violence. It was also concerned by the 
number of laws that were of a discriminatory nature and that the Broadcasting and 
Publication Authority Act allowed the Government to prohibit freedom of expression. The 
Netherlands made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>49. Argentina regretted that, owing to the lack of human and financial resources allotted 
to the 2009 National Advisory Committee for Children, it had not been enabled to work 
effectively. Argentina inquired about the measures adopted to implement the 
recommendations made by UNDP/UNIFEM concerning the constitutional effectiveness of </p>


<p>customary law, which seemed to prolong women&#8217;s inequalities. It also requested 
information about the adopted measures aimed at the implementation of the National Plan 
of Action 2010-2020 to eliminate violence against women, and about the activities 
undertaken thus far in that regard.  Argentina made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>50. Slovakia appreciated the fact that the death penalty had been abolished in Kiribati. It 
welcomed the free compulsory primary school education, as well as the increasing number 
of girls attending school. However, it was concerned by the persistent cases of violence 
against children, in particular sexual violence, including commercial sexual exploitation, 
which had not been sufficiently prosecuted. In addition, children were increasingly exposed 
to domestic violence. Slovakia made recommendations.    
</p>
<p>51. New Zealand shared its deep concern about the entrenched discrimination against 
women that pervades Kiribati society. However, it credited Kiribati for having ratified the 
CEDAW. New Zealand further welcomed its police capacity-building specifically targeting 
violence against women and its National Action Plan. It recognized Kiribati&#8217;s geographical 
and environmental challenges and its limited resources. New Zealand made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>52. Sweden noted reports indicating that violence and discrimination against women 
remained a problem, asking Kiribati to elaborate as to what measures were being taken to 
ensure the rights of women. It also noted the reports by UNICEF and international non-
governmental organizations regarding the alcohol-related physical and sexual abuse of 
children and concerns about child prostitution. Sweden asked what measures were being 
taken to prevent and address child abuse and child prostitution. Sweden made 
recommendations.   
</p>
<p>53. Chile noted the challenges faced by Kiribati, including its fight against poverty and 
the effects of climate change. It noted the national report highlighting the need to undertake 
further work to guarantee the necessary legal framework for facilitating the protection of 
women. Chile also noted Kiribati&#8217;s recognition that the Criminal Code and other codes 
regarding children&#8217;s rights and interests should be revised. Chile made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>54. Japan stated that Kiribati had yet to ratify most of the core international human 
rights instruments, asking about the efforts aimed at ratifying those instruments. It thanked 
the delegation for its explanation that assessment for accession to these instruments was 
currently being done, and stated that it looked forward to further information on the 
development in this regard. Japan also noted reports that domestic violence against women 
and corporal punishment of children were daily occurrences. Japan further noted the actions 
being taken under the Kiribati Development Plan 2008-2011 in designated key policy areas. 
Japan expressed hope that Kiribati would build a stable society through the effective 
implementation of the Plan and that it would also improve the human rights situation. Japan 
made a recommendation.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. Australia was pleased to note the undertaking by Kiribati to submit its State report to 
the CEDAW Committee and the efforts made to align its national laws with the 
Convention. It praised Kiribati&#8217;s endorsement of the Pacific Regional Strategy on Disability 
in October 2009, which fostered links to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. The United States of America expressed its support for the creation of a national, 
independent commission for human rights, as indicated by Kiribati in the national report, as 
well as for the continued efforts aimed at eliminating gender inequality, discrimination, and 
violence against women and children. The United States also expressed support for 
Kiribati&#8217;s efforts to promulgate a draft amendment to the Constitution that would protect 
against discrimination and would seek to protect the rights of women and children. It made 
a recommendation in that regard.      </p>


<p>57. Latvia referred to the issue of a standing invitation, while noting that no requests for 
visits had been made so far. Latvia made a recommendation in that regard. 
</p>
<p>58. Morocco welcomed the priority accorded by Kiribati to climate change, as well as 
the efforts to compensate for the effects of climate change. Morocco requested information 
about the harmonization of national laws with international standards, particularly in 
relation to women and children, asking to what extent UNICEF assisted with the 
implementation of the rights of the child. It also asked about the measures envisaged for the 
follow-up on the report on the study of the family and the results of the survey by the 
World Health Organization on violence against women. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>59. Indonesia noted that there was no national human rights institution in Kiribati and 
commended the Government for its expressed willingness to work with the international 
community to establish one.  It shared Kiribati&#8217;s concerns about the effects of climate 
change and the detrimental impact on the right to a clean environment, clean water and 
livelihood security. It noted that the provisions of the CEDAW and the CRC, which had 
been ratified by Kiribati, had to be fully incorporated into domestic legislation. Indonesia 
made recommendations.   
</p>
<p>60. The Philippines commended Kiribati for having ratified the CEDAW and the CRC, 
and it noted Kiribati&#8217;s plans to ratify other international human rights treaties. It 
congratulated Kiribati on the formulation of its first National Action Plan to eliminate 
gender-based violence, viewing it as a positive step towards the finalization of a national 
policy and action plan on disability issues. The Philippines understood the Government&#8217;s 
focus on urgently addressing the devastating effects of climate change, stating that small 
island States such as Kiribati needed the sustained support of the international community 
in order to adapt to climate change. The Philippines made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Concerning the issue of sexual orientation, the delegation appreciated the existence 
of homosexuality and the need to include it as a prohibited discriminatory ground in the 
Constitution. However, the delegation reiterated the high threshold required in order to 
adopt an amendment to the Bill of Rights.  The same would apply to the issue of 
discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>62. The delegation stated that a legislative reform on child protection had been 
undertaken. The delegation noted that conducting awareness-raising programmes 
throughout the country regarding legislative reform was a daunting task, and it 
acknowledged the assistance provided by UNICEF in that regard.  
</p>
<p>63. With respect to the issue of violence against children, the delegation stated that 
legislative reform was needed in order to comply with the CRC, which might take some 
time.  Kiribati had begun the process. 
</p>
<p>64. The delegation stated that Kiribati was finalizing its national policy on disabilities, 
which would be effective from 2010 to 2014; what remained was Cabinet approval. A draft 
action plan on disabilities was attached to the policy, which awaited the Government&#8217;s 
endorsement. The Government was providing support to people with disabilities through 
the provision of land, homes and financial resources. The delegation stated that Kiribati was 
collecting data regarding people with disabilities.  As its islands were scattered over a wide 
area, Kiribati had few data concerning people with disabilities, which would be required in 
order for the Government to make future plans and take effective decisions.  The 
Government hoped to endorse the policy and action plan once the information/data had 
been analysed. 
</p>
<p>65. Concerning the involvement of non-governmental organizations in the preparation 
of the national report, the delegation stated that the Government and non-governmental 
organizations had played an equal part in the process. The participation of non-</p>


<p>governmental organizations in the preparation of the national report had been very 
constructive, and the Government looked forward to the further engagement of such 
organizations in its future endeavours. 
</p>
