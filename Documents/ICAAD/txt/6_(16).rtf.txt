JUDGMENT

[1] This is an application for abandonment of appeal.

[2] On 26 November 2010, the High Court at Labasa, under its revisionary powers, sentenced the appellant to 7 years' imprisonment for robbery with violence committed on a taxi driver. On 6 January 2011, he filed an untimely appeal against sentence. 

[3] When this appeal was eventually listed for leave hearing, the appellant filed a notice of abandonment of appeal. He informed the Court that he is about to complete his sentence and is due for a release early next year. 

 [4] After hearing the appellant, we are satisfied that the appellant has made the decision to abandon his appeal freely and with the full understanding of the consequences of his decision.

[5] We grant him leave and dismiss the appeal.
