<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, as well as other relevant human rights instruments, including the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of 
Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices similar to Slavery, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as the 
Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the 
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review 
conferences, 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i>Recalling</i> the commitment to the full and effective implementation of and follow-up 
to all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council 
and their subsidiary bodies, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that the practice of child, early and forced marriage is widespread 
and occurs in all regions of the world, and recognizing that it constitutes a violation, abuse 
or impairment of human rights, that it prevents individuals from living their lives free from 
all forms of violence and that it has adverse consequences on the enjoyment of human 
rights, such as the right to education, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
including sexual and reproductive health, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> States&#8217; human rights obligations and commitments to prevent and 
eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, which disproportionately affects 
women and girls, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>by the impact of deep-rooted gender inequalities, norms and 
stereotypes, and harmful traditional practices, perceptions and customs that are obstacles to 
the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular of women and girls, and are among the 
primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that child, early and forced marriage continues to be an impediment to 
not only the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but to the 
development of the community as a whole, and that the empowerment of and investment in 
women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in decisions that affect them, is a 
key factor in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and 
poverty and is critical for sustainable development and economic growth, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> that the complex and challenging nature of child, early and forced 
marriage necessitates the collective efforts of Governments, lawmakers, judicial authorities, 
law enforcement officials, traditional and religious leaders, civil society, media, the private 
sector and other relevant stakeholders to address the root causes of this practice that exists 
in different economic, social and cultural settings, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing further</i> that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage 
contributes to impairing the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and 
sustainable and inclusive economic growth and social cohesion, and that therefore the 
elimination of child, early and force marriage should be considered in the discussion of the 
post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, at its twenty-sixth session, a panel discussion on 
preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, with a particular focus on 
challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps, and requests the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to liaise with States, relevant 
United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, relevant special procedures, civil society, 
including relevant children and youth organizations, and national human rights institutions, 
with a view to ensuring their participation and also requests the Office of the High 
Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report, in 
consultation with States, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, civil society and 
other relevant stakeholders, on preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, 
with a particular focus on challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation 
gaps, to be submitted to the Human Rights Council prior to its twenty-sixth session, and to 
guide the panel discussion.
