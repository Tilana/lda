<p> At its 24th meeting, on 10 June 2010, the Human Rights Council decided to adopt 
the following text: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note of the fact </i>that the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in the Sudan was unable, for medical reasons, to present his report 
(A/HRC/14/41) to the Council at its fourteenth session, as originally scheduled, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides</i>, given the exceptional nature of the circumstances and 
without setting a precedent, to proceed with a technical extension of the mandate of 
the independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan until the end of 
the fifteenth session of the Council to allow an interactive dialogue to be held with 
him. This is without prejudice to the relevant provisions of Council resolution 5/1 of 
18 June 2007; 
</p>
<p> 2. It is understood that the independent expert will continue his work 
until the end of the fifteenth session and will be in a position to complement his 
report thereupon, if he so decides, at that session. It is also understood that the issue 
of the extension of the mandate will be discussed at that session.&#8221; 
</p>
