</p>
<p><i>Taking note with appreciation </i>of the report of the High Commissioner on the 
</p>
<p>incompatibility between democracy and racism, presented to the Human Rights Council at 
</p>
<p>its twenty-first session,<footnote name="1">A/HRC/21/27. </footnote>  
</p>
<p><i>Remaining alarmed </i>at the rise of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that democracy, transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory 
</p>
<p>governance responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, and respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are essential for the effective prevention 
</p>
<p>and elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that acts of racial violence do not constitute legitimate expressions of 
</p>
<p>opinion but rather unlawful acts or offences, and that acts of racism and discrimination 
</p>
<p>endorsed by Governments and public authorities may threaten democracy,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the importance of freedom of speech and expression and the 
</p>
<p>fundamental role of education and other active policies in the promotion of tolerance and 
</p>
<p>respect for others and in the construction of pluralistic and inclusive societies,  
</p>
<p><i>Condemning</i> political platforms and organizations based on racism, xenophobia or 
</p>
<p>doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination, and legislation and practices 
</p>
<p>based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as incompatible 
</p>
<p>with democracy and transparent and accountable governance,  
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance that States reinforce their commitment to promote 
</p>
<p>tolerance and human rights and to fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and related intolerance as a way to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and transparent 
</p>
<p>and accountable governance,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that any form of impunity condoned by public authorities for crimes 
</p>
<p>motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and 
</p>
<p>democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such acts,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance condoned by governmental policies violate human rights, as established in the 
</p>
<p>relevant international and regional human rights instruments, and are incompatible with 
</p>
<p>democracy, the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides </i>to convene, at its thirty-first session, a panel discussion on the 
</p>
<p>incompatibility between democracy and racism with a view to identifying challenges and 
</p>
<p>good practices;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>organize the panel discussion in consultation with States, relevant United Nations bodies, 
</p>
<p>funds and programmes, treaty bodies, special procedures and regional human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, as well as with civil society, non-governmental organizations, national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions and specialized national equality bodies as appropriate with a view to 
</p>
<p>ensuring their participation in the panel discussion;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>4. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the 
</p>
<p>panel discussion for submission to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-second session. 
</p>
