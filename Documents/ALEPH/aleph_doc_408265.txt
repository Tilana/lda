Q2  
 
Sales and production 
 
Global demand for base metals remains stable, but the growth rate is estimated to have decreased. Base metal 
prices fell slightly during the quarter but recovered towards the end of the period. The US dollar continued to 
weaken.  
 
Boliden’s revenues for the quarter totalled SEK 9 896 million (SEK 8 908 m). Sales fell slightly in comparison 
with the preceding quarter primarily due to a weaker US dollar. 
 
Mined  metal  production  fell  slightly  in  comparison  with  the  previous  quarter,  with  the  exception  of  gold. 
Production at Aitik increased sharply, however, in comparison with the weak first quarter, due to the successful 
implementation of various action programmes. 
 
Smelters’  metal  production  fell  in  comparison  with  the  previous  quarter,  primarily  as  a  result  of  planned 
maintenance  shutdowns.  Production  of  zinc  was  unchanged  while  precious  metals  and  copper  increased  in 
comparison with the previous year. Lead production fell.   
 
Operating profit 
 
The operating profit totalled SEK 1 134 million (SEK 1 123 m). The revaluation of process inventory impacted 
the quarterly profit to the tune of SEK 14 million. If the revaluation is excluded, the operating profit totalled 
SEK 1 120 million (SEK 1 130 m).  
 
The operating profit for Business Area Mines totalled SEK 1 064 million (SEK 1 034 m) and the operating profit 
excluding the revaluation of process inventory for Business Area Smelters totalled SEK 143 million (SEK 110 m). 
The BA Smelters’ profit includes the effect of maintenance shutdowns, totalling SEK -180 million (SEK -145 m).

Interim Report January–June 2011 
 
The volume effect was weakly positive in comparison with both the previous quarter and the preceding year. The 
lower smelter production volume was compensated for by better yields and increased production at Aitik.  
 
Costs  have  increased  in  relation  to  both  comparison  periods.  Maintenance  shutdowns  and  holiday  staff  have 
increased  costs  compared  to  the  previous  quarter.  In  comparison  to  previous  year  costs  for  external  services, 
staff, consumables and energy have increased. Cost development, to a great extent, is attributable to higher ore 
production and remedial action plans in connection with the start up of production in Aitik. 
 
The combined effect on the profit of changes to prices and terms was limited in comparison with the previous 
quarter at SEK 47  million. Metal prices and  terms  were lower during the second quarter, but metal  price and 
exchange rate hedging made a positive contribution. A weaker US dollar had a negative effect on exchange rates 
of SEK -108 million. The pricing effect was strongly positive in comparison with the corresponding period last 
year, but this was largely counteracted by negative exchange rate effects.  
 
Net financial items during the second quarter of the year totalled SEK -52 million (SEK -127 m). Net financial 
items remained largely unchanged in comparison with the previous quarter. The interest on fines totalling SEK  
-52 million that was charged to net financial items during the corresponding period last year is the primary reason 
for the improvement. The average interest rate during the quarter was 3,08 per cent as opposed to 3,22 per cent 
in the previous quarter and 2,50 per cent last year. 
 
The profit before tax totalled SEK 1 082 million (SEK 996 m). The net profit was SEK 804 million (SEK 755 m), 
corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 2,94 (SEK 2,76).

Before financing (Free cash flow) 
 
The  cash  flow  from  operating  activities,  before  investments,  totalled  SEK  234  million  (SEK  1  007  m).  In 
comparison with the first quarter of 2011, however, the free cash flow fell by SEK 1 238 million. The cash flow 
for the quarter was negatively affected by an increase in operating capital due to higher inventories from relatively 
low levels. Accounts payable were, furthermore, lower than normal at the period end. Tax paid during the quarter 
totalled SEK -79 million (SEK -95 m).   
 
Financial position 
 
Boliden’s net debt totalled SEK 6 322 million (SEK 7 734 m) on 30th June 2011 and the net debt/equity ratio at 
that time was 33 per cent (46%). The average term of total limits on borrowing approved was 3,7 years (4,3 yrs.). 
The average interest level for Boliden’s debt portfolio at that time was 2,97 per cent (2,45%) and fixed interest 
term was 1,2 years (1,7 yrs.).  
 
The contribution to shareholders’ equity of the net market valuation of financial instruments, after fiscal effects, 
totalled SEK -261 million (SEK 168 m) on 30th June 2011.  
 
Boliden’s current liquidity, in the form of liquid assets and unutilised binding credit facilities, totalled SEK 8 763 
million (SEK 9 644 m) at the end of the second quarter.

Interim Report January–June 2011 
 
MARKET PERFORMANCE 
 
Industrial  activity  levels  in  mature  economies,  with  the  exception  of  Japan,  increased  in  comparison  with  the 
previous year and were on a par with levels during the first quarter. Industrial capacity utilisation levels remain 
below  the  norm  in  several  countries,  while  production  levels  for  several  metal-consuming  sectors  have 
normalised.  
 
Activity levels in the Chinese economy remained high during the second quarter, with a high growth rate for both 
investments and industrial production as well as among end-consumers of base metals. Growth in certain metal-
consuming sectors was, however, lower than in previous quarters.  
 
Zinc 
 
Global  demand  for  zinc  has  increased  by  approximately  1  per  cent  in  comparison  with  the  second  quarter  of 
2010. The automotive industry’s production of private cars in the USA and Europe increased, but activity in the 
construction  industry  continued  weak  overall,  with  the  exception  of  a  recovery  in  certain European  countries. 
Automotive production, investments and industrial production all fell sharply in Japan. 
 
Global smelter production of zinc is estimated to have increased by 1 per cent in comparison with the second 
quarter  of  2010.  A  sharp  fall  in  Japanese  production  was  compensated  for  by  an  increase in  China  and  sharp 
increases in India and South America. Smelter production of zinc exceeded demand and official stock levels have 
increased by almost 25 per cent.  
 
Mined production remained unchanged in comparison with the second quarter of 2010. Production fell in South 
America  but  was  compensated  for  by  increased  production  in  other  major  producing  countries.  Concentrate 
production is adjudged to have matched demand from smelters.   
 
European spot premiums remained stable from the first quarter to the second. TC/RC fell slightly on the spot 
market during the latter half of the quarter, and spot levels  are still below the realised level in the benchmark 
contracts expected to obtain for 2011.   
 
Copper 
 
Global demand for copper increased by approximately 1 per cent in comparison with the second quarter of 2010, 
corresponding to a slowdown in the growth rate from the first quarter, when demand increased by 4 per cent. 
Demand has fallen in mature economies but has continued to increase in China and other developing countries.  
 
Global  copper  production  by  smelters  fell  by  2  per  cent  in  comparison  with  the  second  quarter  of  2010. 
Production in China is estimated to have increased by 13 per cent but to have fallen in the rest of the world by 7 
per cent.  
 
Official global stock levels for copper have increased by just over 10 per cent since the turn of the year, but fell 
during the second quarter.  
 
Mined copper production increased by 2 per cent in comparison with the second quarter of 2010. Production 
increased in Europe and North America, but fell in Australia. Production of mined concentrate was on a par with 
demand by smelters, ignoring any changes in stocks.  
 
Spot premiums in Europe rose once more after the sharp fall during the first quarter, but the level is still below 
that of the European benchmark contracts. The mined concentrate market is adjudged to have been in balance, 
but imports of concentrate by China fell and concentrate availability increased in the West. Spot market TC/RC 
rose and are above the full-year benchmark contract level.

Interim Report January–June 2011 
 
Lead 
 
Demand for lead in developing countries in general, and in China in particular, continues to grow apace with the 
increasing demand for batteries particularly in the automotive industry. Supply has been periodically impacted by 
the  shutdown  of  smelter  capacity  for  environmental  reasons.  Global  lead  consumption  is  estimated  to  have 
increased by approximately 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 in comparison with the corresponding period 
in 2010, and global metal production in smelters by approximately 9 per cent. 
 
Global mined production is estimated to have risen by approximately 9 per cent in comparison with the second 
quarter of 2010 and to have been on a par with smelters’ demand. Lead supply from mines tracks, to some extent, 
mined production of zinc in that lead is a subsidiary metal at many zinc mines. 
 
Lead stock levels on the LME have, in common with zinc stock levels, risen during the second quarter of 2011 
and have increased by over 50 per cent since the turn of the year.  
 
Gold and silver 
 
Gold and silver consumption in the jewellery industry and for industrial applications has increased over the last 12 
months,  but  the  price  trend  has  primarily  been  driven  by  increased  demand  from  financial  players.  This  was 
particularly true of silver during the last 6 months.  
 
Sulphuric acid 
 
Demand for sulphuric acid by a number of important customer segments continued to be good during the second 
quarter and prices rose still further in northern Europe.  
 
METAL PRICES 
 
Boliden’s revenues are affected by the global market prices of base and precious metals. Base metals are traded 
daily  on  the  London  Metal  Exchange  (LME),  where  prices  are  set.  Precious  metal  prices  are  set  daily  by  the 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). Boliden’s income is also affected by treatment and refining charges 
and metal premiums. The value of so-called free metals in concentrates also affects the Group’s income. 
 
Average prices for zinc, copper and lead fell during the second quarter in comparison with the previous quarter, 
but rose for gold and silver. Metal prices rose sharply in comparison with the previous year, but the effect was 
largely  eliminated  by  negative  exchange  rate  fluctuations  –  in  particular,  the  weakening  of  the  US  dollar.  For 
Boliden’s most important metal, zinc, this means that the average price in comparison with the second quarter of 
last year fell in SEK.

EXCHANGE RATES 
 
The majority of Boliden’s revenues and costs of raw materials bought in are in US dollars, but the majority of its 
other costs are in Swedish kronor, euro and Norwegian kroner. The development of the US dollar consequently 
has a significant effect on the Group’s profit.  
 
During the second quarter, the US dollar weakened further against the Swedish krona, the Norwegian krone, and 
the euro. The Swedish krona weakened slightly against the euro during the second quarter, but is still stronger 
against the euro than during the second quarter of 2010.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
 
The  following  table  contains  an  estimate  of  how  changes  in  market  terms  from  listings  on  30th  June  2011, 
calculated on the basis of Boliden’s planned production volume, affect the Group’s operating profit (EBIT) over 
the next twelve-month period. The sensitivity analysis is based on a number of assumptions and does not take 
into account the effects of metal price hedging, currency hedging, contracted TC/RC, or revaluations of process 
inventory in the smelters.

METAL PRICE AND CURRENCY HEDGING 
 
The  following  table  shows  Boliden’s  outstanding  metal  price  and  currency  hedging  on  30th  June  2011.  The 
Boliden  Group’s  production  is  otherwise,  in  every  significant  respect,  exposed  to  market  prices.  The  hedging 
reduces the effects on the Group’s profit of changes in the prices of these metals and exchange rate fluctuations. 
The hedged volume is based on long-term forecasts with regard to metal production by Boliden’s mines, that part 
of the TC/RC terms that is affected by metal price changes (price escalators), and free metals from the smelters.

Volume effect 
 
The volume effect was limited during the quarter. 
 
Costs 
 
The negative cost effect in relation to the previous quarter is primarily a result of higher payroll costs and higher 
materials costs due to increased production at Aitik. The increase in production at Aitik has also led to an increase 
in the costs of external services. The cost increase in relation to the previous year is due to increased energy costs, 
payroll costs and increased costs for external services and materials due largely to increased production levels at 
Aitik and in the Boliden Area. The cost increase in relation to last year also includes an increase of SEK 31 million 
in  depreciation,  primarily  attributable  to  Aitik.  Some  of  the  Aitik-related  costs  are  directly  attributable  to  the 
remedial action plans implemented as part of running-in production at the mine.   
 
Prices and terms 
 
Lower average prices and the US dollar’s weakening against the Swedish krona and the euro negatively affected 
the profit in comparison with the first quarter of 2011 with SEK 88 million. The effect was compensated for, in 
part, by metal price and currency hedging. Metal price trends had a positive effect on the profit in comparison 
with the previous year, but this was largely moderated by the Swedish krona’s exchange rate trend.

Information on production and metal contents at individual units can be found on page 23. 
 
Zinc  concentrate  production  remained  largely  unchanged  in  comparison  with  the  previous  quarter.  Zinc 
production increased in the Boliden Area due to a change in the ore mix, but fell in Garpenberg as a result of 
lower grades on a par with the ore reserve’s average level. Tara's production was stable. 
 
Copper production levels remained unchanged in comparison with both the previous quarter and the previous 
year. Higher levels of  ore production at  Aitik compensated, falling  grades notwithstanding, for lower levels  of 
copper production in the Boliden Area, which were caused by a change in the ore mix.  
 
Mined production at Aitik has stabilised during the quarter, but production there is still being run in. The old 
crusher has been connected up to the new facility, according to plan, and came on line at the end of the period. 
Full capacity will be achieved by 2014. Mining in the northern floor of the open pit, where the highest levels are 
found, is now largely concluded and the next few years will see ores mined at levels where the grades are below 
the ore reserve’s average level of 0,25.  
 
Gold production also increased in relation to both comparison periods as a consequence of higher grades and 
volumes at Aitik. Silver production increased at Aitik but fell in the Boliden Area and at Garpenberg, which is 
linked to grade trends and changes in the ore mix in the Boliden Area.  
 
Ongoing expansion projects 
 
The expansion of Garpenberg is proceeding according to plan. The new facilities will come on line in 2014 and 
full capacity will be achieved in 2015. Full operation will see ore production increase by approximately 80 per cent 
from current production levels of 1,4 million tonnes per annum.  
 
Preparations for the launch of gold and tellurium production at the Kankberg mine are proceeding according to 
plan. Production is scheduled to start in mid-2012 and will yield an average annual production of 1 150 kg of gold 
and 41 tonnes of tellurium.

BUSINESS AREA SMELTERS 
 
Business  Area  Smelters  comprises  the  Kokkola  and  Odda  zinc  smelters,  the  Rönnskär  and  Harjavalta  copper 
smelters, and the Bergsöe lead smelter.  It also includes the smelters’ concentrate purchases and metal sales.  The 
zinc  smelters’  production  primarily  comprises  zinc  metal,  but  also  includes  aluminium  fluoride,  which  is 
produced  at  Odda,  and  sulphuric  acid.  The  copper  smelters  primarily  produce  copper,  gold,  silver,  lead  and 
sulphuric  acid.  The  copper  smelters  also  recycle  metal  and  electronic  scrap.  Harjavalta  also  smelts  nickel 
concentrate. The Bergsöe lead smelter recycles lead metal, primarily from car batteries. 
 
REVENUES AND PROFITS ANALYSIS 
 
Business Area Smelters' operating profit, excluding the revaluation of process inventory, totalled SEK 143 million 
(SEK  110  m).  In  comparison  with  the  first  quarter  of  last  year,  however,  the  profit  fell  by  SEK  83  million. 
Approximately SEK 180 million (SEK 145 m) resulting from maintenance shutdowns was charged to the profit 
for the quarter.

Volume effect 
 
The volume effect was weakly positive in comparison with the previous quarter. This is primarily due to a higher 
percentage  of  secondary  raw  materials,  which  is  also  the  reason  for  the  improvement  in  comparison  with  the 
previous year.  
 
Costs 
 
Higher costs in conjunction with maintenance shutdowns negatively affected the profit with approximately SEK 
100 million in comparison with the previous quarter. Costs associated with consumables and energy increased in 
comparison with the corresponding quarter in 2010, particularly in Finland.

Prices and terms 
 
Prices and terms positively impacted the profit by SEK 84 million in relation to the first quarter. Higher prices for 
sulphuric acid, improved TC/RC for copper as well as higher metal premiums and a positive hedging result were 
counteracted by poorer TC for zinc and negative exchange rate effects totalling SEK 56 million. Improvements in 
prices  and  metal  premiums  in  comparison  with  last  year  yielded  a  positive  effect  on  the  profit.  If  negative 
exchange rate effects of SEK -278 million are included, this figure totals SEK 56 million.

Information on production at individual units can be found on page 24. 
 
Production  volumes  during  the  quarter  were  affected  by  maintenance  shutdowns  in  Rönnskär,  Harjavalta  and 
Odda.  
 
Zinc  production  fell  slightly  in  comparison  with  the  first  quarter.  Odda  experienced  various  disruptions  after 
several quarters of good production stability. Production stability remained good at Kokkola.  
 
Production by the copper smelters fell by 6 per cent and cathode production was affected by slightly lower raw 
material  grades.  Production  levels  at  Rönnskär  were  good,  with  increased  use  of  secondary  raw  materials. 
Harjavalta  experienced  disruptions  to  production  until  the  maintenance  shutdown  implemented  in  May,  but 
production levels were stable at the end of the quarter.   
 
Lead  production  fell  during  the  quarter due  to  the  prioritisation  of  production  utilising  secondary  copper  raw 
materials.  
 
Sulphuric acid production increased in comparison  with last  year as the acquisition  of Kemira’s sulphuric acid 
operations by the Kokkola zinc smelter was not included for the full quarter.   
 
Gold production fell in comparison with the previous quarter, primarily due to lower grades in component raw 
materials at Rönnskär. Silver production levels remained unchanged. 
 
Bergsöe’s  production  during  the  second  quarter  improved  in  tandem  with  the  improvement  in  raw  material 
availability.   
 
Expansion project in progress 
 
The expansion of electronic scrap recycling capacity at Rönnskär is proceeding according to plan. The new facility 
will  be  completed  at  the  end  of  2011  and  will  come  on  line  during  the  first  quarter  of  2012,  at  which  time 
Boliden’s electronic scrap recycling capacity will increase from 45 000 to 120 000 tonnes per year.   
 
Maintenance shutdown 
 
Maintenance  shutdowns  will  be  implemented  at  Bergsöe  and  Odda  during  the  third  quarter  of  2011.  The 
estimated combined effect on the operating profit is one of SEK -45 million.

Interim Report January–June 2011 
 
SUMMARY OF BOLIDEN’S PERFORMANCE DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR  
 
Revenues increased to SEK 20 054 million (SEK 17 224 m) during the first six months of the year. The increase 
is due to higher prices in US dollars, which were, however, largely eliminated by negative exchange rate effects. 
Increased  production  at  Rönnskär  and  increased  sales  of  sulphuric  acid  also  contributed  to  the  higher  sales 
figures.  
 
The operating profit excluding the revaluation of process inventory rose to SEK 2 620 million (SEK 2 172 m). 
The  operating  profit  was  positively  affected  by  increased  volumes  and  higher  prices,  but  was  counteracted  by 
higher  costs  and  negative  exchange  rate  effects.  The  operating  profit,  including  the  revaluation  of  process 
inventory, increased to SEK 2 492 million (SEK 2 353 m).   
 
The realised results of metal price and currency hedging, totalling SEK 93 million (SEK 355 m) is included in the 
result for the period.  
 
Net financial items totalled SEK -109 million (SEK -161 m). The improvement in comparison with the previous 
year is largely due to the fact that the corresponding period last year was affected by interest payments on fines 
totalling SEK -52 million. The net profit for the first six months of the year was SEK 1 765 million (SEK 1 633 
m), and earnings per share increased to SEK 6,45 (SEK 5,97). 
 
Investments totalled SEK -1 684 million (SEK -1 405 m). The free cash flow totalled SEK -342 million (SEK 149 
m).

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  
 
Employees 
 
 in Boliden during the first six months of the year was 4 433. Of these, 2 482 
The average number of employees1
work in Sweden, 986 in Finland, 603 in Ireland, 347 in Norway and 15 in other countries. The average number of 
Group employees in 2010 was 4 412. 
 
The sick leave rate during the second quarter was 3,8 per cent, corresponding to a decrease in comparison with 
the previous quarter of 0,8 percentage points. The sick leave rate for the year as a whole in 2010 was 4,0 per cent. 
The Group’s long-term goal is for the sick leave rate to be no higher than 4,0 per cent. 
 
The accident frequency during the second quarter was 5,6 cases per one million hours worked. The figure does, 
however, represent a decrease in comparison with the first  quarter, when the accident frequency was 6,8. The 
accident frequency for 2010 as a whole was 8,2. 
 
Environment 
 
Environmental performance was generally good during the second quarter. Three incidents involving spills and 
leaks, however, have been reported, one of which resulted in limit values being exceeded.   
 
Kokkola reported an incident entailing the limit value for discharges of zinc into water being exceeded during the 
second quarter, while Harjavalta reported a leak of electrolysis solution into water. Both incidents were reported 
to the authorities and measures taken to prevent similar incidents.  
 
Aitik reported a substantial spill of approximately 100 litres of oil during the second quarter. The contaminated 
soil was dug up and removed for decontamination. Preventative measures have been put in place to prevent any 
repetition of this incident.  
 
Boliden’s operations at all of its facilities are subject to licensing requirements and are conducted in accordance 
with the legislation in the various countries in which they operate. Group-wide environmental goals have been 
defined for the period from 2009 to 2013. The goals relate to emissions and discharges of metals into air and 
water,  energy  consumption,  and  emissions  of  sulphur  dioxide  and  carbon  dioxide  into  the  air.  The  goals  are 
followed up on a monthly basis, with the exception of carbon dioxide emissions/energy consumption, which are 
followed  up  the  end  of  each  calendar  year.  Goals  and  results  are  presented  in  Boliden’s  Sustainability  Report 
2010.  
 
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTY FACTORS 
 
The Group’s and Parent Company’s significant risks and uncertainty factors include market and external risks, 
financial  risks,  operational  and  commercial  risks,  and  legal  risks.  The  global  economic  climate  in  general,  and 
global  industrial  production  in  particular,  affect  demand  for  zinc,  copper  and  other  base  metals.  For  further 
information on risks and risk management, please see Boliden’s Annual Report 2010: Risk Management on page 
40 and Note 19 financial risk management, on pages 71-72.

PREPARATION PRINCIPLES FOR THE INTERIM REPORT 
 
The Consolidated Interim Report has been prepared in accordance with the International  Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) approved by the EU, and with the Swedish Financial Reporting Board recommendation RFR1, 
complementary accounting rules for Groups, which specifies the supplementary information required in addition 
to that required under IFRS standards, pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. This 
Interim Report has been prepared for the Group in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, and in 
accordance  with  the  Swedish  Annual  Accounts  Act.  The  Parent  Company  accounts  have  been  prepared  in 
accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act 
 
A number of new supplements to IFRS standards and interpretations by IFRIC came into force on 1st January 
2011.  None  of  the  changes  that  have  come  into  force  have  had  any  significant  effect  on  Boliden’s  financial 
reports.  
 
IAS 19, Employee Benefits. The PRI non-profit organisation has decided to update the undertakings over the life 
of the plan in respect of the calculation of pension liabilities in accordance with ITP 2, as of 30th June 2011. PRI 
Pensionsgaranti has calculated that the ITP 2 liability, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19, will generally 
increase  by  approximately  8  per  cent.  The  amended  undertakings  over  the  life  of  the  plan  are  classified  as  an 
actuarial loss. Boliden recognises actuarial gains/losses using the so-called corridor approach and the effect of the 
amended undertakings over the life of the plan is consequently postponed. The change will not affect the profit 
for the year.  
 
Boliden has made no amendments to the accounting principles applied in conjunction with the preparation of 
this Interim Report. 
 
The undersigned declare that the Interim Report gives a true and fair overview of the Parent Company’s and the 
Group’s operations, position and results and describes the material risks and uncertainties faced by the Parent 
Company and the companies that make up the Group.

Interim Report January–June 2011 
 
Auditor’s Review Report on interim financial statements prepared in accordance with IAS 34 
and Chapter 9 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (SFS 1995:1554) 
 
Introduction 
 
We reviewed the accompanying balance sheet of Boliden AB as of June 30, 2011 and the related summary of 
income, changes in equity and cash-flows for the six-month period then ended, and a summary of significant 
accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are 
responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of this interim financial information in accordance with IAS 
34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim financial 
information based on our review.  
 
Scope of Review 
 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements, SÖG 2410, “Review of 
Interim Financial Statements Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Swedish 
Federation of Authorized Public Accountants. A review of interim financial information consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing, ISA, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim 
financial information does not give a true and fair view of the financial position of the entity as at June 30, 2011, 
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the six-month period then ended, for the group in accordance 
with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and for the parent company in accordance with the Swedish 
Annual Accounts Act.
