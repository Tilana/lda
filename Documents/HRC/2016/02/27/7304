<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Azerbaijan, two members of the Working 
</p>
<p>Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
</p>
<p>enterprises, Puvan Selvanathan and Pavel Sulyandziga, visited, pursuant to Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 17/4 and 26/22, the State from 18 to 27 August 2014. The objective of 
</p>
<p>the visit was to assess efforts to prevent and address the adverse human rights impact of 
</p>
<p>business-related activities in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>2. The experts met with government authorities from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Internal Affairs, Justice, Labour and Social Protection, Economy and Industry, and Energy. 
</p>
<p>In addition, it held meetings with representatives of the Supreme Court, the State 
</p>
<p>Committee for Family, Women and Children&#8217;s Affairs, the State Agency on Procurement, 
</p>
<p>the State Town Building and Architecture Committee, the State Agency for Public Service 
</p>
<p>and Social Innovations of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the State Oil Fund, 
</p>
<p>and the State Committee for Property Affairs. In addition, they met with members of 
</p>
<p>Parliament, and representatives of the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(Ombudsman), the Institute of Human Rights, the Azerbaijan Trade Union Confederation, 
</p>
<p>and the Azerbaijan Republic Chamber of Commerce, as well as with representatives of a 
</p>
<p>range of local and international business enterprises, civil society organizations, the media, 
</p>
<p>the diplomatic community, and United Nations agencies in Azerbaijan. The experts 
</p>
<p>travelled to Ganja, the second-largest city, where they met with local public authorities and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society and businesses, including workers and managers.  
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group focused, in particular, on the extractive industries, including the 
</p>
<p>oil and gas sectors and the aluminium-producing industry. It also examined labour issues, 
</p>
<p>corruption and the rights and needs of individuals from groups or populations in a 
</p>
<p>vulnerable situation, as well as the administration of access to remedy, the registration of 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations and the situation facing human rights defenders and 
</p>
<p>independent media.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group is grateful to the Government of Azerbaijan for its invitation 
</p>
<p>and for its assistance before, during and after the visit to the State. It also thanks the 
</p>
<p>organizations, businesses and individuals with whom it met during its visit, and who 
</p>
<p>facilitated site visits and meetings with relevant stakeholders. It appreciated the open and 
</p>
<p>constructive discussions on the progress and challenges in the protection of human rights in 
</p>
<p>the context of business activities.  
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Working Group describes its findings and makes 
</p>
<p>recommendations for actions that may assist in addressing and remedying the challenges 
</p>
<p>identified. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It has an estimated 
</p>
<p>population of 9.7 million. Situated at the crossroads between Eastern Europe and Western 
</p>
<p>Asia, the country is divided into 66 districts, 77 cities and 13 urban districts. Since 2003, 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has been led by President Ilham Aliyev. The country&#8217;s first Parliament, the <i>Milli 
</i></p>
<p><i>Majlis</i>, was elected in 1995 and consists of 125 deputies. The judiciary is structured as a 
</p>
<p>three-tiered court system that consists of trial courts of general and special jurisdiction, 
</p>
<p>appellate courts, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. 
</p>
<p>7. An unresolved armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has resulted in more than 600,000 internally displaced persons today and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>thousands more refugees.1 A ceasefire signed in 1994 remains fragile, with reports of 
</p>
<p>sporadic violations. Some of the interlocutors with whom the Working Group met 
</p>
<p>described the situation as a &#8220;frozen conflict&#8221;; when discussing business and human rights, 
</p>
<p>interlocutors repeatedly raised the issue of internally displaced persons as one of the main 
</p>
<p>human rights issues affecting the country.  
</p>
<p>8. Azerbaijan has experienced a period of sustained economic growth over the past 
</p>
<p>decades, driven by increasing revenues from oil and gas. Overall private companies, 
</p>
<p>including international corporations, play an increasing role in the economy, following a 
</p>
<p>policy of privatization of State-owned enterprises since the country&#8217;s independence in 
</p>
<p>1991.  
</p>
<p>9. Oil and gas have always been the mainstay of the State&#8217;s economy. According to 
</p>
<p>information provided by the Government, in 2014, the oil and gas sector accounted for 39 
</p>
<p>per cent of GDP; oil, oil products, natural gas and electricity made up 92 per cent of 
</p>
<p>exports, and the oil sector made up 65 per cent of State budget revenues. The main actor in 
</p>
<p>the sector is the State-owned oil company SOCAR, which works in partnership with several 
</p>
<p>international oil and gas companies. In recent years, the Government has sought to 
</p>
<p>diversify the economy to ease the country&#8217;s dependence on hydrocarbon revenues, a sector 
</p>
<p>that, despite its economic significance, accounts for less than 1 per cent of total 
</p>
<p>employment.
2
 Azerbaijan has witnessed a construction boom in the past decade, mainly 
</p>
<p>since the Government embarked on a programme of urban renewal largely in the capital 
</p>
<p>city, Baku. Other significant industries include telecommunications, agriculture, 
</p>
<p>manufacturing and the service sectors, particularly wholesale and retail trade, and hotels 
</p>
<p>and restaurants services.  
</p>
<p>10. High economic growth in the 2000s saw the Government initiate large public sector 
</p>
<p>investment programmes and policies to expand social assistance (such as social protection 
</p>
<p>transfers to the population) and to increase wages. This helped to substantially reduce 
</p>
<p>poverty and improve the distribution of wealth. There was a steep decline in poverty rates 
</p>
<p>from 46.7 per cent in 2002 to 8.4 per cent in 2011;3 the World Bank estimated that poverty 
</p>
<p>stood at 6 per cent of the population in 2012.
4
 The average monthly nominal wage of 
</p>
<p>workers increased from 44.3 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) in 2000 to 444.3 AZN in 2014.  
</p>
<p>11. The proportion of low-wage earners has, however, increased since 2000, reaching 40 
</p>
<p>per cent of the population in 2010.
5
 Inequality remains high, especially in urban areas and 
</p>
<p>between genders. The 2008 Living Standards Measurement Survey showed the country-
</p>
<p>wide Gini coefficient to be 31, with inequality in cities higher at 32.8 and lower in rural 
</p>
<p>areas at 27.1.6 Azerbaijan ranked 62 out of 149 countries in the 2013 UNDP Gender 
</p>
<p>Inequality Index. Women&#8217;s average wages are less than half those of men (56.8 per cent in 
</p>
<p>2009 &#8211; a steady increase since data were first collected in 2003), despite the fact that 
</p>
<p>women make up almost half of the labour force. The labour market is also heavily gender 
</p>
<p>segregated, even though the educational qualifications of women and men are almost 
</p>
<p>equivalent. Women tend to work in low-wage sectors and do not move far up the pay

<p>ladder. The proportion of women in executive positions has stagnated at around 10 per cent 
</p>
<p>over the past decade.7 
</p>
<p>12. According to data provided by the Government, unemployment has steadily 
</p>
<p>declined over the past decade, from 9.2 per cent in 2013 to 4.9 per cent in 2014. Its recent 
</p>
<p>decrease (of 0.3 per cent between 2012 and 2013) was due to job creation in the non-
</p>
<p>tradable sectors, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, and in retail trade. Youth 
</p>
<p>unemployment and informal employment continue, however, to pose a challenge. The 
</p>
<p>country has a young population: 40 per cent are younger than 24 years of age. Important 
</p>
<p>advances have, however, been made to address youth unemployment, which dropped to 29 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2012 from 42 per cent in 1999.8 The share of people working without formal 
</p>
<p>labour contracts has stood consistently at 67 per cent in recent years, a problem that 
</p>
<p>particularly affects women and workers in regions outside Baku.9  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legislative and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Azerbaijan has signed all nine of the core international human rights treaties and has 
</p>
<p>ratified or acceded to eight of them.10 It has also signed, and in some cases ratified, all 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocols, with the exception of two.11 In addition, Azerbaijan has ratified all eight 
</p>
<p>core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) that cover four categories 
</p>
<p>of principles and rights: freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; the 
</p>
<p>elimination of forced labour; the abolition of child labour; and the elimination of 
</p>
<p>discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. It has also ratified 44 of the 177 
</p>
<p>ILO technical conventions and four ILO governance conventions relating to labour 
</p>
<p>inspection, employment policy and tripartite consultations. 
</p>
<p>14. The country has a monist legal system. The Constitution,12 adopted by referendum in 
</p>
<p>1995, states that international agreements undertaken by Azerbaijan (including international 
</p>
<p>human rights treaties) constitute an integral part of the legislative system (art. 148, II). 
</p>
<p>According to article 151, whenever there is disagreement between international agreements 
</p>
<p>and treaties and domestic normative-legal acts (except the Constitution and acts accepted 
</p>
<p>by referendum), the provisions of international agreements take precedence. 
</p>
<p>15. The Constitution protects a range of human rights, including the right to life (art. 
</p>
<p>27), equality before the law and prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race, 
</p>
<p>nationality, religion, language, sex, origin, financial position, occupation, political 
</p>
<p>convictions, membership of political parties, trade unions and other public organizations 
</p>
<p>(art. 25). In addition, the Constitution stipulates that nobody may be subject to torture or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment (art. 46), and protects the rights to property, freedom of 
</p>
<p>thought and speech, and a healthy environment. It also provides protections for workers 
</p>
<p>(art. 35) and the right of workers to establish and join trade unions (art. 58). The 
</p>
<p>Constitution grants citizens the right to appeal decisions and allows them to criticize the 
</p>

</p>
<p> 10  Azerbaijan is yet to ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance, which it signed in 2007. 
</p>
<p> 11  Azerbaijan has signed but not ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It has also neither signed nor ratified the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.

<p>activity or work of State bodies, their officials, political parties, trade unions or other public 
</p>
<p>organizations, and also the activity or work of individuals (art. 57). 
</p>
<p>16. The Government has a number of key policy documents that focus on human rights 
</p>
<p>and broader social and economic issues. In December 2011, a presidential decree approved 
</p>
<p>a national programme of action to improve the protection of human rights and freedoms in 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Azerbaijan. The programme document comprises five chapters, focusing on 
</p>
<p>improvement of the regulatory and legal framework; the protection of the rights of various 
</p>
<p>population groups; improving the activity of government agencies; educational, scientific, 
</p>
<p>analytical and awareness-raising activities in the area of human rights; and cooperation with 
</p>
<p>international organizations in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The &#8220;Azerbaijan 2020: Look into the Future&#8221; development concept,13 approved by 
</p>
<p>presidential degree in December 2012, was designed to address current social and economic 
</p>
<p>challenges. Its main policy objectives include (a) to diversify the economy to reduce 
</p>
<p>dependence on oil and gas through the development of human capital to lay the foundation 
</p>
<p>for a transition to a knowledge-based economy; (b) to develop the social sphere by 
</p>
<p>improving the general welfare of the population, including through facilitated access to 
</p>
<p>quality education, health care and social security systems, improved labour conditions and 
</p>
<p>the creation of equal opportunities for women; and (c) to deepen democracy by improving 
</p>
<p>the business environment and ensuring human rights and freedoms and the active status of 
</p>
<p>civil society in public life. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Awareness of business and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>18. The meetings held by the Working Group with representatives of key stakeholders, 
</p>
<p>including of the Government, business enterprises and civil society revealed that, in 
</p>
<p>general, awareness of business and human rights issues and of the Guiding Principles on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights was limited. At the same time, there are also indications of 
</p>
<p>progress and an increasing recognition of the importance of the business and human rights 
</p>
<p>agenda.  
</p>
<p>19. Scant reference was made during meetings held by the Working Group to any 
</p>
<p>relationship between business activities and human rights beyond the protection of 
</p>
<p>workers&#8217; rights. In the Working Group&#8217;s dialogue with representatives of business, the 
</p>
<p>latter sought advice on how human rights considerations might inform their activities given 
</p>
<p>that there was a clear need for further guidance and assistance to business in this area.  
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group recognizes that business may be less familiar with human rights 
</p>
<p>issues than Governments and civil society, and that it may face challenges in integrating 
</p>
<p>and interpreting human rights within corporate systems and decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>The recent establishment of a United Nations Global Compact Local Network shows that 
</p>
<p>some business enterprises are beginning to take human rights-related issues into 
</p>
<p>consideration. The Local Network, together with business associations, could play an 
</p>
<p>important role in raising awareness about and demystifying human rights among their 
</p>
<p>members.  
</p>
<p>21. The Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) is another 
</p>
<p>example of new attention being given to business and human rights issues. Since its 2014 
</p>
<p>edition, the annual reports of the Ombudsman include a section on &#8220;business and human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221; containing descriptions of activities undertaken in this area, including discussions 
</p>
<p>with relevant government authorities, national confederations of trade unions and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 See www.president.az/files/future_en.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>employers, and civil society organizations. Also, in 2013, the Ombudsman facilitated the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a working group composed of relevant State bodies and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations. At the initiative of the Office, the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights<b> </b>have been translated into the Azerbaijani language and distributed to the 
</p>
<p>members of the Working Group and to civil society organizations. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>welcomes these and other such initiatives, which provide a clear opportunity for raising 
</p>
<p>awareness and the inclusion of the human rights agenda in national development.  
</p>
<p>22. In general, when the Working Group asked questions about the country&#8217;s most 
</p>
<p>salient business and human rights issues, the public authorities met during the mission 
</p>
<p>typically mentioned two areas: (a) the situation facing internally displaced persons and 
</p>
<p>refugees as a consequence of the armed conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh 
</p>
<p>region of Azerbaijan; and (b) the &#8220;right of entrepreneurs&#8221; to start and develop a business in 
</p>
<p>the country.  
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group acknowledges that, in the national context, the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned issues are highly important ones. At the same time, it is important to note that 
</p>
<p>these issues are not central to the framework set out in the Guiding Principle focused on the 
</p>
<p>obligation of the State and the responsibility of business enterprises to prevent and protect 
</p>
<p>against business-related abuse of human rights.  
</p>
<p>24. Company programmes o assist internally displaced persons were mentioned as 
</p>
<p>examples of corporate social responsibility, not of how companies implemented their 
</p>
<p>responsibility to protect human rights throughout their operations.  
</p>
<p>25. The concept of the &#8220;right of entrepreneurs&#8221; is set out in a specific law, backed also 
</p>
<p>by policies such as the &#8220;National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support&#8221;14 and is referred to in 
</p>
<p>the Azerbaijan 2020 development concept (see para. 17 above). The Constitution of 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan also enshrines the &#8220;right for business activity&#8221;, stating that &#8220;everyone may, 
</p>
<p>using his/her possibilities, abilities and property, according to existing legislation, 
</p>
<p>individually or together with other citizens, carry out business activity or other kinds of 
</p>
<p>economic activity not prohibited by the law&#8221; (art. 59). Likewise, the national programme of 
</p>
<p>action to improve the protection of human rights and freedoms refers to &#8220;strengthening the 
</p>
<p>rights of entrepreneurs&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group appreciates the importance of protecting entrepreneurs and 
</p>
<p>small businesses against abuse. In particular, it was reported that those who start up a 
</p>
<p>business face obstacles relating to &#8220;red tape&#8221; and corruption, such as arbitrary exclusion 
</p>
<p>from bidding processes in public procurement. The Guiding Principles and the mandate of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group do not, however, focus on the human rights abuses faced by 
</p>
<p>enterprises, but rather on the abuses caused by their activities.  
</p>
<p>27. On the basis of its observations, the Working Group concludes that much 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising and capacity-building are needed to ensure that all stakeholders 
</p>
<p>understand the respective duties and responsibilities of States and business enterprises to 
</p>
<p>tackle human rights risks related to business activities.  
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group notes that the Azerbaijan 2020 development concept includes 
</p>
<p>the objective of developing &#8220;a strategy and State programme on corporate responsibility&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>This objective could offer an important opportunity to raise awareness about how the 
</p>
<p>international human rights framework provides specific guidance on the corporate 
</p>
<p>responsibility of business enterprises.  
</p>

</p>
<p>29. The State&#8217;s steady economic growth and diversification poses both opportunities and 
</p>
<p>challenges related to the impact of business on human rights. As previously noted by the 
</p>
<p>Working Group, all countries, particularly those undergoing economic development, need 
</p>
<p>to maximize the positive effects of business (including economic development, building 
</p>
<p>infrastructure and employment) while minimizing negative impact (such as damage to the 
</p>
<p>environment, the violation of labour rights, and reduced access to economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights) (A/HRC/23/32/Add.1, para. 4). With its changing economy, the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>institutions will come under pressure to keep up with effectively preventing and addressing 
</p>
<p>human rights risks. A national plan of action for the implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles could help the Government of Azerbaijan to identify areas of particular risk, 
</p>
<p>thereby allowing it to prioritize the strengthening of laws, regulations, policies and 
</p>
<p>oversight of human rights protection.  
</p>
<p>30. At the same time, the business enterprises operating in Azerbaijan, both foreign and 
</p>
<p>local, also have an independent responsibility to respect human rights. This responsibility is 
</p>
<p>a global standard of expected conduct for all businesses wherever they operate, regardless 
</p>
<p>of the State&#8217;s abilities and/or willingness to fulfil its own human rights obligations. To 
</p>
<p>avoid infringing on the human rights of others, the Guiding Principles state that business 
</p>
<p>enterprises should institute a policy commitment to meet their responsibility to respect 
</p>
<p>human rights; undertake ongoing human rights due diligence to identify, prevent, mitigate 
</p>
<p>and account for their human rights impact; and have in place processes to enable 
</p>
<p>remediation for any adverse human rights impact that they cause or to which they 
</p>
<p>contribute. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Issues in specific contexts 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Inclusiveness and participation 
</b></p>
<p>31. Multi-stakeholder approaches involving the Government, business and civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations are particularly important in the area of business and human rights. Such 
</p>
<p>inclusive approaches allow for interests to be balanced and the formulation of well-
</p>
<p>informed policies that respond more effectively to the needs and concerns of both 
</p>
<p>businesses and those whose rights may be affected by business activities. In this respect, an 
</p>
<p>independent civil society and the media play an important role in promoting transparency 
</p>
<p>and accountability in business operations, particularly where human rights concerns may 
</p>
<p>arise. An active civil society engaged in these issues is also essential in advocating for 
</p>
<p>progress and in the monitoring of implementation of the Guiding Principles by the 
</p>
<p>Government and all business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>32. The Guiding Principles recognize the important and valuable role played by 
</p>
<p>independent civil society organizations and human rights defenders. In particular, Principle 
</p>
<p>18 underlines the essential role of civil society and human rights defenders in the 
</p>
<p>identification of potential adverse business-related human rights impact, while Principle 26 
</p>
<p>underlines how States, in order to ensure access to remedy, should ensure that the 
</p>
<p>legitimate activities of human rights defenders are not obstructed. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Space for civil society participation 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Working Group welcomes the Government&#8217;s policy commitments in the 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan 2020 development concept to enhanced cooperation between the Government 
</p>
<p>and civil society organizations by means of a national plan of action for the development of 
</p>
<p>civil society. The Government&#8217;s stated objectives include the adoption of legislation that (a) 
</p>
<p>stimulates a conducive environment and financial support for civil society; (b) leads to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>creation of &#8220;non-governmental organization houses&#8221; and education centres; and (c) 
</p>
<p>increases civil society participation in the development of State programmes and public 
</p>
<p>commissions. The Development Concept also underlines the importance of greater 
</p>
<p>inclusion of civil society in policymaking and in promoting freedom of speech and 
</p>
<p>information, including by improving the regulation of information and mass media in 
</p>
<p>compliance with international standards.  
</p>
<p>34. At the same time, the Working Group noted with concern signs that the space for 
</p>
<p>independent civil society appears to be contracting. In this regard, it regrets that it was 
</p>
<p>unable to engage with some civil society actors who had been placed in pretrial detention in 
</p>
<p>the weeks and months prior to the mission. The arrest of a number of prominent civil 
</p>
<p>society actors was brought to the direct attention of the Working Group as a human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanism within the United Nations and because of its scheduled visit to Azerbaijan. The 
</p>
<p>experts had arranged to meet with a number of the said civil society actors prior to their 
</p>
<p>arrest to discuss the situation of business and human rights in Azerbaijan.  
</p>
<p>35. The Working Group received reports that civil society organizations, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, journalists and civic and political activists had suffered harassment, intimidation 
</p>
<p>or arrest. It also notes that the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
</p>
<p>of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
</p>
<p>assembly and of association issued a statement on 19 August 2014 in which they 
</p>
<p>condemned the growing tendency to prosecute prominent human rights defenders in 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan.15 Similar observations were made by the Commissioner for Human Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe after a two-day visit to the country in October 2014.16 
</p>
<p>36. In its dialogue with the Government, when the Working Group raised the issue of 
</p>
<p>the recent arrests of prominent civil society actors, it was informed that the Government 
</p>
<p>was in the process of setting up a working group to look into the matter. It was 
</p>
<p>subsequently informed that a joint working group on human rights issues, including 
</p>
<p>representatives of State bodies and non-governmental human rights organizations (which 
</p>
<p>had previously operated from 2005 to 2008), had been restored in October 2014 on the 
</p>
<p>initiative of the head of State and the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.  
</p>
<p>37. The Working Group heard first-hand accounts of how several civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations working on human rights issues faced increasing difficulties with registration 
</p>
<p>and had had their bank accounts frozen; consequently some organizations had to cease their 
</p>
<p>activities. From the information received, the grounds for freezing bank accounts derived 
</p>
<p>from recent amendments to the law on non-governmental organizations (public associations 
</p>
<p>and foundations), the law on grants, and requirements for registration of grants with the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice.  
</p>
<p>38. From the meetings held with a broad range of civil society organizations, the 
</p>
<p>Working Group noted generally that organizations supported by funding from non-
</p>
<p>governmental sources, such as grants from international organizations, were evidently more 
</p>
<p>affected by these new administrative requirements than organizations supported by the 
</p>
<p>Government.

<p>39. During its visit, the Working Group encouraged the Government to proceed with 
</p>
<p>measures to simplify grant registrations. It urged the Government to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>legitimate activities of human rights defenders are not obstructed and that procedures 
</p>
<p>pertaining to the process of registration and approval of grants are transparent, avoid any 
</p>
<p>perception of bias and are conducted in an efficient and timely manner. The Government 
</p>
<p>informed the Working Group that work was being carried out to improve regulations 
</p>
<p>regarding the registration of grants. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group also met with investigative journalists who explained how they 
</p>
<p>had been subjected to harassment and intimidation as a result of their work to expose 
</p>
<p>corrupt business practices. It has been reported that, since the visit of the Working Group, 
</p>
<p>one of the said journalists was arrested and is being held in pretrial detention. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group is deeply concerned that actions such as these may interpreted as reprisals against 
</p>
<p>individuals working to expose corruption by a privileged few, thereby undermining the 
</p>
<p>broader agenda for development. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
</b></p>
<p>41. The difficulties faced by independent civil society organizations are reflected in 
</p>
<p>concerns about the State&#8217;s compliance with its commitments made under the <i>Extractive 
</i></p>
<p><i>Industries Transparency Initiative</i>.  
</p>
<p>42. Azerbaijan is a founding and governing board member of the EITI, an international 
</p>
<p>coalition of Governments, companies and non-governmental groups that promotes 
</p>
<p>government openness in natural resources management. The EITI collects and publishes 
</p>
<p>data on government revenues from oil, gas and mining with the objective of fostering open 
</p>
<p>public debate about how revenues are used. A key EITI requirement is &#8220;effective multi-
</p>
<p>stakeholder oversight, including a functioning multi-stakeholder group that involves the 
</p>
<p>government, companies, and the full, independent, active and effective participation of civil 
</p>
<p>society.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>43. The discussions held by the Working Group with representatives of the civil society 
</p>
<p>mechanism of the EITI strengthened the impression that its process is a greatly valued 
</p>
<p>opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with the Government and the representatives of the 
</p>
<p>oil and gas sector. The Working Group was informed that some member organizations were 
</p>
<p>currently unable to function or contribute to the EITI given that their bank accounts had 
</p>
<p>been frozen. Despite these difficulties, those with whom the Working Group met disagreed 
</p>
<p>with calls made by some international human rights organizations that the EITI should 
</p>
<p>suspend Azerbaijan&#8217;s membership because of its restrictive new laws regulating non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations.17  
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group notes that concerns over the State&#8217;s treatment of civil society 
</p>
<p>organization had led the EITI to send a mission to Azerbaijan in September 2014 to 
</p>
<p>examine the extent to which civil society representatives could play their role in it. 
</p>
<p>Following the mission and a meeting of the EITI International Board in Myanmar in 
</p>
<p>October 2014, the Board adopted a decision on Azerbaijan in which it, inter alia, called 
</p>
<p>upon the Government to ensure that civil society representatives substantively involved in 
</p>
<p>the EITI process are able to &#8220;freely access and use funding to carry out their activities&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;speak freely about the EITI process and express views on natural resource governance 
</p>
<p>without fear or threat of reprisal or harassment&#8221;.18 The Board agreed that progress on these 
</p>
<p>actions would be assessed through an early validation (by an external, independent

<p>evaluation mechanism) to begin on 1 January and completed early in February 2015. Based 
</p>
<p>on the validation, the Board would decide whether Azerbaijan could keep its current status 
</p>
<p>as EITI-compliant, should be downgraded to &#8220;candidate&#8221; or, in the case that no meaningful 
</p>
<p>progress had been made with EITI implementation, be delisted.  
</p>
<p>45. The Working Group encourages the Government to work with its partners in the 
</p>
<p>EITI as well as in the United Nations system and the Council of Europe to ensure that 
</p>
<p>independent civil society actors are not obstructed in their work and are able to contribute 
</p>
<p>to well-informed policymaking. While the Government&#8217;s stated policy objective of greater 
</p>
<p>inclusion of civil society in policymaking is commendable, a basic condition for the success 
</p>
<p>of such a policy is ensuring that civil society actors are able to operate freely.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Tackling corruption and ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p>46. As underlined in Guiding Principle 1, States must project against human rights 
</p>
<p>abuse by third parties, including business enterprises, through appropriate steps to prevent, 
</p>
<p>investigate, punish and redress such abuse. An important aspect of this State obligation is to 
</p>
<p>protect the rule of law and to ensure adequate accountability.  
</p>
<p>47. As also evidenced by the emphasis given to the &#8220;rights of entrepreneurs&#8221; in various 
</p>
<p>policy documents, the effort to combat corruption is high on the political agenda. The 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan 2020 development concept highlights the need to scale up the fight against 
</p>
<p>corruption. The Government has taken a set of measures to combat corruption and abuse of 
</p>
<p>public positions. In 2004, it adopted the Law on Combating Corruption and established the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Combatting Corruption; in 2005, it ratified the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Corruption. The second national anti-corruption plan (2012-2015), endorsed by 
</p>
<p>presidential decree of 4 September 2012, also includes new provisions to improve the 
</p>
<p>protection of whistle-blowers in corruption-related cases and to limit the immunity of 
</p>
<p>judges accused of corruption. Also, one of the aims of the Azerbaijan Service and 
</p>
<p>Assessment Network (ASAN), established in 2012, is to reduce petty corruption across the 
</p>
<p>public administration by providing citizens with access to a range of public and private 
</p>
<p>services through dedicated service centres and mobile buses.  
</p>
<p>48. According to information received, corruption is linked to monopolies and a lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency in certain sectors of the economy. In some cases, there have also been 
</p>
<p>irregularities in public bidding processes. Transparency International ranked Azerbaijan 
</p>
<p>126th out of 175 countries on its 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index. 
</p>
<p>49. The Working Group notes that a wide range of measures are envisaged under the 
</p>
<p>second national anti-corruption plan (2012-2015), including action to improve the labour 
</p>
<p>and social service administration, to prevent illegal employment and provide persons 
</p>
<p>working in the shadow economy with social rights (sect. 25.1); performance studies on the 
</p>
<p>problems faced by entrepreneurs in their relations with State institutions (sect. 12.1); the 
</p>
<p>establishment of web-based resources and telephone services for receiving information on 
</p>
<p>illegal inspections of entrepreneurial activity, and preparation of proposals for inspecting 
</p>
<p>bodies and inspectors for illegal inspections (sects. 12.3-12.4); and the development of 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for restricting participation in public procurement of natural and legal persons 
</p>
<p>owing to previous violations of competition and execution of transactions on public 
</p>
<p>procurement (sect. 14.3).  
</p>
<p>50. The Working Group appreciated the frank dialogue held with the State Procurement 
</p>
<p>Agency about efforts under way to address the challenges faced, in particular with regard to 
</p>
<p>transparency. For example, the Agency has commenced publishing the results of public 
</p>
<p>tenders on its website and was in the process of developing guidelines on procurement 
</p>
<p>policy, informed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>(UNCITRAL) Model Law on Public Procurement. The Working Group underlines the 
</p>
<p>importance of States using commercial transactions with business enterprises to promote 
</p>
<p>awareness of and respect for human rights by those enterprises, including through the terms 
</p>
<p>of contracts, as prescribed in Guiding Principle 6. Developing guidelines for public 
</p>
<p>procurement offer an ideal opportunity to do so. As also described in the Guide to 
</p>
<p>Enactment of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement,19 the concept of 
</p>
<p>sustainable procurement allows for States to impose international labour law and human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. 
</p>
<p>51. The Working Group notes that, pursuant to the amendments to the Law on the Right 
</p>
<p>to Obtain Information, passed in 2012, together with amendments to the State Law on 
</p>
<p>Registration of Legal Entities and the Law on Commercial Secrets, business enterprises are 
</p>
<p>not required to make public information about their registration, ownership or structure. 
</p>
<p>Accordingly, several stakeholders from independent media and civil society organizations 
</p>
<p>alerted the experts to the difficulty of properly identifying certain businesses and their 
</p>
<p>owners in order to monitor compliance with national and international law<b><i>.</i></b>  While the 
</p>
<p>Working Group understands the value of privacy in business, it believes that an open 
</p>
<p>registry of fundamental corporate information may foster more responsible business actors 
</p>
<p>and boost investor confidence across all sectors.  
</p>
<p>52. The Working Group took note of recent reports alleging a lack of transparency and 
</p>
<p>apparent irregularities in the trading of oil. Notably, a report issued in 2013 noted a lack of 
</p>
<p>information on the ownership of private companies partnered with SOCAR and on bidding 
</p>
<p>processes or public tenders.20 The Working Group also noted that an ongoing EITI pilot 
</p>
<p>programme aims to make the disclosure of beneficial ownership of companies operating, 
</p>
<p>investing or bidding on extractive assets mandatory in 2016. The Working Group is of the 
</p>
<p>view that such measures of transparency might help to address suspicion and perceptions of 
</p>
<p>corruption and abuse of position by private companies and public authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Oil and gas sector 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Working Group held a number of meetings that concern the State&#8217;s extractive 
</p>
<p>industries, notably the dominant oil and gas sectors and others, such as the aluminium 
</p>
<p>industry. Besides meeting with representatives of the Ministry of Energy, the State Oil 
</p>
<p>Fund (SOFAZ) and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), the experts 
</p>
<p>consulted with transnational oil and gas corporations operating in Azerbaijan, including BP 
</p>
<p>(headquartered in the United Kingdom), Statoil (headquartered in Norway) and Total 
</p>
<p>(headquartered in France). In addition, the Working Group visited a domestically owned 
</p>
<p>and run aluminium factory in Ganja, where it discussed environmental issues with the 
</p>
<p>manager and witnessed the factory&#8217;s labour standards.  
</p>
<p>54. SOCAR is the main national company involved in the extraction of oil and gas in 
</p>
<p>Azerbaijan. It is entirely State-owned and controlled. As underlined in Guiding Principle 4, 
</p>
<p>States are expected to take additional steps to protect human rights abuses by business 
</p>
<p>enterprises owned or controlled by the State.

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>55. In meetings with SOCAR officials, the Working Group noted the poor degree of 
</p>
<p>understanding of the company&#8217;s human rights responsibilities, particularly when measured 
</p>
<p>against the Guiding Principles. Although officials referred to a number of social 
</p>
<p>responsibility projects, such as a number of SOCAR-sponsored cultural centres, the 
</p>
<p>company did not have any specific policy on human rights nor mechanisms for carrying out 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence.  
</p>
<p>56. Equally, in meetings with officials at the Ministry of Energy, which regulates the 
</p>
<p>activities of SOCAR and other companies in the energy sector (including AzerEnergy and 
</p>
<p>Azerigaz), the Working Group found that there was very limited awareness of the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>particular responsibility to exercise scrutiny and oversight of State-owned and -controlled 
</p>
<p>companies and to ensure that they conduct effective human rights due diligence. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group was informed that there had been many cases of complaints in 
</p>
<p>the context of projects in which SOCAR was involved, in particular by people whose 
</p>
<p>property had been affected by the construction of plants and pipelines. SOCAR officials 
</p>
<p>explained that these cases were dealt with by national courts. They did not consider that the 
</p>
<p>company, a commercial organization, had any role in facilitating access to grievance 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, including at an operational level, which, as prescribed by Guiding Principles 
</p>
<p>28 and 29, should be directly accessible to individuals and communities.  
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group was encouraged to learn that SOCAR, together with an 
</p>
<p>international partner, is carrying out a social impact study in advance of a planned 
</p>
<p>construction project to mitigate adverse human rights impact to the community. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group, however, received no specific information on SOCAR policies and 
</p>
<p>procedures relating to social impact assessments. According to the information received, 
</p>
<p>however, the initiative to undertake such an impact assessment generally came from 
</p>
<p>international partners. While peer learning in the sector is important, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>considers that the Government should intervene to support and, where appropriate, demand 
</p>
<p>human rights due diligence by companies.  
</p>
<p>59. The human rights risks and impact of large-scale development projects in the oil and 
</p>
<p>gas sectors have been illustrated by the Bakz-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline, built from 
</p>
<p>2003 to 2005, crossing through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The pipeline is owned and 
</p>
<p>operated by a consortium of 11 energy companies, managed by BP, the largest shareholder 
</p>
<p>(30 per cent); SOCAR is the second largest shareholder (25 per cent). In the face of 
</p>
<p>criticism levelled by civil society groups about a possible negative impact on human rights, 
</p>
<p>BP set up an independent external panel to assess the economic, social and environmental 
</p>
<p>impact of the BTC pipeline project. BP also took initiative to issue a &#8220;human rights 
</p>
<p>undertaking&#8221;, which guaranteed that the host government agreements entered into with the 
</p>
<p>BTC consortium would not limit the ability of host Governments to comply with their 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>60. Lessons from the BTC pipeline can inform construction of the Southern gas corridor 
</p>
<p>project due to commence in 2015. This mega-project will involve the construction of a 
</p>
<p>3,500 km pipeline to carry natural gas from in Azerbaijan to southern Italy. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group appreciated the scale of the project when it visited outside Baku the Sangachel 
</p>
<p>terminal (operated by a BP-led consortium), where the pipelines start, one of the largest oil 
</p>
<p>and gas processing plants in world.  
</p>
<p>61. The pipeline will be made up of three main parts: the South Caucasus Pipeline 
</p>
<p>(SCP) passing through Azerbaijan and Georgia; the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) 
</p>
<p>through Turkey; and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), through Greece, Albania and Italy. 
</p>
<p>Each part will be constructed and operated by different business consortiums.  
</p>
<p>62. In Azerbaijan, the construction project involves the expansion of an already existing 
</p>
<p>pipeline operated by a consortium of seven major companies, headquartered in seven </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>different States: BP (United Kingdom, 28.8 per cent), Statoil (Norway, 15.5 per cent), 
</p>
<p>Lukoil (Russian Federation, 10 per cent), NICO (Islamic Republic of Iran, 10 per cent), 
</p>
<p>TPAO (Turkey, 19 per cent) and two Azerbaijani companies: Azerbaijan South Caucasus 
</p>
<p>Pipeline, Ltd. (AzSCP) (10 per cent) and SGC Midstream (6.7 per cent). AzSCP is a 
</p>
<p>commercial affiliated company of SOCAR incorporated under the laws of the Cayman 
</p>
<p>Islands, while SGC Midstream was established by SOCAR as part of the Southern Gas 
</p>
<p>Corridor project.  
</p>
<p>63. The State&#8217;s responsibility to ensure adequate human rights due diligence in the 
</p>
<p>construction of the Southern gas corridor extends beyond its own borders, given that 
</p>
<p>SOCAR is the operator and majority shareholder of the TANAP consortium that will 
</p>
<p>construct the 2,000 km-long pipeline through Turkey, and also holds a 20 per cent stake in 
</p>
<p>the TAP consortium.  
</p>
<p>64. In December 1999, a presidential decree established the State Oil Fund of the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ), with the objectives of (a) preserving macroeconomic 
</p>
<p>stability, ensuring fiscal-tax discipline, decreasing the dependence on future oil revenues 
</p>
<p>and stimulating the development of the non-oil sector; (b) providing intergenerational 
</p>
<p>equality, retaining oil revenues for future generations; and (c) funding important 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic projects on a national scale. SOFAZ, which operates as a sovereign wealth 
</p>
<p>fund, is also a component of the annual budget.  
</p>
<p>65. In meetings with the management of the State Oil Fund, the Working Group was 
</p>
<p>impressed by the strategic outlook and prudent approach to managing the wealth generated 
</p>
<p>by oil revenues, particularly in human capital and socioeconomic projects for the benefit of 
</p>
<p>future generations.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Construction industry 
</b></p>
<p>66. The construction sector has witnessed a veritable boom in the past decade, as seen in 
</p>
<p>the large-scale redevelopment in Baku in particular since 2006. Although jobs have been 
</p>
<p>created in the construction sector, concerns have also been raised about the manner in 
</p>
<p>which expropriations, evictions and demolitions have been carried out and about non-
</p>
<p>competitive construction contracts having been awarded to well-connected business people.  
</p>
<p>67. Owing to the brevity of its visit, the Working Group was unable to visit any current 
</p>
<p>construction projects in Azerbaijan, nor was it able to meet with building companies. The 
</p>
<p>experts did, however, discuss the impact of the construction sector on human rights with 
</p>
<p>relevant government departments and civil society organizations, and was informed about a 
</p>
<p>number of public reports on the issue prior to its visit. 
</p>
<p>68. In this regard, the Working Group recalls the recommendations made by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2013 concerning information on 
</p>
<p>cases of forced evictions, unlawful expropriations and demolitions with little or no notice 
</p>
<p>(E/C.12/AZE/CO/3, para. 22). The Working Groups also notes that the European Court of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, in the case of <i>Akhverdiyev v. Azerbaijan</i> of 29 January 2015, found a 
</p>
<p>violation relating to unlawful forced relocation and the demolition of property. 
</p>
<p>69. According to another report, a number of construction projects had entailed 
</p>
<p>expropriation, evictions and demolitions carried out in a way that was inconsistent with 
</p>
<p>both national and international human rights law.21 It looked at four areas in Baku, 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>including the Bayil neighbourhood where the Baku Crystal Hall was constructed before the 
</p>
<p>Eurovision song contest in 2012. The authors reported that the Government&#8217;s programme 
</p>
<p>of urban renewal, comprising new parks, roads, a shopping centre and luxury residential 
</p>
<p>buildings, entailed the illegal expropriation of hundreds of properties, the forcible evictions 
</p>
<p>of homeowners and the refusal to provide fair compensation based on market values.  
</p>
<p>70. While the Working Group was informed that measures had been taken to improve 
</p>
<p>urban planning and development, it also took note of information received during 
</p>
<p>discussions held with civil society organizations on the problems that remain. As a number 
</p>
<p>of ongoing and future construction projects are undertaken, such as the White City urban 
</p>
<p>renewal project that aims to redevelop a derelict part of Baku, the Working Group urges the 
</p>
<p>Government and all business enterprises involved to carry out human rights due diligence, 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the Guiding Principles and the specific guidance provided by the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (in particular its general comment No. 
</p>
<p>7), the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
</p>
<p>standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, and in the basic 
</p>
<p>principles and guidelines of development-based evictions and displacement (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/4/18, annex I).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Azerbaijan 2020 development concept document sets the objective of 
</p>
<p>strengthening efforts to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, including through the 
</p>
<p>preparation of a new State programme. One important challenge is that approximately 67 
</p>
<p>per cent of the population work without formal labour contracts in the informal economy, 
</p>
<p>and therefore fall outside the protection of the Labour Code. The situation of women in the 
</p>
<p>workplace also requires special attention. It is estimated that only one third of women are in 
</p>
<p>salaried employment and a significant disparity exists between the incomes of men and 
</p>
<p>women.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to increase the 
</p>
<p>minimum wage to 60 per cent of the average income, in accordance with the stipulations of 
</p>
<p>the European Social Charter (in 2014, the minimum wage was equivalent to 22.9 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the average monthly wage). The Working Group was informed that the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>objective was to gradually increase the minimum wage so that it would be equivalent to 
</p>
<p>30.8 percent of the average monthly wage by 2018, 41.4 per cent by 2018, and 60 per cent 
</p>
<p>by 2020. The Working Group urges the Government to act on that commitment and thus 
</p>
<p>address the large number of workers on low incomes<i>.<b> </b></i>It noted that the current minimum 
</p>
<p>wage is below the national poverty line. In this regard, it also notes the observations of the 
</p>
<p>ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in 
</p>
<p>which it requested the Government to indicate the measures it intended to take so that the 
</p>
<p>national minimum wage could provide low-paid workers with a decent standard of living.22 <b> </b></p>
<p>73. Ongoing efforts to ensure registration of labour contracts, notably through the 
</p>
<p>electronic information system under the &#8220;e-Government portal&#8221;, should improve oversight 
</p>
<p>of labour conditions, including issues related to working children in the informal economy. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the Working Group recalls the recommendations made by the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations in 2006 (CRC/C/AZE/CO/2) and a 
</p>
<p>study by the Statistical Committee of Azerbaijan and ILO-IPEC in which it was estimated 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22  Direct Request (CEACR) &#8211; adopted 2011, published 101st ILC session (2012) concerning the 
</p>
<p>Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 (No. 131) &#8211; Azerbaijan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>that more than 156,000 children under the age of 18 were engaged in some form of 
</p>
<p>economic activity.23<b> </b></p>
<p>74. The Working Group noted how persons with disabilities face particular challenges. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the Government has established a quota system requiring private companies 
</p>
<p>to hire a certain percentage of their workforce for citizens with specific social protection 
</p>
<p>needs and who would otherwise have difficulty in finding employment (decree no. 212 of 
</p>
<p>23 November 2005). Depending on their number of employees, companies must reserve 
</p>
<p>between 3 and 5 per cent of workplaces for such persons, including people with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Despite such measures, however, the ILO reports that the proportion of disabled persons 
</p>
<p>involved in labour activity has declined over the past decade.24 In the information received, 
</p>
<p>the main problems identified related to inadequate accessibility of work places to persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities and inadequate control and sanctioning of non-compliance with the 
</p>
<p>prescribed quotas reserved for vulnerable groups. Furthermore, in May 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, noting that the number of people 
</p>
<p>benefiting from the quotas was very low, recommended that the Government ensure 
</p>
<p>enforcement through effective sanctions and complement such efforts with programmes to 
</p>
<p>enable persons with disabilities to participate effectively in the labour market 
</p>
<p>(CRPD/C/AZE/CO/1, paras. 42-43). According to statistics provided by the Government, 
</p>
<p>as at 1 January 2015, the number of able-bodied persons with disabilities was 494,988, 
</p>
<p>while the number of quota jobs identified by the State Employment Service in 2014 totalled 
</p>
<p>2,275 in 758 enterprises, including 1,100 jobs for persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>75. The Working Group also discussed these issues with the Office of the Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Ombudsman), which has assumed the 
</p>
<p>functions of the independent monitoring mechanism specified in article 33, paragraph 2 of 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>76. During its meetings, the Working Group was able to explore the work of the State 
</p>
<p>labour inspectorate in monitoring and enforcing laws and regulations concerning 
</p>
<p>occupational health and safety, including through regular on-site visits. It also discussed 
</p>
<p>these issues with workers and the management of an aluminium plant in Ganja, employing 
</p>
<p>1,400 workers. Although the Working Group was informed that health facilities also 
</p>
<p>reported accidents to the labour inspectorate, it was unclear whether this was consistently 
</p>
<p>done in practice. The experts observed that there was a need to improve further the 
</p>
<p>collection of data on occupational health and safety, including through closer cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the Ministry of Labour and the State Statistical Committee.  
</p>
<p>77. The Working Group also explored the situation of trade unions and issues relating to 
</p>
<p>collective bargaining. Even though the practice of collective bargaining is still relatively 
</p>
<p>new in the Azerbaijan, the number of collective agreements has steadily grown in recent 
</p>
<p>years, from 9,460 in 2001 to 11,890 in 2010.<b> </b></p>
<p>78. The Working Group noted that more than 85 per cent of workers currently belong to 
</p>
<p>one of the approximately 1,600 trade unions in the country. The Trade Unions Act of 1994 
</p>
<p>stipulates that a trade union may be set up by a minimum of seven people, should be 
</p>
<p>allowed to work without interference, and that discrimination against trade union members 
</p>
<p>is prohibited. The Working Group nonetheless heard reports that, in practice, trade unions 
</p>
<p>did not always act fully independently of the Government. It also noted the observation of 
</p>
<p>the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, 
</p>
<p>on the need for additional measures to encourage and promote collective bargaining 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>between trade unions and employers and their organizations, without interference by the 
</p>
<p>public authority.25<b> </b></p>
<p>79. During its meeting with national trade union representatives, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>heard their accounts of problems related to the right to join trade unions of workers in 
</p>
<p>multinational companies in the oil and gas sector. The representatives of the Azerbaijan 
</p>
<p>Trade Union Confederation complained of the difficulties posed in establishing trade 
</p>
<p>unions within the said companies. Similar concerns were raised with ILO by the 
</p>
<p>International Trade Union Confederation, noting in its above-mentioned observation that, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;despite an adequate protection of trade union rights in law, trade union activities in 
</p>
<p>multinational companies were often reprimanded in practice, that employers often delayed 
</p>
<p>negotiations, unions rarely participated in determining wage levels and were often bypassed 
</p>
<p>in the conclusion of bilateral agreements between the Government and multinational 
</p>
<p>enterprises&#8221;.26<b> </b></p>
<p><b> VI. Access to remedy 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. State-based judicial mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>80. Ensuring access to effective judicial mechanisms is an essential component of the 
</p>
<p>requirements set out in the Guiding Principles. In dealing with business-related human 
</p>
<p>rights abuses, accessible and effective judicial remedies are particularly important in the 
</p>
<p>light of the imbalances between the parties to business-related human rights claims.  
</p>
<p>81. In discussions on the challenges faced with regard to access to remedies for 
</p>
<p>business-related human rights abuses, government officials highlighted the various judicial 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in place to address such grievances, including the labour inspectorate and the 
</p>
<p>accessibility of courts throughout the country. The Ministry of Justice informed the 
</p>
<p>Working Group that a system was in place to provide free legal aid to needy families. At 
</p>
<p>the same time, it was clear from the Working Group&#8217;s meetings with a range of civil society 
</p>
<p>actors that there were also concerns about the effectiveness of the court system in some 
</p>
<p>cases. Such concerns are also reflected in the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (2012-
</p>
<p>2015), which includes the preparation of proposals &#8220;on limiting the scope of immunity of 
</p>
<p>judges from criminal prosecution in the context of combating corruption&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>82. The Guiding Principles highlight how corruption can block access to effective 
</p>
<p>remedies for human rights abuses by business enterprises. The commentary to Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principle 26 clarifies that States should ensure that the provision of justice is not prevented 
</p>
<p>by corruption of the judicial process, and that courts are independent of economic or 
</p>
<p>political pressures from other State agents and from business actors. To ensure that 
</p>
<p>agencies tasked with enforcing and monitoring compliance with laws, regulations and 
</p>
<p>policies that require business enterprises to respect human rights are effective and 
</p>
<p>accountable, the Working Group particularly encourages anti-corruption efforts focused on 
</p>
<p>the integrity of officers involved in law enforcement at the district level and in the judicial 
</p>
<p>sector.

</p>
<p><b>B. State-based non-judicial grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>83. In addition to courts and administrative tribunals, non-judicial mechanisms also play 
</p>
<p>an important role in ensuring access to remedy for business-related abuses. In particular, 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions are often empowered to examine complaints on human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. This is also the case of the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>84. According to the annual report of the Ombudsman, in 2013, the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman, including four regional centres, received 13,670 appeals, of which 75.8 per 
</p>
<p>cent were complaints. The complaints typically concerned issues such as delivery of 
</p>
<p>identity cards, registration, responses to information queries, land and property, damage 
</p>
<p>caused by natural disasters, pensions and allowances, social aid, restoring the work place, 
</p>
<p>the execution of court decisions, and payment of alimony and loans. A total of 709 
</p>
<p>complaints concerned violations of labour rights, in particular failure of the employer to 
</p>
<p>pay (or to pay when due)wages, employment without a regular work contract, long-term 
</p>
<p>leave or dismissal without payment. According to the Ombudsman, in most cases, the rights 
</p>
<p>of citizens were upheld following due investigation.  
</p>
<p>85. The Working Group was informed that the Ombudsman is not empowered to 
</p>
<p>consider complaints concerning business enterprises. The Ombudsman may, however, 
</p>
<p>cooperate with State authorities to investigate complaints about business stakeholders. The 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman has in fact established a working group on business and human rights with the 
</p>
<p>objective of promoting corporate social responsibility. According to the annual report of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman for 2013, one of the priorities of the working group is to define the 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for investigation of complaints and for the elimination of violations, ensuring 
</p>
<p>their effectiveness, conducting monitoring in workplaces jointly with authorized bodies on 
</p>
<p>protection of labour rights, set-up of a hot-line service, and strengthening measures to 
</p>
<p>eliminate discrimination in labour relations. To date, the Working Group has held 
</p>
<p>discussions on such themes as &#8220;Child rights and business&#8221;, &#8220;Observing ecological 
</p>
<p>requirements in the realization of business&#8221;, &#8220;Business and women&#8217;s rights&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Protection of rights of persons with disabilities from the context of business and human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>C. Non-State-based grievance mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>86. Although the Working Group was informed about a number of grievance 
</p>
<p>mechanisms currently operated by multinational corporations present in Azerbaijan, there 
</p>
<p>seemed to be little understanding of the value of such non-State grievance mechanisms by 
</p>
<p>local companies. While operational-level grievance mechanisms are not meant to substitute 
</p>
<p>judicial mechanisms in cases of more serious human rights abuse, they can play an 
</p>
<p>important role in providing access to remedy for individuals or communities who are 
</p>
<p>adversely affected by a business enterprise, as also explained in Guiding Principle 29.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Strengthening the policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>87. One of the stated objectives of the Azerbaijan 2020 development concept is to 
</p>
<p>develop &#8220;a strategy and State programme on corporate responsibility&#8221;. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>encourages the Government to realize that objective through an open and inclusive process, 
</p>
<p>in cooperation with businesses and civil society, to develop a comprehensive national plan 
</p>
<p>of action on business and human rights that draws on the Guiding Principles. Such a 
</p>
<p>process could build upon and draw experience from different initiatives already under way, 
</p>
<p>including the national action plan and programme on human rights, and multi-stakeholder </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/28/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>dialogue conducted through the <i>Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</i>, national 
</p>
<p>councils and State committees.  
</p>
<p>88. In December 2014, the Working Group issued specific guidance for the process of 
</p>
<p>developing a national action plan on business and human rights. The Working Group 
</p>
<p>considers that such national action plans, and the process to develop it, should ideally 
</p>
<p>provide for (a) greater coordination and coherence within government on the range of 
</p>
<p>public policy areas that relate to business and human rights; (b) an inclusive process to 
</p>
<p>identify national priorities and concrete policy measures and action; (c) transparency and 
</p>
<p>predictability for interested domestic and international stakeholders; (d) a process of the 
</p>
<p>continuous monitoring and evaluation of implementation; (e) a platform for ongoing multi-
</p>
<p>stakeholder dialogue.  
</p>
<p>89. The process of developing a national action plan on business and human rights 
</p>
<p>should also involve the identification of ways to improve access to remedy for victims of 
</p>
<p>adverse business-related human rights impact through both State-based and non-State-
</p>
<p>based grievance mechanisms, in accordance with Guiding Principles 25 to 31. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Working Group notes the political commitment of the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Azerbaijan to the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and its pledge to 
</b></p>
<p><b>develop a national action plan to implement them.</b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>The meetings held during the visit with Government officials and local business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises revealed that issues concerning business and rights are not well 
</b></p>
<p><b>understood or known about.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Free and vibrant social dialogue is critically important to the promotion of 
</b></p>
<p><b>business and human rights. Consequently, the Working Group is deeply concerned at 
</b></p>
<p><b>the plight of independent civil society organizations in Azerbaijan; in particular, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>arrest of prominent human rights defenders suggests that the opportunity to air views 
</b></p>
<p><b>in open discourse is severely limited. In this way, policymakers are denied valuable 
</b></p>
<p><b>input and opinions, their consideration of which might </b>significantly benefit the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>development. </b> 
</p>
<p>93. <b>The specific recommendations of the Working Group are made on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>assumption that all actors </b>&#8211;<b> the Government, business enterprises, civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations and international development partners operating in Azerbaijan </b>&#8211;
</p>
<p><b>respect and abide by the Constitution and international human rights standards.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Working Group recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Raise awareness and build the capacity of civil servants and lawmakers 
</b></p>
<p><b>on issues concerning businesses and human rights from the perspective of the Guiding 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principles;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Set out clear expectations in government policy that any and all business 
</b></p>
<p><b>enterprises in Azerbaijan respect human rights throughout their operations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Require all State-owned or -controlled companies to perform human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights due diligence, for both their domestic and international operations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Develop a national action plan on business and human rights based on 
</b></p>
