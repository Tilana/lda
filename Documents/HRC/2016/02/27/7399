<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human 
rights in Mali, Suliman Baldo 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In this report, which covers the period from 1 May to 29 December 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert gives an account of his third visit to Mali, from 7 to 17 October 2014. 
</p>
<p>He notes with concern that the progress observed during his second mission, in February 
</p>
<p>2014, in terms of strengthening State authority, deploying the administration in the north of 
</p>
<p>the country and combating impunity has been called into question following the fighting 
</p>
<p>that broke out in Kidal from 16 to 21 May 2014. These events which rekindled the power 
</p>
<p>struggle between the Government and rebel groups have had major political, security and 
</p>
<p>humanitarian repercussions in the country as well as serious consequences for the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation there. 
</p>
<p> Armed movements, including terrorist groups, are gradually regaining control of the 
</p>
<p>north of the country and, for the first time, members of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) are being targeted 
</p>
<p>by the jihadi groups. This extremely worrying situation is keeping humanitarian actors 
</p>
<p>away from people living in northern Mali who are thus deprived of access to basic social 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert notes the contrast, since his last report, between the marked 
</p>
<p>decrease in cases of violations of the right to life attributable to the Malian armed forces 
</p>
<p>and the significant increase in violations of human rights and of international humanitarian 
</p>
<p>law by the different armed groups in northern Mali. The rape of minors by certain members 
</p>
<p>of the Malian armed forces is the main source of concern. 
</p>
<p> Armed and extremist groups present in the north of Mali continue to be involved in 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights: violations of the right to life, abductions, cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment, unlawful detention, the recruitment and use of children by armed 
</p>
<p>groups, asymmetrical attacks and looting.

</p>
<p> The fragile security situation in northern Mali is pushing many groups, formed most 
</p>
<p>often on the basis of their identity, to acquire weapons to defend their communities. 
</p>
<p>Against a background of intercommunal and intracommunal tensions, sometimes 
</p>
<p>manipulated by political and security actors, the risk of serious human rights violations 
</p>
<p>among the civilian population is especially worrying. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert notes the Government&#8217;s efforts to reform the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission so as to bring it into line with international standards as well as 
</p>
<p>its efforts to establish mobile counselling centres to expedite judicial proceedings for 
</p>
<p>crimes committed in the north of the country. 
</p>
<p> Regarding the peace process in Algiers, the Independent Expert emphasizes the 
</p>
<p>importance of ensuring that any peace agreement comes under a legal framework in 
</p>
<p>keeping with international human rights instruments, which means not granting amnesty to 
</p>
<p>the perpetrators of international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war 
</p>
<p>crimes and serious human rights violations, including sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert stresses the fact that political arrangements often made to the 
</p>
<p>detriment of victims of the serious human rights violations committed in Mali since the 
</p>
<p>start of the crisis should not be a substitute for the rule of law.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 25/36, 
</p>
<p>adopted on 28 March 2014, in which the Council renewed the mandate of the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali for one year with a view to assisting the 
</p>
<p>Government of Mali in its efforts to promote and protect human rights, and requested him 
</p>
<p>to submit his report at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>2. In this report, which covers the period 1 May to 29 December 2014, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert gives an account of his third visit to Mali, from 7 to 17 October 2014. The report is 
</p>
<p>based on information collected from government authorities, United Nations bodies 
</p>
<p>operating in the country, national and international organizations dealing with humanitarian 
</p>
<p>issues and human rights, as well as on the testimonies of associations and families of 
</p>
<p>victims of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert wishes to thank the Government of Mali for facilitating his 
</p>
<p>stay in the country and for having granted him access to all the national and local officials 
</p>
<p>that he asked to meet. During the third mission, as with the two previous missions, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert met with high-ranking officials, including the President of the 
</p>
<p>Republic, the Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Keeper of the Seals, the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Defence and Veterans&#8217; Affairs, the Minister of the Interior and Security, the Minister for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Minister for the Advancement of 
</p>
<p>Women, Children and the Family, and the Minister of National Education. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert met with the Public Prosecutor, the Chief of Staff of the 
</p>
<p>Armed Forces of Mali, the Secretary General of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission and the Chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission. He visited 
</p>
<p>detention centres but could not go to the northern part of the country for security reasons.  
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert held talks with representatives of civil society, associations 
</p>
<p>of victims in northern Mali and the association of parents and spouses of the &#8220;red beret&#8221; 
</p>
<p>soldiers killed on duty, political parties, the diplomatic corps and United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert wishes to thank David Gressly, Special Representative of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General for Mali and Head of the United Nations Multidimensional 
</p>
<p>Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), Arnauld Akodj&#232;nou, his deputy for 
</p>
<p>political affairs, and the staff of the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA. The technical 
</p>
<p>and logistical support from the United Nations system in Mali was essential for facilitating 
</p>
<p>and ensuring the success of the Independent Expert&#8217;s third mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General situation in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The political situation 
</b></p>
<p>7. In his first report, submitted to the Council on 25 March 2014, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert welcomed the fact that Mali was gradually emerging from the severe, 
</p>
<p>multidimensional crisis of the previous two years, which had brought the country to the 
</p>
<p>brink of collapse. The gradual return to constitutional order and the significantly improved 
</p>
<p>security situation in the north, as of the second half of 2013, had been made possible with 
</p>
<p>the support of neighbouring countries and the international community, particularly 
</p>
<p>MINUSMA and the countries of the Economic Community of West African States, as well 
</p>
<p>as through the efforts of the Malian authorities to restore peace and stability in the country. </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. In 2013, the intervention by the African-led International Support Mission to Mali, 
</p>
<p>and subsequently by MINUSMA and the French forces of Operation Serval, alongside the 
</p>
<p>reconstituted Malian armed forces, led to the recapture of northern Mali from the control of 
</p>
<p>extremist Islamist groups such as Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement 
</p>
<p>for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) and Ansar Dine. 
</p>
<p>9. A determining factor in the defeat of the extremist groups was the collapse of the 
</p>
<p>alliance of convenience, which initially united the Malian Tuareg and Arab groups 
</p>
<p>campaigning for autonomy or independence, and the subsequent involvement of those 
</p>
<p>groups in the campaign against the jihadi groups. 
</p>
<p>10. This cooperation resulted in the conclusion of a preliminary agreement on 
</p>
<p>presidential elections and inclusive peace negotiations in Mali, signed in Ouagadougou, on 
</p>
<p>18 June 2013, between the Transitional Government and the armed groups from the north. 
</p>
<p>The agreement allowed elections to be held in favourable conditions across the whole 
</p>
<p>country, with presidential elections on 28 July and 11 August 2013, and parliamentary 
</p>
<p>elections on 24 November and 15 December 2013. The absolute majority polled by the 
</p>
<p>party of President-elect Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, (Rassemblement pour Mali) with its allies 
</p>
<p>would give significant parliamentary support to the President for his declared agenda of 
</p>
<p>restoring peace, security and good governance. These advances laid the ground for political 
</p>
<p>stability in the country in 2014. 
</p>
<p>11. Article 18 of the preliminary agreement of 18 June 2013 (Ouagadougou Preliminary 
</p>
<p>Agreement) provides for the establishment of an international commission of inquiry into 
</p>
<p>war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide, sexual abuse and other serious 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by the 
</p>
<p>belligerents during the war in the north of the country. Article 21 of the Agreement 
</p>
<p>provides that, after the presidential elections, and 60 days after the new Government has 
</p>
<p>taken office, the Government will engage in peace talks with all the communities from the 
</p>
<p>north, as well as the signatories and armed groups that are party to the Preliminary 
</p>
<p>Agreement, with a view to reaching a comprehensive and lasting peace. 
</p>
<p>12. The considerable delay in implementing these important provisions of the 
</p>
<p>Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement by the newly elected authorities of Mali seriously 
</p>
<p>threatened the greater political stability and improved security situation made possible by 
</p>
<p>the Preliminary Agreement. A fragile truce prevailed among government troops and rebel 
</p>
<p>groups in the north, while the representative of the rebel groups continued to meet with 
</p>
<p>government officials in Bamako and elsewhere in neighbouring countries in an effort to 
</p>
<p>relaunch the peace process with the support of MINUSMA. On the ground, real security 
</p>
<p>problems persisted between the Malian armed forces and armed groups campaigning for 
</p>
<p>independence, particularly in Kidal, the cradle of the Tuareg rebellion in Mali since its 
</p>
<p>independence in 1960. 
</p>
<p>13. Another significant development on the political scene was the resignation, on 5 
</p>
<p>April 2014, of Prime Minister Oumar Tatam Ly. He was replaced by Moussa Mara, former 
</p>
<p>presidential candidate and member of the Yelema party. 
</p>
<p>14. Efforts to relaunch the political process were seriously jeopardized by armed clashes 
</p>
<p>that took place in Kidal, from 16 to 21 May 2014, between the Malian armed forces and the 
</p>
<p>National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) supported by other associated 
</p>
<p>armed groups. This violation of the ceasefire, in breach of article 10 of the Preliminary 
</p>
<p>Agreement of Ouagadougou, brought a deterioration in the security situation and an 
</p>
<p>increasingly fragile humanitarian and human rights situation for the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>15. A ceasefire agreement between the parties was signed, on 23 May 2014, following 
</p>
<p>the intervention of the Mauritanian President, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. The signatories 
</p>
<p>to the agreement committed to revert to the provisions of the Ouagadougou Preliminary </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>Agreement and to immediately resume negotiations. The parties agreed that an international 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry should be set up to investigate the events in the north, starting with 
</p>
<p>Kidal, and in accordance with the Preliminary Agreement. 
</p>
<p>16. The first round of negotiations, held from 14 to 24 July 2014 in Algiers, led to the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a road map and a declaration of cessation of hostilities, signed by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Mali with each of the two groups of armed coalitions: the Coordination 
</p>
<p>(composed of MNLA, the Supreme Council for the Unity of Azawad (HCUA), the Arab 
</p>
<p>Movement of Azawad (MAA)); the Platform (composed of Coordination des Mouvements 
</p>
<p>et Forces Patriotiques de R&#233;sistance (CMFPR), Coalition du peuple pour l&#8217;Azawad (CPA), 
</p>
<p>and another dissident faction of MAA). 
</p>
<p>17. A second round of negotiations began in early September between, the Government 
</p>
<p>and the Coordination on the one hand, and the Government and the Platform on the other 
</p>
<p>hand. The negotiations centred on four basic themes: policy, security, development, and 
</p>
<p>justice and reconciliation issues. Two further rounds of negotiations were held in Algiers, 
</p>
<p>on 20 October 2014 and from 20 November respectively. 
</p>
<p>18. The November session of the Algiers talks ended in stalemate as the positions of the 
</p>
<p>Malian Government and Tuareg armed groups could not be reconciled. With their 
</p>
<p>confidence boosted by the events of May in Kidal, the Tuareg armed groups are demanding 
</p>
<p>full autonomy for the three northern regions: they would form one federal entity in a 
</p>
<p>federation with the southern region and have their own parliament, judiciary and 
</p>
<p>government. By so doing the movements are seeking to meet the expectations of 
</p>
<p>independence among their popular support base, especially in Kidal, and to a lesser extent 
</p>
<p>in the cities of Gao and Timbuktu. 
</p>
<p>19. For its part, the Government is proposing to the armed Tuareg movements an 
</p>
<p>enhanced version of its policy of greater devolvement of decision-making on local affairs to 
</p>
<p>regional and local authorities throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>20. On 30 November 2014, the draft agreement for peace and reconciliation in Mali was 
</p>
<p>distributed to the parties by the mediation team and will be discussed at the next round of 
</p>
<p>negotiations scheduled for January 2015. The question of the degree of autonomy that 
</p>
<p>should be given to the regions of northern Mali and ensuring security in this part of the 
</p>
<p>country are likely to dominate the public debate in the coming months. 
</p>
<p>21. It was against this political background that the third visit of the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>to Mali took place. During his discussions with political actors involved in the Algiers 
</p>
<p>talks, he drew their attention to the importance of ensuring that any peace agreement comes 
</p>
<p>under a legal framework in keeping with international human rights instruments, which 
</p>
<p>means not granting amnesty to the perpetrators of international crimes such as genocide, 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity, war crimes and serious human rights violations, including sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>22. For this reason, the Independent Expert welcomes the publication, on 27 August 
</p>
<p>2014, of the human rights organizations&#8217; manifesto for a peace agreement that respects 
</p>
<p>victims&#8217; rights. The document recalls that political negotiations are necessary to reach a 
</p>
<p>final and inclusive peace agreement that respects national unity and the rights of victims to 
</p>
<p>justice, truth and reparation, as recognized in international and national instruments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The security situation 
</b></p>
<p>23. These political and diplomatic developments seriously hampered the progress that 
</p>
<p>Mali had begun to make in late 2013 and early 2014, in the closely related tasks of ensuring 
</p>
<p>security and re-establishing the administrative and judicial authorities in the northern </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>region, as well as basic social services in the State. Efforts to restore the rule of law 
</p>
<p>throughout the country, particularly in the regions worst affected by the conflict in the 
</p>
<p>north, obviously suffered a considerable setback. 
</p>
<p>24. The jihadi movements took advantage of the authorities&#8217; delay in relaunching the 
</p>
<p>final peace talks and re-establishing civilian State authorities in northern Mali, the slowness 
</p>
<p>with which MINUSMA deployed its forces in that region and the reconfiguration of 
</p>
<p>Operation Serval into Operation Barkhane, which extends across the Sahel, to regroup 
</p>
<p>themselves. Since then these groups have been waging asymmetric warfare with suicide 
</p>
<p>attacks, improvised explosive devices, sometimes also rocket fire, first against the Malian 
</p>
<p>armed forces and soldiers of Operation Serval, and more recently against the United 
</p>
<p>Nations forces. 
</p>
<p>25. On account of this new vulnerable situation, at the time of the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>third visit, MINUSMA already seemed to be one of the most deadly peacekeeping 
</p>
<p>operations, with a total of 23 peacekeepers killed and 100 injured, including with disabling 
</p>
<p>injuries. 
</p>
<p>26. Furthermore, the relationship between the Government and separatist groups in the 
</p>
<p>north took a radical turn with the announcement of the visit of the Prime Minister and other 
</p>
<p>senior officials of the Malian Government to Kidal in May 2014. On 16 May 2014, during a 
</p>
<p>demonstration against the visit, a crowd of around 100 MNLA supporters threw stones and 
</p>
<p>Molotov cocktails at members of the Malian Government&#8217;s security forces and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations police responsible for restoring public order at Kidal airport. 
</p>
<p>27. On 17 May 2014, the Prime Minister&#8217;s delegation finally arrived in Kidal. The 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister visited the camp of the Malian armed forces and went to the governorate for 
</p>
<p>a meeting with officials from the regional authorities and community and civil society 
</p>
<p>leaders from Kidal. Subsequently, heavy fighting broke out between armed elements of 
</p>
<p>MNLA and the Malian armed forces for control of the Kidal governorate building. 
</p>
<p>28. The toll of the fighting, which ended with the seizure of the governorate by members 
</p>
<p>of MNLA and HCUA, is a matter for concern: 11 deaths, including 8 civilians and 3 
</p>
<p>members of the Malian armed forces, 34 civilians in arbitrary detention and material 
</p>
<p>damage. Following the clashes, the governorate was vandalized, stormed and looted by the 
</p>
<p>members of MNLA and MAA, who were joined later by the civilian population. The 
</p>
<p>Government of Mali, in a statement issued on 17 May 2014, described the events of Kidal 
</p>
<p>as a declaration of war and promised that an appropriate response would follow. The 
</p>
<p>Government condemned the killing of eight civilians and called for the establishment of an 
</p>
<p>international commission of inquiry to shed light on the events. 
</p>
<p>29. On 21 May 2014, after fortifying its positions, the Malian army launched a military 
</p>
<p>offensive against the MNLA, HCUA and MAA positions in Kidal. Light and heavy gunfire 
</p>
<p>were used to take control of the town. After heavy fighting, lasting about three hours, 
</p>
<p>armed groups took over the barracks of the Malian armed forces, forcing them to retreat out 
</p>
<p>of Kidal. When the fighting ended 36 persons had been killed, including 32 members of the 
</p>
<p>Malian armed forces and 4 members of the armed groups, and 93 had been wounded. Forty-
</p>
<p>five members of the Malian armed forces had been captured and were being held by armed 
</p>
<p>groups; and administrative buildings and civilian homes had been vandalized and looted. 
</p>
<p>30. Such events have significantly worsened the security situation in the north, where 
</p>
<p>Malian armed forces have retreated from their positions and terrorists and armed groups are 
</p>
<p>gaining ground and still circulating and running their operations. This is compounded by 
</p>
<p>banditry by armed groups, including militia forces and other unidentified groups. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>31. Following these events and since the Algiers talks, the number of armed clashes has 
</p>
<p>increased in northern Mali among the different members of the armed coalitions aligned 
</p>
<p>with the two main parties in the peace process. 
</p>
<p>32. A typical example of this trend was the violent battle that took place near Tabankort 
</p>
<p>in the Gao region, on 10 July 2014, between the alliance of pro-independence groups 
</p>
<p>MNLA, HCUA and MAA, and the so-called loyalist Arab and Tuareg groups, including an 
</p>
<p>MAA faction close to the Government, Tuareg soldiers from the Imghad tribe as well as 
</p>
<p>members of CMFPR. Such factional fighting took place on 20 July in Tarkint, in <i>cercle</i> of 
</p>
<p>Bourem, between MAA and MNLA factions. 
</p>
<p>33. Due to the resurgence of localized fighting, on 24 July, at the end of the first round 
</p>
<p>of the Algiers talks, both parties set up a joint commission to be deployed in northern Mali 
</p>
<p>with the assistance of MINUSMA so as to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities between 
</p>
<p>MNLA and MAA and factions of the same ethnic groups allied to the Government. 
</p>
<p>34.  In spite of these many challenges, the Government has made progress in forging a 
</p>
<p>national vision for the reform of the security sector. For example, on 14 August 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert was pleased to hear that a national council for the reform of the security 
</p>
<p>sector had been established by presidential decree. The reform, which is part of the agenda 
</p>
<p>for peace in Mali, will be essential for the modernization of its national defence and 
</p>
<p>security forces. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The ongoing challenge of the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p>35. The inauguration of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, on 4 September 2014, ended 
</p>
<p>a 16-month transitional period of disturbances, marked by the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat of 22 March 2012 
</p>
<p>and the state of emergency declared between January and July 2013. 
</p>
<p>36. The Transitional Government gained notoriety through its contradictory actions in 
</p>
<p>the fight against impunity. It submitted information relating to international crimes 
</p>
<p>committed during the crisis in Mali to the International Criminal Court, yet it approved the 
</p>
<p>promotion to general of the instigator of the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, Captain Amadou Haya Sanogo, 
</p>
<p>who was suspected of direct involvement in committing those crimes. 
</p>
<p>37. Another legal loophole in the fight against impunity is article 18 of the 
</p>
<p>Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement, under which the parties commit to take appropriate 
</p>
<p>confidence-building measures to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement and to 
</p>
<p>release those detained in connection with the armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>38. The Malian Constitution of 1992, which is still in force, provides for an independent 
</p>
<p>judiciary; but the judiciary is often subject to interference from the executive and corruption 
</p>
<p>is commonplace. 
</p>
<p>39. In his report of March 2014, the Independent Expert praised the considerable efforts 
</p>
<p>made by the Malian judiciary, which had demonstrated great courage and a certain 
</p>
<p>independence by conducting investigations into serious crimes committed in the south of 
</p>
<p>the country during the crisis, despite the modest logistical and material resources provided 
</p>
<p>by the Government. 
</p>
<p>40 However, the Independent Expert drew attention to the fact that little or no headway 
</p>
<p>had been made so far in the investigations into the war crimes and crimes against humanity 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by all the belligerents in the north of the country. 
</p>
<p>41. This contrast has remained apparent since, as shown by the progress made in the 
</p>
<p>investigation of the case of the missing &#8220;red beret&#8221; soldiers and the mutiny of September 
</p>
<p>2013; both events centred on the Kati military barracks, the headquarters of those involved </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>in the coup. Even before he had overseen the exhumation of the bodies of victims in two 
</p>
<p>cases of enforced disappearances, in December 2013 and April 2014 respectively, the 
</p>
<p>investigating judge responsible for the cases had sufficient evidence to order the arrest of 
</p>
<p>General Sanogo, four senior officials from the former military junta and their associates. 
</p>
<p>The defendants remain under arrest, pending the commencement of their trials. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert met with representatives of the association of parents and spouses of 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;red beret&#8221; soldiers killed at the Kati military barracks, who said that they were 
</p>
<p>distraught and sad because, since the exhumation of their relatives&#8217; remains, the families 
</p>
<p>were still waiting for the victims&#8217; bodies to be returned to them, in order to make funeral 
</p>
<p>arrangements. The families also complained that they had not received any assistance from 
</p>
<p>the military authorities, contrary to the provisions of the Malian army regulations. 
</p>
<p>42. The Independent Expert emphasizes that the Malian Government and military 
</p>
<p>authorities had, in each instance, brought before the civilian judicial authorities the military 
</p>
<p>personnel against whom warrants to appear had been issued, regardless of their military 
</p>
<p>rank. This attests to the efforts being made in Mali to assert the control of the civilian 
</p>
<p>authorities over the army and other security bodies. 
</p>
<p>43. However, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed as part of the conflict 
</p>
<p>in the north continue to go largely unpunished. The Government established a special 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry into the murder of Malian soldiers in Aguelhok in 2012, but the 
</p>
<p>members of that commission could not reach Aguelhok for security reasons and had to stop 
</p>
<p>at Gao, where they met with the families of the victims. The commission has drawn up a 
</p>
<p>list of survivors, widows and orphans, and has met with them, but it has not been able to 
</p>
<p>conduct thorough investigations. It has submitted a progress report to the authorities. 
</p>
<p>44. The Independent Expert would like to commend the Malian human rights 
</p>
<p>organizations and their international partners who have continued to remind the Malian 
</p>
<p>authorities at the highest level that it is their duty to respect the right to justice and the right 
</p>
<p>to compensation for the victims of such crimes and not to make those rights a bargaining 
</p>
<p>chip in the political talks with armed groups. The organizations have and deplored the fact 
</p>
<p>that no distinction has been made between political prisoners, criminals under ordinary law 
</p>
<p>and persons suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>45. Despite these calls, the Government of Mali has, over the last year, begun to release 
</p>
<p>political detainees belonging to the armed groups, as it did in October 2013, invoking the 
</p>
<p>confidence-building measures provided for in article 18 of the Ouagadougou Preliminary 
</p>
<p>Agreement. 
</p>
<p>46. On 15 July 2014, the Government released 42 members of MNLA, HCUA and 
</p>
<p>MAA, in exchange for 45 soldiers captured during the events that occurred in Kidal in May. 
</p>
<p>Some of the individuals released had been charged with, or were under investigation for, 
</p>
<p>their alleged roles in committing international crimes during the conflict in the north of the 
</p>
<p>country. 
</p>
<p>47. On 15 August 2014, the Malian Government released Houka Houka Ag 
</p>
<p>Alfousseyni, who, as a sharia court judge in Timbuktu, had allegedly been ruthless with the 
</p>
<p>local population during the occupation of the city by jihadi groups. The court had ordered 
</p>
<p>amputations, floggings and arbitrary arrests. The judge investigating the case had filed 
</p>
<p>charges against Mr. Alfousseyni for his alleged role in committing those crimes. 
</p>
<p>48. These politically-motivated releases occurred at the same time as the competent 
</p>
<p>investigating judges were holding the first round of hearings for a group of victims of 
</p>
<p>international crimes committed in the north of Mali. The releases pose a security risk for 
</p>
<p>the victims who are losing all confidence in their country&#8217;s justice system. Victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>associations have expressed great concern because of the sense of fear among victims, who 
</p>
<p>realize that their torturers are at liberty, and because of the resurgence of armed groups </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>which, once again, occupy much of the northern part of the country. This situation is all the 
</p>
<p>more worrying as the Malian justice system does not provide for any witness or victim 
</p>
<p>protection measures. 
</p>
<p>49. In response to Malian civil society organizations, the Independent Expert recalls that 
</p>
<p>the confidence-building measures set out in article 18 of the Ouagadougou Preliminary 
</p>
<p>Agreement are no justification for the politically-motivated release of alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>of serious human rights violations. Such action is contrary to the international obligations 
</p>
<p>of Mali and undermines the principle of the separation of powers enshrined in article 81 of 
</p>
<p>the Malian Constitution of 25 February 1992. 
</p>
<p>50. The Independent Expert raised these issues during his meeting with the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice and Human Rights, who highlighted the fact that: none of these releases has been 
</p>
<p>decided definitively, as the procedures have not been completed; policy measures have 
</p>
<p>been taken so as not to deprive the persons concerned of their liberty; and the Government 
</p>
<p>will ensure that there is no statute of limitation for crimes committed by those released. The 
</p>
<p>Minister informed the Independent Expert of the Government&#8217;s efforts to renew 
</p>
<p>investigations in the north of the country by establishing mobile counselling centres, which 
</p>
<p>should be operational shortly. 
</p>
<p>51. The Independent Expert welcomes these efforts and the process of rebuilding the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission so as to bring it into line with the Paris Principles. The 
</p>
<p>Independent expert notes with satisfaction that, on 10 July 2014, and in accordance with 
</p>
<p>article 18 of the Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement, as well as the ceasefire agreement 
</p>
<p>of 23 May 2014, the Malian Government sent a request for technical assistance to the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations with a view to the establishment of a commission 
</p>
<p>to shed light on the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>committed between 1 January 2012 and the date of the commission&#8217;s establishment. Such a 
</p>
<p>commission, if provided with sufficient resources, is likely to give new momentum to 
</p>
<p>efforts towards combating impunity in Mali. 
</p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert welcomes the appointment, on 9 June 2014, of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary General of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, following the 
</p>
<p>adoption, on 20 March 2014, of the government bill to establish the Commission. With a 
</p>
<p>mandate of three years, the Commission is entrusted with the task of shedding light on the 
</p>
<p>serious human rights violations that took place in Mali between 1960 and 2013, as well as 
</p>
<p>of encouraging reconciliation and consolidating national unity and democratic values. 
</p>
<p>53. Many of the persons consulted have expressed concerns about the independence of 
</p>
<p>the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission, which will come under the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>National Reconciliation; there are also concerns that the Commission was established 
</p>
<p>without prior consultation at a national level with the country&#8217;s social and community 
</p>
<p>leaders. There have been reports of a lack of transparency in the process for appointing 
</p>
<p>members of the Commission. It should be noted that, as part of the political negotiations in 
</p>
<p>Algiers, armed groups were invited to participate in the selection process for members of 
</p>
<p>the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. Bearing that in mind, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert draws attention the need to ensure that alleged perpetrators of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations do not end up serving as members of the Commission. </p>

<p><b> III. The human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights violations committed by the Malian armed forces 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Independent Expert has received reports of violations committed by the Malian 
</p>
<p>armed forces. There have been eight incidents in which they have been implicated in this 
</p>
<p>regard. They involve violations of the right to life and to physical integrity and cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>55. The Independent Expert notes that there has been a marked decrease in cases of 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to life attributable to the Malian armed forces since his last report. 
</p>
<p>The fact that they are stationed in different parts of the north could explain this 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p>56. The most emblematic of the incidents took place in the town of Kidal, in which 
</p>
<p>violent confrontations broke out between Malian armed forces and armed groups during the 
</p>
<p>visit of the Prime Minister of Mali on 16 and 17 May 2014. On the morning of 21 May, 
</p>
<p>fighting involving the use of heavy weapons took place between the Malian armed forces 
</p>
<p>and the various armed groups present in the town. The fighting in and around the Kidal 
</p>
<p>governorate building resulted in loss of life (of civilians and soldiers) and extensive 
</p>
<p>material damage. The Malian armed forces reportedly carried out indiscriminate and 
</p>
<p>disproportionate attacks, which caused harm to the civilian population in the town. 
</p>
<p>57. The Independent Expert notes that one person was killed by a member of the Malian 
</p>
<p>armed forces in Gao&#8217;s Quatri&#232;me Quartier, or Fourth District. The incident reportedly 
</p>
<p>occurred during the night of 15 to 16 November 2014; at around 1 a.m., a Malian army 
</p>
<p>lance corporal allegedly entered a bar with his weapon and began to check identity papers. 
</p>
<p>During the identity check, he was said to have stripped the people present of their 
</p>
<p>belongings and then opened fire, killing one person and wounding five others before he was 
</p>
<p>overpowered and brought to the gendarmerie, where he was placed in detention in camp 
</p>
<p>No. 1 of the Malian armed forces. 
</p>
<p>58. The Independent Expert notes with great concern the increasing number of rape 
</p>
<p>cases involving minors committed by the Malian armed forces, particularly in the Gao and 
</p>
<p>Timbuktu regions. He recalled the serious nature of such acts, which constitute one of the 
</p>
<p>six grave violations against children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>59. The wave of rapes committed by elements of the Malian armed forces began on 9 
</p>
<p>May 2014, including the rape of a 14-year-old girl by two soldiers in the Ch&#226;teau District of 
</p>
<p>Gao. The two soldiers suspected of the rape have not faced any prosecution, which 
</p>
<p>reinforces the sense of impunity within the army. 
</p>
<p>60. On 31 July 2014, a member of the Malian armed forces raped a 16-year-old girl of 
</p>
<p>Arab descent in Timbuktu. The victim was provided with care by a doctor from the Central 
</p>
<p>Emergency Response Fund in Timbuktu and M&#233;decins sans fronti&#232;res. The perpetrator was 
</p>
<p>arrested; he is being held in solitary confinement in the military garrison pending a hearing 
</p>
<p>by the military council with jurisdiction over such acts. 
</p>
<p>61. On 7 October 2014, a member of the armed forces of Mali raped an 11-year-old girl. 
</p>
<p>According to the victim, she was at home when she was approached by a female neighbour. 
</p>
<p>The neighbour then allegedly took her to a house located some 150 metres from her home, 
</p>
<p>dragged her into a room where a man was waiting and closed the door as she left. The 
</p>
<p>victim reportedly remained locked up for one hour with her torturer, who raped her. On the 
</p>
<p>same day, the victim was taken to the hospital in Gao, where she received medical care and </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>psychosocial support from the non-governmental organization GREFFA, or Women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Action, Research, Study and Training Group. The perpetrator and his accomplice were 
</p>
<p>arrested and are in detention. 
</p>
<p>62. On 11 November 2014, in Niafounk&#233;, 140 km from Timbuktu, a representative of 
</p>
<p>the women&#8217;s movement expressed her concern over reports of sexual harassment of girls 
</p>
<p>from that community on the part of the Malian armed forces. In her view, the Malian armed 
</p>
<p>forces were known to intimidate girls into granting them sexual favours. Despite the grave 
</p>
<p>public concern over this issue, no member of the Malian armed forces has been called to 
</p>
<p>account by his superiors. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert has also received reports of cases of cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment. On 2 November 2014, following an assault by the Malian army to 
</p>
<p>liberate the village of Boulkessy, 20 persons were arrested and detained. During the transfer 
</p>
<p>of the prisoners, human rights officers at the regional office in Mopti observed that some of 
</p>
<p>them had marks that would suggest cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Some declared 
</p>
<p>that they had been beaten by soldiers after their arrest. The victims reportedly received 
</p>
<p>blows to the head and other parts of the body. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human rights violations committed by armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>64. Extremist armed groups present in the north of Mali continue to be involved in 
</p>
<p>human rights violations: violations of the right to life, abductions, cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment, unlawful detention, the recruitment and use of children by armed 
</p>
<p>groups, asymmetrical attacks and looting. Asymmetrical attacks have claimed the lives of at 
</p>
<p>least 28 persons, including 25 United Nations peacekeepers, and wounded at least 51, 
</p>
<p>including 9 minors. The attacks were carried out in areas occupied by armed groups in the 
</p>
<p>town of Kidal after the events of 21 May 2014. 
</p>
<p>65. On 16 May 2014, at the time of a demonstration by the opposition during the Malian 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister&#8217;s visit to Kidal, members of the government security forces and United 
</p>
<p>Nations police were attacked, as indicated in paragraph 26 above. 
</p>
<p>66. On 17 May 2014, heavy fighting erupted during the meeting of the Prime Minister 
</p>
<p>and his delegation with officials from the regional authorities and community and civil 
</p>
<p>society leaders in Kidal and ended with the capture of the governate by elements of MNLA 
</p>
<p>and HCUA, claiming the lives of 11 persons (8 civilians and 3 members of the Malian 
</p>
<p>armed forces), the arbitrary detention of 34 civilians and causing material damage (see 
</p>
<p>paras. 27 and 28 above). 
</p>
<p>67. There were reports of asymmetrical attacks, including 6 mine incidents, 3 incidents 
</p>
<p>involving rocket and mortar fire, 2 suicide attacks and 20 incidents involving explosive 
</p>
<p>ordnance. The region with the highest number of casualties from these attacks is Kidal, 
</p>
<p>with a total of 23 attacks that claimed 15 lives and wounded 51 persons, including 3 
</p>
<p>minors. Next is the region of Gao, where there were 6 attacks to which 6 children fell 
</p>
<p>victim. Lastly, 3 incidents were recorded in the Timbuktu region. 
</p>
<p>68. The Independent Expert notes with great concern the increase in the number of such 
</p>
<p>attacks and their impact on children. On 29 July 2014, in Tihaoulalene in the Gao region, a 
</p>
<p>16-year-old boy of Arab descent was injured in his right hand by explosive devices. On 8 
</p>
<p>August 2014, two children were injured by explosive devices and taken to the Senegalese 
</p>
<p>battalion infirmary based in Tabankort. They were later evacuated by helicopter, assisted by 
</p>
<p>doctors, and cared for by a medical team from the International Committee of the Red 
</p>
<p>Cross at the hospital in Gao. On 18 August 2014, an 8-year-old child was injured in 
</p>
<p>Tabankort while playing with an explosive device. The victim lost the use of three fingers 
</p>
<p>and sustained injuries to the arm and the head. </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>69. On the same day, a 10-year-old child belonging to the Arab community was injured 
</p>
<p>when an explosive device went off in the Ezadjad area. The child was transported to the 
</p>
<p>MINUSMA camp where he reportedly received first aid before being evacuated to the 
</p>
<p>hospital in Gao on 21 August. On 4 October 2014, a 12-year-old member of the Arab 
</p>
<p>community of Tabankort was seriously injured in the right hand while playing with an 
</p>
<p>explosive device that he had picked up in the vicinity of Tabankort. 
</p>
<p>70. United Nations peacekeepers came under a number of rocket and mortar attacks in 
</p>
<p>convoys and at the airport in Kidal. The deadliest attack against the United Nations in Mali 
</p>
<p>took place on 3 October 2014. On that date, nine peacekeepers from the Niger were killed 
</p>
<p>in an ambush by heavily armed men on motorcycles travelling between M&#233;naka and 
</p>
<p>Ansongo in north-eastern Mali. 
</p>
<p>71. In accordance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ratified by Mali on 26 February 1999, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert has received reports of inhuman and degrading treatment committed by 
</p>
<p>armed groups. The Independent Expert is particularly concerned about the wave of offences 
</p>
<p>committed by members of MNLA against the families of the Malian armed forces soldiers 
</p>
<p>still present in M&#233;naka. 
</p>
<p>72. On 12 June 2014, a 30-year-old woman was beaten by three members of MNLA at 
</p>
<p>the market in M&#233;naka. The victim reported that she had been brutally beaten by three 
</p>
<p>individuals on the pretence that her husband was a member of the Malian armed forces 
</p>
<p>based in Ansongo. She was called pro-Malian. This raises the larger question of how to 
</p>
<p>protect the families of soldiers in towns occupied by armed groups. 
</p>
<p>73. On 6 July 2014, as part of its mandate to monitor the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>places of detention, the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA heard testimony from 
</p>
<p>prisoners held by HCUA in Kidal. It raises concerns about the way in which certain HCUA 
</p>
<p>combatants humiliated and showed contempt for the prisoners. This was clear from pictures 
</p>
<p>they took using mobile phones, particularly while the prisoners were going to the toilet or 
</p>
<p>taking showers, for the purpose of taunting them. 
</p>
<p>74. Acts of torture were committed during clashes between the pro-Government MAA 
</p>
<p>and MNLA. For example, a combatant from the pro-Government MAA captured by 
</p>
<p>MNLA, on 8 June 2014, in a village near Tabankort in the Gao region and detained at 
</p>
<p>Intachdaite for 70 days was allegedly tortured in order to compel him to disclose 
</p>
<p>information about the pro-Government MAA. MNLA combatants reportedly burned the 
</p>
<p>victim&#8217;s ears and genitals. 
</p>
<p>75. On 20 August 2014, following an exchange of prisoners between armed groups on 
</p>
<p>18 August, one of the four prisoners released by MNLA, a 45-year-old member of MAA, 
</p>
<p>was taken to hospital. The person concerned had wounds which suggested that he had been 
</p>
<p>bound by his wrists, which had affected his skin and flesh to the point that his bones were 
</p>
<p>visible in places where he had been tied up. According to the doctor, this is a serious case 
</p>
<p>that might require amputation of the affected limbs. It is allegedly the result of being tied up 
</p>
<p>for long periods of time, an act that constitutes cruel treatment in a detention setting. The 
</p>
<p>injured party has expressed his wish to make a formal complaint against the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>On the same day, in M&#233;naka in the region of Gao, six civilians were stopped at a barrier 
</p>
<p>under MNLA control and severely beaten on the grounds that they were wearing T-shirts in 
</p>
<p>the national colours of Mali. 
</p>
<p>76. The Human Rights Division of MINUSMA has recorded 68 illegal arrests and 
</p>
<p>detentions carried out by armed groups in the regions of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu. Most of 
</p>
<p>the prisoners to whom the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA had access were either 
</p>
<p>members of armed groups (17) arrested by their respective superiors on disciplinary </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>grounds or under ordinary law or civilians (29) arrested under ordinary law by the 
</p>
<p>Coordination (coalition of MNLA, HCUA and MAA). 
</p>
<p>77. In Kidal and in Ber, the Coordination arrested and brought before the sharia courts 
</p>
<p>not only civilians suspected of being spies or members of jihadi groups but also those 
</p>
<p>suspected of fraud, theft, rape and murder. The other prisoners (22), to whom the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Division of MINUSMA did not have access, were members of armed groups 
</p>
<p>arrested by an opposing group during the confrontations. In Kidal, in October 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Coordination put in place a system for dealing with prisoners which differentiates between 
</p>
<p>civilians and members of armed groups. Detentions on disciplinary grounds are handled 
</p>
<p>separately by each of the three groups and persons detained for offences under ordinary law 
</p>
<p>are grouped together in a single place visited by the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA, 
</p>
<p>and the cases are referred to a sharia court for a decision. 
</p>
<p>78. During the period covered by this report, the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA 
</p>
<p>recorded 39 releases carried out by the armed groups, including 16 in August as part of a 
</p>
<p>prisoner exchange between one MNLA faction and MAA (Platform) and 5 releases of 
</p>
<p>persons detained for disciplinary reasons. With respect to detentions for offences under 
</p>
<p>ordinary law, 38 persons were released during the period under review, including 22 
</p>
<p>civilians and 16 members of armed groups, in proceedings conducted by a sharia court 
</p>
<p>judge. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Intercommunal and intracommunal conflicts 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Independent Expert is concerned about the increasing number of intercommunal 
</p>
<p>and intracommunal conflicts and human rights violations caused by these conflicts. During 
</p>
<p>the reporting period, the Independent Expert was able to document at least seven deaths 
</p>
<p>caused by these conflicts throughout northern Mali. These conflicts have different causes 
</p>
<p>and affect almost all communities, in particular the Tuareg, Songhai and Arab communities. 
</p>
<p>80. Furthermore, in recent months the Independent Expert has observed another trend 
</p>
<p>involving conflicts between armed groups often formed on the basis of their identity. The 
</p>
<p>groups have sparked fighting which has brought about extensive civilian collateral damage. 
</p>
<p>81. On 27 July 2014, clashes between ethnic Tuareg, Daoussak and Ibretian 
</p>
<p>communities were reported following the theft of livestock in Tankademi, in the <i>cercle</i> of 
</p>
<p>M&#233;naka. The clashes left four dead and two injured. One of the injured persons was an 
</p>
<p>MNLA member, a 28-year-old man from the Daoussak faction of Tamalelt, who was 
</p>
<p>wounded in his right arm and left foot. The wounded were taken to the Referral Health 
</p>
<p>Centre of M&#233;naka. 
</p>
<p>82. There are reports that on the night of 1 August 2014, three unidentified men wearing 
</p>
<p>turbans and riding motorcycles burst into the Bella camp of Ebang Melen in Gossi; they 
</p>
<p>opened fire on the residents of the camp, killing one man and critically wounding another, 
</p>
<p>both of whom were from the Bella community. According to a local source in Gossi, the 
</p>
<p>attack on the Ebang Melen camp is the result of a dispute between Bella and Tuareg 
</p>
<p>shepherds. They reportedly wished to water their livestock near a water supply point 
</p>
<p>located around the Ebang Melen camp. When members of the Bella community refused, 
</p>
<p>those of the Tuareg community allegedly attacked the Bella camp. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>83. The Independent Expert devotes special attention to violence against women in 
</p>
<p>conflict situations and attaches priority to documenting such violence. During the reporting </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>period, the sexual crimes recorded tended to highlight the actions of Malian armed forces 
</p>
<p>and civilians, as perpetrators. The Independent Expert notes with concern the difficulty of 
</p>
<p>collecting information on sexual violence committed by armed groups, particularly in 
</p>
<p>occupied areas. As this issue is still taboo in Mali, the available data might be masking the 
</p>
<p>extent of the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>84. On 9 November 2014, the Gommy Kondeye Association of Timbuktu organized a 
</p>
<p>meeting in the district of Sankor&#233; and gathered together 32 victims of conflict-related 
</p>
<p>sexual violence. The purpose of the meeting was to come in contact with these women and 
</p>
<p>discuss the establishment of a forum for dialogue on the transitional justice process in 
</p>
<p>Timbuktu. According to the victims, they live in fear of reprisals by the alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>who have been released, and they are stigmatized and cast out by the population. The 
</p>
<p>feeling of impunity that the perpetrators supposedly enjoy seems to have grown among the 
</p>
<p>population, particularly owing to the releases carried out as part of confidence-building 
</p>
<p>measures related to the peace process. Nevertheless, the women in question have the right 
</p>
<p>to justice and adequate reparation. 
</p>
<p>85. On 12 November 2014, the International Federation for Human Rights and Malian 
</p>
<p>Association for Human Rights filed a complaint on behalf of 80 victims of rape and sexual 
</p>
<p>violence during the occupation of the northern part of the country. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>welcomes this initiative, which is in keeping with the fight against impunity 
</p>
<p>86. Early and/or forced marriages are still being reported, particularly in the regions of 
</p>
<p>Timbuktu and Mopti. On 11 November 2014, the Association of Women Jurists of Mali in 
</p>
<p>Niafounk&#233; indicated that it was aware of more than 150 victims of forced marriage and 
</p>
<p>offences against the integrity of the person (rape and other acts of sexual violence). 
</p>
<p><b> D. The situation of children 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Independent Expert remains concerned about the harm suffered by children 
</p>
<p>because of the conflict in Mali. In fact, children are the main victims of the crisis, as they 
</p>
<p>are the most vulnerable and are often recruited and used by armed groups. Children are 
</p>
<p>prey to sexual abuse and exposed to explosive remnants of war. 
</p>
<p>88. The Independent Expert has received reports that children have been recruited by 
</p>
<p>extremist armed groups in some areas in the north of the country. Children have been seen 
</p>
<p>at the side of armed groups in Ber, M&#233;naka, Intilit, Kidal, Aguelhok and Boulkessy, which 
</p>
<p>lays them open to other consequences such as arrest. For example, nine children were 
</p>
<p>detained in prisons in Bamako, in violation of the Protocol for the Release, Transfer and 
</p>
<p>Protection of Children Associated with Armed Forces and Groups, which was signed by the 
</p>
<p>Government on 1 July 2013 and which concerned all parties to the conflict in Mali. 
</p>
<p>89. On 1 August 2014, a 17-year-old boy from Gossi managed to slip from the hands of 
</p>
<p>MUJAO in Tabankort. He stated that he had been abducted in 2012 by MUJAO in the 
</p>
<p>region of Timbuktu and taken to Tabankort. He said that he had made several attempts to 
</p>
<p>escape while he was in captivity within this group, which had all ended in failure. On 24 
</p>
<p>October 2014, armed groups in Timbuktu organized a meeting with young people in Ber. 
</p>
<p>The MNLA Chief of Operations invited more than 50 youngsters from the Tuareg and Arab 
</p>
<p>communities in Ber to the MNLA headquarters there with a view to mobilizing the young 
</p>
<p>and asking them to make themselves available to the groups at the appropriate moment. 
</p>
<p>90. The Independent Expert recalls the principle that the parties to the conflict should 
</p>
<p>not recruit or use children as combatants or support staff in hostilities. He also emphasized 
</p>
<p>that such practices constitute one of the six grave violations against children in armed 
</p>
<p>conflict. </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.15-00252 
</p>
<p>91. The Independent Expert remains concerned about the adverse effects of explosive 
</p>
<p>remnants of war on children. On 5 August 2014, in the village of Daki, the fingers of a 12-
</p>
<p>year-old boy from the Fulani community were blown off by the blast of an explosive 
</p>
<p>device. Six other children were injured by explosive devices following confrontations in 
</p>
<p>Tabankort. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The prison situation 
</b></p>
<p>92. During the reporting period, the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA recorded 92 
</p>
<p>conflict-related arrests made by government forces (soldiers and gendarmes), including 4 
</p>
<p>arrests involving persons who identified themselves as minors. 
</p>
<p>93. The de facto jurisdiction of the courts in Gao, Timbuktu and Mopti over conflict-
</p>
<p>related cases has been confirmed, as the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA recorded 
</p>
<p>90 arrests there (30 in Gao, 35 in Timbuktu and 25 in Mopti), and only 35 cases have been 
</p>
<p>transferred to Bamako. However, no judgement of the Supreme Court was rendered to 
</p>
<p>reverse the precedents transferring the cases from the aforementioned courts to the Court of 
</p>
<p>First Instance of Commune III of Bamako. This thus raises the question of whether the 
</p>
<p>arrests were legal. 
</p>
<p>94. After a lull in the number of arrests between June and September 2014 (fewer than 
</p>
<p>10 per month), a sharp increase in number was recorded in October (18) and especially in 
</p>
<p>November (52), largely owing to the arbitrary arrest of groups of persons to carry out 
</p>
<p>identity checks (24 recorded cases). Of the 92 persons arrested during the reporting period, 
</p>
<p>72 have been released and 20 are still in detention. 
</p>
<p>95. In addition, from 1 May to 3 December 2014, the Human Rights Division of 
</p>
<p>MINUSMA recorded the release from custody of 196 prisoners: 82 concerned persons 
</p>
<p>connected with an armed group or armed groups who were released under article 18 of the 
</p>
<p>Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement (mainly in June and July), while the releases ordered 
</p>
<p>between October and December concerned persons arrested for the purpose of identity 
</p>
<p>checks or on unfounded allegations. 
</p>
<p>96. The Human Rights Division of MINUSMA has recorded 174 conflict-related 
</p>
<p>detainees, including 5 persons purported to be minors at the time of their arrest. The 
</p>
<p>detainees include 88 persons in pretrial detention under a committal order, 7 convicted 
</p>
<p>persons and 79 persons detained without a warrant. Thirty-four persons whose release has 
</p>
<p>been requested by one or several armed groups are still in detention. 
</p>
<p>97. The Minister of Justice and Human Rights has affirmed the Government&#8217;s desire to 
</p>
<p>devote special attention to improving prison conditions in Mali, which are run-down and 
</p>
<p>pose health and safety problems. The prisons were built during the colonial era and no 
</p>
<p>improvements have been made since. Staff is insufficient and poorly trained. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Refugees and internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>98. The Independent Expert had a productive meeting with the members of the Mali 
</p>
<p>Protection Cluster, who highlighted the various challenges to the work of humanitarian 
</p>
<p>actors, particularly the dwindling humanitarian space which is due to the deteriorating 
</p>
<p>security situation and restricted access to communities in the north. 
</p>
<p>99. According to data collected by the Mali Protection Cluster, 2.5 million vulnerable 
</p>
<p>people have been affected by the crisis in northern Mali and are in urgent need of 
</p>
<p>protection, including 126,249 internally displaced persons, more than 200,000 returning 
</p>
<p>refugees, 140,768 Malian refugees, and 32,425 spontaneous returnees and host </p>


<p>GE.15-00252 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>communities or vulnerable communities that have not been displaced. Population 
</p>
<p>movements continue to occur along with the hostilities. The Government encourages 
</p>
<p>refugees and internally displaced persons to return voluntarily to their regions of origin. 
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert argues for the safe and dignified return of refugees and internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons to their communities. 
</p>
<p>100. However, the deteriorating security situation in the north, intercommunal violence 
</p>
<p>and the threat of false accusations discourages people from returning. 
</p>
<p><b> G. The issue of slavery 
</b></p>
<p>101. The Independent Expert has received reports of the persistence of slavery in Mali. 
</p>
<p>Between July and August 2014, the non-governmental organization Temedt, with the 
</p>
<p>support of the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative (ABA ROLI), recorded 35 
</p>
<p>cases of slavery in the village of Labbezanga and 32 in Gossi. Before the fall of the city of 
</p>
<p>Gao in 2012, ABA ROLI had managed to provide legal aid to 18 persons in situations of 
</p>
<p>slavery through the Al Haq Legal Clinic. Given that slavery is not a punishable offence 
</p>
<p>under the criminal legislation of Mali, eight of the persons who received counsel had filed 
</p>
<p>complaints for slavery-related offences under the Criminal Code, in particular kidnapping, 
</p>
<p>unlawful confinement and rape.  
</p>
<p>102. The Independent Expert notes with concern that the legislative framework of Mali 
</p>
<p>does not provide for criminal penalties for acts of slavery. Therefore, despite the 
</p>
<p>promulgation of Act No. 2012-023 on Combating Human Trafficking and Related 
</p>
<p>Practices, slavery, including descent-based slavery, is still practised, especially in the north 
</p>
<p>of Mali. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>103. The Independent Expert notes with concern that armed groups occupy schools in the 
</p>
<p>three regions in the north. In late 2014, they held a total of 14 school buildings: 2 schools in 
</p>
<p>M&#233;naka; a school in Intilit; a school in Tessalit; a lyc&#233;e in Kidal; 2 schools in Aguelhok; a 
</p>
<p>primary school in Tabankort; a school in Lerneb; a school in Boulkessy, occupied by MAA 
</p>
<p>and HCUA; and 4 new schools in the Gao and Timbuktu regions, occupied respectively by 
</p>
<p>CPA, MAA (Platform), MAA (Coordination) and the MNLA/HCUA/MAA (Platform) joint 
</p>
<p>troops. The 4 new schools have just been added to the list of 10 schools already occupied 
</p>
<p>by MNLA, CPA, MAA (Coordination) and HCUA in the three regions, including Kidal. 
</p>
<p>104. In December 2014, a MINUSMA contingent moved out of a vocational training 
</p>
<p>centre that it had occupied since 2013. This situation was likely to infringe on the right to 
</p>
<p>education of children in northern Mali. 
</p>
<p>105. The Independent Expert recalls the essential nature of this right, on which all other 
</p>
<p>rights depend, and notes the progress made in the situation. The start of the school year in 
</p>
<p>October 2014 was largely observed in the various regions of northern Mali despite 
</p>
<p>differences in approaches. The schools in the town of Kidal reopened with curricula that are 
</p>
<p>different from those followed throughout the rest of the country. In the town of Kidal, the 
</p>
<p>lessons offered are focused on religion, which is a reflection of the decline of secularism in 
</p>
<p>this part of the country. 
</p>
<p>106. However, challenges remain, including a lack of safety, which strongly discourages 
</p>
<p>students from going to schools when they are not occupied by armed groups. Many families 
</p>
<p>in Kidal have chosen to send their children to Bamako or neighbouring countries to ensure 
</p>
<p>their access to education. </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The situation in northern Mali has deteriorated considerably, and the progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed by the Independent Expert during his second mission, in February 2014, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>terms of strengthening State authority, deploying the administration in the north and 
</b></p>
<p><b>combating impunity has been called into question as a result of the fighting that broke 
</b></p>
<p><b>out in Kidal from 16 to 21 May 2014. There is a genuine before and after mid-May 
</b></p>
<p><b>2014 in Mali, as the events in Kidal have contributed to moving political lines by 
</b></p>
<p><b>altering the power struggle between the Government and rebel groups. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>This has had a significant impact on the situation of human rights in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country. There is a striking contrast between the marked decrease in cases of 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of the right to life attributable to Malian armed forces and the significant 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b>committed by armed groups in the north of the country. The rape of minors by some 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the Malian armed forces is the main concern. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Extremist armed groups present in the north of Mali have been involved in 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious human rights violations, including violations of the right to life, cruel, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inhuman or degrading treatment, abductions, unlawful detention, recruitment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of children by armed groups, suicide and asymmetrical attacks and looting. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The ongoing political dialogue in Algiers carries with it the seeds for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>negotiated solution to the Malian crisis provided that this is not to the detriment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims of serious human rights violations. There is an African proverb which goes: 
</b></p>
<p><b>when elephants fight, the grass (reeds) gets hurt. In the case of Mali, the grass 
</b></p>
<p><b>symbolizes the victims who have paid a high price during the crisis and feel excluded 
</b></p>
<p><b>from political and judicial processes that are favouring the very political players who 
</b></p>
<p><b>are the cause of their troubles. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The independent expert recommends that the Malian authorities should:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Provide the State with the necessary means to protect civilians from 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacks by armed groups in accordance with human rights and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Create a political environment that is conducive to the effective and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable return of State authority to the northern regions in order to facilitate 
</b></p>
<p><b>people</b>&#8217;<b>s access to basic social services and bring about economic progress in these 
</b></p>
<p><b>regions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Strengthen the fight against impunity by precluding any amnesty for 
</b></p>
<p><b>international crimes, including sexual violence and the recruitment of children into 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed groups, and continue to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with the Rome Statute; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Adopt a decree to bring into force Act No. 2012-025 of 12 July 2012 on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Compensation of Victims of the Rebellion of 17 January 2012 and the Insurrectionary 
</b></p>
<p><b>Movement of 22 March 2012; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Meet the requests of the association of parents and spouses of the </b>&#8220;<b>red 
</b></p>
<p><b>beret</b>&#8221;<b> soldiers killed on duty, in particular the request for funerals to be arranged, </b></p>

<p><b>through strong symbolic measures, individually or as a group, and material assistance 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be provided to the families of the victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Finalize the ongoing initiatives for the establishment of mobile 
</b></p>
<p><b>counselling centres to expedite legal proceedings in the north of the country, reform 
</b></p>
<p><b>the National Human Rights Commission to bring it into line with international 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Facilitate access of the International Committee of the Red Cross and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Human Rights Division of MINUSMA to persons detained by the intelligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>services; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Give clear orders through chains of command and codes of conduct (or 
</b></p>
<p><b>their equivalent) to preclude security forces and armed groups from committing 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) Ensure that victims of sexual violence have access to legal and medical 
</b></p>
<p><b>services, including HIV/AIDS treatment, and psychosocial rehabilitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Strengthen the legal framework for combating slavery by enacting a law 
</b></p>
<p><b>that criminalizes traditional and contemporary forms of slavery. 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the armed groups should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Cease attacks on civilians; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Respect the humanitarian space and facilitate the access of humanitarian

<p><b>workers to populations in need of assistance and protection; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) End the recruitment and use of children by armed groups and facilitate 
</b></p>
<p><b>the release and reintegration of children who are still within their ranks. 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure that the United Nations and its Member States do not endorse 
</b></p>
<p><b>any peace agreement on the crisis in Mali which provides for amnesty for 
</b></p>
<p><b>international crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious human rights violations, including sexual violence and gender-based violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide financial support and technical assistance for the Government</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Malian judicial system with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>collecting evidence regarding the crimes committed in the north of Mali by armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups and Malian armed forces; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Support Malian initiatives in the area of security sector reform.</b>
