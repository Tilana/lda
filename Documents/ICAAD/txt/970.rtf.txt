You have made Mr Zhang Yong's life insecure in Fiji which may create a wrong impression on this beautiful country.

13.

Both are 1st offenders
(b)     
Some of the Goods were recovered

20.     
Considering the nature of the offence I inclined to act under Section 31(1) of the Sentencing & Penalties Decree.
