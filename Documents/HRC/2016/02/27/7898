<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 
21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Burundi was held at the 7th meeting on 24 
January 2013. The delegation of Burundi was headed by Clotilde Niragira, Minister of 
National Solidarity, Human Rights and Gender. At its 13th meeting, held on 29 January 
2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Burundi. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Burundi: Benin, India and Republic of 
Moldova. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Burundi: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BDI/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BDI/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/BDI/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to Burundi through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation presented the report of Burundi for the second cycle of 
the universal periodic review, emphasizing that Burundi had made substantial progress in 
the promotion and protection of human rights as a whole. 
</p>
<p>6. He thanked the entire international community, and especially the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, for supporting the people of 
Burundi even during the most difficult moments of the crisis. 
</p>
<p>7. Burundi had taken various practical measures in response to the recommendations 
made during the first cycle of the universal periodic review.1 It had drafted a bill on the 
prevention of, protection from and punishment of gender-based violence, which was in the 
process of being adopted. A pilot centre had been established to provide comprehensive 
support to victims of gender-based violence. The State had also taken steps towards 
ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/HRC/10/71. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.13-12565 
</p>
<p>Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. It had developed a national policy on human rights 
and child protection. In addition, a national children&#8217;s forum and a women&#8217;s forum were 
being established. Burundi had also set up an independent national electoral commission to 
thoroughly prepare for the 2015 elections. It had developed a strategic framework to 
promote growth and combat poverty, a national strategy for the socioeconomic 
reintegration of persons affected by conflict, and a national strategy to combat food 
insecurity. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation recognized, however, that Burundi was facing some challenges and 
impediments to the fulfilment of its human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>9. In the knowledge that the promotion and protection of human rights went hand in 
hand with development, Burundi had just adopted a new strategic framework to promote 
growth and combat poverty that focused on economic growth and job creation. 
</p><p>10. Burundi already had plenty of experience it could share with other nations, given the 
solutions it had found for the internecine conflicts that had lasted for decades and had 
crippled development. Thanks to the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for 
Burundi of 2000, the country had been able to exorcise the demons of division and ethnic 
hatred. Burundi had managed to train a new army and a national police force, which had 
received worldwide acclaim for their performance. 
</p>
<p>11. Burundi had established several national institutions for the promotion and 
protection of human rights, namely the Ombudsman, the National Independent Human 
Rights Commission (NIHRC) and the National Commission on Land and Other Properties. 
</p><p>12. With regard to civil and political rights, the new Criminal Code had, inter alia, 
abolished the death penalty, raised the age of criminal responsibility from 13 to 15 years 
and defined rape and torture as offences. The Code punished war crimes, crimes against 
humanity and genocide, which were not subject to statutory time limits or amnesty. 
13. In addition, Burundi had developed a criminal policy document to serve as a guide 
for judicial officials when processing case files, so as to ensure respect for defendants&#8217; 
rights with a view to creating a humane criminal justice system. 
14. Burundi had taken several steps to ensure that judicial services were more accessible 
and more evenly distributed. A policy creating itinerant judges had been established to 
dispense community justice, and legal advice services were offered through the courts in 
order to respond quickly to gross human rights violations. In addition, &#8220;focal point&#8221; judges 
had been appointed in civil courts to monitor cases involving gender-based violence.  
</p>
<p>15. Burundi was a State based on the rule of law and was committed to creating an 
accessible, independent, efficient, gender-sensitive judicial system that ensured respect for 
human rights. A preparatory committee for the national consultations on justice had been 
established to determine how best to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>16. Burundi had continued its efforts to reduce prison overcrowding by releasing 
prisoners on parole and granting presidential pardons. More than 7,000 prisoners, or more 
than 45 per cent of the prison population, had benefited from such acts of clemency. 
</p>
<p>17. A new Code of Criminal Procedure had been drafted; it had been adopted by the 
National Assembly and was currently before the Senate. One of the changes in the new 
Code was the introduction of community service as an alternative to imprisonment. The 
Government was also working through the prison administration to improve prison 
conditions: 7 out of 11 prisons had been renovated so as to separate children from adults 
and women from men. </p>


<p>GE.13-12565 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. With a view to promoting full protection for the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, the Government of Burundi had prepared a press bill, in which the main 
innovation was the decriminalization of press offences. 
</p>
<p>19. With regard to economic, social and cultural rights, the delegation explained the 
progress made in providing access to basic social services, among other things, and said 
that the Government provided free education for all children in primary school. Health care 
was also provided free of charge for children under 5 years of age and for women giving 
birth. The delegation noted the challenges with regard to the quality of health care, the high 
mortality rates among children and the labour force, and problems of hygiene, sanitation 
and access to drinking water.  
</p>
<p>20. The Constitution guaranteed the principle of equality among all citizens and 
established a minimum quota of 30 per cent representation for women in parliament and in 
the Government. With regard to inheritance, matrimonial regimes and bequests, the 
Government had launched a study on the effects of having no written law on those matters 
and on the advantages of having one. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to trafficking in persons, Burundi had ratified the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In 
addition, the trafficking and exploitation of women and girls were prohibited under the 
revised Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>22. Burundi had launched a study on the effects of having no written law on inheritance, 
matrimonial regimes and bequests, and on the advantages of having one. A national plan of 
action was currently being prepared and implemented in response to Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000). 
</p><p>23. On the subject of ethnic minorities, the delegation stressed that the Batwa&#8217;s rights 
were protected and that their community was represented in both chambers of parliament 
and in other republican institutions, as provided for in the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government had taken special measures to ensure protection for vulnerable 
groups, particularly albinos. It had ordered that cases involving violations of the rights of 
albinos should be handled without delay, and the perpetrators of such violations received 
the maximum penalties. 
</p>
<p>25. Burundi had not only ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (see paragraph 21 above) after the 
first cycle of the universal periodic review, but was also considering adopting several other 
international legal instruments. 
</p>
<p>26. The delegation acknowledged that the country still faced difficulties and challenges, 
including in the areas of population growth, food insecurity and the effective 
implementation of the strategic framework to promote growth and combat poverty. Human 
rights violations were still taking place: they included murder, gender-based violence and 
violations resulting from conflicts over land. 
</p>
<p>27. However, there were early signs that the people of Burundi were ready to rebuild the 
country on new foundations with a view to achieving social cohesion and effective 
reconciliation. The vast majority of refugees had returned, and the last refugee camp &#8212; 
Mtabila Camp in the United Republic of Tanzania &#8212; had closed on 31 December 2012. 
Internally displaced persons were gradually returning to their places of origin. A truth and 
reconciliation commission would also be established.  
</p>
<p>28. After calling on all its partners to help Burundi with support of all kinds, the head of 
the delegation reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to continuing its policy of </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.13-12565 
</p>
<p>strengthening the democratic process and the rule of law, expanding civil liberties and 
improving the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the interactive dialogue 74 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>30. Djibouti congratulated Burundi on the quality of its national report. It commended 
efforts for the promotion of human rights, in particular the adoption of a law in 2010 for the 
creation of a national human rights institution. Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p><p>31. Egypt noted the review conducted by Burundi to bring legislation into conformity 
with the principals of human rights. New provisions in the Criminal Code addressing the 
protection of children, the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, 
torture and rape were welcomed. Egypt made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Ethiopia expressed its appreciation of the progress in poverty reduction, protection 
of women and children and improvement in prison conditions. It asked for additional 
information on the efforts to promote democracy, good governance, poverty reduction and 
empowerment of women.  
</p>

</p><p>40. Japan commended the progress made on the rule of law, good governance, and 
gender equality. It expressed its appreciation of the high percentage of women represented

violence against girls in schools. Japan made recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-12565 <b>7 
</b></p>

additional relevant international legal instruments, as well as the recent creation of the 
NIHRC. Kenya made a recommendation.  
</p>

</p>
<p>43. Libya commended steps taken to ratify a number of international human rights

</p>
<p>44. Madagascar praised progress made in the field of human rights since the first

continue its efforts to address illiteracy. 
</p>
<p>47. Mexico acknowledged efforts made to overcome the recent history of suffering and 
serious human rights violations. It encouraged Burundi to continue the implementation of

</p>
<p>48. Morocco noted with satisfaction the cooperation with the Independent Expert on the 
situation of human rights in Burundi. Morocco inquired about the progress made in the 
establishment of a High Court of Justice and the preparation for the conference (<i>&#233;tats 
g&#233;n&#233;raux</i>) on the justice system, as well as about the measures taken to reintegrate 
detainees in the society. It also inquired about the current status of the Press Act. 
</p>
<p>49. Namibia noted with appreciation the ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress 
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol). It 
commended the new Criminal Code, but raised concerns about the lack of access to justice, 
the lack of qualified personnel in the judicial system and the low representation of women 
in Parliament. Namibia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. The Netherlands commended the variety of media and asked how that related to the 
new media law, which would presumably be more restrictive on press media. It urged the 
Government to continue dialogue with opposition parties. It noted with concern that 
education policy entrenched discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The 
Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Norway noted that adequate funding would be essential to the success of the new

in most cases. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.13-12565 
</p>
<p>53. The State of Palestine welcomed efforts in the areas of, inter alia, reduction of 
poverty and promotion of gender equality. Amendments to the Criminal Code and measures 
to protect children from domestic violence were commended. The State of Palestine urged 
Burundi to adopt a national plan for children&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Paraguay noted the revision of criminal legislation on torture, genocide, war crimes 
and crimes against humanity, and the abolition of capital punishment. It welcomed the 
establishment of the NIHRC and noted cooperation between Burundi and OHCHR. 
Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The delegation of Burundi thanked the representatives for their questions and 
reaffirmed its Government&#8217;s willingness to listen to their advice and suggestions so that 
together they could see how best to meet the challenges facing the country. The delegation 
grouped its replies by theme.  
</p>
<p>56. With regard to the question about the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission, the bill was in the process of being adopted by parliament. Burundi had not 
been able to establish the Commission in 2012 due to various sociopolitical and 
organizational impediments, but the President of the Republic was committed to 
establishing the Commission in 2013. The Government had deemed it unwise to combine 
the legal provisions governing the two transitional justice mechanisms, one non-judicial 
(the Truth and Reconciliation Commission) and the other judicial (the Special Tribunal). 
The legal provisions governing the latter would likely be drafted once the Commission had 
submitted its report.  
</p>
<p>57. With regard to impunity for serious human rights violations in the form of crimes 
and extrajudicial executions, it had been pointed out that the number of violations had 
dropped significantly and that the perpetrators of offences were brought to justice, as 
demonstrated by the recent arrest of a number of soldiers and police officers.  
</p>
<p>58. Regarding the concerns about the intimidation of journalists and human rights 
defenders, the delegation pointed out that freedom of expression was guaranteed. No 
journalists were intimidated. On the other hand, anyone who violated the law was 
prosecuted regardless of their profession. A bill decriminalizing press offences had been 
drafted, and the media had been given the opportunity to express their complaints about the 
bill. 
</p>
<p>59. Special procedures mandate holders were welcome: Burundi had worked closely 
with the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Burundi for eight years. 
The delegation would look into the possibility of extending a standing invitation to mandate 
holders. 
</p>
<p>60. Regarding the recommendation to adopt a specific law on violence against women, 
the Government was currently analysing a bill dealing specifically with gender issues, 
which was intended to protect women, girls and schoolchildren. In addition, anyone 
convicted of violence against women or children was liable to receive the maximum 
penalty. 
</p>
<p>61. With regard to the rights of the child, the head of the delegation said that a decree 
establishing a national children&#8217;s forum had been signed and was in the process of being 
implemented. In addition, the Government was developing a national policy to protect the 
rights of the child, as it recognized that children were the country&#8217;s future. Burundi had 
established a national policy on education for girls, and there was parity between girls and 
boys in access to school. 
</p>
<p>62. Concerning inheritance, matrimonial regimes and bequests, a bill had been 
submitted to parliament, but for the time being the Government had decided to launch a 
study on the impact and benefits of such a law. </p>


<p>GE.13-12565 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>63. The independence of the judiciary was guaranteed by the Constitution, but tangible 
reforms could be expected. The need for reform had already been pointed out during the 
negotiation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The Government was 
preparing for the national consultations on justice with a view to ensuring the full 
independence of the judiciary. The consultations would be held in the second half of 2013.  
</p><p>64. Concerning the 2015 elections and the opposition members in exile, some 
opposition members had already returned to the country, after the Government had 
consistently reached out to them to facilitate their return. Burundi needed all of its citizens 
to participate in the 2015 elections.  
</p>
<p>65. With regard to the independence of the National Independent Human Rights 
Commission, the delegation thanked partners for their assistance and reiterated its request 
for their continued support. It pointed out that the running costs of the Commission were 
covered by the State budget.  
</p>
<p>66. The Batwa were recognized as an ethnic group under the Constitution and did not 
suffer from any discrimination. With regard to protection for albinos, the delegation 
repeated that the perpetrators of offences against those persons received the maximum 
penalties. 
</p>
<p>67. The Philippines noted efforts by Burundi to improve its legal and institutional 
human rights framework and increase legal protection for women and children. It 
welcomed the second phase of the Strategic Framework for Growth and Poverty Reduction. 
The Philippines made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>68. The Republic of Korea took note of the establishment of the NIHRC, the revised 
Criminal Code and the measures taken to protect albinos. Burundi was encouraged to 
transform plans into actions. The Republic of Korea made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. The Republic of Moldova appreciated the strengthened institutional framework for 
human rights, including the NIHRC, and noted the willingness of Burundi to combat 
impunity. Work to improve children&#8217;s rights was welcomed. The Republic of Moldova 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. Romania took note of positive developments in Burundi. Despite the remaining 
challenges, Romania hoped that reform projects would be pursued without delay and 
encouraged further work to improve the situation of women. Romania made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Rwanda welcomed action for gender equality, notably the 30 per cent quota for 
women in decision-making bodies. It highlighted reforms to the business climate; poverty 
reduction and job creation; the new Ombudsman; and access to basic services. Rwanda 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72. Senegal noted achievements, notably in the justice, education and health sectors. It 
also noted measures to eliminate violence against women and increase their involvement in 
decision-making, and to provide free education. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Singapore welcomed the legislative and institutional reforms made by Burundi with 
respect to the rule of law, and the legislative and administrative measures to protect 
children, particularly the national plan of action to eliminate child labour and the national 
strategy to combat the phenomenon of street children. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>74. Slovakia acknowledged the abolition of the death penalty. It noted the establishment 
of the Child and Family Department within the Ministry of National Solidarity, Human 
Rights and Gender. It made recommendations.  </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-12565 
</p>
<p>75. Slovenia welcomed the NIHRC; the plan of action to eliminate child labour; and the 
equal gender distribution in schools. Slovenia remained concerned about girls&#8217; dropout, 
teenage pregnancies and the criminalization of same-sex relations. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. South Africa expressed appreciation for the strengthening of the capacity to protect 
human rights and the cooperation between Burundi and OHCHR. It welcomed the Strategic 
Plan for Justice and the draft law on gender violence. It noted the continued importance of 
providing Burundi with technical assistance. South Africa made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>77. Spain commended efforts towards political stability and human rights promotion, 
particularly the establishment of the NIHRC. It welcomed the abolition of the death penalty 
and the criminalization in the Criminal Code of genocide, war crimes, crimes against 
humanity and torture. Spain made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>78. Sri Lanka welcomed efforts in the areas of protection of children&#8217;s and women&#8217;s 
rights; criminalization of trafficking, exploitation and prostitution; improvement in access 
to health care; restoring peace, including the reintegration of former child soldiers; and 
civilian disarmament. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>79. Sudan acknowledged efforts to protect human rights, particularly the ratification of 
several human rights treaties and the measures to combat violence against women. It urged 
Burundi to speed up the adoption of a law to fight gender violence. Sudan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>80. Switzerland acknowledged the abolition of the death penalty in the 2009 Criminal 
Code and the establishment of the NIHRC. It encouraged Burundi to continue its efforts 
regarding gender equality and women rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>81. Thailand commended efforts to protect Batwa and albinos, empower rural women 
and improve detention conditions. Thailand was concerned about discrimination against 
girls, albinos and Batwa children in education, and about the criminalization of 
homosexuality. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>82. Togo took note of the laws on human rights; the abolition of the death penalty; the 
provision for punishment of torture, genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in 
the Criminal Code; the NIHRC; the promotion of girls&#8217; education; and the national health 
plan for 2011&#8211;2015. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>83. Tunisia noted the establishment of the NIHRC, the revised Criminal Code, and the 
current revision of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Actions to introduce transitional justice 
mechanisms were welcomed. Tunisia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>84. Turkey welcomed the abolition of death penalty, and free health care for children 
and during maternity. It urged further action on monitoring mechanisms, birth registration 
and juvenile justice. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p><p>85. Uganda noted achievements in the implementation of a 30 per cent quota for 
women&#8217;s representation in decision-making bodies, and the provision for punishment for 
the trafficking, exploitation and prostitution of women and girls. Uganda made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>86. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland commended several 
measures, but objected to the criminalization of homosexuality. It urged the ratification of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women (OP-CEDAW). Extrajudicial executions, torture and a lack of 
accountability remained serious concerns. The United Kingdom made recommendations. </p>


<p>GE.13-12565 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>87. The United States of America welcomed several measures, but expressed concern at 
political violence, impunity, harassment of those reporting corruption and human rights 
abuses, and the absence of prosecutions of perpetrators of trafficking. It made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>88. Uruguay welcomed the NIHRC. Despite changes to criminal legislation, the 
continued criminalization of homosexuality raised concerns. Uruguay noted that de facto 
discrimination of certain groups continued to be tolerated. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted the NIHRC, the amended
