</p>
<p>2. <i>Deplores</i> the brutal actions of the Syrian regime over the past 11 months, 
such as its use of heavy artillery and tanks to attack residential areas of cities and towns,

destruction, forced tens of thousands of Syrians to flee their homes and created widespread 
suffering among the Syrian people,<b> </b>resulting in a humanitarian crisis;

allow free and unimpeded access by the United Nations and humanitarian agencies to carry 
out a full assessment of needs in Homs and other areas, and to permit humanitarian 
agencies to deliver vital relief goods and services to all civilians affected by the violence,
