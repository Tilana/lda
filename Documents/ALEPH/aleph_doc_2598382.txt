Review of Operations  
 
Total Comprehensive Income for the Consolidated Group for the period was a loss of $618,491 (2015: $993,795). 
Total  Comprehensive  Loss  includes  a  gain  of  $71,898  (2015:  gain  of  $937,935)  arising  on  translation  of  foreign 
operations.  
 
Revenue of the Consolidated Entity from discontinued oil and gas production for the half year ended 30 June 2016 
was $10,513 (2015: $1,179,592).  The decrease reflects the sale of the Four Rivers Assets on 1 January 2016 and the 
sale of the Capitola Assets on 2 March 2016. 
 
For the half year ended 30 June 2016, the Company has recorded negative cash flows from operations of $1,389,039 
 (2015: negative $1,069,481).  
 
The  functional  currency  for  the  Company  is  US  Dollars.    The  presentation  currency  for  the  Group’s  accounts  is 
Australian Dollars.  All figures quoted in this report are Australian Dollars unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
Production  
 
There was no production for the Company for the half year ending June 2016 (2015: 17,674 barrels of oil and 13,464 
Mcf of natural gas). 
 
 
Exploration Activities  
 
Details of Indago’s exploration activities are specified in the “Projects” section of the half year report.

PROJECTS 
 
As  the  energy  industry  weathers  low  commodity  prices  and  weakened  capital  market  conditions,  Indago  remains 
focused on seeking new investment and acquisition opportunities while maintaining its position in the Newkirk Project.   
 
Capitola Oil Project (37.5% - 100% WI) 
 
The Capitola Project in Texas was sold for US$2.1 million on the 2 March 2016. 
 
The Company suspended the development programme for Capitola in 2015 due to the declining oil prices and overall 
poor production performance of the four wells drilled. As a result of inactivity, the Company’s interest in the project at 
the time of sale had reduced to 37.5% WI in the shallow rights of the undeveloped acreage (25% WI in the deep rights). 
Many of the leases were also due to expire during 2016. Production levels at the date of sale was approximately 100 
BOE/day.  
 
The board concluded that the Capitola asset had limited potential to generate any meaningful value for shareholders 
and as such considered that it was in the best interests of the Group to sell it. The carrying value at the date of sale 
was $US$2.2 million. 
 
Four Rivers Project (8% - 25% WI)
In February 2016, the Four Rivers Project assets were sold with an effective date of 1 January 2016 for US$120,000, 
an amount equal to the carrying value of the asset as at 31 December 2015. 
 
Newkirk Project (100% WI, 81.25% NRI) 
 
Indago holds a 100% WI and 81.25% NRI in 4,049 acres located in Kay County, Oklahoma near Ponca City.  The 
leases were largely acquired during 2015 with a three year primary term and two year bonus term.  The project is 
located within the Mississippi Lime tight oil play, a relatively mature play in which hundreds of wells have been drilled 
in the past decade. At this time and in this low oil price environment, the Operator, Empire Energy Group (ASX:EEG) 
has no short-term plans to drill any wells.  There is always a risk that leases will commence to expire prior to the 
establishment of a commercial play. Indago will therefore consider all options to create value from this asset including 
joint ventures, sale and possibly a modest drilling programme if energy prices improve. 
Oil and gas leases held by Indago are contiguous with an additional 4,936 acres held by EEG.  Under a Joint Operating 
Agreement, the two companies have agreed to the further development of the combined acreage (8,985 acres) on a 
50/50 basis.

JUNE 2016 HALF YEAR REPORT  10
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2015
NOTE 1: BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The half year consolidated financial statements are a general purpose financial report prepared in accordance with 
the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134:  Interim  Financial 
Reporting,  Australian  Accounting  Interpretations  and  other  authoritative  pronouncements  of  the  Australian 
Accounting Standards Board. 
This interim financial report does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial 
report.  Accordingly, it is recommended that this financial report be read in conjunction with the annual financial 
report  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2015  and  any  public  announcements  made  by  Indago  Energy  Limited 
(“Indago”  or  “the  Company”)  and  its  controlled  entities  (“Consolidated  Entity”  or  the  “Group”)  during  the  interim 
reporting period in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.  
The accounting policies have been consistently applied by the entities in the consolidated entity and are consistent 
with those in the annual financial report for the year ended 31 December 2015.  The Group has adopted a number 
of Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that are mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2016.  The adoption of these standards did not have any impact on the current period or any previous 
period and is not likely to affect future periods. 
 
The financial report has been prepared on an accruals basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where 
applicable, by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial 
liabilities. 
 
Consistent with other oil and gas exploration companies, Indago raises capital to fund exploration activities as 
required.  Accordingly, the financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis in the belief that the Group 
will realise its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of business and for at least the amounts stated in 
the financial report.  The ability of the Group to continue as a going concern and meet its debts and commitments 
as they fall due is dependent upon existing cashflows and the Group securing sufficient capital which may be in the 
form of (or some combination of) the following:
-  Entering in to arrangements to farm out or sell existing projects/assets; 
-  Establishing new debt funding; and/or 
-  Extending existing debt funding; and/or 
-  Raising equity from new/existing shareholders
The directors believe that the Group will continue to be successful in securing sufficient capital and accordingly 
have prepared the report on a going concern basis. At this time, the directors are of the opinion that no asset is 
likely to be realised for an amount less than the amount at which it is recorded in the financial report as at 30 June 
2016.  Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the financial report relating to the recoverability and 
classification of the asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary 
should the Group not continue as a going concern. 
 
New Accounting Standards and Interpretations
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June 2016 
reporting period. The Group’s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below. 
 
AASB 9 Financial Instruments (effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018) 
AASB 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. Since December 2013, it also sets out new rules for hedge accounting. The standard is not 
applicable until 1 January 2018 but is available for early adoption.  There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting 
for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting for financial liabilities that are designated at 
fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.  The Group does not have any 
hedging arrangements.
JUNE 2016 HALF YEAR REPORT  11
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2015
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2017) 
The AASB has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue.  This will replace AASB 18 which covers 
contracts for goods and services and AASB 111 which covers construction contracts.  The new standard is based on 
the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer with the notion of 
control replacing the existing notion of risks and rewards.  The group has not yet considered the effect of the new 
rules on its revenue recognition policies.  The Group intends to apply the amendment from 1 January 2017.  
 
AASB 16: Leases (effective 1 January 2019) 
When effective, this Standard will replace the current accounting requirements applicable to leases in AASB 117: 
Leases and related Interpretations. AASB 16 introduces a single lessee accounting model that eliminates the 
requirement for leases to be classified as operating or finance leases. Although the directors anticipate that the 
adoption of AASB 16 will impact the Group's financial statements, it is impracticable at this stage to provide a 
reasonable estimate of such impact. 
 
AASB 2014-10: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Sale or Contribution of Assets between 
an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (effective 1 January 2018)  
This Standard amends AASB 10: Consolidated Financial Statements with regards to a parent losing control over a 
subsidiary that is not a “business” as defined in AASB 3 to an associate or joint venture. 
The transitional provisions require that the Standard should be applied prospectively to sales or contributions of 
subsidiaries to associates or joint ventures occurring on or after 1 January 2018. The directors do not anticipate 
that the adoption of AASB 2014-10 will have an impact on the Group’s financial statements. 
 
AASB 2016-1: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Recognition of Deferrred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses [AASB 112] (effective 1 January 2017) 
This Standard amends AASB 112 Income Taxes to clarify the circumstances in which the recognition of deferred tax 
assets may arise in respect of unrealized losses on debt instruments measured at fair value. The Group does not 
currently have any debt instruments.  
 
AASB 2016-2: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to 
AASB 107 (effective 1 January 2017) 
This Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows to include additional disclosures and reconciliation 
relating to changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes arising from cash flows and non-
cash changes. The group has not yet considered the effect of the new rules.  The Group intends to apply the 
amendment from 1 January 2017.

JUNE 2016 HALF YEAR REPORT 


Independent auditor's review report to the members of Indago
Energy Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Indago Energy Limited (the company),
which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, selected explanatory notes and the directors'
declaration for Indago Energy Limited (the consolidated entity). The consolidated entity comprises the
company and the entities it controlled during that half-year.
Directors' responsibility for the half-year financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We
conducted our review in accordance with Australian Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE
2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to
state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes
us believe that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001
including giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Indago Energy
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the
annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001.
Conclusion
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half-year financial report of Indago Energy Limited is not in accordance with the
Corporations Act 2001 including:
