FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND DISCLAIMER
Competent Person’s Statement – Exploration Results 
The information in this report that relates to Exploration Results is based on information compiled by Mr. Shannan Bamforth who is a 
Member of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr. Bamforth is a permanent  employee of Sandfire Resources and 
has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralization and type  of deposit under consideration and to the activity 
which he is undertaking to qualify as Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Mr Bamforth consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based 
on his information in the form and context in which it appears.  
Competent Person’s Statement – Mineral Resources 
The  information  in  this  report  that  relates  to  Mineral  Resources  is  based  on  information  compiled  by  Mr.  Ekow  Taylor  who  is  a 
Member of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr. Taylor is a permanent employee of Sandfire Resources NL and 
has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type  of deposit under consideration and to the activity 
which he is undertaking to qualify as Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Mr Taylor consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based on 
his information in the form and context in which it appears.  
Competent Person’s Statement – Ore Reserves and Mine Plan 
The information in this report that relates to Ore Reserves and Mine Plan is based on information compiled by Mr Neil Hastings who 
is a Member of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr Hastings is a permanent employee of Sandfire Resources NL 
and has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity 
which he is undertaking to qualify as Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the Australasian Code for Reporting of 
Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Mr Hastings consents to the inclusion in the report of the matters based 
on his information in the form and context in which it appears. 
Exploration and Resource Targets 
Any discussion in relation to the potential quantity and grade of Exploration Targets is only conceptual in nature. While Sandfire is 
confident that it will report additional JORC compliant resources for the DeGrussa Project, there has been insufficient exploration to 
define  mineral  resources  in  addition  to  the  current  JORC  compliant  Mineral  Resource  inventory  and  it  is  uncertain  if  further 
exploration will result in the determination of additional JORC compliant Mineral Resources.  
Forward-Looking Statements 
Certain  statements  made  during  or  in  connection  with  this  statement  contain  or  comprise  certain  forward-looking  statements 
regarding Sandfire’s Mineral Resources and Reserves, exploration operations, project development operations, production rates, life 
of mine, projected cash flow, capital expenditure, operating costs and other economic performance and financial condition as well as 
general  market  outlook.  Although  Sandfire  believes  that  the  expectations  reflected  in  such  forward-looking  statements  are 
reasonable,  such  expectations  are  only  predictions  and  are  subject  to  inherent  risks  and  uncertainties  which  could  cause  actual 
values, results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed, implied or projected in any forward looking 
statements and no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results could differ 
materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic and market 
conditions,  delays  or  changes  in  project  development,  success  of  business  and  operating  initiatives,  changes  in  the  regulatory 
environment  and  other  government  actions,  fluctuations  in  metals  prices  and  exchange  rates  and  business  and  operational  risk 
management.  Except  for  statutory  liability  which  cannot  be  excluded,  each  of  Sandfire,  its  officers,  employees  and  advisors 
expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the material contained in this statement and excludes all 
liability whatsoever (including in negligence) for any loss or damage which may be suffered by any person as a consequence of any 
information in this statement or any error or omission.  Sandfire undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions 
to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today's date or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated 
events other than required by the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules.  Accordingly you should not place undue reliance on any 
forward looking statement. 
JORC Compliance Statement  
A summary of the information used in this release is as follows. 
The  DeGrussa  VHMS  (volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide)  copper-gold  deposit  is  located  900  kilometres  north  of  Perth  and  150 
kilometres north of Meekatharra in the Peak Hill Mineral Field. The system is hosted within a sequence of metasediments and mafic 
intrusions situated in the Bryah Basin that have been metamorphosed and structurally disrupted. 
The  sulphide  mineralisation  consists  of  massive  sulphide  and  semi-massive  sulphide  mineralisation.  Primary  sulphide  minerals 
present are pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and sphalerite, together with magnetite. The sulphide mineralisation is interpreted to be 
derived from volcanic activity. The deposit shares characteristics with numerous VHMS deposits worldwide. 
DeGrussa is located wholly within Mining Lease 52/1046. This tenement is subject to the Yugunga-Nya (WC99/046) and Gingirana 
Claims (WC06/002). A Land Access Agreement was executed with both claimant groups in November 2010. Sandfire is required to 
make royalty payments to the State and affected Native Title Claimants on a periodical basis. 
Drilling of the DeGrussa massive sulphide lens (of which there are four defined lenses of mineralisation) and surrounding area is by 
diamond drill holes of NQ2 diameter core and, to a lesser extent, by Reverse Circulation (RC) face sampling hammer drilling. The 
nominal  drill-hole  spacing  is  less  than  80m  x  40m  in  the  inferred  areas  of  the  Mineral  Resource  and  increases  in  density  as  the 
classification  increases  to  Measured  where  nominal  13m  x  20m  drill  hole  spacing  is  achieved.  Drilling  has  been  by  conventional 
diamond drilling with a small number holes aided by the use of navigational drilling tools. RC drilling was completed with a nominal 
140mm face sampling hammer and split on a cone or riffle splitter. Drill-hole collar locations were surveyed using RTK GPS, and all 
holes were down-hole surveyed using high speed gyroscopic survey tools. 
Sampling of diamond core was based on geological intervals (standard length 0.5 m to 1.3 m). The core was cut into half or quarter 
(NQ2) to give sample weights up to 3 kg. RC samples were 1.0m samples down-hole, with sample weights between 3.5kg and 7kg 
depending on material type. Field quality control procedures involved assay standards, along with blanks and duplicates. These QC 
samples were inserted at an average rate of 1:15. 
The sample preparation of diamond core involved oven drying, coarse crushing of the core sample down to ~10 mm followed by 
pulverisation of the entire sample to a grind size of 90% passing 75 micron. A pulp sub-sample was collected for analysis by either 
four acid digest with an ICP/OES, ICP/MS (multi element) finish or formed into fused beads for XRF determination on base metals 
and a fire assay for Au.

FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND DISCLAIMER
All reported assays have been length weighted. No top-cuts have been applied. A nominal 0.3% Cu lower cut-off is applied. High 
grade intervals internal to broader zones of sulphide mineralisation are reported as included intervals. 
The attitude of the ore bodies at DeGrussa  is variable but there is a dominant southerly dip from ~40 to 90 degrees flat-lying and is 
drilled  to  grid  west  with  drill  holes  inclined  between  -60  and  -90  degrees.  As  such  the  dominant  hole  direction  is  north  and  with 
varying intersection angles all results are clearly defined as either down hole or approximate true width. 
Density  of  the  massive  sulphide  orebody  ranges  from  2.8g/cm3  to  4.9g/cm3,  with  an  average  density  reading  of  3.7g/cm3. 
Geotechnical and structural readings recorded from diamond drilling include recovery, RQD, structure type, dip, dip direction, alpha 
and beta angles, and descriptive information. All data is stored in the tables Oriented Structure, Geotechnical RQD, Core Recovery, 
Interval Structure as appropriate. 
A  suite  of  multi-element  assays  are  completed  on  each  mineralised  sample  and  include  all  economic  and  typical  deleterious 
elements in copper concentrates. This suite includes Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Pb, S, Fe, Sb, Bi, Cd and As.   
Regional drilling has been completed using a combination of RC and AC drilling. A majority of the drilling is preliminary in nature and 
starts with 800m x 100m AC drilling where the geology and geochemistry is revaluated to determine the requirement for follow 400m 
x 100m drilling. If significant anomalism is identified in the AC drilling then follow up RC drilling will be conducted to determine the 
opportunity  for  delineating  potentially  economic  mineralisation.  Whist  the  main  aim  of  the  exploration  at  Doolgunna  is  to  identify 
additional VHMS mineralisation in some areas of regional land holding it is currently the interpreted that there is shear zones located 
on the contact between dolerite and sediments hosting auriferous quartz vein stockworks with some coincident copper. 
AC and RC regional samples are prepared at Ultra Trace in Perth with the original samples being dried at 80° for up to 24 hours and 
weighed, and Boyd crushed to -4mm. Samples are then split to less than 2kg through linear splitter and excess retained. Sample 
splits are weighed at a frequency of 1/20 and entered into the job results file. Pulverising is completed using LM5 mill to 90% passing 
75%µm.    Assaying  is  completed  using  a  Mixed  4  Acid  Digest  (MAD)  0.3g  charge  and  MAD  Hotbox  0.15g  charge  methods  with 
ICPOES or ICPMS. The samples are digested and refluxed with a mixture of acids including Hydrofluoric, Nitric, Hydrochloric and 
Perchloric acids and conducted for multi elements including  Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, As, Fe, S, Sb, Bi, Mo. The MAD Hotbox method is an 
extended  digest  method  that  approaches  a  total  digest  for  many  elements  however  some  refractory  minerals  are  not  completely 
attacked. The elements are then determined by ICPOES or ICPMS finish. Samples are analysed for Au, Pd and Pt by firing a 40g of 
sample with ICP AES/MS finish.

Note: Mining and production statistics are rounded to the nearest 0.1% Cu grade and 0.1 g/t Au grade. Errors may occur due to 
rounding.  
Underground Mining  
Total ore production from the underground mine was 1,593,168 tonnes of ore grading 4.7% Cu. 
Performance  was  in  line  with  the  mine  production  target  of  1.60  million  tonnes  per  annum  (Mtpa)  and  reflects  a 
continued focus on reliable stope design and excavation, as well as mining fleet productivity.  
The increased mine production performance reflects an overall 8% increase in future annualised mine production with 
the same mine personnel and mining fleet.  
During  the  reporting  period,  production  was  sourced  from  all  lenses  at  DeGrussa,  with  the  C5  lens  brought  into 
production during the June 2016 quarter.  
The mine remains in balance between production and back-fill, with total underground development reaching 37km by 
the end of the reporting period.  
The focus of mine development was on the Conductor 4 and 5 declines.  During the period, the Conductor 4 decline 
development  advanced  533m  and  the  Conductor  5  decline  development  advanced  647m,  with  development 
advancing  in  good  ground  conditions.  It  is  expected  that  the  C4  and  C5  declines  will  reach  their  lowest  designed 
position during the September 2016 Quarter with development transitioning to accelerated level development in the 
C4 and C5 lenses. 
Processing  
Key metrics for the DeGrussa Concentrator for the 2016 financial year included:

1,572,682 tonnes milled at an average head feed grade of 4.7% Cu, slightly under the targeted annualised 
rate of approximately 1.60 Mtpa;
  Average copper recovery for the reporting period of 91%; 
  Concentrate production of 278,171 tonnes; and 
  Metal production of 68,202 tonnes of contained copper and 37,612 ounces of gold.
Copper recovery for the reporting  period averaged 91%.  Each mining area  undergoes geo-metallurgical  laboratory 
testing  prior  to  processing,  including  grinding  simulation  and  copper  liberation  testing  to  understand  the  impact  of 
primary  grind  and  the  downstream  circuit  parameters  on  copper  recovery  and  copper  grade.  This  work  is  used  to 
predict copper recovery performance compared with what would be expected from global macro indicators such as 
copper grade and Cu:S ratio and is used to optimise ROM blending and processing tactics. 
Following  the  successful  commissioning  of  the  major  enhancement  projects  completed  during  FY2015,  Sandfire  is 
continuing  to  investigate  opportunities  for  further  improvements  in  copper  recovery.  These  include  examining 
additional flotation capacity, further improvements in grind optimisation and operating tactic optimisation.  
Production Guidance 
FY2017 targeted copper production is expected to be within the range of 65,000 to 68,000 tonnes of contained copper 
metal  with  gold  production  within  the  range  of  35,000  to  40,000  ounces.  Headline  C1  cash  operating  costs  are 
expected to be within the range of US$0.95-1.05/lb.  
Mine production is forecast at 1.55Mt with the processing of 1.63Mt of ore achieved via the pull-down of ROM stocks. 
First and third quarter production will be impacted by planned shuts to re-line the SAG mill and replace the trunnion 
liner.

Sales & Marketing 
Copper Concentrate 
A total of 282,012 tonnes of concentrate was sold for the 2016 financial year containing 68,653 tonnes of copper and 
36,042 ounces of gold. Shipments were completed from both Port Hedland and Geraldton.  
Infrastructure  
DeGrussa Solar Power Project  
During  the  reporting  period,  construction  was  completed  for  a  10.6MW  solar  power  station  at  DeGrussa,  which 
represents the largest integrated off-grid solar and battery storage facility in Australia.  
The new solar power facility achieved full generation capacity in the June quarter, and at the time of finalising this 
report  was  generating  approximately  7MW  of  power,  which  is  in  line  with  seasonal  expectations.  Solar  generating 
output will ramp up during the summer months to achieve the full 10MW functional capacity.  
The $40 million project consists of 34,080 solar PV panels covering a total area of over 20 hectares at a site located 
immediately adjacent to the DeGrussa underground mine and processing plant. The system has been designed with 
the diesel-fired power station continuing to provide base-load power to the DeGrussa mine with sufficient minimum 
load to ensure it can respond quickly to meet the power requirements of the process plant and underground mine.  
The innovative DeGrussa Solar Farm is expected to set a new benchmark for the use of renewable energy at remote 
mine sites in the resource sector, reducing diesel consumption and cutting carbon emissions at DeGrussa by more 
than 12,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.  
The project was funded by a consortium of participants, with Sandfire’s direct cash contribution totalling less than $1 
million. 
Feasibility Studies and Metallurgy 
Monty Copper-Gold Project  
The  Monty  VMS  Copper-Gold  Project  is  located  10km  east  of  the  DeGrussa  Copper  Mine  and  forms  part  of  the 
Springfield  Unincorporated  Joint  Venture.  Sandfire  is  manager  of  the  Joint  Venture,  which  comprises  participating 
interests of Sandfire (70%) and Talisman Mining Limited (ASX: TLM; “Talisman”) (30%). 
A  maiden  JORC  2012  compliant  Indicated  and  Inferred  Resource  of  1.05  million  tonnes  grading  9.4%  copper  and 
1.6g/t gold was completed for the Monty copper-gold deposit in April 2016 (see ASX Announcement – 13 April 2016), 
providing the foundation for a potential new satellite mining operation located 10km east of the DeGrussa Copper-
Gold Project. 
A  high-level  study  was  subsequently  completed  to  identify  the  primary  value  drivers  for  the  Monty  deposit  and 
determine  the  development  pathway  for  the  project.    This  study  identified  no  fatal  flaws  and  investigated  the 
optionality  of  various  project  elements  including  surface  infrastructure  locations,  site  access,  mining  methods  and 
permitting and approval pathways. The study also identified the preferred location of surface infrastructure including 
the box-cut and decline entrance portal. 
During May 2016, Sandfire, as Manager of the Springfield Joint Venture, submitted a Mining Lease Application (MLA) 
to the Department of Mines and Petroleum of Western Australia (DMP) over the Monty Project.   
The  area  of  the  Mining  Lease  Application  is  approximately  16.42km2  and  covers  the  footprint  of  the  known 
mineralisation  of the Monty  VMS deposit  as  well  as the surrounding area  which  will  be required for  a box-cut and 
decline portal and other supporting mine infrastructure and services such as an electrical sub-station to provide power 
to the underground mine, workshops and offices. 
Given  the  proximity  of  Monty  to  the  existing  DeGrussa  Copper  Mine,  it  is  envisaged  that  a  number  of  mining, 
administrative and support services will be provided by the existing mining and infrastructure services and facilities at 
DeGrussa.  
The Mining Lease Application process will be progressed in parallel with consultations and negotiations with relevant 
stakeholders and preparations for future mining activities.

In  addition,  a  Feasibility  Study  on  the  Monty  Project  also  commenced  during  the  reporting  period.  Several  work 
streams are in progress as part of this Feasibility Study, including:
  Metallurgical testwork is now underway with specific focus on comminution and flotation test work; 
  Geotechnical and structural geology studies are well advanced following completion of targeted geotechnical
  Underground  mine  design  has  commenced  following  release  of  the  Mineral  Resource  with  stoping,  ore
diamond drill holes through the Monty ore body;
access and ventilation work underway;
  A preferred box-cut location has been selected with follow-up geotechnical drilling in progress; and 
  A proposed haul road route  between the DeGrussa operations and the  Monty Project is under evaluation
with design work to follow.
In  parallel  with  the  Feasibility  Study  activities,  negotiations  are  continuing  to  progress  formal  agreements  between 
Sandfire and Talisman relating to Monty construction and mining activities, as well as potential ore process routes and 
terms.  
Oxide Copper Feasibility Study 
The Sandfire Oxide Copper Project at DeGrussa has been extensively tested and a Scoping Study undertaken on the 
basis of a traditional sulphuric acid heap leach combined with a solvent extraction circuit with a strong electrolyte fed 
to an electrowinning circuit to produce 99.99-99.999% copper cathode.  
The investigation of Innovat continuous vat leaching technology as an alternative to heap leaching and glycine as a 
potential alternative to a sulphuric acid environment continued throughout the reporting period.  
It  is  expected  that  the  next  step  in  the  development  of  this  vat  leaching/glycine  process  flowsheet  will  be  the 
completion of pilot plant testing to allow confirmation of project economics prior to consideration of a full-scale plant 
with a decision within the next six months. 
Exploration 
Overview 
During the period, Sandfire continued to progress a tightly focused, multi-disciplined exploration campaign to test for 
extensions to the known cluster of VMS deposits at DeGrussa and to unlock the broader potential of the Doolgunna 
region for additional VMS and structurally-hosted copper deposits.  
Key components of the Company’s exploration activity at Doolgunna during the period are listed below.
  Completion and close-out of Resource Definition drilling at the Monty deposit. 
  Completion of a maiden JORC Mineral Resource estimate for the Monty deposit. 
  Completion of the initial geotechnical diamond drilling program at the Monty deposit. 
  Commencement of metallurgical diamond drilling at the Monty deposit. 
  Continuation of aircore drilling with in-fill near Monty and in the Southern Volcanics. 
  Reverse  Circulation  (RC)  drilling  to  systematically  target  the  untested  portion  of  the  interpreted  C5  host
  Completion of a Super-Conducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) EM geophysical programme over
horizon within the Homer area.
the Monty deposit and surrounding area.
  Continued  underground  resource  definition  drilling  of  the  Conductor  5  deposit  to  allow  conversion  of  the
existing Inferred Resource to Indicated and Measured status.
  RC drilling at the Red Bore East prospect targeting areas of low drilling density and geochemical anomalies. 
  RC and diamond drilling at the Thaduna Copper Project with the aim of targeting gaps in drill coverage over
the main orebody between known mineralised intercepts.
DeGrussa Regional Exploration  
Springfield Joint Venture  
During the period Sandfire reached the $15 million farm-in expenditure threshold (project-to-date), which marked the 
end  of  its  sole-funding  stage  at  Springfield  and  commencement  of  the  Joint  Venture  with  Talisman.  The  Talisman 
Projects  comprise  the  Springfield,  Halloween  and  Halloween  West  Projects,  which  abut  Sandfire’s  DeGrussa-
Doolgunna tenements and contain extensions of the lithological sequence which hosts the DeGrussa VMS deposits.  
Exploration expenditure at the Talisman Projects is now jointly funded by Sandfire and Talisman on a 70:30 basis. 
The  unincorporated  Springfield  Joint  Venture  has  been  formed,  with  Sandfire  as  Manager,  in  accordance  with  the 
Farm-In and Joint Venture Agreement entered into on 20 December 2013.

A  total  of  282,012  tonnes  of  concentrate  were  sold  during  the  year,  containing  68,653  tonnes  of  copper  (65,832 
tonnes  payable)  and  36,042  ounces  of  gold  (33,302  ounces  payable).    Copper  represents  approximately  88%  of 
revenue derived from the DeGrussa Mine at current metals prices.  A total of 27 shipments were completed from Port 
Headland and Geraldton during the year. 
The base metals market commonly works on Quotational Periods (QP) for the final pricing of metal content shipped to 
smelters  for  treatment  and  refining.  The  QP  often  reflects  the  average  time  to  elapse  (generally  2  to  4  months) 
between the date of shipment and the date of processing by the smelter at final destination.  Changes in fair value 
over the QP and up until final settlement are estimated by reference to forward market prices and are recognised as 
part of unrealised price adjustment gains and losses in the income statement.  Gains and losses that occur on final 
settlement are recognised as part of sales revenue for metal content and as part of realised price adjustment gains 
and losses for price.

Operating costs are predominantly driven by the physical quantity of ore moved in mining and processing operations, 
irrespective of  variations in the copper content of that ore.  Mine operations costs,  which include costs incurred in 
underground mining and plant operations on site, have increased marginally in dollar terms however have reduced in 
unit terms with an overall increase in mine and plant throughput to 1.6mtpa.   
The Group has provided cost guidance for the 2017 Financial Year in the range US$0.95-1.05 per pound of payable 
copper production (after gold and silver credits).   
Royalties 
Royalties  are  levied  at  5.0%  for  copper  sold  as  concentrate  and  2.5%  for  gold,  plus  native  title  payments.    As 
DeGrussa’s production value is heavily weighted towards copper production, the combined royalty rate approximates 
the 5% level (net of allowable deductions). 
Exploration and evaluation 
Significant exploration and evaluation activities continued in and around the DeGrussa Copper Mine with the objective 
of discovering further ore bodies and lenses to establish a copper-gold VMS camp.  For the year ended 30 June 2016 
the Group’s Exploration and Evaluation segment contributed a loss before net financing expense and income tax of 
$33.2  million  (2015:  $35.8  million).    In  accordance  with  the  Group’s  accounting  policy,  exploration  and  evaluation 
expenditure is expensed as incurred. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises expenditure on the Group’s projects, including:
  Near-mine  and  Doolgunna  regional  exploration,  which  include  a  number  of  joint  venture  earn-in
arrangements, most significantly the Springfield Joint Venture with Talisman Mining Ltd;

Cash balance 
Group cash on hand was $66.2 million as at 30 June 2016 (the Company $62.4 million), which included $6.3 million 
held in  a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).  With the early repayment of the Amortising Facility on  30 June 
2016 (see below), the balance of the DSRA was reduced to $0.6 million subsequent to year end.  The balance of the 
DSRA now represents the September 2016 quarter projected interest payment. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables include remaining funds from the sale of concentrate subject to provisional pricing and 
quotational periods at the time of sale. 
Inventories 
Finished goods inventories (plant concentrate) have decreased by $4.9 million since 30 June 2015 due to completion 
of three sales in June 2016.  
Exploration and evaluation assets 
Exploration and evaluation assets have increased by $13.3 million since 30 June 2015 due to the acquisition of the 
Temora  and  Currumburrama  Exploration  Projects  from  Aeris  Resources  Ltd  ($2.5  million)  and  the  consolidation  of 
Tintina Resources Inc exploration and evaluation assets ($10.7 million).  
Mine properties 
Further  investment  of  $69.1  million  has  been  made  in  underground  mine  development  to  establish  decline  and 
development access to the sulphide ore bodies ahead of stoping activities. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment at cost has increased by $17.7 million to $333.6 million at the end of the year. 
Investments – WCB Resources Ltd (“WCB”; TSX-V: WCB) 
The Group accounts for its investment in WCB Resources Ltd using the equity method of accounting.  For the year, 
the Group recognised $0.4 million (2015: $1.7 million) in equity accounted losses after income tax. 
Investments – Tintina Resources Inc (“Tintina”; TSX-V: TAU) 
On  18  November  2015,  the  Group  increased  its  stake  in  North  American  copper  development  company  Tintina 
Resources  Inc  to  57%  from  36%,  by  acquiring  a  further  21%  interest.    The  additional  shareholding,  comprising 
47,244,095 shares, was acquired by Sandfire in an off-market transaction at an average price of C$0.0831 per share, 
for total consideration of C$3,926,000 ($4,160,000).  
The Group obtained control of Tintina on 18 November 2015 and the Group has applied the acquisition method of 
accounting  (see  note  6).    The  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses  of  Tintina  are  included  in  the  consolidated 
financial statements as at and for the period ended 30 June 2016, from the date the Group gained control, being 18 
November 2015.   
Tintina contributed $3.8 million (2015: $nil) in losses to the Group’s result for the period 18 November 2015 to 30 
June 2016.  $2.1 million (2015: $nil) of these losses are  attributable to the members of the parent entity.  Prior to 
gaining  control,  the  Group’s  investment  in  Tintina  was  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.    The 
Group recognised $1.1 million (2015: $2.9 million) in equity accounted losses after income tax for the period 1 July 
2015 to 17 November 2015. 
Refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details. 
Current and deferred tax liabilities 
Taxable profit on operations during the year has exceeded the carried forward balance of tax losses and tax credits 
resulting in the Group booking a current income tax liability  of $7.2 million at year end.  In addition the Group has 
booked a net deferred tax liability position of $53.8 million at balance date which predominantly relates to the differing 
tax depreciation and amortisation rates of mining assets and equipment compared to accounting rates. 
Interest bearing liabilities – finance facilities 
The Group’s financing arrangements are provided under a secured loan facility with ANZ and are secured by a fixed 
and floating charge over the Group’s assets, including the DeGrussa Project and the broader Doolgunna Project, and 
a mining mortgage over the Project tenements.   
During the year, the Company fully repaid its Amortising Facility with its financier, ANZ Banking Corporation (ANZ), 
ahead  of  schedule,  following  a  $20.0  million  payment  on  30  June  2016.    The  Amortising  Facility  was  previously 
scheduled to be repaid over the period ending 31 December 2017.

This repayment reduced the Company’s total outstanding debt to $50 million as at 30 June 2016 (under its Revolver 
Facility). With $62.4 million in company cash and deposit holdings (Group $66.2 million), Sandfire was in a net cash 
positive position at financial year-end. This is a significant milestone for Sandfire which sees the Company net debt-
free for the first time since development of the DeGrussa Copper-Gold Project commenced in 2011.  
The Company has now repaid a total of $330 million against the original $380 million project finance facility drawn to 
fund the construction and development of the DeGrussa Mine.  
The $85 million Revolver Facility (currently drawn to $50 million) can be paid down or redrawn as required, subject to 
facility terms, and is repayable in full by 31 December 2017. The Company also retains a $25 million working capital 
facility  with  ANZ,  currently  undrawn,  which  can  be  drawn  down  against  the  value  of  saleable  copper  concentrate 
inventories held by the Company at the mine and ports. 
Cash Flows 
Operating activities 
Net cash inflow from operating activities was $133.9 million for the year.  Net cash flow from operating activities prior 
to exploration and evaluation activities was $166.5 million for the year. 
Investing activities 
Net cash outflow from investing activities was $80.9 million for the period.  This included payments for property, plant 
and equipment purchases ($15.3 million); payments for mine development ($69.6 million); and net cash inflow from 
the Group’s investment into Tintina Resources Inc ($3.7 million). 
Financing activities 
Net cash outflow from financing activities of $93.7 million for the period includes finance facility repayments ($70.0 
million); payment of interest and other costs of finance ($3.4 million); and dividend payments ($19.1 million).   
5.3 
The Group’s operational and financial performance is subject to a range of assumptions and expectations all of which 
contain  varying  levels  of  risk.  The  Board  has  oversight  responsibility  and  determines  overall  risk  appetite  for  the 
Group.  The Group manage these risks through the requirements of its Risk Management System and accompanying 
policies, procedures, and standards.  
In  addition  to  the  discussion  contained  above  on  the  Group’s  operational  and  financial  reviews,  performance  and 
associated risks, the following risks have been identified as at the date of the Directors’ Report which may affect the 
Group’s future operational and financial performance. 
Business and operational 
DeGrussa  is  the  Group’s  sole  operating  mine  and  profitable  operating  segment.  DeGrussa  derives  approximately 
88% of its revenue from the sale of copper contained within its concentrate, with the remainder derived from gold and 
silver.   
The  DeGrussa  operation  consists  of  an  underground  mine  (operating  from  a  single  portal  and  primary  decline), 
processing  plant,  paste  plant,  village  accommodation  and  infrastructure  facilities.  Concentrate  is  transported  to 
Geraldton  and  Port  Hedland  via  road  and  shipped  to  international  trader  and  smelter  customers.  The  Group’s 
operational and financial performance is heavily reliant on the successful integrated operation of its various business 
elements.   
Production  and  capital  costs  affect  financial  performance  and  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  factors  including,  but  not 
limited  to,  variability  in  input  costs  and  consumables,  changes  in  economic  conditions  and  changes  in  operating 
strategy.   
As is common in the mining and exploration industry, many of the Group’s activities are conducted using contractors. 
The  Group’s  operational  and  financial  results  are  impacted  by  the  performance  of  contractors,  their  efficiency  and 
costs  and  associated  risks.    The  Group  actively  manages  its  contractors  to  the  extent  possible  working  within  its 
agreements with them. 
The DeGrussa underground mine is subject to geotechnical and  water ingress risk  which, if left unmitigated, could 
result  in  a  mine  collapse,  cave-ins  or  other  failures  to  mine  infrastructure  and  significantly  reduced  operational 
performance and increased costs. 
The Group mitigates these risks by employing appropriately qualified technical personnel and experienced managers 
that  utilise  formalised  operating  practises,  processes  and  procedures,  by  undertaking  continual  monitoring  of  the 
underground  environment  to  identify  change  that  may  require  action,  by  engaging  specialist  consultants  when 
technical issues are identified outside available internal skills and experience, and by conducting audits completed by 
external consultants on a regular basis to identify gaps and manage compliance.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Principal activities, operating and financial review (continued) 
Risks (continued)
5 
5.3 
Health, Safety and Environment 
Mining operations involve safety risk, including but not limited to areas such as explosives, underground operations 
including the risk of rock fall, work involving confined spaces, areas where heavy and light vehicles interact, manual 
handling, operating at height and emergency caused by severe weather events. The occurrence of significant safety 
incidents  could  result  in  regulatory  investigations  or  restrictions  which  may  impact  operating  performance  and 
negatively  impact  morale.  The  Group  manage  these  risks  through  the  requirements  of  its  Health  and  Safety 
Management System and accompanying policies, procedures, and standards. Company personnel are trained in the 
assessment of risks and hazards and the operating procedures required to operate safely.  Operating in a fly in fly out 
operation also introduces the risk that is inherent in air travel, as contractors and employees are required to regularly 
commute by aircraft. 
The Group operates under a range of environmental regulation and guidelines. Environmental regulations and health 
guidelines for certain products and by-products produced or to be produced are generally becoming more onerous. 
Increased  environmental  regulation  of  the  Group’s  products  and  activities  or  any  changes  to  the  environmental 
regulations could have an adverse effect on the Group’s financial performance and position. 
The Group is required to close its operations and rehabilitate the land affected by the operation at the conclusion of 
mining and processing activities. Actual closure costs in the future may be higher than currently estimated.  
The  Group  works  closely  with  local  communities  affected  by  its  mining  and  exploration  activities,  and  has 
compensation agreements in place with indigenous communities affected by its activities. The Group also manages 
and relies on maintenance of good title over the authorisations, permits and licences which allow it to operate.  Loss 
of  good  title  or  access  due  to  challenges  instituted  by  issuers  of  authorisations,  permits  or  licences,  such  as 
government authorities or land owners may result in disruptions to operating performance. 
Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and Mine Plan 
The  estimation  of  the  Group’s  Mineral  Resource  and  Ore  Reserve  involves  analysis  of  drilling  results,  associated 
geological and geotechnical interpretations, metallurgical performance evaluation, mining assessment, operating cost 
and  business  assumptions  as  well  as  a  reliance  on  commodity  price  assumptions.  As  a  result,  the  assessment  of 
Mineral  Resource  and  Ore  Reserve  involve  areas  of  significant  estimation  and  judgement.  The  ultimate  level  of 
recovery of minerals and commercial viability of deposits cannot be guaranteed. 
The  Group’s  Mine  Plan  is  based  on  the  Mineral  Resource  at  DeGrussa  and  changes  to  it  caused  by  changes  in 
underlying assumptions may impact on the future financial and operational performance of the Group.  DeGrussa’s 
mine life has been successfully extended since original discovery through expenditure on exploration and evaluation 
activities.  The current Mine Life extends to early-2021, representing the mining of currently identified mineralisation. 
Financial 
The marketability of the concentrates is dependent on mine supply, smelter demand and quality of the product.   
The prices received are dictated by global commodity and currency markets. Commodity prices and exchange rates 
have a direct and material impact on the Group’s financial performance. The Group may from time to time seek to 
hedge risk in commodity and foreign currency risk on its US dollar dominated sales.  The Group did not enter into 
hedge transactions during the current financial year.  The Group selectively utilises letters of credit to mitigate risk of 
receipt of sales funds and receives provisional payments prior to shipments arriving at their destination port.   
The majority of the Group’s costs are incurred in Australian dollars, funded through the conversion of US dollar sales 
proceeds to Australian dollars on receipt from customers. 
The Group funded the majority of the construction and development of the DeGrussa mine through a fully secured 
debt finance facility.  While the current debt levels are considered appropriate for the targeted operating and financial 
performance  of  the  DeGrussa  operations  over  the  Mine  Plan,  financial  risk  remains  in  the  areas  of  quarterly 
compliance measures, repayment obligations and working capital management. 
The Group’s inability to manage these risks could lead to facility review or default events, and ultimately demand for 
payment  of  facility  balances.    The  total  outstanding  debt  for  the  Company  was  reduced  to  $50  million  (Revolver 
Facility) as at 30 June 2016, with $62.3 million in Company cash and deposit holdings (Group: $66.2 million), Sandfire 
was in a net cash positive position at financial year-end. 
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, 
under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation.  The Group manages liquidity risk by conducting regular reviews and updates of the timing of cash flows in 
order to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet its obligations and debt covenants.

Director Independence 
The Board consists of a majority of independent directors.  Directors of Sandfire are considered to be independent 
when they are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially 
interfere  with,  or  could  reasonably  be  perceived  to  materially  interfere  with,  the  exercise  of  their  unfettered  and 
independent judgement.  The Board will consider the materiality of any given relationship on a case-by-case basis 
and has adopted guidelines to assist in this regard (refer Section 2.2 of the Board Charter).  The Board, guided by 
the Board Charter, considers thresholds of materiality for the purposes of determining independence in accordance 
with ASX Recommendations, having regard to both quantitative and qualitative principles.  An item is presumed to 
be quantitatively immaterial if it is equal to or less than 5% of the appropriate base amount.  It is presumed to be 
material (unless there is qualitative evidence to the contrary) if it is equal to or greater than 10% of the appropriate 
base amount.  Overriding the quantitative assessment is the qualitative assessment.  Specifically, the Board will 
consider whether there are any factors or considerations which may mean that the Director’s interest, business or 
relationship could, or could be reasonably perceived to, materially interfere with the Director’s ability to act in the 
best interests of the Company.

The roles of Chair and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are not exercised by the same individual.  
Director Selection and Succession Planning 
The  Board  regularly  reviews  its  membership  to  ensure  that  it  has  the  appropriate  mix  of  diversity,  skills  and 
experience required to meet the needs of the Group.  When a Board position becomes vacant or additional directors 
are required, external professional advisors are engaged to assist with identifying potential candidates to ensure that 
a diverse range of candidates are considered. 
Appropriate  background  checks  are  conducted  before  appointing  a  Director.    When  candidates  are  submitted  to 
shareholders for election or re-election, the Company includes in the Notice of Annual General Meeting (AGM) all 
material information relevant to a decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a Director.  Directors receive formal 
letters of engagement setting out the key terms, conditions and expectations of their engagement. 
At the AGM held on 18 November 2015, Mr Derek Le Ferla was re-elected as a Director of the Company.  Ms Maree 
Arnason was appointed a casual Director of the Company on 18 December 2015 and will be standing for re-election 
at the 2016 AGM, along with Mr Robert Scott and Mr Paul Hallam. 
Induction Procedures and Ongoing Professional Development 
Sandfire  has  formal  induction  procedures  for  both  directors  and  senior  executives.    These  induction  procedures 
have been developed to enable new directors and senior executives to gain an understanding of: 
  Sandfire’s financial position, strategies, operations and risk management practices; and 

the respective rights, duties and responsibilities and roles of the Board and senior executives.
Directors are given an induction briefing by the Company Secretary and an induction pack containing information 
about the Group, Board and Committee charters and the entity’s policies.  New directors also meet with key senior 
executives to gain an insight into the Group’s business operations. 
Sandfire supports the continuing professional development of its directors and the Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee undertakes a review of developmental needs not less than annually and a development program for the 
following year is devised and implemented addressing the issues raised from the review.  
Board Committees 
The  Board  has  established  an  Audit  and  Risk  Committee,  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  and 
Sustainability Committee which operate under Charters approved by the Board.  The functions of the Committees 
are set out in their respective Charter. 
The Committee Charters and membership details of each Committee are available on Sandfire’s website.  Details 
of  the  number  of  Board  and  Committee  members  held  during  the  year,  each  Director’s  attendance  at  those 
meetings and the qualifications and experience of each Committee member are set out in the Directors’ Report. 
All the members on the Audit and Risk Committee and Remuneration and Nomination Committee are independent 
non-executive  directors.    All  the  members  on  the  Sustainability  Committee  are  independent  non-executive 
directors, except for the Chair. 
Performance Evaluation and Remuneration 
Evaluation of the Performance of the Board, its Committees and Individual Directors 
The  Board,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee,  regularly  monitors  the 
performance of the Board, its committees and individual directors throughout the year and conducts a review of 
their performance on an annual basis.  This may occur through a process of internal review led by the Chairman, 
or, be performed with the assistance of external advisers as considered appropriate. 
The 2016 financial year review was led by the Chairman by way of a questionnaire, followed up where applicable 
with one-on-one discussions.  The outcomes of the review were discussed and considered by all the directors and 
the general conclusion was that the Board, individual directors and Board Committees were functioning well.  The 
Board agreed on initiatives to improve its operation and performance.

Evaluation of Senior Executives Performance 
Each  Director  of  the  Company  has  entered  into  a  formal  letter  of  appointment  which  clearly  sets  out  what  is 
expected  of  each  Director.    Senior  executives  have  service  agreements  containing  detailed  duties  and 
responsibilities which are complimented by key performance indicators.  The performance of the key executives is 
reviewed regularly against both measurable and qualitative indicators. 
During the reporting period, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee conducted performance evaluations that 
involve  an  assessment  of  each  senior  executive’s  performance  against  specific  and  measurable  qualitative  and 
quantitative performance criteria.  The performance criteria against which executives are assessed are aligned with 
the financial and non-financial objectives of the Company.  Details of how Sandfire assesses the performance of the 
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer and the executive management team are set out in the Remuneration 
Report included in the Directors’ Report. 
Remuneration Practices 
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee’s remuneration strategy is designed to attract, motivate and retain 
employees, contractors and non-executive directors by identifying and rewarding high performers and recognising 
the contribution of each employee to the continued growth and success of the Company.  For further details please 
see the Remuneration Report included in the Directors’ Report. 
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors 
The  Company  clearly  distinguishes  the  structure  of  non-executive  directors’  remuneration  from that  of  executive 
directors and senior executives.  The 2016 Remuneration Report provides a separate table outlining the structure 
of  Executive  statutory  remuneration  disclosures  and  Non-Executive  Director  fees.    Non-Executive  Director  fees 
consist  of  Director  fees  and  committee  fees.    Non-executive  directors  do  not  receive  retirement  or  termination 
benefits  and  do  not  participate  in  any  incentive  plans.  The  aggregate amount  of fees  that may  be  paid  to  non-
executive directors in any one year is capped at a level approved by shareholders.   
Risk Framework 
Management of Risks 
The Board is committed to reviewing and overseeing the risk management strategy for Sandfire and for ensuring 
the Company has an appropriate corporate governance structure, in order to support the achievement of business 
objectives. 
The identification and effective management of risk, including measured risk-taking is viewed as an essential part 
of the Company’s approach to creating long-term shareholder value. 
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews and reports to the Board that:
 
 

the Company’s ongoing risk management program effectively identifies all areas of potential risk; 
adequate mitigation activities are designed and implemented to manage risks; and 
there are regular reviews on the process of the implementation of designed risk mitigation activities.
The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in monitoring the Company’s economic, environmental and social 
sustainability risks, and the processes and controls underlying the identification and monitoring or risks. 
Sandfire’s  Risk  Management  Policy  outlines  the  Company’s  approach  to  managing  risks  and  is  available  in  the 
Governance section of Sandfire’s website. 
Management through the CEO is responsible for the day to day design and implementation of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control system.  Management reports to the Board on the Company’s key risks and the 
extent to which it believes these risks are being adequately managed. 
The  Company’s  risk  framework  is  applied to  all  risk  aspects  of the  Company’s  business  and  is  used  to  identify, 
assess, evaluate, treat, monitor and communicate risks using a common methodology.  The framework is aligned 
with ISO Standard 31000:2009.  Risk are ranked using both pre mitigating controls and post mitigating controls and 
the rankings reflect the different types of likelihoods and consequences that may arise from risks, including metrics 
for safety and health, environmental, legal and regulatory, reputation/community and social, property damage and 
process  loss  and  financial.    The  Board  ratifies  the  Company’s  approach  to  managing  risk  and  oversees  the 
Company’  Risk  Management  System,  including  the  Company’  risk  profile  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  systems 
being implemented to manage risk.  The Risk Management System, including the Company’ risk profile and the 
effectiveness of the systems in place to manage risk, were reviewed in 2016.   
The Company is exposed to numerous risks, most of which are common within the mining industry.  The business 
and operational risks; health, safety and environment risks; Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and Mine Plan risks; 
and  financial  risks  are  outlined  in  section  5.3  of  the  Director’s  Report.    Material  exposure  to  economic, 
environmental and social sustainability risk and how the Company manages those risks, are also disclosed in the 
Sustainability Report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)

Internal Control Framework 
The key controls that the Company has in place to ensure that its risks are managed effectively and to protect the 
Company’s interests and to ensure the integrity of its financial reporting include the following:
  Board  approval  of  strategic  planning,  which  encompasses  the  Company’s  vision,  mission  and  strategy


statements, designed to meet stakeholders’ needs and manage business risk; 
implementation of Board approved operating plans and budgets and Board monitoring of progress against 
these budgets, including the establishment and monitoring of financial and non-financial KPIs; and 
underpinning these efforts is a comprehensive set of policies and procedures directed towards achieving: 
 
 

an effective and efficient use of the Company’s resources; 
compliance with laws and regulations; and  
preparation of reliable published information.
Internal Audit Function 
Sandfire  has  an  internal  audit  function  that  assists  the  Board  by  undertaking  an  objective  evaluation  of  the 
Company’s internal control framework, focusing on Sandfire’s key risks.  The internal auditor attends the Audit and 
Risk Committee meetings to present internal audit findings and has the opportunity to meet privately with the Audit 
and Risk Committee on a regular basis to ensure a degree of independence and objectivity to the role.  The Audit 
and Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing the internal audit function. 
The  Company’s  internal  audit  function  objectively  evaluates  and  reports  on  the  existence,  design  and  operating 
effectiveness  of  internal  controls.    The  internal  auditor  is  independent  of  the  external  auditor  and  reports  to  the 
Audit and Risk Committee. 
The Board agrees that due to its nature, internal control assurance from the internal auditor can only be reasonable 
rather than absolute.  This is due to such factors as the need for judgement, the use of testing on a sample basis, 
the inherent limitations in internal control and because much of the evidence available is persuasive rather than 
conclusive and therefore is not and cannot be designed to detect all weaknesses in control procedures. 
External Auditor 
Under the Committee Charter it is the policy of Sandfire that its external auditing firm must be independent of it.  
The Committee reviews and assesses the independence of the external auditor on an annual basis.  The Charter 
contains an External Audit Policy, which provides information on procedures for the selection and appointment of 
the external auditor, and for the rotation of external audit engagement partners, presently every 5  years, unless 
otherwise approved by the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Sandfire.   
The Company's external auditor will attend the AGM and be available to answer shareholder questions about the 
conduct  of  the  audit  and  the  preparation  and  content  of  the  auditor's  report.    The  external  auditor  will  also  be 
allowed  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  answer  written  questions  submitted  by  shareholders  to  the  auditor  as 
permitted under the Corporations Act (“the Act”). 
CEO and CFO Certification  
In  accordance  with  section  295A  of  the  Act,  the  CEO  and  CFO  have  provided  written  statements  to  the  Board  in 
respect of each half and full year financial period that, in their opinion, the financial records of the Group have been 
properly  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  Act;  the  financial  statements  and  the  notes  for  the  period  comply  with 
accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the entity and their 
opinion has been formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating 
effectively. 
Governance Policies 
The  Group  has  developed  a  number  of  codes  and  policies  to  help  directors  and  employees  understand  what  is 
expected  of  them.    Below  is  a  summary  of  the  Sandfire’s  core  codes  and  policies  which  apply  to  directors  and 
employees.  Each of these policies below are available on the Sandfire’s website. 
Code of Conduct 
The  Board  recognises  the  need  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  corporate  practice  and  business  conduct.  
Accordingly,  the  Board  has  established  a  Code  of  Conduct  which  applies  to  directors,  employees,  temporary 
employees and contractors of Sandfire.  They key principles underpinning the Code of Conduct are:
 
 

our actions must be governed by the highest standards of integrity and fairness; 
our decisions must be made in accordance with the spirit and letter of applicable law; and 
our business must be conducted honestly and ethically,  with our best skills and judgement, and for the 
benefit of our people, clients, shareholders, stakeholders and Sandfire alike.
- 24 -
FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
14 
The objective of the Code of Conduct is to:
provide a benchmark for professional behaviour throughout Sandfire; 
support Sandfire’s business reputation and corporate image within the community; and
 
 
  make employees aware of the consequences if they breach the Code.
Values 
The Company has also implemented a set of Core Values designed to guide the directors and all employees in 
their day-to-day dealings with each other, competitors, customers and the community.
Whistleblower Protection Policy 
The Board has endorsed a Whistleblower Protection Policy which has a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year 
round independent hotline.  A whistleblower is someone who discloses reportable conduct to people that have the 
power to take corrective action.  Sandfire recognises that a genuine commitment to detecting and preventing illegal 
and other undesirable conduct must include a mechanism whereby personnel can report their concerns freely and 
be protected from reprisals. 
Policy for Dealing in Securities 
The Board has endorsed a Policy for Dealing in Securities Policy which:


explains the types of conduct in dealing in securities that are prohibited under the Corporations Act 2001 
(Clth) (Corporation Act); and 
establish a best practice procedure for the dealing in securities that protects the Company, directors and 
personnel against misuse of unpublished information which could materially affect the value of securities. 
The rules set out in this policy are designed to assist in preventing breaches of the insider trading provisions of the 
Corporations Act and to enable the Company to satisfy the disclosure requirements of the ASX Listing Rules.  The 
policy also establishes “blackout periods” during which directors, employees, contractors and their closely related 
parties must not trade in the Company’s securities.  It also prevents directors and executives from entering into any 
hedging arrangements over unvested securities issued pursuant to an equity based remuneration scheme.  
Disclosure and Communication Policy 
The  Board  has  endorsed  a  Disclosure  and  Communication  Policy,  which  sets  out  processes  which  assist  the 
Company to ensure that all investors have equal and timely access to material information about the Company and 
that Company announcements are factual and presented in a clear and balanced way.
- 25 -
FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
14 
The Disclosure and Communication Policy also sets out the procedures for identifying and disclosing material and 
market-sensitive information in accordance with the Corporations Act and the ASX Listing Rules. 
Diversity Policy 
Sandfire is committed to providing a diverse and inclusive work environment in which everyone is treated fairly and 
with respect.  Sandfire is committed to recruiting, training and promoting individuals based on competence and to 
attracting  the  best  people  in  their  fields,  regardless  of  their  gender,  religion,  race,  ethnicity,  language,  cultural 
background, sexual orientation, disability and age. 
The Board believes that the promotion of diversity within the organisation generally:
 
 
 

broadens the pool for recruitment of high quality employees; 
is likely to support employee retention; 
is likely to encourage greater innovation, enhances work practices and productivity; and 
is socially and economically responsible governance practice.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has developed, and the Board has approved, the Company’s Diversity 
Policy.    This  policy  applies  to  directors  and  all  employees  of  Sandfire.    In  summary,  the  Diversity  Policy  provides 
guidelines in relation to Sandfire’s commitment to diversity, the establishment of measurable objectives for achieving 
gender  diversity  and  the  progress  made  towards  achieving  the  objectives  set  and  the  responsibilities  of  the 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee to consider the Diversity Policy. 
The proportion of women employed by the Company as at 30 June 2016 and as at 30 June 2015 is listed below:

the  industry  average  by  approximately  7%  (2015:  7%).    The  Company  acknowledges  that  improving  female 
representation needs to occur at all levels within the Company.  On 18 December 2015 Sandfire appointed Ms Maree 
Arnason as its first female board member. 
The Sandfire’s website contains Sandfire’s Public Report Form submitted to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency 
for  2015-16  and  2014-15,  which  details  amongst  other  items,  the  proportion  of  females  employed  by  manager 
occupational categories and non-manager occupational categories.  
Sandfire offers equal remuneration for all of our employees, reflective of the type of job, years of experience and the 
period  for  which  employees  have  held  their  position.  Sandfire  plans  to  conduct  its  second  gender  pay  audit  by 
December 2016. 
Additional information on diversity can be found in Sandfire’s Sustainability Report.

FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee 
Dear shareholders 
On behalf of the directors of Sandfire Resources NL, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 30 June 2016.   
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  have  continued  to  focus  on  ensuring  remuneration  at  Sandfire  is 
designed to maintain alignment with shareholder interest (both short-term and long-term), that remuneration remains 
appropriate and that it is clearly communicated to shareholders.   
The Board regularly reviews the Company’s executive remuneration structure and in the past two years has simplified 
the long-term incentive plan structure.  The Company has progressed from a share price based option and rights plan 
to a single performance rights plan that aligns executive rewards with the creation of shareholder value.  The vesting 
period  for  the  awards  has  been  set  to  3  years,  with  an  initial  2  year  vesting  period  for  50%  of  the  rights  awarded 
during  the  2015FY  as  a  transitional  arrangement.  The  revised  plan  was  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  Annual 
General Meeting held on 18 November 2015. 
Aside  from  the  simplification  to  our  long-term  incentive  plan  structure,  remuneration  for  directors  and  executives 
remains  largely  unchanged  from  the  previous  year.    Executive  remuneration  is  delivered  as  a  mix  between  fixed 
remuneration  (including  base  salary  and  superannuation)  and  variable  at-risk  remuneration,  including  performance 
based awards, comprising a short-term incentive (STI Plan) and long-term incentive (LTI Plan). 
Key Highlights for Remuneration in FY16 
Safety 
The  safety  of  our  people  is  always  our  primary  concern  and  is  a  key  measure  of  performance  for  everyone  at 
Sandfire.  This is reflected by the inclusion of safety related key performance indicators (KPIs) in our STI Plan and the 
reduction of our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) by 25%, which was a very pleasing result. 
Fixed Remuneration 
When  considering  the  context  of  the  wider  mining  sector  and  the  comparative  position  of  salaries  at  Sandfire,  the 
Committee recommended not to award salary increases across the business in FY16.   
STI Plan 
Executives  received  an  average  of  73%  of  their  STI  Plan  target  for  performance  against  a  mix  of  financial,  non-
financial, Company and individual KPIs.   
The maximum opportunity of the quarterly assessed component of the STI Plan was reduced to 10% from 20% of 
total fixed remuneration (TFR).  For executives, this reduced the maximum short-term incentive opportunity from 50% 
to 40% of TFR. 
LTI Plan 
The annual award of rights was issued to executives other than the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer on 
30  June  2016.    Rights  will  be  granted  to  the  CEO,  subject  to  shareholder  approval  at  the  Company’s  AGM,  in 
November 2016.   
Non-Executive Director (NED) Fees 
Board and Committee fee levels for NEDs, including the Chairman, which are reviewed annually, did not increase in 
FY16.  The fees have not increased since 1 December 2013.  
The Board is confident that Sandfire’s remuneration policies continue to support the Group’s financial and strategic 
goals.  We are committed to transparency and an ongoing dialogue with shareholders on remuneration and with this 
in mind we have further improved the remuneration report to enhance the overall format and flow of information.  
On behalf of the Board, I invite you to review the full report and thank you for your ongoing support of Sandfire. 
Yours sincerely 
Paul Hallam

The directors present the Remuneration Report for the Company and the Group for the year ended 30 June 2016.  
The  Remuneration  Report  forms  part  of  the  Directors’  Report  and  outlines  the  remuneration  arrangements  of  the 
Company and the Group in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and its 
regulations.  This information has been audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Act. 
The Remuneration Report details the remuneration arrangements for Sandfire’s key management personnel (KMP), 
and  consist  of  the  non-executive  directors  (NEDs)  and  the  executive  KMP  (collectively  the  executives).    KMP  are 
those persons who, directly or indirectly, have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the 
major activities of the Company and Group. 
The table below outlines the KMP of the Group during FY2016:

Sandfire’s  Board  is  committed  to  delivering  remuneration  strategy  outcomes  that  further  our  key  business  drivers, 
reflect our business performance and sustainability, and attracts and retains the highest quality executive KMP. The 
remuneration strategy identifies and rewards high performers and recognises the contribution of each employee to the 
continued growth and success of the Group.

Remuneration mix 
The mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration varies depending on the role and grading of the executives.  More senior 
positions  have  a  greater  proportion  of  at  risk  remuneration.    If  maximum  at  risk  remuneration  is  earned,  the 
percentage of fixed to at-risk remuneration would be as follows:

Remuneration decision making 
The following diagram represents the Group’s remuneration decision making framework:
Further information on the Remuneration and Nomination Committee’s role, responsibilities and membership is set 
out in Sandfire’s Corporate Governance Statement on page 20 and can be seen at www.sandfire.com.au. 
Use of remuneration consultants 
The Committee seeks external remuneration advice when making remuneration decisions.  In carrying out its review 
of  the  remuneration  packages  on  the  Chairman,  NEDs,  and  non-director  KMP  for  the  2016  financial  year,  the 
Committee engaged the services of independent remuneration consultants, Psytec Management Services (Psytec). 
The  Committee  has  established  protocols  to  ensure  that  if  remuneration  recommendations,  as  defined  by  the 
Corporations Act, are made by independent remuneration consultants they are free from bias and undue influence by 
members  of  the  KMP  to  whom  the  recommendations  relate.    The  Committee  directly  engages  the  remuneration 
consultants (without management involvement), and receives all reports directly from the remuneration consultants.  
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from Psytec is free from bias and undue influence.  
During the financial year, Psytec provided market data to the Company (sourced from AON Hewitt’s McDonald Gold 
and General Mining Industry report) in respect of NED fees and executive remuneration levels. This market data was 
industry-specific relating to Australian mining companies. The remuneration recommendations were provided to the 
Committee as input into decision making only.  The fees paid to Psytec for the remuneration recommendations were 
$60,000.  Other services provided by Psytec included other human resources (HR) and strategic planning services.  
The fees for other services were $112,200. 
Remuneration report approval at FY15 Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
The remuneration report for FY15 received positive shareholder support at the FY15 AGM with a vote of 99% in favour.

Elements of executive remuneration
15 
4. 
Fixed remuneration 
Fixed remuneration includes base pay and superannuation contributions and is designed to reward for the scope of 
the executives’ role, skills and qualifications, and individual performance.  Remuneration levels are reviewed on an 
annual basis, which considers market competitiveness as well as Company and individual performance. 
The  Committee’s  policy  is  to  position  fixed  remuneration  between  the  median  and  the  upper  quartile  for  the 
executives,  against  its  defined  market  to  ensure  a  competitive  offering.  The  market  used  by  the  Company  is 
companies in the Australian mining industry, having regard to gross revenue, employee numbers, shareholder equity, 
net income and market capitalisation.  The Committee may find it reasonable to shift the market positioning for the 
executive, based on an assessment of Company and individual performance. 
Variable remuneration – STI Plan 
KPIs cover financial, non-financial, company and individual objectives, chosen as they represent the key drivers for 
the short-term success of the business and provide a framework for delivering long-term value.

The CEO has discretion to reduce the calculated awards in respect of the safety, production and cost KPIs to nil in the event of 
a serious incident or inadequate safety performance.
Target performance: represents the achievement of planned or budgeted performance, set to a challenging level. 
Threshold performance: represents the minimum level of performance required for an STI award to vest.
The quarterly assessed STI is designed to reward executive KMP at three pre-determined levels.    
  Stretch performance: represents outstanding performance. 
 
 
The award is determined by actual performance against the KPI and is assessed quarterly.  No payments are made 
for below threshold performance.  The maximum opportunity of the quarterly assessed component of the STI Plan 
was reduced to 10% from 20% of TFR during the year. 
Annual KPIs (30% of TFR) 
KPIs  are  set  at  the  beginning  of  each  year  and  are  designed  to  drive  successful  and  sustainable  financial  and 
business outcomes, with reference to the Board approved corporate objectives, plans and budget for the year.  The 
Board assesses and sets the KPIs applicable to the Managing Director & CEO, and the Managing Director & CEO 
assesses and sets the KPIs for each of his direct reports in consultation with the Board.  
For  2016,  the  key  areas  of  focus  included  improving  the  Company’s  operational  and  financial  performance, 
sustainability  performance  and  progressing  the  Company’s  growth  objectives.    KPIs  are  set  to  take  into  account 
executive KMP individual performance and their ability to influence the outcome of the Company’s performance.

The annual KPIs have a range of performance levels, from unsatisfactory to superior.  The award is determined by 
actual performance against the KPI.  No payments are made for below threshold or unsatisfactory performance.  The 
Chairman of the Board reviews the Managing Director & CEO’s performance against each of his calendar year KPIs. 
The Managing Director & CEO reviews the performance of each of the executive KMP against their calendar year 
KPIs, and seeks the approval of the Committee in determining STI award outcomes.

Variable remuneration – LTI Plan
Why does the Board 
consider the LTI Plan 
appropriate?
What types of equity 
may be granted under 
this plan?
How often are grants 
made and was a grant 
made in 2016?
The Company believes that the LTI Plan can: 
  Focus and motivate senior executives to achieve outcomes that are aligned to optimising shareholder value; 
  Ensure that business decisions and strategic planning have regard to the Company’s long term performance; 
  Be consistent with contemporary remuneration governance guidelines; 
  Be consistent and competitive with current practices of comparable companies; and 
  Create an immediate ownership mindset among the executive participants, linking a substantial portion of the
potential reward to Sandfire’s ongoing share price and returns to shareholder.
Awards are in the form of performance rights over ordinary shares in the Company for no consideration, or share 
options with an exercise price.
Awards will be made annually. 
Rights were granted to executives other than the Chief Executive Officer on 30 June 2016. Rights will be granted 
to the Chief Executive Officer following shareholder approval at the Company’s AGM in November 2016.  The 
rights carry neither rights to dividends or voting.
What quantum of 
awards and allocation 
methodology is used?
The quantum of rights granted to an executive is determined by the executives TFR; the applicable multiplier; and 
the face value of Sandfire shares, calculated as the 5 day volume weighted average price (VWAP). 
The CEO’s multiplier is 1.0 x TFR; the senior executives’ multiplier is 0.6 x TFR.

Remuneration report (audited) (continued)
What are the 
performance and 
vesting conditions?
The performance conditions are: (a) the executive meeting the service condition; and (b) Sandfire meeting the LTI 
performance condition.  The two conditions are referred to as the vesting conditions. 
Service condition 
The service condition is met if employment with Sandfire is continuous for the period commencing on or around 
the grant date until the end of the performance period (see LTI Performance condition below).  Refer below for 
details if the executive leaves the Company prior to meeting the service condition. 
Performance condition 
The LTI Plan performance condition is the Company’s TSR as measured against a comparator group constituting 
companies  in  the  ASX200  Resources  Index  (ASX:XJR).  The  Board  considers  that  TSR  is  an  appropriate 
performance  hurdle  because  it  ensures  that  a  proportion  of  each  participant’s  remuneration  is  linked  to 
shareholder value.  TSR reflects benefits received by shareholders through share price growth and dividend yield 
and is the most widely used long term incentive hurdle in Australia.  
To  ensure  an  objective  assessment  of  the  relative  TSR  comparison,  the  Company  employs  an  independent 
consultant to calculate the TSR ranking.  
The  performance  rights  will  only  vest  where  the  TSR  performance  of  the  Company  relative  to  the  selected 
comparator group measured over the performance period is at the 51st percentile or above.
TSR ranking versus comparator group

Greater than 75th percentile
Percentage of rights that vest 
Nil 
50% of rights vest 
Between 50% and 100% rights vest 
100% of rights vest
Sandfire’s TSR is to be measured over a three year performance period relative to the comparator group at the 
beginning of the performance period (commencing 1 July). 
Rights granted to participants are tested at the third anniversary of the grant and will vest subject to the relative 
TSR performance condition being met. 
As a transitional arrangement for the rights granted in FY2015 only, the LTI performance period will commence on 
1 July 2015 and rights will be allocated as two equal tranches: 
  50% of the rights will be performance tested against the relative TSR measure for the period 1 July 2015 to 30
June 2017; and
  50% of the rights will be performance tested against the relative TSR measure for the period 1 July 2015 to 30
June 2018.
What happens to 
performance rights 
granted under the plan 
when an executive 
ceases employment?
If the executive’s employment is terminated for cause, or due to resignation, all unvested performance rights will 
lapse, unless the Board determines otherwise.  In all other circumstances, unless the Board decides otherwise, a 
pro-rata  portion  of  the  executive’s  performance  rights,  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  proportion  of  the 
performance  period  that  has  elapsed,  will  remain  on  foot,  subject  to  the  performance  condition  as  set  by  the 
Board.  If and when the performance rights vest, shares will be allocated in accordance with the plan rules and 
any other condition of the grant.
What happens in the 
event of a change in 
control?
In the event of a change in control, the Board will exercise its discretion, and determine the treatment of the 
unvested awards which may include a pro-rata vesting.

The fair value of rights is calculated at the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Simulation model and recognised over the period 
in which the minimum service conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period).  The fair value is not related to or indicative of the 
benefit (if any) that the individual KMP may in fact receive.  Refer to note 26 to the financial report for more details. 
The  vesting  date  is  the  date  on which  the  Board  determines  the  rights  vest,  based  on  the  extent  to  which  the  performance 
conditions are satisfied.  This is anticipated to occur around 1 October of each year, following full year results announcement.  
In accordance with the terms of the LTI Plan and the 2016 grant of rights under the plan, Mr Simich will receive 216,175 rights 
on approval from shareholders at the Company’s AGM in November 2016.
Legacy LTI Plans 
The  Long-term  Indexed  Bonus  Plan  was  created  to  align  executive  director  rewards  with  shareholder  value 
creation,  retain  executive  directors,  and  was  provided  as  a  grant  of  conditional  rights.  Rights  vest  in  three  equal 
tranches and  are all premium priced.  The participant realises value from the  rights if the share price exceeds the 
initial  notional  value  (INV)  on  the  initial  vesting  date  or  a  subsequent  higher  test  price  on  re-testing.    Where  the 
participant realises value at any of the test dates, the holder of the award receives, at the Company’s sole discretion, 
either cash, or subject to any shareholder approval required under the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASX Listing 
Rules, ordinary shares in the Company for the difference between the 5-day volume weighted average ASX price of 
underlying Company shares prior to the vesting/testing date and the INV/test price.  Once vested, the rights are tested 
twice a year on 15 June and 15 December until expiry. 
The Long-term Incentive Option Plan was created to align executive awards with shareholder value and to retain 
executives, and  was provided as a grant  of options  over  ordinary shares to executives.  The options vest in three 
equal  tranches  after  1,  2  and  3  years,  with  an  exercise  price  for  the  three  tranches  set  at  a  20%,  40%  and  60% 
premium to the 5-day volume weighted average share price prior to the date of grant. 
For  rights  and  options  issued  under  the  legacy  LTI  plans,  the  Board  imposed  service  based  vesting  conditions  to 
encourage  retention.    There  was  also  the  challenging  market  performance  hurdle  related  to  share  price  growth 
inherent in the INV and exercise price. 
Outstanding awards under the Legacy LTI plans are as follows: 

The rights previously issued to the CEO under the Long-term Indexed Bonus Plan expire between 15 December 
2016 and 15 December 2018 and the INV/test price ranges from $7.35 to $11.45. 
The options previously issued to the COO, CFO and CCO under the Long-term Incentive Option Plan expire on 
15 July 2018 and the exercise price ranges from $7.60 to $10.00.

The Company’s share price as at 30 June 2016 was $5.23. 
With the introduction of the LTI Plan, no further awards are planned to be made under the Long-term Indexed Bonus 
Plan and Long-term Incentive Option Plan.  Refer to note 26 to the financial statements for more detail.

The  actual  remuneration  earned  by  executives  in  the  2016  financial  year  is  set  out  below.  This  information  is 
considered to be relevant as it provides shareholders with a view of the remuneration actually paid to executives for 
performance  in  the  2016  financial  year  and  the  value  of  LTIs  that  vested  during  the  period.  This  differs  from  the 
remuneration details prepared in accordance with statutory obligations and accounting standards outlined in section 7 
of the Remuneration Report, as those details include the values of performance rights that have been awarded, but

Policy 
Aggregate NED fees are set at a level that provides the Company with the ability to attract and retain directors of the 
highest caliber, whilst incurring a cost that is acceptable to shareholders.  The amount of aggregate fees sought to be 
approved  by  shareholders  and  the  fee  structure  is  reviewed  annually  against  fees  paid  to  NED  of  comparable 
companies.  The Committee considers advice from external advisors when reviewing NED fees.  
Structure 
NED fees consist of director fees and committee fees.  NEDs do not receive retirement or termination benefits and do 
not participate in any incentive plans.  The aggregate amount of fees that may be paid to NEDs in any year is capped 
at a level approved by shareholders. The current maximum aggregate fee pool of $750,000 per annum was approved 
by shareholders at the 2013 annual general meeting.   
The  Board  and  committee  fees  for  the  Company  are  set  out  below  for  all  NEDs.  These  are  inclusive  of 
superannuation.

Summary of significant accounting policies
1 
The consolidated financial statements of Sandfire Resources NL and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the year ended 
30 June 2016 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 29 August 2016. 
Sandfire Resources NL (the Company or the parent) is a for profit company incorporated in Australia whose shares 
are  publicly  traded  on  the  Australian  Stock  Exchange  (ASX).    The  nature  of  the  Group’s  operations  and  principal 
activities are described in the Directors’ report.  Information on the Group’s structure is provided in note 4.  Information 
on other related party relationships of the Group is provided in note 25.

Basis of preparation 
The  financial  report  is  a  general  purpose  financial  report,  which  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements 
of  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board.    The  financial  report  has  been  prepared  on  a  historical  cost  basis, 
except for trade receivables, derivative financial instruments, cash-settled share-based payments and available-for-
sale (AFS) investments which have been measured at fair value. 
The  financial  report  is  presented  in  Australian  dollars  and  all  values  are  rounded  to  the  nearest  thousand  dollars 
($000) unless otherwise stated. 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  provide  comparative  information  in  respect  of  the  previous  period  and  have 
been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which  contemplates  the  continuity  of  normal  business  activities  and  the 
realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.  
(a) 
The financial report complies with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
(b) 
(i) 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding reporting 
period except for the adoption of the new standards and amendments which became mandatory for the first time this 
reporting  period  commencing  1  July  2015.  The  adoption  of  these  standards  and  amendments  did  not  result  in  a 
material adjustment to the amounts or disclosures in the current or prior year. The Group has not early adopted any 
other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but yet effective. 
(ii) 
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective and 
have not been adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2016 are outlined below:

Summary 
AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces AASB 
139. This new version supersedes AASB 9 issued in December 2009 
(as amended) and AASB 9 (issued in December 2010) and includes a 
model for classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking 
‘expected loss’ impairment model and a substantially-reformed 
approach to hedge accounting. 
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. However, the Standard is available for early adoption. The own 
credit changes can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise 
changing the accounting for financial instruments. 
Classification and measurement 
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for classification 
and measurement of financial assets compared with the requirements 
of AASB 139. There are also some changes made in relation to 
financial liabilities. 
The main changes are described below. 
Financial assets 
a.
Financial assets that are debt instruments will be classified 
based on (1) the objective of the entity's business model for 
managing the financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the 
contractual cash flows.

Summary 
b.  Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present 
gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that are 
not held for trading in other comprehensive income. Dividends in 
respect of these investments that are a return on investment can 
be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or 
recycling on disposal of the instrument. 
Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss at initial recognition if doing so eliminates or 
significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency 
that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or 
recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.
c.
Financial liabilities 
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities are 
limited to the measurement of liabilities designated at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.  
Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the change 
in fair value is to be accounted for as follows: 
►
The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in 
other comprehensive income (OCI); and 
The remaining change is presented in profit or loss.
► 
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was caused by 
changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to be measured at fair 
value. This change in accounting means that gains or losses 
attributable to changes in the entity’s own credit risk would be 
recognised in OCI.  These amounts recognised in OCI are not 
recycled to profit or loss if the liability is ever repurchased at a 
discount. 
Impairment 
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss 
impairment model that will require more timely recognition of expected 
credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to 
account for expected credit losses from when financial instruments are 
first recognised and to recognise full lifetime expected losses on a 
more timely basis. 
Hedge accounting 
Amendments to  AASB 9  (December 2009 & 2010 editions and AASB 
2013-9)  issued in December 2013 included the new hedge 
accounting requirements, including changes to hedge effectiveness 
testing, treatment of hedging costs, risk components that can be 
hedged and disclosures. 
Consequential amendments were also made to other standards as a 
result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB 2009-11 and superseded by 
AASB 2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 – Part E. 
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments arising 
from the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014. 
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of AASB 9 
(AASB 9 (December 2009) and AASB 9 (December 2010)) from 1 
February 2015 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on 
after 1 January 2015. 
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 to provide guidance on the 
accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations in which the 
activity constitutes a business. The amendments require:  
(a) the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity 
constitutes a business, as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, 
to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in 
AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards except for those 
principles that conflict with the guidance in AASB 11; and  
(b) the acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and 
other Australian Accounting Standards for business combinations.  
This Standard also makes an editorial correction to AASB 11.

financial report 
The amendments which 
become mandatory for 
the Group’s 30 June 
2017 financial 
statements are not 
expected to have any 
impact on the financial 
statements.
The Group has not 
assessed the impact of 
the amendments, which 
become mandatory for 
the Group’s 30 June 
2019 financial 
statements.
Summary 
AASB 116 and AASB 138 both establish the principle for the basis of 
depreciation and amortisation as being the expected pattern of 
consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset.  
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to 
calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because 
revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset 
generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic 
benefits embodied in the asset. 
The amendment also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to 
be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, 
however, can be rebutted in certain limited circumstances. 
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces the 
existing revenue recognition standards AASB 111 Construction 
Contracts, AASB 118 Revenue and related Interpretations 
(Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, Interpretation 15 
Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 
Transfers of Assets from Customers,  Interpretation  131 Revenue—
Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services and 
Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the 
Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates the 
requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
developed jointly with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB). 
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue arising from 
contracts with customers (except for contracts within the scope of 
other accounting standards such as leases or financial 
instruments).The core principle of AASB 15 is that an entity 
recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or 
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services. An entity recognises revenue in accordance with that core 
principle by applying the following steps. 
(a)   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 
(b)  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
(c)   Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 
(d)  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract.
(e)  Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation.
AASB 2015-8 amended the AASB 15 effective date so it is now 
effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 
January 2018. Early application is permitted.  
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to a 
number Australian Accounting Standards (including Interpretations)

Summary 
AASB 2014-10 amends AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 
and AASB 128 to address an inconsistency between the requirements 
in AASB 10 and those in AASB 128 (August 2011), in dealing with the 
sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or 
joint venture. The amendments require: 
(a)  A full gain or loss to be recognised when a transaction involves a
business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not); and 
(b)  A partial gain or loss to be recognised when a transaction
involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these 
assets are housed in a subsidiary.
Application date and 
impact on the Group’s 
financial report 
The Group has not 
assessed the impact of 
the amendments, which 
become mandatory for 
the Group’s 30 June 
2019 financial 
statements.
AASB 2014-10 also makes an editorial correction to AASB 10. 
AASB 2015-10 defers the mandatory effective date (application date) 
of AASB 2014-10 so that the amendments are required to be applied 
for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
instead of 1 January 2016. 
The subjects of the principal amendments to the Standards are set out 
below: 
AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations:   
  Changes in methods of disposal – where an entity reclassifies an 
asset (or disposal group) directly from being held for distribution 
to being held for sale (or visa versa), an entity shall not follow the 
guidance in paragraphs 27–29 to account for this change.
The Group has not 
assessed the impact of 
the amendments, which 
become mandatory for 
the Group’s 30 June 
2017 financial 
statements.

AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:  

Servicing contracts  - clarifies how an entity should apply the 
guidance in paragraph 42C of AASB 7 to a servicing contract to 
decide whether a servicing contract is ‘continuing involvement’ for 
the purposes of applying the disclosure requirements in 
paragraphs 42E–42H of AASB 7. 
Applicability of the amendments to AASB 7 to condensed interim 
financial statements - clarify that the additional disclosure 
required by the amendments to AASB 7 Disclosure–Offsetting 
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities is not specifically 
required for all interim periods. However, the additional disclosure 
is required to be given in condensed interim financial statements 
that are prepared in accordance with AASB 134 Interim Financial 
Reporting when its inclusion would be required by the 
requirements of AASB 134.
AASB 119 Employee Benefits: 
  Discount rate: regional market issue - clarifies that the high
quality corporate bonds used to estimate the discount rate for 
post-employment benefit obligations should be denominated in 
the same currency as the liability. Further it clarifies that the depth 
of the market for high quality corporate bonds should be 
assessed at the currency level.
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting:  
  Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’
- amends AASB 134 to clarify the meaning of disclosure of 
information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’ and to 
require the inclusion of a cross-reference from the interim 
financial statements to the location of this information.

Summary 
The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of 
Financial Statements arising from the IASB’s Disclosure Initiative 
project. The amendments are designed to further encourage 
companies to apply professional judgment in determining what 
information to disclose in the financial statements.  For example, the 
amendments make clear that materiality applies to the whole of 
financial statements and that the inclusion of immaterial information 
can inhibit the usefulness of financial disclosures.  The amendments 
also clarify that companies should use professional judgment in 
determining where and in what order information is presented in the 
financial disclosures. 
The key features of AASB 16 are as follows: 
Lessee accounting 

Lessees are required to recognise assets and liabilities for all 
leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying 
asset is of low value. 
A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-
financial assets and lease liabilities similarly to other financial 
liabilities.  
Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on 
a present value basis. The measurement includes non-
cancellable lease payments (including inflation-linked payments), 
and also includes payments to be made in optional periods if the 
lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the 
lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. 
AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for lessees.



 
Lessor accounting 

AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting 
requirements in AASB 117. Accordingly, a lessor continues to 
classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to 
account for those two types of leases differently. 
AASB 16 also requires enhanced disclosures to be provided by 
lessors that will improve information disclosed about a lessor’s 
risk exposure, particularly to residual value risk.
AASB 16 supersedes: 
a)  AASB 117 Leases; 
b)
Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a 
Lease;
c)  SIC-15 Operating Leases—Incentives; and 
d)  SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the
Legal Form of a Lease.
The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, provided the new 
revenue standard, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
has been applied, or is applied at the same date as AASB 16.
Basis of consolidation
(c) 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise  the  financial  statements  of  Sandfire  Resources  NL  and  its 
subsidiaries (as outlined in note 4).  Interests in associates are equity accounted (see accounting policy note 2(e)).  
Control  is  achieved  when  the  Group  is  exposed,  or  has  rights,  to  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  with  the 
investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee.    Specifically,  the  Group 
controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the
investee);
  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 

The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Basis of consolidation (continued)
2 
(c) 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control.  To support this presumption, and 
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant 
facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee;
 
  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and 

The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
Business combinations
The  Group  re-assesses  whether  or  not  it  controls  an  investee  if  facts  and  circumstances  indicate  that  there  are 
changes  to  one  or  more  of  the  three  elements  of  control.    Consolidation  of  a  subsidiary  begins  when  the  Group 
obtains  control  over  the  subsidiary  and  ceases  when  the  Group  loses  control  of  the  subsidiary.    Assets,  liabilities, 
income  and  expenses  of  a  subsidiary  acquired  or  disposed  of  during  the  year  are  included  in  the  consolidated 
financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the 
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit  balance.    When  necessary,  adjustments  are  made  to  the  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  to  bring  their 
accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies.  All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, 
expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation. 
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. 
If  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  related  assets  (including  goodwill),  liabilities,  non-
controlling interest and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  Any 
investment retained is recognised at fair value.  
(d) 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.  The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree.  For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. 
When  the  Group  acquires  a  business,  it  assesses  the  financial  assets  and  liabilities  assumed  for  appropriate 
classification  and  designation  in  accordance  with  the  contractual  terms,  economic  circumstances  and  pertinent 
conditions as at the acquisition date.  This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the 
acquiree. 
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition 
date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.   
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of AASB 
139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value  with the changes in fair value 
recognised in the income statement. 
Goodwill  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  being  the  excess  of  the  aggregate  of  the  consideration  transferred  and  the 
amount  recognised  for  non-controlling  interests,  and  any  previous  interest  held,  over  the  net  identifiable  assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration 
transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the 
reassessment  still  results  in  an  excess  of  the  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  over  the  aggregate  consideration 
transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss. 
(e) 
An  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence.    Significant  influence  is  the  power  to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those 
policies.  The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine 
control over subsidiaries. 
The Group’s investment in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. 
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is initially recognised at cost.  The carrying amount of the 
investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition 
date.  Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised 
nor individually tested for impairment.

Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Investment in associates (continued)
2 
(e) 
The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate.  Any change in OCI of 
those  investees  is  presented  as  part  of  the  Group’s  OCI.    In  addition,  when  there  has  been  a  change  recognised 
directly  in  the  equity  of  the  associate,  the  Group  recognises  its  share  of  any  changes,  when  applicable,  in  the 
statement of changes in equity.  Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the 
associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.   
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the income statement 
outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the 
associate. 
The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.  When necessary, 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. 
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss 
on its investment in the associate.  At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence 
that  the  investment  in  the  associate  is  impaired.    If  there  is  such  evidence,  the  Group  calculates  the  amount  of 
impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises 
the loss as an impairment expense in the income statement. 
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at 
its fair value.  Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the 
fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss. 
(f) 
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification.  An asset is 
current when it is:
Current versus non-current classification
  Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle; 
  Held primarily for the purpose of trading; 
  Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve
months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.   
A liability is current when:
 
 
 

It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; 
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; 
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or 
There  is  no  unconditional  right  to  defer  the  settlement  of  the  liability  for  at  least  twelve  months  after  the 
reporting period.
Operating segments
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. 
(g) 
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engage in business activities from which it may earn revenue 
and incur expenditure and about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the 
Group’s chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 
Segment  information  that  is  evaluated  by  the  chief  operating  decision  makers  is  prepared  in  conformity  with  the 
accounting policies adopted for preparing the financial statements of the Group. 
Operating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision makers – 
being the executive management team and the Board of Directors. 
(h) 
Functional and presentation currency 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars.  Items included in the financial statements 
of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
entity operates, the ‘functional currency’.  The functional currency of Sandfire Resources NL is Australian dollars ($). 
Transactions and balances 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency 
spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.

(h) 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates 
of  exchange  at  the  reporting  date.    Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  settlement  of  such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  in  terms  of  historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the 
exchange  rate  as  at  the  date  of  the  initial  transaction.    Non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value  in  a  foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Group companies 
On consolidation, the assets  and liabilities  of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars  at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at 
the  dates  of  the  transactions.  The  exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  for  consolidation  purposes  are 
recognised in OCI.  On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that 
particular foreign operation will be recognised in profit or loss. 
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts 
of  assets  and  liabilities  around  on  the  acquisition  are  treated  as  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  foreign  operation  and 
translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. 
(i) 
Revenue  is  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefits  will  flow  to  the  Group  and  the 
revenue can  be reliably measured, regardless of  when the  payment is received.  Revenue is measured  at the fair 
value  of  the  consideration  received  or  receivable,  taking  into  account  contractually  defined  terms  of  payment  and 
excluding  taxes  or  duty.    The  specific  recognition  criteria  described  below  must  also  be  met  before  revenue  is 
recognised. 
(i) 
Revenue from  the sale of goods is recognised  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,  usually in the 
form of an executed sales agreement, indicating there has been a transfer of risks and rewards to the customer, no 
further  processing  is  required  by  the  Group,  the  quantity  and  quality  of  the  goods  has  been  determined  with 
reasonable  accuracy,  the  price  is  fixed  or  determinable,  and  collectability  is  probable.    This  is  generally  when  title 
passes,  which  for  the  sale  of  concentrate  represents  the  bill  of  lading  date  when  the  concentrate  is  delivered  for 
shipment. 
Revenue on provisionally priced sales is recognised at the estimated fair value of the total consideration received or 
receivable.  Royalties paid and payable are separately reported as expenses. 
Contract terms for the Group’s sales allow for a price adjustment based on a final assay of the goods by the customer 
to  determine  content.    Recognition  of  the  sales  revenue  for  these  commodities  is  based  on  the  most  recently 
determined  estimate  of  product  specifications  with  a  subsequent  adjustment  made  to  revenue  upon  final 
determination. 
The terms of concentrate sales contracts with third parties contain provisional pricing arrangements.  The provisional 
selling price for metal in concentrate is based on prevailing spot prices at the time of shipment to the customer and 
adjustments to the sales price occur based on movements in quoted market prices up to the date of final settlement. 
These provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative.  Accordingly, the Group has designated 
the receivable at fair value through profit and loss (see Note 2(q)).  Subsequent changes in fair value of the receivable 
is recognised in the income statement in each period until final settlement.  Changes in fair value over the Quotational 
Period (QP) and up until final settlement are estimated by reference to forward market prices.  The QP often reflects 
the average time to elapse (generally 2 to 4 months) between the date of shipment and the date of processing by the 
smelter at final destination.  This pricing methodology is normal for the industry. 
For amounts at balance date still subject to price adjustments due to the quotational period remaining open, a final 
settlement price is estimated based on the closing forward LME (London Metals Exchange) copper price on the final 
day of the month. This revaluation is performed up until the final invoice is received. The actual settlement price may 
vary from this estimate. 
(ii) 
Income  is  recognised  as  interest  accrues  using  the  effective  interest  method.    This  is  a  method  of  calculating  the 
amortised  cost  of  a  financial  asset  and  allocating  the  interest  income  over  the  relevant  period  using  the  effective 
interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the 
financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.  Interest income is included in finance income in the 
income statement.

Inventories
Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
Cash and cash equivalents

(j) 
Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position and statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank 
and on hand and short-term deposits that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to 
an insignificant risk of changes in value.  
(k) 
Stores  and  consumables,  ore  and  concentrate  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value.    Cost 
comprises direct materials, direct labour and a proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure which is directly 
related to the production of inventories. 
Costs  are  assigned  to  individual  items  of  inventory  on  the  basis  of  weighted  average  costs.    Cost  includes  direct 
material, mining, processing, labour, related transportation costs to the point of sale and other fixed and variable costs 
directly related to mining and processing activities. 
Net  realisable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  the  estimated  costs  of 
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 
Stores  and  consumables,  and  ore  inventories  expected  to  be  processed  or  sold  within  twelve  months  after  the 
balance sheet date, are classified as current assets.  All other inventories are classified as non-current assets. 
(l) 
(i) 
Exploration and evaluation assets comprise acquired mineral rights including Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources 
and  are  recognised  at  cost.    As  the  assets  are  not  yet  ready  for  use  they  are  not  depreciated.    Exploration  and 
evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if:
Exploration and evaluation 
Exploration and evaluation assets
 

sufficient data exists to determine commercial viability; or  
other facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Once the commercial viability of the assets are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets are first tested for 
impairment and then reclassified to mine properties as development assets. 
(ii) 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  incurred  on  licenses  where  the  commercial  viability  of  extracting  mineral 
resources has not yet been established is expensed and recognised in the income statement as incurred 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  includes  pre-licence  costs,  costs  associated  with  exploring,  investigating, 
examining and evaluating an area of mineralisation, and assessing the technical feasibility and commercial viability of 
extracting the mineral resources from that area.   
Once  the  commercial  viability  of  extracting  mineral  resources  are  demonstrable  (at  which  point,  the  Company 
considers it probable that economic benefits will be realised), the Company capitalises any further evaluation costs 
incurred for the particular licence to mine properties.  
Cash flows arising from exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Other  than  the  acquisition  of  mineral  rights,  cash  flows  arising  from  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  are 
included in the statement of cash flows as an operating activity. 
(m) 
Mine development 
Mine property and development assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment 
losses recognised.  Mine property and development assets include costs incurred in evaluating and accessing the ore 
body and costs to develop the mine to the production phase, once the commercial viability of an ore body has been 
established. Any ongoing costs associated  with mining  which  are considered to benefit mining  operations in future 
periods are capitalised. 
Amortisation 
The Group amortises mine property and development assets from the commencement of commercial production.  The 
Group amortises mine property and development assets on a units of ore extracted basis over the life of mine. 
(n) 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any.  Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items and costs 
incurred in bringing the asset into use.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can  be  measured  reliably.    The  carrying  amount  of  the  replaced  part  is  derecognised.    All  other  repairs  and 
maintenance costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.  The present value of the expected cost for 
the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria 
for  a  provision  are  met.    Refer  to  significant  accounting  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  (note  3)  and 
provisions (note 2(u)) for further information about the recognised decommissioning provision. 
The capitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation  
The depreciation methods adopted by the Group are shown in table below:

Leases
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or 
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.  Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of 
the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is 
included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted 
prospectively, if appropriate. 
(o) 
The determination of whether an arra9ngement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement 
at inception date.  The arrangement is assessed for whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of 
a  specific  asset  or  assets  or  the  arrangement  conveys  a  right  to  use  the  asset,  even  if  that  right  is  not  explicitly 
specified in an arrangement. 
Group as lessee 
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.  A lease that transfers substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the group is classified as a finance lease.  An operating lease is a 
lease other than a finance lease. 
Finance  leases  are  capitalised  at  the  commencement  of  the  lease  at  the  inception  date  fair  value  of  the  leased 
property or, if lower, at the present value off the minimum lease payments.  Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance  charges  and  reduction  of  the  lease  liability  so  as  to  achieve  a  constant  rate  of  interest  on  the  remaining 
balance of the liability.  Finance charges are recognised in finance costs in the income statement.  
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.  However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the

Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement (continued)
2 
(q) 
All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not subsequently measured 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Subsequent measurement 
For purposes of subsequent measurement financial assets are classified in four categories:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; 
Trade and other receivables;
 
 
  Held-to-maturity investments; or 
  Available-for-sale financial assets.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  include  financial  assets  held  for  trading  and  financial  assets 
designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.    Financial  assets  are  classified  as  held  for 
trading  if  they  are  acquired  for  the  purpose  of  selling  or  repurchasing  in  the  near  term.  Derivatives,  including 
separated  embedded  derivatives,  are  also  classified  as  held  for  trading  unless  they  are  designated  as  effective 
hedging instruments as defined by AASB 139. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the balance sheet at fair value with net changes in fair 
value presented as finance costs (negative net changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair 
value) in the income statement . 
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their 
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not 
held for trading or designated at fair value though profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss. Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in 
the  terms  of  the  contract  that  significantly  modifies  the  cash  flows  that  would  otherwise  be  required  or  a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade  receivables  are  carried  at  fair  value.    Provisional  payments  in  relation  to  trade  receivables  are  due  for 
settlement within 30 days from the date of recognition, with any mark to market adjustment due for settlement usually 
from 60-120 days.  Sales of copper concentrate are recognised in accordance with Note 2(i). 
After initial measurement, other receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. 
Held-to-maturity investments 
The Group did not have any held-to-maturity investments at reporting date. 
Available-for-sale (AFS) financial assets 
AFS  financial  assets  include  equity  investments.    Equity  investments  classified  as  AFS  are  those  that  are  neither 
classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss.   
After initial investment, AFS financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or 
losses recognised as OCI and credited in the AFS reserve until the investment is de-recognised, at which time the 
cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other operating income, or the investment is determined to be impaired, when 
the cumulative loss is reclassified from the AFS reserve to the income statement.  
The  Group  evaluates  whether  the  ability  and  intention  to  sell  its  AFS  financial  assets  in  the  near  term  is  still 
appropriate.  When, in rare circumstances, the Group is unable to trade these financial assets due to inactive markets 
and management’s intention to do so significantly changes in the foreseeable future, the Group may elect to reclassify 
these financial assets. 
For a financial asset reclassified from the AFS category, the fair value carrying amount at the date of reclassification 
becomes its new amortised cost and any  previous gain or loss on the asset that has been recognised in equity is 
amortised  to  profit  or  loss  over  the  remaining  life  of  the  investment  using  the  effective  interest  rate  (EIR).    Any 
difference between the new amortised cost and the maturity amount is also amortised over the remaining life of the 
asset using the EIR.  If the asset is subsequently determined to be impaired then the amount recorded in equity is 
reclassified to the income statement.

(q) 
Derecognition 
A  financial  asset  (or,  where  applicable,  a  part  of  a  financial  asset  or  part  of  a  group  of  similar  financial  assets)  is 
derecognised when:
 

The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or 
The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to 
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a “pass-through” arrangement; 
and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group 
has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred 
control of the asset.
Impairment of financial assets
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass through 
arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership.  When it has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement. In that case, 
the Group also recognises an associated liability.  The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on 
a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained. 
(ii) 
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of 
financial assets is impaired.  An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition 
of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the 
group  of  financial  assets  that  can  be  reliably  estimated.    Evidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the 
debtors  or  a  group  of  debtors  is  experiencing  significant  financial  difficulty,  default  or  delinquency  in  interest  or 
principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and observable data 
indicating  that  there  is  a  measurable  decrease  in  the  estimated  future  cash  flows,  such  as  changes  in  arrears  or 
economic conditions that correlate with defaults. 
Trade and other receivables 
Collectability of other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Individual debts that are known to be uncollectible 
are  written  off  when  identified.    An  impairment  allowance  is  recognised  when  there  is  objective  evidence  that  the 
Group will not be able to collect the receivable.  Financial difficulties of the debtor, default payments or debts more 
than 90 days overdue are considered objective evidence of impairment.  The amount of the impairment loss is the 
receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original 
effective interest rate.  The amount of the impairment is recognised in the income statement. 
Available for sale (AFS) financial investments 
For AFS financial investments, the Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that an 
investment or a group of investments is impaired. 
In  the  case  of  equity  investments  classified  as  AFS,  objective  evidence  would  include  a  significant  or  prolonged 
decline  in the  fair value of the investment below  its cost.  ”Significant” is  evaluated against the original cost of the 
investment and ‘prolonged’ against the period in which the fair value has been below its original cost.  When there is 
evidence  of  impairment,  the  cumulative  loss  –  measured  as  the  difference  between  the  acquisition  cost  and  the 
current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previously recognised in the statement of profit or loss 
– is removed from OCI and recognised in the income statement.  Impairment losses on equity investments are not 
reversed through the income statement; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised directly in OCI. 
(iii) 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans 
and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.  
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings. 
Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
The Group did not have any financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss at reporting date.

Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement (continued)

(q) 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost and due to their short-term nature they are not discounted.  
They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are 
unpaid  and  arise  when  the  Group  becomes  obliged  to  make  future  payments  in  respect  of  the  purchase  of  these 
goods and services.  The amounts are generally unsecured and are usually paid within 60 days of recognition. 
Loans and borrowings 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR  method.    Gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  liabilities  are  de-recognised  as  well  as 
through the EIR amortisation process.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.  The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs 
in the statement of profit or loss. 
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.  For more information refer note 20. 
Derecognition 
A  financial  liability  is  de-recognised  when  the  obligation  under  the  liability  is  discharged  or  cancelled,  or  expires.  
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms  of  an  existing  liability  are  substantially  modified,  such  an  exchange  or  modification  is  treated  as  the  de-
recognition  of  the  original  liability  and  the  recognition  of  a  new  liability.    The  difference  in  the  respective  carrying 
amounts is recognised in the statement or profit or loss. 
iv) 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if 
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net 
basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
(r) 
Initial recognition and subsequent measurement 
In order to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in copper price during the quotational period (QP), the Group may from 
time to time enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of QP hedging via copper swaps to either fix the 
price of sales at the time of shipment or to reduce the length of the QP.  Such derivative financial instruments are 
initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  on  which  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are  subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial 
liabilities when the fair value is negative. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to profit or loss, except for 
the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss when the 
hedge item affects profit or loss. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
Offsetting of financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

Fair value hedges: when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
or an unrecognised firm commitment;
  Cash  flow  hedges:  when  hedging  the  exposure  to  variability  in  cash  flows  that  is  either  attributable  to  a 
particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the 
foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment; or
  Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
At  the  inception  of  a  hedge  relationship,  the  Group  formally  designates  and  documents  the  hedge  relationship  to 
which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. 
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the 
risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in 
offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such 
hedges  are  expected  to  be  highly  effective  in  achieving  offsetting  changes  in  fair  value  or  cash  flows  and  are 
assessed  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  determine  that  they  actually  have  been  highly  effective  throughout  the  financial 
reporting periods for which they were designated. 
The hedges entered into by the Group during the comparative reporting period ended 30 June 2015 in the form of QP 
hedging  via  copper  swaps  were  considered  to  be  economic  hedges,  however  were  not  designated  into  a  hedging 
relationship for accounting purposes as the strict criteria for hedge accounting were not met.  The Group did not enter 
into any hedges during the financial year ended 30 June 2016.

Impairment of non-financial assets
2 
(s) 
Further disclosures relating to impairment of non-financial assets are also provided in the following notes:
  Disclosures for significant assumptions (note 3); and 

Investments accounted for using the equity method (note 18).
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.  If any 
indication  exists,  or  when  annual  impairment  testing  for  an  asset  is  required,  the  Group  estimates  the  asset’s 
recoverable amount.  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s (CGU) fair 
value less costs of disposal and its value in use.  Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless 
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount.   
In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
In  determining  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal,  recent  market  transactions  are  taken  into  account.    If  no  such 
transactions  can  be  identified,  an  appropriate  valuation  model  is  used.    These  calculations  are  corroborated  by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. 
The  Group  bases  its  impairment  calculation  on  detailed  budgets  and  forecast  calculations,  which  are  prepared 
separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.  These budgets and forecast 
calculations  cover  a  period  up  to  seven  years  form  reporting  date.  For  longer  periods,  a  long-term  growth  rate  is 
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. 
Impairment  losses  of  continuing  operations,  including  impairment  on  inventories,  are  recognised  in  the  income 
statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. 
An assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.  If such indication exists, the Group estimates the 
asset’s or CGUs recoverable amount.  A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a 
change  in  the  assumptions  used  to  determine  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount  since  the  last  impairment  loss  was 
recognised.  The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised  for  the  asset  in  prior  years.    Such  reversal  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  unless  the  asset  is 
carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. 
(t) 
The Company recognises a liability to pay cash distributions to equity holders of the parent when the distribution is 
authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. A corresponding amount is recognised 
directly in equity. 
(u) 
(i) 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  When the Group expects some or all of a provision to 
be  reimbursed  the  reimbursement  is  recognised  as  a  separate  asset  but  only  when  the  reimbursement  is  virtually 
certain.  The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
present obligation at the reporting date.  The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The increase in the provision resulting 
from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs. 
(ii)  
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 
months  of the  reporting  date  are recognised in respect  of  employees' services up to the reporting date.  They  are 
measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.  Expenses for non-accumulating sick 
leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable. 
(iii)  
The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be 
made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. 
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of 
service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate 
bonds with terms to maturity and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

Rehabilitation, restoration and dismantling
2 
(u) 
(iv) 
The Group records the present value of estimated costs of legal and constructive obligations required to restore and 
rehabilitate  operating  locations  in  the  period  in  which  the  obligation  is  incurred.    The  nature  of  these  restoration 
activities includes dismantling and removing structures, rehabilitating mines and tailings dams, dismantling operating 
facilities, closure of plant and waste sites, and restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas.  
The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed or the ground/environment is disturbed at the production 
location.  When the liability is initially recognised, the present value of the estimated costs is capitalised by increasing 
the carrying amount of the related assets to the extent that it  was incurred by the development/construction of the 
asset.  The capitalised cost of this asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.  Rehabilitation and 
restoration  obligations  arising  from  the  Group’s  exploration  activities  are  recognised  immediately  in  the  income 
statement in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 2(l). 
Over time, the discounted liability is increased for the change in present value based on the discount rates that reflect 
current market assessments and the risks specific to the liability.  The periodic unwinding of the discount is recognised 
in  the  income  statement  as  a  finance  cost.    Additional  disturbances  or  changes  in  rehabilitation  costs  will  be 
recognised as additions or charges to the corresponding assets and rehabilitation liability when they occur. 
(v) 
(i) 
The Group provides benefits to its employees and contractors (including key management personnel) in the form of 
share-based  payments,  whereby  employees  render  services  in  exchange  for  rights  over  shares  (equity-settled 
transactions).   
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an 
appropriate valuation model (see note 26).  That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other 
capital reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee 
benefits expense.  The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the 
vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.  The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the 
movement  in  cumulative  expense  recognised  as  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  that  period  and  is  recognised  in 
employee benefits expense. 
No  expense  is  recognised  for  awards  that  do  not  ultimately  vest,  except  for  equity-settled  transactions  for  which 
vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition.  These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or 
not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are 
satisfied. 
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense had the 
terms not been modified.  An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value 
of  the  share-based  payment  transaction,  or  is  otherwise  beneficial  to  the  employee  as  measured  at  the  date  of 
modification. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings 
per share. 
(ii) 
The  Group  has  also  provided  benefits  to  executive  directors  in  the  form  of  cash-settled  share-based  payments, 
whereby executive directors render services in exchange for cash, the amounts of which are determined by reference 
to movements in the price of the shares of Sandfire Resources NL. 
The ultimate cost of these cash-settled transactions will be equal to the actual cash paid to the director, which will be 
the fair value at settlement date. 
The cumulative cost recognised until settlement is a liability and the periodic determination of this liability is as follows:
Cash settled transactions
  At each reporting date between grant and settlement, the fair value of the award is determined; 
  During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that
date multiplied by the percentage of the vesting period completed; 
From the end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability recognised is the full fair value of the liability 
at the reporting date; and

  All changes in the liability are recognised in employee benefits expense for the period.
The fair value of the liability is determined, initially and at each reporting date until it is settled, by applying the Black-
Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the award was granted, and the 
extent to which employees have rendered service to date (see note 26).

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
(x) 
(i) 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities.  The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted  or  substantively  enacted,  at  the  reporting  date  in  the  countries  where  the  Group  operates  and  generates 
taxable income. 
Current  income  tax  relating  to  items  recognised  directly  in  equity  is  recognised  in  equity  and  not  in  the  income 
statement.  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which 
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
(ii) 
Deferred  tax  is  provided  using  the  liability  method  on  temporary  differences  between  the  tax  bases  of  assets  and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:
Taxes 
Current income tax
Deferred tax
  When the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the 
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; 
In  respect  of  taxable  temporary  difference  associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and 
interests in joint ventures, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses.  Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused 
tax losses can be utilised, except:
  When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; 
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and 
interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which 
the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.  
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has 
become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss.  Deferred tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same 
taxation authority. 
Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that 
date, would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment 
would either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if it was incurred during the 
measurement period or in profit or loss. 
(iii) 
Revenues,  expenses  and  assets  are  recognised  net  of  the  amount  of  GST  except:  when  the  GST  incurred  on  a 
purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the GST is recognised as 
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and when receivables and 
payables are stated with the amount of GST included.

The Group measures financial instruments such as AFS financial assets at fair value at each reporting date.  Fair 
value related disclosures for financial instruments that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, 
are summarised in the following notes:
Fair value measurement
  Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions notes 3, and 28; 
  Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy note 28; 
 
  Other financial assets – AFS financial assets and unquoted equity securities note 28.
Trade and other receivables note 28; and
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.  The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
 

In the principal market for the asset or liability, or 
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to or by the Group. 
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. 
A  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market  participant's  ability  to  generate 
economic  benefits  by  using  the  asset  in  its  highest  and  best  use  or  by  selling  it  to  another  market  participant  that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use. 
The  Group  uses  valuation  techniques  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances  and  for  which  sufficient  data  are 
available  to  measure  fair  value,  maximising  the  use  of  relevant  observable  inputs  and  minimising  the  use  of 
unobservable inputs. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within 
the  fair  value  hierarchy,  described  as  follows,  based  on  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value 
measurement as a whole:
 


Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level  2  —  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable; or 
Level  3  —  Valuation  techniques  for  which  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting 
period. 
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.

The  preparation  of  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make  judgements, 
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues,  expenses,  assets  and  liabilities,  and  the 
accompanying  disclosures,  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities.    Uncertainty  about  these  assumptions  and 
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities 
affected in future periods.

Judgements 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 
Lease commitments – Group as lessee (DeGrussa Solar Power Project) 
The Group classifies leases between financial and operating depending on whether the Group holds substantially all 
of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership or not.  In making this assessment the Group primarily considers the 
asset ownership at the end of the lease term, any purchase options, the lease term in respect to the assets’ life, the 
present value of future lease payments in relation to the assets’ fair value and the nature of the asset. 
The Group has entered into a solar power purchase agreement with juwi Renewable Energy Pty Ltd.  Based on an 
evaluation of the terms and conditions of the agreement, the Group has determined that the arrangement contains a 
lease and is in the scope of AASB 17 Leases.  The Group accounts for the arrangement as an operating lease due to 
the following indicators:

 

The agreement does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the solar 
power facility to the Group; 
The lease term does not constitute a major part of the economic life of the solar power facility; and 
The present value of the minimum lease payments do not amount to substantially all of the fair value of the 
solar power facility.
Estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when 
the  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared.  Existing  circumstances  and  assumptions  about  future 
developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of 
the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. 
Significant estimates and assumptions 
Rehabilitation, restoration and dismantling provision 
The  Group  assesses  its  rehabilitation,  restoration  and  dismantling  (rehabilitation)  provision  at  each  reporting  date.  
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision as there are numerous factors that will 
affect the ultimate liability payable.  These factors include estimates of the extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, 
technological  changes,  regulatory  changes,  cost  increases  as  compared  to  the  inflation  rates,  and  changes  in 
discount  rates.    These  uncertainties  may  result  in  future  actual  expenditure  differing  from  the  amounts  currently 
provided. The provision at reporting date represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future 
rehabilitation costs required, which are expected to be incurred up to 2036.  Changes to estimated future costs are 
recognised in the balance sheet by either increasing or decreasing the rehabilitation liability and related asset if the 
initial estimate was originally recognised as part of an asset measured in accordance with AASB 116 Property, Plant 
and Equipment.  Any reduction in the rehabilitation liability and any deduction from the related asset may not exceed 
the carrying amount of that asset.  If it does, any excess over the carrying value is taken immediately to profit or loss. 
If the change in estimate results in an increase in the rehabilitation liability and therefore an addition to the carrying 
value of the related asset, the entity is required to consider whether this is an indication of impairment of the asset as 
a whole and test for impairment in accordance with AASB 136.  If the revised assets, net of rehabilitation provisions, 
exceed the recoverable amount, that portion of the increase is charged directly to the income statement. 
Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates 
Ore  reserves  are  estimates  of  the  amount  of  ore  that  can  be  economically  and  legally  extracted  from  the  Group’s 
mining properties.  The Group estimates its Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources based on information compiled by 
appropriately  qualified  persons  relating  to  the  geological  data  on  the  size,  depth  and  shape  of  the  ore  body,  and 
requires complex geological judgments to interpret the data.  The estimation of recoverable reserves is based upon 
factors such as estimates of foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, future capital requirements, and production 
costs along with geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body and 
removal  of  waste  material.    Changes  in  these  estimates  may  impact  upon  the  carrying  value  of  mine  properties, 
property,  plant  and  equipment,  provision  for  rehabilitation,  recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets,  inventory,  and 
depreciation and amortisation charges.

FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
3 
Commercial viability of extracting Mineral Resources 
The Group assesses a project to be in a development stage when the project is assessed as being technically and 
commercially  viable.    The  process  for  determining  whether  a  project  is  commercially  viable  involves  a  number  of 
judgements  and  estimates,  including  forecasting  metal  prices,  assessing  resource  grades  and  viable  methods  of 
extracting the mineral resource. 
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group 
and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment.  If an impairment trigger exists the recoverable amount of the 
asset is determined.  Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit (CGU) exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less 
costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental 
costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. 
Taxes 
Judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are recognised on 
the  balance  sheet.    Deferred  tax  assets,  including  those  arising  from  unrecouped  tax  losses,  capital  losses  and 
temporary  differences,  are recognised only  where it  is considered more  likely than  not that they  will  be recovered, 
which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits. 
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management's estimates of future cash flows.  
These  depend  on  estimates  of  future  production  and  sales  volumes,  operating  costs,  restoration  costs,  capital 
expenditure,  dividends  and  other  capital  management  transactions.    Judgements  are  also  required  about  the 
application of income tax legislation.  These judgements and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence 
there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred 
tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  and  the  amount  of  other  tax  losses  and 
temporary differences not yet recognised.  In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amounts of recognised 
deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the income 
statement. 
Share-based payment transactions 
The  Group  measures  the  cost  of  equity-settled  and  cash-settled  transactions  with  employees  and  contractors 
(including  key  management  personnel)  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  the  instruments.    Estimating  fair  value  for 
share based payment transactions requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on 
the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  grant.    This  estimate  also  requires  determining  the  most  appropriate  inputs  to  the 
valuation  model  including  the  expected  life  of  the  instrument,  volatility  and  dividend  yield  and  making  assumptions 
about them.  The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are 
disclosed in note 26. 
Estimated useful lives of assets 
The  estimation  of  the  useful  lives  of  assets  has  been  based  on  historical  experience,  lease  terms  (for  leased 
equipment) and turnover  policies (for motor vehicles).  In addition, the condition  of the assets is assessed at least 
once  per  year  and  considered  against  the  remaining  useful  life.    Adjustments  to  useful  lives  are  made  when 
considered necessary. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured 
based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the DCF 
model.  The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, 
a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values.  Judgements include considerations of inputs such as 
liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.  Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value 
of financial instruments.  See note 28 for details. 
Business combinations 
The  recognition  of  a  business  combination  requires  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  to  be  used  whereby  the 
purchase  consideration  is  allocated  to  the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  (identifiable  net 
assets) on the basis of fair value at the acquisition date.  Any excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the 
identifiable  net  assets  is  to  be  allocated  to  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  acquired  entity.  The Group  makes 
judgements  and  estimates  in  relation  to  the  fair  value  allocation  of  the  purchase  price.    See  note  6  for  details  of 
business combinations during the year.

Finance income, finance costs and taxes are not allocated to individual segments as they are managed on a Group 
basis. 
Segment assets 
The  Group  does  not  separately  disclose  assets  for  its  operating  segments,  as  a  majority  of  Group  assets  are 
attributable to the DeGrussa Copper Mine segment and the Group does not consider assets attributable to the other 
operating segments to be material. 
Information about geographical areas and products 
The Group’s sales revenue (see note 7 for details) arise from sales to customers in Asia. A majority of the product 
was  sent  to  China  for  processing  (89%),  a  portion  was  sent  to  Philippines  (7%)  and  Japan  (4%).    During  2015,  a 
majority of the product was sent to China for processing (86%), a portion was sent to Japan (8%), Philippines (4%) 
and Indonesia (2%).  The revenue information is based on the location of the customer’s operations. 
Four customers (2015: four customers) individually accounted for more than ten percent of total revenue during the 
year.    Sales  revenue  from  these  major  customers  ranged  from  11%  to  25%  of  total  revenue,  contributing 
approximately 77% of total revenue (2015: 71%). 
As at 30 June 2016 and 2015, no material assets or liabilities were located outside Australia.

Acquisition of additional interest in Tintina Resources Inc 
On  18  November  2015,  the  Group  increased  its  stake  in  North  American  copper  development  company  Tintina 
Resources  Inc  (“Tintina”;  TSX-V:  TAU)  to  57%  from  36%,  by  acquiring  a  further  21%  interest.  The  additional 
shareholding,  comprising  47,244,095  shares,  was  acquired  by  Sandfire  in  an  off-market  transaction  at  an  average 
price of C$0.0831 per share, for total consideration of C$3,926,000 ($4,160,000).  
The  Group  obtained  control  of  the  Tintina  on  18  November  2015  and  has  applied  the  acquisition  method  of 
accounting.    The  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses  of  Tintina  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements as at and for the period ended 30 June 2016, from the date the Group gained control, being 18 November 
2015.  The Group’s investment in Tintina was previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Acquisition date fair value of equity interest 
The fair value of the existing equity interest at the date of acquisition was assessed to be $6,125,000, resulting in a 
reversal of impairment expense of $2,212,000. The fair value of the equity interest was categorised to level 2 of the 
Group’s  fair  value  hierarchy,  as  detailed  in  note  28,  and  was  estimated  using  the  off-market  transaction  price  of 
C$0.0831 per share, adjusting for a control premium. 
An amount of $501,000  was also recycled from the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) on disposal of the 
equity accounted investment.  This is recognised within other income in the consolidated income statement.

The Group has elected to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value using Tintina’s share price 
as a primary input. 
The acquired business contributed net losses to the Group of $3,749,000 from 18 November 2015 to 30 June 2016. If 
the transaction had occurred on 1 July 2015, the consolidated profit for the 12 months ended 30 June 2016 would 
have been $43,125,000. This amount has been calculated using the subsidiary’s results for the period 1 July 2015 to 
18 November 2015.

Sandfire delivers concentrate to customers on the industry standard basis using prevailing London Metal Exchange 
(LME)  metal  prices.  For  those  sales  based  on  prevailing  LME  metal  prices,  the  customer  makes  a  provisional 
payment to Sandfire against a provisional invoice for the contained copper and precious metal credits (for gold and 
silver) in the shipment.  Final settlement of the payment is based on the average LME metal price over a subsequent 
pricing period as specified by the terms of the sales contract.  The period commencing on the date of shipment to the 
end of the pricing period is known as the Quotational Period (QP).  The QP historically reflects the average time to 
elapse  (generally  2  to  4  months)  between  the  date  of  shipment  and  the  date  of  processing  by  the  smelter  at  final 
destination.  This pricing methodology is normal for the industry.  This resulted in an unfavourable $11,348,000 (2015: 
unfavourable $16,580,000) mark-to-market adjustment to profit or loss for the year ended 30 June 2016.

Unrecognised temporary differences and capital losses 
The  Group  has  unrecognised  temporary  differences  and  carry  forward  losses  for  which  no  deferred  tax  asset  is 
recognised in the statement of financial position of $55,048,000 (2015: $5,185,000) that have not been recognised as 
the statutory requirements for recognising those deferred tax assets have not been met. 
Deferred  tax  assets  have  not  been  recognised  in  respect  of  the  losses  as  they  may  not  be  used  to  offset  taxable 
profits elsewhere in the Group, that have primarily arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time, 
and there are no other tax planning opportunities or evidence of recoverability in the near future.  Included are US 
losses that will commence to expire from 2028 and Canadian losses that will commence to expire from 2036.

FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
Earnings per share (EPS)
11 
Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.  Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by 
dividing  the  net  profit  attributable  to  ordinary  equity  holders  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  ordinary  shares 
outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion 
of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

There are 1,695,000 share options (refer to note 22) excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share that 
could  potentially  dilute  basic  earnings  per  share  in  the  future  because  they  are  anti-dilutive  for  the  current  period. 
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting 
date and the date of authorisation of these financial statements.

On  18  November  2015,  the  Group  increased  its  stake  in  North  American  copper  development  company  Tintina 
Resources Inc (“Tintina”; TSX-V: TAU) to 57% from 36%, by acquiring a further 21% interest. The Group obtained 
control  of  Tintina  on  18  November  2015  and  has  applied  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting  (see  note  6).    The 
Group’s investment in Tintina was previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

WCB Resources Inc
(ii) 
The Group accounts for its investment in WCB Resources Ltd (WCB: TSX-V: WCB) using the equity method.  WCB is 
a  Toronto  listed  copper-gold  explorer.   The  Group  holds  22,222,222  shares  in  WCB  (30  June  2014:  22,222,222 
shares), which equates to an interest of 38.28% at 30 June 2016 (2015: 38.38%). 
The Group performed its impairment test as at 30 June 2016 to determine whether there is objective evidence that the 
investment in WCB is impaired.  The Group considers the relationship between the investment’s market capitalisation 
and its carrying amount, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment.  As a result, the Group has 
recognised  an  impairment  loss  of  $940,000  with  respect  to  its  investment  in  WCB,  representing  the  difference 
between the Group’s carrying amount of the investment and the recoverable amount, calculated as the fair value less 
costs  of  disposal.    The  fair  value  of  WCB  has  been  categorised  to  level  2  of  the  Group’s  fair  value  hierarchy,  as 
detailed in note 28, and has been estimated using the closing share price of WCB at 30 June 2016.  The share price 
of WCB as at 30 June 2016 was C$0.04 per share.

Finance facilities 
The Group’s financing arrangements are provided under a secured loan facility with ANZ and are secured by a fixed 
and floating charge over the Group’s assets, including the DeGrussa Project and the broader Doolgunna Project, and 
a mining mortgage over the Project tenements.   
DeGrussa Project Loan Facility 
The  facility  was  designed  to  underpin  the  Group’s  construction  and  development  of  its  DeGrussa  Copper  Mine  in 
Western Australia and includes an $85 million Revolver Facility, which can be paid or redrawn as required, subject to 
facility terms, and which must be fully repaid by 31 December 2017, and a $40 million Amortising Facility. 
During the year the Company fully repaid the Amortising Facility with its financier, ANZ Banking Corporation (“ANZ”), 
ahead of schedule, following a $20 million payment at the end of the June 2016 Quarter.  The Amortising Facility was 
previously  scheduled  to  be  repaid  over  the  next  18  months  to  31  December  2017.    The  Company  also  made  a 
payment  of  $35  million  against  the  Revolver  Facility,  reducing  the  outstanding  balance  to  $50  million,  which  also 
represented the Company’s total outstanding debt as at 30 June 2016. 
Working Capital Facility 
The Company has access to a working capital facility with ANZ for $25 million.  The facility, which can be drawn down 
up to the value of saleable copper concentrate inventories held by the Company at the mine and ports, is designed to 
reduce the potential cash flow impact of timing of concentrate shipments and cash receipts.  The facility was undrawn 
at 30 June 2016 and at the date of this report.

Capital management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise shareholder value.  In order to achieve this 
overall  objective,  the  Group’s  capital  management,  amongst  other  things,  aims  to  ensure  that  it  meets  financial 
covenants attached to the Company’s interest bearing liabilities (see note 20) and maintain a strong liquidity position 
in  order  to  support  its  business.    There  have  been  no  breaches  in  the  financial  covenants  of  any  interest  bearing 
liabilities  during  the  current  financial  year  or  prior  financial  years.    The  Group  is  not  subject  to  externally  imposed 
capital requirements other than restrictions relating to the Group’s cash debt service reserve account as part of the 
Group’s Project Loan Facility.  See note 12 and 20 for more details. 
The Group manages and makes adjustments to its capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions.  In 
order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may for example return capital to shareholders, issue new 
shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  No changes were made in the objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital, during the years ended 30 June 2016 and 2015. 
Nature and purpose of reserves 
Share-based payments reserve 
The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to 
employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration. Refer note 26 for details. 
Foreign currency translation reserve 
Exchange  differences  arising  on  the  translation  of  entities  with  a  functional  currency  differing  from  the  Group’s 
presentation currency, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) as described in accounting policy 
note 2(h). For the Group, this relates to its investment in Tintina Resources Inc and WCB Resources Ltd, see note 18.

Long-term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan)
(a)  
(i)   
Under the executive LTI Plan, awards are made to executives and other key talent (collectively referred to as senior 
management) who have an impact on the Group’s performance. LTI awards are delivered in the form of performance 
rights  over  ordinary  shares  in  the  Company  for  no  consideration,  which  vest  over  a  period  of  3  years  subject  to 
meeting  performance  measures,  with  no  opportunity  to  retest.    The  Group  uses  relative  Total  Shareholder  Return 
(TSR) as the performance measure.  Performance rights granted under the LTI Plan are not entitled to dividends nor 
have voting rights.  Refer to the Group’s Remuneration Report for further details on the plan. 
Listed below are the terms and conditions of issues made by the Group during the current financial year.

Pricing model 
The fair value of performance rights granted is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo simulation model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted. The model simulates the TSR and 
compares it against the comparator group constituting companies in the S&P/ASX200 Resources Index (XJR: ASX). It 
takes into account historical and expected dividends, and the share price fluctuation covariance of the Company and 
the comparator group to predict the distribution of relative share performance. 
The following table lists the assumptions used in determining the fair value of performance rights granted during the 
current and previous financial year.

Long-term Incentive Option Plan (IOP Plan)
(ii)  
The IOP Plan was created to align senior management awards with shareholder value.  Awards under the plan were 
provided as a grant of options over ordinary shares for no consideration.  The options vest in three equal tranches 
after 1, 2 and 3 years, with an exercise price for the three tranches set at a 20%, 40% and 60% premium to the 5-day 
volume weighted average share price prior to the date of grant.  The Board imposed service based vesting conditions 
to  encourage  retention.    There  was  also  the  challenging  market  performance  hurdle  related  to  share  price  growth 
inherent in the exercise price. 
With the introduction of the LTI Plan, no further awards have been made under the IOP Plan.  Outstanding awards 
under the plan are as follows: 

1,695,000 options previously issued to senior management expire on 15 July 2018 and the exercise price ranges 
from $7.60 to $10.00.
There are no voting or dividend rights attached to the options.  Voting rights will be attached to the ordinary issued 
shares when the options have been exercised. 
Option pricing model 
The fair value of options granted was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and 
has been recognised in full in previous financial years.  There was no share-based payment expense arising from the 
IOP Plan during the financial year ended 30 June 2016.

Cash-settled share-based payments
The  weighted  average  remaining  contractual  life  for  share  options  outstanding  as  at  30  June  2016  is  2.00  years 
(2015: 1.26 years). 
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was $7.60 - $10.00 (2015: $7.60 - $11.70).  
As the range of exercise prices is wide, refer to the above table for further information in assessing the number and 
timing of additional shares that may be issued and the cash that may be received upon exercise of those options. 
(b) 
Long-term Indexed Bonus Plan (LTIB Plan) 
The LTIB Plan was created to align executive director rewards with shareholder value creation and was provided as a 
grant of conditional rights. Rights vest in three equal tranches and are all premium priced.  The participant realises 
value  from  the  rights  if  the  share  price  exceeds  the  initial  notional  value  (INV)  on  the  initial  vesting  date  or  a 
subsequent higher test price on re-testing.  Where the participant realises value at any of the test dates, the holder of 
the award receives, at the Company’s sole discretion, either cash, or subject to any shareholder approval required 
under  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  the  ASX  Listing  Rules,  ordinary  shares  in  the  Company  for  the  difference 
between  the  5-day  volume  weighted  average  ASX  price  of  underlying  Company  shares  prior  to  the  vesting/testing 
date and the INV/test price.  Once vested, the rights are tested twice a year on 15 June and 15 December until expiry.   
It  is  the  current  intention  of  the  Board  that  awards  issued  under  the  LTIB  Plan  will  be  settled  in  cash  where  the 
participant realises value from the rights and historically, grants that have realised value have been cash-settled. 
With the introduction of the LTI Plan, no further awards have been made under the LTIB Plan.  Outstanding awards 
under the LTIB Plan include the conditional rights previously issued to the CEO, which expire between 15 December 
2016 and 15 December 2018 and the INV/test price ranges from $7.35 to $11.45. 
Pricing model 
The ultimate cost of the rights, representing the fair value at settlement date,  will be equal to the cash paid to the 
participants or, subject to any shareholder approval required under the Corporations Act 2011 and the ASX Listing 
Rules, the value of ordinary Company shares issued.  The cumulative cost recognised until settlement is recognised 
as a liability and the periodic determination of this liability is as follows: 
  During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting date is the fair value of the award at that date
multiplied by the percentage of the vesting period completed;
  From the end of the vesting period until settlement, the liability recognised is the full fair value of the liability at the
reporting date; and
  All changes in the liability are recognised in employee share-based payments expense for the period.

The fair value of the liability is determined, initially and at each reporting date until it is settled, by applying the Black-
Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions on  which the award  was granted.  The

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group recognised a credit of $473,000 (2015: credit $780,000) during the current financial year relating to the 
valuation of the conditional rights in accordance with AASB 2.  No cash payments were made to executive directors 
under the LTIB Plan during the current or previous financial year.

This  note  presents  information  about  the  Group’s  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  its  exposure  to  financial 
risks, as well as objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.   
The  Group’s  principal  financial  liabilities  comprise  loans  and  borrowings  and  trade  and  other  payables.    The  main 
purpose  of  these  financial  liabilities  is  to  finance  the  Group’s  operations.    The  Group’s  principal  financial  assets 
comprise trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations.  The 
Group also holds unquoted equity securities in the form of warrants and available-for-sale investments. 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the following financial risks: 
  Market risk including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk and equity price risk; 
  Credit risk; and 
 
Primary  responsibility  for  the  identification  and  control  of  these  financial  risks  rests  with  the  Group’s  senior 
management.  The Group’s senior management is supported by the Audit and Risk Committee under the authority of 
the Board.  The Audit and Risk Committee provides assurance to the Board that the Group’s financial risk activities 
are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in 
accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives.

Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
27  
The  Group  uses  different  methods  to  measure  and  manage  different  types  of  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed.    These 
include  monitoring  levels  of  exposure  to  interest  rates  via  assessments  of  market  forecasts  for  interest  rates  and 
monitoring liquidity risk through the development of future rolling cash flow forecasts. 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes 
in market prices.  Market risk for the Group comprise three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other 
price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity price risk.  Financial instruments affected by market risk include 
loans and borrowings, trade receivables, cash and short-term deposits, unquoted equity securities and available-for-
sale investments. 
The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at 30 June 2016 and 2015. 
Interest rate risk management and sensitivity analysis 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes  in  market  interest  rates.    The  Group’s  exposure  to  the  risk  of  changes  in  market  interest  rates  relates 
primarily  to  the  Group’s  current  and  non-current  debt  obligations  with  floating  interest  rates.    The  Group  is  also 
exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and short-term deposits. 
At 30 June 2016 the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

The effect of a reasonably possible change in interest rates at balance date would not have a significant impact on the 
Group’s after tax profit or equity. 
Foreign currency risk and sensitivity analysis 
Foreign  currency  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  an  exposure  will  fluctuate  because  of 
changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates 
primarily to the Group’s sale of metal concentrate products denominated in US dollars.   
The Group did not use any form of derivatives to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk during the financial year 
ended 30 June 2016. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s financial assets by its currency risk exposure as at 30 June 2016 is listed below.

Commodity price risk and sensitivity analysis 
The Group is exposed to commodity price volatility on the sale of metal in concentrate products such as copper and 
gold,  which  are  priced  on,  or  benchmarked  to,  open  market  exchanges,  specifically  the  London  Metal  Exchange 
(LME).  Sandfire aims to realise average copper prices, which are materially consistent with the prevailing average 
market prices for the same period. 
The Group did not use any form of derivatives to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk during the financial year 
ended 30 June 2016. 
The  following  table  demonstrates  the  sensitivity  to  a  reasonably  possible  change  in  commodity  prices  from  the  30 
June 2016 LME forward curve, with all other variables held constant.

(9,197)
2015

(12,678)
The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of provisionally priced sales contracts 
outstanding  at  year  end  totaling  $80,113,000  (2015:  $119,356,000).    The  sensitivity  analysis  does  not  include  the 
impact of the movement in commodity prices on the total sales for the year. 
Equity price risk 
The Group’s listed and unlisted equity securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about 
future  values  of  the  investment  securities.    The  Group  does  not  actively  trade  these  investments.  The  Group’s 
exposure to equity price risk is not considered material at 30 June 2016. 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss.  The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions.  At the reporting date, the carrying 
amount of the Group’s financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. 
The  credit  risk  on  cash  and  cash  equivalents  is  managed  by  restricting  dealing  to  banks  which  are  assigned  high 
credit ratings by international credit rating agencies.  The Group’s cash and cash equivalents as at 30 June 2016 is 
maintained by one financial institution. 
Credit risk in trade receivables is managed by the Group by undertaking a regular risk assessment process including 
assessing  the  credit  quality  of  the  customer,  taking  into  account  its  financial  position,  past  experience  and  other 
factors.  As there are a relatively small number of transactions, they are closely monitored to ensure payments are 
made  on  time.    Credit  risk  arising  from  sales  to  customers  is  managed  by  contracts  that  stipulate  a  provisional 
payment of at least 90 per cent of the estimated value of each sale.  This is payable promptly after vessel loading.  
The balance outstanding is received within 60-120 days of the vessel arriving at the port of discharge. Additionally, 
several sales are covered by letter of credit arrangements with approved financial institutions.  The Group does not 
have any significant receivables which are past due at the reporting date. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  Group  will  encounter  difficulty  in  meeting  obligations  associated  with  financial 
liabilities.    The  Group’s  approach  to  managing  liquidity  is  to  ensure,  as  far  as  possible,  that  it  will  always  have 
sufficient  liquidity  to  meet  its  liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.  The Group manages liquidity risk by conducting 
regular reviews of the timing of cash flows in order to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet these obligations.  
The Group also has access to a number of finance facilities as detailed in note 20.

Fair value measurement
28  
The  carrying  amount  of  all  financial  assets  and  all  financial  liabilities,  except  for  the  Group’s  secured  bank  loan, 
recognised in the balance sheet approximates their fair value.  The fair value of the Group’s secured bank loan is 
represented by the face value of the liability, prior to capitalised finance establishment costs (see note 20 for details). 
Fair value hierarchy 
All financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole, as follows: 
 

Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable. 
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable.

For  financial  instruments  that  are  recognised  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis,  the  Group  determines  whether 
transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. 
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of Level 3 
fair value measurements, during the year ended 30 June 2016 or the comparative period ended 30 June 2015. 
The  following  table  shows  the  fair  values  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities,  other  than  cash  and  cash 
equivalents, including their levels in the fair value measurement hierarchy as at 30 June 2016.

(i)  Trade  receivables/payables  relate  to  concentrate  sale  contracts  that  are  still  subject  to  price  adjustments  where  the  final 
consideration to be received/paid will be determined based on prevailing London Metals Exchange (LME) metal prices at the 
final settlement date.  Sales that are still subject to price adjustments at balance date are fair valued by estimating the final 
settlement  price  using  the  LME  forward  metals  prices  at  balance  date.    The  receivable/payable  represents  the  expected 
proceeds to be received/expected funds to be paid.
