<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the situation of human 
rights and the activities of her Office in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> In its resolution 19/27, the Human Rights Council invited the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to submit a report to the Council at its twenty-fourth 
session on the situation of human rights and the activities of her Office in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. In the present report, which covers the period from November 2011 
to May 2013, the High Commissioner assesses the progress made by the authorities in the 
implementation of recommendations made by the High Commissioner and United Nations 
human rights mechanisms in recent years.  
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner commends the efforts made by Congolese authorities to 
address such recommendations, which resulted in important developments in the field of 
human rights, including the promulgation of a law on the establishment of a national 
human rights commission. The High Commissioner also notes with satisfaction the 
improvements in holding State agents accountable for human rights violations, including 
sexual violence, such as elements of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (FARDC) and of the Congolese National Police, many of whom were convicted 
during the period under review. There were several other significant developments during 
the reporting period, including, in March 2013, the surrender to the International Criminal 
Court of General Bosco Ntaganda, accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
</p>

<p> Despite the above-mentioned efforts, the High Commissioner notes that the situation 
of human rights had significantly deteriorated since her previous report to the Council 
(A/HRC/19/48), especially in the eastern part of the country, where the United Nations 
Joint Human Rights Office Joint Human Rights Office documented an important increase 
in the number of human rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law that could amount to war crimes, committed by national security and 
defence forces, as well as by foreign and national armed groups. 
</p>
<p> The increase in gross human rights violations during the period under review can be 
attributed to various armed groups, including Mouvement du 23 mars (M23), and to the 
security and defence forces, in relation to M23 activities. M23 combatants were indeed 
responsible for gross human rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law, including summary executions, rape and child recruitment. Other armed 
groups, which took advantage of the security vacuum that followed the redeployment of 
FARDC units to combat M23, since May 2012, were also responsible for gross human 
rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law. Such groups have 
sought to extend their influence and control over areas rich in natural resources in the 
eastern part of the country, committing attacks against civilians, often on ethnic grounds. In 
addition, in the context of operations against M23, members of the Congolese defence and 
security forces allegedly committed gross human rights violations and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law, including mass rape. 
</p>
<p> The presidential and legislative elections held in November 2011were characterized 
by acts of violence and serious human rights violations, apparently committed mostly by 
members of the Congolese defence and security forces against opposition party members 
and supporters. While judicial authorities initiated investigations into some election-related 
human rights violations, little progress was observed with regard to the prosecution of the 
alleged perpetrators. In addition, human rights defenders and journalists were threatened, 
arbitrarily arrested and subjected to other human rights violations during the election 
period. The judiciary&#8217;s lack of independence continued to be observed, in particular when 
dealing with cases of human rights violations against political opponents and civil society 
members. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner encourages the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo to implement all the recommendations made in the present report and reiterates 
the engagement of her Office in the State to support its efforts to protect and promote 
human rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1<b>. </b>The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/27. 
Like the three previous reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights submitted to the Human Rights Council on the Democratic Republic of the Congo,1 
the report presents an overview of the situation of human rights in the country, as well as of 
the activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR)2 in the country 
from November 2011 to May 2013. In the report, the High Commissioner also assesses 
progress with regard to the implementation of the recommendations made by OHCHR and 
other United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Main human rights developments 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the previous report of the High Commissioner (A/HRC/19/48), the Congolese 
authorities have made significant efforts to advance human rights including through the 
introduction of new policies and legislative changes. Appointed in April 2012, the Minister 
for Justice and Human Rights and her Deputy Minister have focused efforts on several 
pivotal issues, such as the launching of the <i>entit&#233;s de liaison</i>3 at the provincial level, the 
implementation of the 2011 law criminalizing torture, and assessing prison conditions 
throughout the country. The promulgation, on 21 March 2013, by the President of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo of a law establishing a national human rights 
commission is also expected to greatly enhance the national capacity to promote and protect 
human rights. The designation of its members and the completion of its establishment are 
now pending. The relaunching of the parliamentary network on human rights was also a 
significant development.  
</p>
<p>3. At the same time, the situation of human rights has deteriorated, with a significant 
increase in human rights violations, particularly in the conflict-stricken eastern provinces, 
namely North Kivu, South Kivu, Orientale and northern Katanga. Since April 2012, the 
majority of the human rights violations documented by the Joint Human Rights Office have 
been related to the activities of Mouvement du 23 mars (M23). M23 committed gross 
human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law, as did 
other armed groups, taking advantage of the security vacuum left since May 2012 following 
the redeployment of units of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(FARDC) to combat M23. These various Congolese and foreign armed groups have been 
seeking to extend their influence and control over areas rich in natural resources. In that 
context, killings, enforced disappearances and, cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and 
rape were often committed in the scope of systematic attacks on villages and on their 
civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity. In addition, in the 
context of military operations against M23 and other armed groups, FARDC were the main 
perpetrators of human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/13/64, A/HRC/16/27 and A/HRC/19/48. 
 2 On 1 February 2008, the Division of Human Rights of the United Nations Organization Mission in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and OHCHR in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo were merged to create the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p> 3 In August 2009, the Entit&#233; de liaison pour les droits de l&#8217;homme, a forum for discussion on human 
rights issues, was created by ministerial decree 095/35.  </p>


<p>4. Sexual violence remained a major human rights concern, in both its scope and its 
systematic nature, particularly in the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale. A 
large number of cases of rape were committed by members of the Congolese defence and 
security forces, as well as by armed groups. Incidents of sexual violence mainly occurred 
during attacks on villages alongside other human rights violations, such as killings, torture 
and abduction. Many armed groups continued to struggle for control of resource-rich 
territories, resulting in serious human rights violations on civilians, including mass rape.  
</p>
<p>5. Insecurity in many parts of eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo led 
to significant displacement, with a large number of Congolese fleeing to neighbouring 
countries for refuge. At least one million people have been displaced as a result of gross 
human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law since May 
</p><p>2012.  
</p>
<p>6. Impunity remains widespread throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
especially for individuals in positions of power or influence. Nevertheless, in 2012, the 
Joint Human Rights Office documented the conviction of more than 200 individuals for 
human rights violations committed by State agents and armed groups. Despite this progress, 
the criminal justice system remains structurally weak and generally lacks independence, 
particularly when dealing with cases against political opponents and members of civil 
society. 
</p>
<p>7. The presidential and legislative elections, held in November 2011, were marked by 
widespread human rights violations, including violations of the rights to life, to liberty and 
security of person and to physical integrity, and violations of the rights to freedom of 
expression, the press and peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>8. In March 2013, in response to the above-mentioned developments, the Security 
Council adopted resolution 2098 (2013), in which it provided the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) with a 
stronger mandate and more robust tools for the protection of civilians. Provisions for an 
intervention brigade with an offensive mandate and the designation of a special envoy for 
the Great Lakes region were among the main measures adopted by the Council in resolution 
2098 (2013) to address the persistence of violations of human rights and of international 
humanitarian law by a multitude of armed groups, mostly in the conflict-stricken provinces 
of the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to address the stalemate in 
establishing regional security. 
</p>
<p>9. Throughout the period under review, the Joint Human Rights Office continued to 
contribute to the implementation of several MONUSCO tools and coordination 
mechanisms for the protection of civilians, including the Joint Protection Teams, the 
Community Alert Networks and the Community Liaison Assistants. Such tools are intended 
to enable the mission to anticipate protection needs, develop community protection plans 
and mitigate serious threats to the local population.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Extrajudicial killings and summary executions 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>10. Recommendations were made to the Government in the past regarding the 
responsibility to investigate, prosecute and punish all acts of extrajudicial killing and 
summary execution and to grant appropriate reparations to the families of the victims.4 It 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See CCPR/C/COD/CO/3, para. 10. </p>


<p>was also recommended that the Government should implement fully its &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; 
policy and investigate, arrest and prosecute FARDC members responsible for such 
killings.5  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>11. Violations to the right to life continued to be widely reported since the previous 
report of the High Commissioner. The extensive killings targeting civilians6, which were 
committed between April and September 2012 by various armed groups in Southern 
Masisi, North Kivu, for instance, were among the most serious witnessed in the past two 
years in the country. In other parts of Masisi territory, the Joint Human Rights Office 
documented more than 130 killings and other human rights violations by armed groups, 
mainly Ra&#239;a Mutomboki and Nyatura combatants, during the period from 15 August 2012 
to 10 January 2013. The killings were linked to the security vacuum created in the area 
following the redeployment of FARDC troops to Rutshuru to fight M23.  
</p>
<p>12. The disproportionate use of force by FARDC soldiers, members of the Republican 
Guard and agents of the Congolese National Police (PNC) during an operation against some 
300 Mai-Mai Kata Katanga in March 2013 in Lubumbashi resulted in the killing of at least 
three civilians and more than 18 Mai-Mai, some shot at close range, as well as many others 
injured. Appropriate and laudable action was taken by Congolese authorities in some of 
these cases documented by OHCHR, such as in the Mitwaba case, where the perpetrators 
were arrested and referred to the military justice. In other cases, such as in the Ilema case, 
no serious action was taken.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to conduct monitoring and investigation 
missions to the most volatile areas and reported on the most urgent concerns. Four reports 
were subsequently published, with a particular focus on issues relating to serious human 
rights violations committed in Southern Masisi;7 death in detention;8 elections-related 
human rights violations in Kinshasa;9 and human rights violations perpetrated by FARDC 
and M23 in North and South Kivu from 15 November to 2 December 2012. On these cases 
and previous ones, OHCHR in the Democratic Republic of the Congo met with provincial 
and, where necessary, national authorities to encourage them to take appropriate measures.

<p>perpetrated by armed groups during attacks on villages in Ufamandu I and II, Nyamaboko I and II, 
and Kibabi groupements, Masisi territory, North Kivu province, between April and September 2012, 
14 November 2012. In the report, the Office confirmed the arbitrary execution of at least 264 people, 
of whom 246 were killed by combatants from Ra&#239;a Mutomboki and Mai-Mai Kifuafua, and 18 were 
killed by combatants of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and Nyatura, 
between April and September 2012 in Ufamandu I and II, Nyamaboko I and II and Kibabi 
<i>groupements</i>, in Masisi territory, North Kivu province.

<p> 9 Report of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office on serious human rights violations 
committed by members of the Congolese defense and security forces in Kinshasa in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo between 26 November and 25 December 2011, March 2012 (available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/ReportDRC_26Nov_25Dec2011_en.pdf). </p>


<p><b> B. Torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>14. Recommendations previously made included that the Government should eliminate 
impunity for alleged acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment (ill-
treatment) by carrying out prompt, impartial and exhaustive investigations into all reported 
cases of torture and ill-treatment.10 Those convicted of such acts should receive sentences in 
accordance with the provisions of the law, and effective reparations should also be granted 
to victims, including adequate compensation.11 It was also recommended that the 
Government should also ensure that all persons reporting cases of torture and ill-treatment 
are protected from intimidation or reprisals for reporting such cases.12 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>15. The widespread use of torture and ill-treatment by defence and security forces in the 
country remains a major human rights concern. Most cases of torture and ill-treatment 
registered by the Joint Human Rights Office are perpetrated by members of the PNC, the 
National Intelligence Agency and FARDC. Certain FARDC members torture civilians 
considered to be deserters of the army or perceived to be cooperating with armed groups. In 
such cases, torture is often used to obtain confessions from suspects. Some victims reported 
having had their hands and feet tied while being beaten with different objects. In one 
emblematic case, in July 2012, five Rwandan nationals, including three minors, arbitrarily 
arrested and detained by FARDC soldiers in Goma for their alleged affiliation with M23 
were subjected to torture. One boy was beaten so severely that he had to be transported to 
the military hospital by the soldiers, where he was reported dead on arrival. 
</p>
<p>16. In a positive development witnessed during the period under review, the 
Government made progress in the application of the law criminalizing torture. Since the 
promulgation of the law on 9 July 2011, at least six FARDC soldiers, five PNC agents and 
one intelligence officer have been convicted for acts of torture to sentences ranging from 
six months to life imprisonment. In addition, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights 
conducted workshops and training sessions in different provinces to sensitize various 
actors, including defence and security forces, judicial authorities and civil society 
representatives, on the content and application of the anti-torture law.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to monitor and report on incidents of 
torture and ill-treatment throughout the country. It also continued to provide support to 
judicial authorities in the investigation and prosecution of alleged perpetrators of torture, 
and conducted high-level advocacy with Congolese authorities to encourage them to hold 
elements of the security forces accountable for acts of torture. In collaboration with the 
Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and civil society partners, the Office also organized 
awareness-raising activities for various groups on the anti-torture law. In addition, as part of 
the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, on 26 June 2012, the Office 
organized several outreach activities in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice and 
Human Rights in Kinshasa and in various provinces.

<p><b> C.  Arbitrary and illegal arrests and detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>18. It was recommended that the Government should restrict the number of security 
forces with the power of arrest and ensure that the police force remains the primary law 
enforcement agency.13 The Government should also ensure that procedures followed in the 
arrest and detention of persons comply with all provisions of article 9 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.14 It was also recommended that the Government set 
up a task force within the Ministry of Justice to combat arbitrary detentions and seek urgent 
ways of improving the situation of persons in detention.15 It was further recommended that 
the Government grant the Joint Human Rights Office and other independent mechanisms 
free access to all places of detention.16 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. Arbitrary and/or illegal arrests and detention remain a common practice throughout 
the country. PNC agents and FARDC members frequently arrest civilians without a 
warrant, and detain them without ever charging them or referring them to the competent 
judicial authorities. Civilians are often detained for political reasons, their ethnicity or their 
perceived collaboration with armed groups, or simply to extort money from them. In order 
to secure their release, civilians are regularly forced to pay bribes to police agents or other 
officials. The systematic use of violence during arrests by State agents across the country is 
also of particular concern. Moreover, the frequent absence of judicial review of such arrests 
and detentions further exacerbates a pattern of corruption within the security forces, who 
often believe their power can go unchecked. Victims of illegal arrests and detention rarely 
file complaints. 
</p>
<p>20. Despite provisions included in Security Council resolution 1756 (2007) and in 
subsequent relevant resolutions, and in recommendations made by human rights 
mechanisms to grant the United Nations access to all detention centres in the country, the 
Joint Human Rights Office still does not have full access to all detention facilities, 
particularly those run by the National Intelligence Agency and the Republican Guard. 
During the period under review, the Office was particularly concerned about the existence 
of two secret detention facilities allegedly set up by Colonel Jean-Marie Izumbu Lugeni 
(alias Igwe) of the 61st FARDC Infantry Brigade based in Kalemie, Tanganyika district, in 
Katanga province. The detention facilities were reportedly closed following the Colonel&#8217;s 
arrest on 26 November 2012. He was subsequently released on 17 December 2012, and his 
trial began before the Military Court of Lubumbashi on 19 February 2013, for various 
charges, including torture and arbitrary arrests. The accused is, however, currently at large.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to monitor and report on cases of arbitrary 
and/or illegal arrests and detentions. Daily human rights monitoring revealed that these are 
among the most common violations committed by the defence and security forces. 
Moreover, during the period under review, the Office documented an upsurge in arbitrary 
arrests and cases of torture and ill-treatment in detention by FARDC soldiers trying to

<p>obtain military information from civilians about armed groups, especially in North Kivu 
province.  
</p>
<p>22. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to conduct advocacy with Congolese 
authorities on measures to reduce illegal detentions, efforts that led to the release of 
numerous detainees. It also conducted awareness-raising workshops for police officers and 
other authorities about the rules on arrest and detention. For example, in March 2013, the 
Office trained more than 500 PNC agents in Mvula Matadi, Bas Congo province, on basic 
human rights principles, including the rights of detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>23. A recommendation was made that the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo should abolish all provisions of national law that discriminate against women.17 
The Government was also called on to establish and promote an effective mechanism to 
receive complaints of sexual violence, including at custodial facilities.18 The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights called on the Government to provide victims with 
psychological and medical care.19 It has been consistently recommended that the 
Government arrest and bring to justice members of the armed forces who perpetrate acts of 
sexual violence.20 Lastly, the State has been called on to pay damages to victims of sexual 
violence committed by State agents, and to create an adequate budgetary line for this 
purpose in the national budget.21 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>24. Sexual violence continues at appalling levels throughout the country. During the 
period under review, the Joint Human Rights Office observed an alarming increase in mass 
rape committed by armed groups and members of the Congolese army. In November 2012, 
after M23 took over Goma, FARDC soldiers retreated to Minova in South Kivu Province, 
where they committed mass rape and other human rights violations over a period of 10 
days.22 The Joint Human Rights Office also documented at least 59 cases of sexual violence 
committed between 20 November and 2 December 2012 by M23 members following their 
takeover of Goma. In addition, Mai-Mai Simba/Lumumba combatants also committed mass 
rape, including in Mambasa territory in Orientale Province, in June and November 2012, 
when they raped at least 110 women.23 These incidents demonstrate how the Congolese 
army and armed groups operating in the east have continued to use rape as a weapon of war 
to intimidate the population and to force it into subjugation, as well as to punish civilians 
for their perceived collaboration with the enemy.

 22 See the report of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office on human rights violations 
</p>
<p>perpetrated by soldiers of the Congolese Armed Forces and combatants of the M23 in Goma and 
Sake, North Kivu province, and in and around Minova, South Kivu province, from 15 November to 2 
December 2012, May 2013 (available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHROMay2013_en.pdf).  
</p>
<p> 23 See A/67/792&#8211;S/2013/149, para. 39. </p>


<p>25. As mentioned by the High Commissioner in her previous reports, most reported rape 
cases are not investigated and do not reach a court of law. In cases where the perpetrators 
are ordered to pay damages, the victim rarely, if ever, receives them. Perpetrators are often 
insolvent, and the State has still not allocated funds for reparations, while the execution of 
awards requires the payment of additional legal fees that often prohibit follow-up by 
victims. 
</p>
<p>26. In other developments regarding women&#8217;s rights, the submission by the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo of its combined sixth and seventh reports to the Committee on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women24 was a positive development 
in 2012. OHCHR is confident that the dialogue between the Committee and the State party 
will lead to further progress for the advancement of women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to monitor, and follow up and report on 
cases of sexual violence, including through the publication of reports, such as the report on 
human rights violations by FARDC soldiers and M23 combatants in Goma and Sake, North 
Kivu province, and in and around Minova, South Kivu province, from 15 November to 2 
December 2012.22 The Office also continued to provide support to judicial authorities to 
help them to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of sexual violence, including through 
the deployment of mobile court hearings in remote areas. In partnership with the Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Swedish International Development 
Agency (SIDA), the Office is implementing projects to improve access to justice for 
victims through legal assistance provided by national and international non-governmental 
organizations. During the period under review, a total of 1,449 victims of sexual violence 
were provided with legal assistance through the CIDA and SIDA projects, which resulted in 
235 court decisions. In partnership with the Government of Brazil, the Office also provided 
economic reintegration kits (usually comprising tools and supplies for the small business 
activity that beneficiaries have chosen and been trained in) and counselling and business 
training to victims of sexual violence.  
</p>
<p>28. Since the previous report of the High Commissioner, the Joint Human Rights Office 
has taken a number of steps to raise awareness among State agents and civil society on 
national laws against sexual violence. For example, in January 2013, the Office organized a 
training session on sexual violence monitoring for 40 PNC agents and 41 members of civil 
society, in Ango territory, Orientale province. In addition, during the period under review, 
the Office trained 350 magistrates on sexual violence laws and procedures. 
</p>
<p>29. The Joint Human Rights Office remains engaged with the Government i strategies to 
combat sexual violence; for instance, it continues to support the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
implement the national strategy to combat sexual and gender-based violence, and is part of 
a technical team, led by the Ministry of Gender, Family and Child Affairs, to discuss ways 
to improve mechanisms to address sexual violence. In a very positive development, on 30 
March 2012, the Prime Minister and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
Sexual Violence in Conflict signed a joint communiqu&#233;, which contained a list of the 
commitments made by the Government to tackle sexual violence, including the need to 
establish effective mechanisms to protect against sexual violence in conflict situations.

<p><b> E.  Situation of journalists, human rights defenders, victims and witnesses 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>30. At the universal periodic review, it was recommended that the Government develop 
a legal framework to protect and ensure the security of journalists, human rights defenders, 
and members of civil society and the political opposition.25 It was also recommended that 
Government should ensure that members of political parties, media and civil society are 
permitted to exercise freely their rights to freedoms of expression, association and peaceful 
assembly according to international standards.26  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>31. The situation of human rights defenders and journalists remains precarious, as they 
have been regularly intimidated and subjected to death threats, arbitrary arrest and other 
human rights violations by State agents and armed groups. For example, after the fall of 
Goma in November 2012, at least 19 human rights defenders and three journalists received 
death threats from M23 combatants after they had denounced the human rights violations 
committed by the group.  
</p>
<p>32. The Joint Human Rights Office is also particularly concerned by the delays in the 
appeal process, which started in July 2012, before the High Military Court in Kinshasa, in 
the case of assassination of the human rights defender Floribert Chebeya and his driver, 
Fid&#232;le Bazana. In June 2011, a military court in Kinshasa had found five senior police 
officers guilty of murdering Chebeya and Bazana in June 2010. The Office is following the 
proceedings closely to ensure that the trial complies with relevant international standards.  
</p>
<p>33. The Government&#8217;s efforts to protect victims and witnesses who testify in court 
remain insufficient. During the period under review, in several cases, the protection needs 
of victims and witnesses were neglected, and judicial authorities failed to properly protect 
such individuals against the threats they faced for testifying in court. As an example, the 
names of victims were read out loud during public hearings before the High Military Court 
in the case of General Kakwavu, who is accused for war crimes and crimes against 
humanity.  
</p>
<p>34. Despite several recommendations made by civil society and other actors, the draft 
law on the protection of human rights defenders has been pending before Parliament since 
27 May 2011, apparently because it was not part of its priorities. Furthermore, the 
protection cell established by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights for human rights 
defenders in 201127 lacks the powers and resources to function effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>35. Throughout the period under review, the Joint Human Rights Office followed 
closely the cases of human rights violations against journalists, human rights defenders and 
victims and witnesses of human rights violations. It continued to provide targeted 
protection assistance to victims and witnesses of serious human rights violations who faced 
the risk of reprisals for testifying and participating in sensitive trials for serious crimes, as 
well as to human rights defenders at risk owing to their work. The Office also provided 
judicial authorities with advice on appropriate measures to protect victims during 
investigations and trials. It also participated in training sessions and awareness-raising

<p>activities for officials, such as administrative personnel, military police and judicial 
authorities, on the rights of victims, witnesses and human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> F.  Public liberties and elections 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>36. Recalling with concern the cases of threats and violence reported during the 
presidential and legislative elections, including against members of civil society and human 
rights defenders, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 19/27, recommended that the 
Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should hold free and fair elections 
with all due respect for the rights of all parties to freedom of expression, assembly and 
opinion. A number of recommendations were also made thereon in the report of the United 
Nations Joint Human Rights Office on serious human rights violations committed by 
members of the Congolese defence and security forces in Kinshasa during the electoral 
period (November 2011), published jointly with MONUSCO.28  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>37. The elections in 2011 were held in a context of violence, involving clashes between 
various political actors and during which serious human rights violations were committed 
by State agents across the country. Between 1 October 2011 and 31 January 2012, the Joint 
Human Rights Office documented 345 human rights violations linked to the electoral 
process, involving 769 victims: at least 41 civilians were killed, 168 injured and/or 
mistreated and 400 people subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. The Office also 
documented 26 violations of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, 48 violations of the 
right to freedom of expression and 18 violations of the right to freedom of the press. The 
Congolese defence and security forces were found to be responsible for more than half of 
the human rights violations documented by the Office. The most serious violations were 
reported in Kinshasa and Kasai Oriental. 
</p>
<p>38. Despite high-level advocacy by different national and international actors, including 
the Joint Human Rights Office, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
has largely failed to address the human rights violations committed in the context of the 
2011 elections. More than a year and a half after the elections, very few of the human rights 
violations documented by the Office have resulted in an investigation or prosecution. None 
of the agents of the National Intelligence Agency or of the Republican Guard reportedly 
involved in human rights violations committed in the context of the elections has been 
arrested or prosecuted.29  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>39. During the pre-election and election periods, the Joint Human Rights Office 
strengthened monitoring at its headquarters in Kinshasa and through its 18 field offices. In 
the months leading up to the elections, it carried out awareness-raising activities, in 
collaboration with partners, for more than 10,000 people throughout the country. In 
November 2011, the Office established a free hotline, active around the clock, every day of 
the week, for civilians wishing to report election-related human rights violations, and

</p>
<p>committed by members of the Congolese defense and security forces (see footnote 9).  </p>


<p>provided financial support to the hotline run by the national network of non-governmental 
human rights organizations, RENADHOC.  
</p>
<p>40. The Joint Human Rights Office provided support to judicial authorities in charge of 
investigating election-related human rights violations, and published two reports on them.30 
Since the elections, the Office has conducted high-level advocacy with local, provincial and 
national authorities to follow up on the status of investigations and recommendations made 
in the reports. Impunity for election-related human rights abuses has, however, prevailed 
owing to the limited action taken by the authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> G.  Violations of economic, social and cultural rights and the illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>exploitation of natural resources 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has made various 
recommendations that the Government should take comprehensive measures to address the 
issue of illegal exploitation of natural resources and to increase transparency in its revenue 
collection.31 It recommended that the Government should review, without delay, all mining 
contracts and repeal any that are detrimental to the Congolese people; that the Government 
should adopt measures to control the export of minerals and impose drastic sanctions on 
those involved in the illicit trade of natural resources; and that it ensure that revenues 
derived from natural resources are used to improve basic services and infrastructure so that 
living conditions may be improved.32  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>42. Throughout the period under review, many resource-rich areas, mostly in Orientale 
province, the Kivus and northern Katanga, bore witness to human rights violations, 
including forced labour linked to the illegal exploitation of such resources, allegedly 
committed by both armed groups and State agents. A series of attacks by armed groups 
were launched in March 2012, spreading terror and clearing the above-mentioned areas of 
their populations. As an example, human rights violations were committed against civilians, 
including the rape of more than 110 women and the abduction of at least 100 civilians, in 
the scope of attacks by Mai-Mai Simba/Lumumba33 in Mambasa territory, Orientale 
province. Other serious human rights violations were also committed by armed groups to 
facilitate the exploitation of natural resources. The Joint Human Rights Office documented 
a large number of cases of abduction of civilians and of forced labour by armed groups. A 
significant number of abductions, particularly by combatants of the Allied Democratic 
Forces, were reported in Beni territory, North Kivu province. Many abductees were forced 
to take part in such activities as timber cutting, gold mining and agricultural production for 
the benefit of the armed group. 
</p>
<p>43. State agents were also implicated in mineral trafficking and often used their position 
of power to shield themselves from accountability; for example, in September 2012,

</p>
<p> 31 E/C.12/COD/CO/4, para. 13. 
 32 Ibid. 
 33 The Mai-Mai Simba/Lumumba militia, led by a former poacher known as Captain Morgan, moved in 
</p>
<p>March 2012 to the resource-rich Mambasa, where it has sought to spread terror among the civilian 
population and illegally exploit natural resources. </p>


<p>Dieudonn&#233; Kasongo Kabila (alias General Kasongo), half-brother to Laurent Desire Kabila, 
ordered in Lubumbashi the arbitrary arrest, illegal detention and ill-treatment of three anti-
fraud agents, a magistrate and a police agent who had intercepted a truck transporting 
minerals as part of traffic in which he was allegedly involved. Although a judicial inquiry 
has been opened against him, he has yet to be arrested. 
</p>
<p>44. Mining trading centres, established by the Government to ensure the traceability of 
minerals, were suspended on 18 December 2012 owing to insecurity and the rivalry 
between holders of mining titles and artisanal miners. Thousands of artisanal miners are 
engaged in illegal mining. The Government has yet to put in place an effective system that 
would allow for the certification of origin and ensure the traceability of minerals, as well as 
regularize the working conditions of artisanal miners. 
</p>
<p>45. The continued failure of the State to curb illegal mining and the complicity of 
FARDC and, in many cases, other State agents is a key factor in the State&#8217;s lack of the 
funds required for it to comply with its minimum core obligations under the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very 
least, essential foodstuffs, essential primary health care, basic shelter and housing and the 
most basic forms of education.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Joint Human Rights Office continued to monitor and investigate human rights 
violations linked to the illegal exploitation of natural resources, and to share the findings 
with Congolese authorities. Moreover, MONUSCO continued to encourage the authorities 
to deploy sufficient and professional security forces to the conflict areas to track down 
those responsible for illegal exploitation and to hold them to account. During the period 
under review, MONUSCO and the Ministry of Mines pursued efforts to mediate between 
mining title holders and artisanal miners in North Kivu. MONUSCO continued to support 
the process of tagging minerals and validating mining sites in the eastern part of the State to 
determine whether mines were controlled by armed groups and whether human rights were 
respected.  
</p>
<p><b> H.  Administration of justice and the fight against impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>47. Numerous recommendations have been made to encourage the Government to 
reform the judicial system, to improve access to justice and to fight impunity. At the 
universal periodic review, it was recommended that the Government should establish a 
vetting process for its security forces with the aim of preventing the recruitment of 
individuals who have committed gross human rights violations.34 The Committee against 
Torture recommended that the Government should ensure that military courts only try 
members of the military for military offences, in accordance with the applicable 
international norms.35 At the universal periodic review, it was recommended that legislation 
should be enacted to give effect to the Rome Statute,36 and that sufficient funds be allocated 
for the administration of justice and a comprehensive plan be developed for training 
judges.37 The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 19/27, recommended that the

 35 CAT/C/DRC/CO/1, para. 9. 
 36 A/HRC/13/8, para. 96 (14). 
 37 Ibid.  </p>


<p>Government should also establish a national human rights commission in accordance with 
the relevant international principles. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Action taken by the Government and current situation 
</b></p>
<p>48. Some positive developments were registered in the fight against impunity, some of 
which resulted from activities conducted with the support of the Joint Human Rights 
Office. The developments included the conviction by the South Kivu military court, in May 
2012, of 15 FARDC officers who had deserted the Congolese army in April 2012 in an 
attempt to join M23, many of whom had extensive records of human rights violations.38. 
Another development was the surrender to the International Criminal Court, in March 2013, 
of General Bosco Ntaganda. Judicial investigations are also ongoing against Mai-Mai 
Simba/Lumumba combatants for serious human rights violations committed between 
March 2012 and March 2013 in several localities of Mambasa territory. Approximately 20 
Mai-Mai combatants are currently detained and awaiting trial at the central prison of Bunia.  
</p>
<p>49. A lack of progress was, however, noted with regard to several cases of mass rape 
and other serious human rights violations documented by the Joint Human Rights Office. 
For instance, no development was observed in investigations into the mass rape and other 
human rights violations committed, at the end of December 2010 and in early January 
2011, in Bushani and Kalambahiro, in Masisi territory, North Kivu.39 Despite advocacy by 
MONUSCO and the Joint Human Rights Office with regard to the mass rape and other 
human rights violations committed in Minova,40 to date only two low-ranking soldiers have 
been charged with rape and, while 12 FARDC officers have been suspended, none of them 
has yet been arrested. Furthermore, numerous escapes from prisons and holding cells are 
undermining efforts of the judiciary to fight impunity. The deplorable living conditions of 
detainees and the lack of sufficient prison personnel prompt riots and prison escapes. 
During the occupation of Goma by M23 in November 2012, all detainees of the prison 
escaped, including an FARDC major, the only defendant in the Walikale mass rape trial of 
July-August 2010.41 The destruction of judicial files at the North Kivu military court in 
Goma, in November 2012, was another major setback for the judiciary in its efforts to 
combat impunity.  
</p>
<p>50. After a period of stagnation, some progress was made in the prosecution of two of 
the five army officers whose names were on a list given to the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo by members of the Security Council during their visit in 
May 2009. The trial of General Kakwavu for war crimes and crimes against humanity 
resumed before the High Military Court in Kinshasa on 19 April 2013. Lieutenant Colonel 
Bedi Mobuli Engangela (alias Colonel 106), who has been accused of war crimes and 
</p>
<p>  
 38 Thirteen of the accused who were present at the trial were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two 
</p>
<p>years to life imprisonment, while two were sentenced in absentia to the death penalty<i>. </i>Three officers 
were acquitted. 
</p>
<p> 39 See the report of the investigation missions of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office into the 
mass rapes and other human rights violations committed in the villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro, 
in Masisi territory, North Kivu, on 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011, July 2011 (available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHROReportMassRapesBushani_en.pdf). 
</p>
<p> 40 See the report of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office on human rights violations 
perpetrated by soldiers of the Congolese Armed Forces and combatants of the M23 in Goma and 
Sake, North Kivu province, and in and around Minova (see footnote 22).  
</p>
<p> 41 See the final report of the fact-finding missions of the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office into 
the mass rapes and other human rights violations committed by a coalition of armed groups along the 
Kibua-Mpofi axis in Walikale territory, North Kivu, from 30 July to 2 August 2010, July 2011

www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/BCNUDHRapportViolsMassifsKibuaMpofi_en.pdf).  </p>


<p>crimes against humanity, was transferred on 2 April 2013 from Kinshasa to Bukavu prison 
with the support of MONUSCO. The Military Court of South Kivu is in the process of 
completing the investigation phase, and Colonel Engangela will stand trial in 2013.  
</p>
<p>51. In spite of pledges made by the Government to adopt legislation to implement the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the relevant bill has been pending before 
Parliament since 2008. In a positive development, on 4 May 2013, the President 
promulgated the new organic law on the organization, functioning and competence of 
courts of the Judicial Order. The new law extends to the Appeals Courts42 and jurisdiction 
over the crime of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  
</p>
<p>52. In addition, although the OHCHR mapping report43 recommended a holistic 
approach to transitional justice in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including tools 
for vetting the security services for their human rights records, and judicial and non-judicial 
transitional justice mechanisms, the current Government has not yet identified the steps that 
it needs to take to that end. The rise of M23, composed of former rebels who joined the 
national army in 2009 and deserted in April 2012, reflect the dramatic consequences of the 
lack of action taken in this regard.  
</p>
<p>53. In a positive development, however the Government recently reiterated its intention 
not to grant amnesties to perpetrators of violations of human rights law and international 
humanitarian law in the context of ongoing negotiations with various armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Action taken by the Joint Human Rights Office 
</b></p>
<p>54. Judicial authorities continued to benefit from the support of MONUSCO and of the 
Joint Human Rights Office in the conduct of investigations and the organization of mobile 
hearings, especially in the eastern part of the country. In this regard, the Office undertook 
several joint missions with judicial authorities during the period under review, including for 
the Minova case,44 for which MONUSCO provided support for the deployment of judicial 
investigators to the affected villages.  
</p>
<p>55. The Joint Human Rights Office also continued to advocate at the highest level for 
the prosecution of FARDC and PNC members accused of human rights violations and, in 
that respect, held several meetings with the relevant authorities.  
</p>
<p>56. In compliance with the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support 
to non-United Nations security forces,45 the Joint Human Rights Office continued to screen 
FARDC battalion commanders and PNC agents for past human rights violations as a 
condition for any support provided by MONUSCO or by the United Nations country team 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>  
 42 To date, only military courts with jurisdiction over such serious crimes were empowered to prosecute 
</p>
<p>civilians and members of the military charged with these crimes.

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The period under review was marked by an escalation in armed conflict in the 
east and a resulting dramatic increase in the number of human rights violations. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Democratic Republic of the Congo still faces major challenges in implementing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by United Nations human rights mechanisms and OHCHR, 
</b></p>
<p><b>for two main reasons: lack of capacity, and the limited engagement of the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>to hold perpetrators of human rights abuses to account. It is essential that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government establish reliable vetting mechanisms to ensure that human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>abusers are not maintained within or integrated into the security forces. Without 
</b></p>
<p><b>background checks on individuals wishing to join FARDC or measures to enforce 
</b></p>
<p><b>discipline and to hold human rights abusers to account, all initiatives by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government and its partners to reform the security sector are significantly 
</b></p>
<p><b>undermined if not doomed to failure.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>As stated by the High Commissioner in her previous reports, despite some 
progress in prosecuting some high-profile perpetrators, the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains structurally weak. The lack of independence of the judiciary continued to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed, in particular when dealing with cases of political opponents and members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>civil society. In addition, current initiatives in the field of transitional justice should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>coordinated to ensure their complementarity and to avoid creating contradictions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal loopholes.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The High Commissioner welcomes the steps taken by the Government to 
implement some of the recommendations made by United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms and her Office, including progress towards establishing the national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights commission, and commends </b>the Government&#8217;s collaboration with the 
</p>
<p><b>Joint Human Rights Office and United Nations human rights machinery. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Speed up reform of the justice sector, including by increasing budget 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocations, and establish the judicial and non-judicial mechanisms necessary to 
</b></p>
<p><b>redress the massive human rights abuses committed throughout the country; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Establish, as a matter of utmost urgency, adequate vetting mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>as part of security sector reform;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c)  Ensure that the future national human rights commission is provided 
</b></p>
<p><b>with appropriate financial and logistical capacity support needed for its effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>functioning, in accordance with the Paris Principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Increase budget allocations to health, education and social services in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to improve the living conditions of the Congolese people in view of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>realization of their economic, social and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Create, in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</b></p>
<p><b>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
</b></p>
<p><b>and with the assistance of the Subcommittee on</b> <b>the Prevention of Torture and Other </b></p>


<p><b>Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a national preventive 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism independent of the Government;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f)  Adopt legislation on international crimes, including legislation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Extend a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>holders, and provide detailed responses to the communications sent by them. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> In view of the above recommendations, the Human Rights Council should 
continue to be seized of the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Congo.
