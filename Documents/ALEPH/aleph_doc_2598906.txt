Cautionary Statement on Forward Looking Statements 
 
This management’s discussion and analysis contains statements about expected future events and financial 
and operating results of the Company that are forward looking. By their nature, forward looking statements 
require the Company to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. These forward 
looking  statements  are  based  on  current  expectations.  There  is  substantial  risk  that  forward  looking 
statements will not prove to be accurate. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company’s 
forward  looking  statements  as  a  number  of  factors  including  economic  conditions,  technological  change, 
regulatory change, and competitive factors, could cause actual future results, conditions, actions or events to 
differ  materially  from  targets,  expectations,  estimates  or  intentions  expressed  in  the  forward  looking 
statements; many of which are beyond the Company’s control.   
 
Highlights 
 
The Company achieved the following milestones from 2012 through mid-2016: 
  A $318,000 equity financing of the Company was completed on August 25, 2016 enabling the Company
to clear third party debt and commence exploration.
  Expanded  the  Shining  Tree  Property  by  over  50%  with  new  options  and  claim  purchases  increasing
exposure to high potential ground near former Ronda Mine workings.
  Advanced the Shining Tree Gold property to the discovery stage with the identification of significant gold 
grain counts in soil along a nine kilometre length of a shear zone. Concentrated till sampling has now 
identified over 30 high gold count anomalies. The outlined gold dispersion train is one of the larger such 
anomalies in the Province of Ontario and it is largely untested by drilling.
  Conducted an internal assessment of the gold mineralization outlined by drilling in the Herrick gold deposit
summarized herein. An independent valuation has been commenced.

  A 9km IP survey conducted in February and March, 2012 outlined numerous anomalies associated with
the high gold grain counts in till. 
Initial  drilling  assessment  of  gold  in  till  targets  has  identified  a  syenite  porphyry  gold  environment 
associated with the gold in till and IP anomalies Following which a comprehensive internal summary report 
on the Shining Tree property was completed and filed in June, 2012.
  An exploration plan and permit under the New Mining Act in Ontario have been filed and accepted. The
  The Tib Lake property was sold to Lac des Iles Mines Ltd., a subsidiary of North American Palladium for
permit covers up to 20,000m of drilling.
$25,000 plus a 0.5% Net Smelter Royalty.
 

  The Ivanhoe property was sold to Probe Mines for $100,000, 50,000 shares of Probe Mines and a retained
1.5% NSR royalty; subsequently the royalty was sold to Probe Mines for $50,000. 
In August, 2014, Platinex negotiated an option to acquire the Nabish lake Ni-Cu-PGE prospect. 
In January, 2015 the CRA Appeals Division accepted the Company’s position and therefore the Company 
has reversed the estimated shareholder indemnification liability of $633,071 and has adjusted the Part 
XII.6 tax accordingly (refer Provisions section page 12).
  Extended time to make advance royalty payments on Shining Tree property to 2018 and made favourable
changes to buyback schedule on advance royalties.

PLATINEX INC. 
Management’s Discussion & Analysis   
For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 
 
Overview of Company 
 
The Company was incorporated on August 12, 1998 under the laws of the Province of Ontario and trades on 
the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol “PTX”.  The Company is at the exploration and evaluation stage 
and is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of properties for the mining of precious and 
base metals. The Company is in the process of exploring its resource properties for mineral resources and 
has not determined whether the properties contain economically recoverable reserves. Recovery of amounts 
reported  for  mineral  properties  and  related  deferred  expenditures  is  dependent  upon  the  existence  of 
economically recoverable reserves, confirmation of the Company’s interest in the underlying mineral claims, 
the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing to conduct exploration and the ability of the Company 
to recover value for its properties and/or upon future profitable production. 
 
The  business  of  mining  and  exploring  for  minerals  involves  a  high  degree  of  risk  and  there  can  be  no 
assurance that current exploration programs will result in profitable mining operations. Recoverability of the 
carrying value of exploration properties and the Company’s continued existence are dependent upon the 
preservation of its interest in the underlying properties, the discovery of economically recoverable reserves 
and the development and/or sale of such properties at a profit.
The Company has limited financial resources and no operating cash flow.  Until profitable production can be 
reached, the Company is dependent on debt or equity financings and/or the sale, lease or farm-out of assets 
to provide the funds necessary for the Company’s operating and capital expenditures.  Although the  
Company has been successful in the past in obtaining requisite funding, there can be no assurance that 
additional funding in amounts and on terms satisfactory to the Company will be available on a timely basis to 
fund  the  further  exploration  and  development  of  its  properties  or  to  fulfill  its  obligations  under  applicable 
agreements. Failure to obtain such funding has resulted in delays and could in the future result in the delay 
or indefinite postponement of further exploration and development of the Company’s properties and in the 
possible dilution or loss of interests in such properties.  If the Company raises additional funding through the 
issue of equity securities, such financings may dilute the holdings of the Company’s existing shareholders. 
 
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to the properties on which it is conducting exploration 
and in which it has an interest, in accordance with industry standards for the current stage of development of 
such  properties  these  procedures  do  not  guarantee  the  Company’s  title.  Property  title  may  be  subject  to 
government  licensing  requirements  or  regulations,  unregistered  prior  agreements,  unregistered  claims, 
aboriginal claims, breakdown in law and order, arbitrary and punitive actions of governments and their failure 
to comply with their own laws and regulations.
In order to sustain its operations, the Company requires additional funds to discharge its liabilities, conduct 
work programs and meet overhead expenses. The Company continues to seek capital through various means 
including farm-out / joint venture partnerships and the issuance of equity or debt. Although the Company has 
been successful in the past in financing its activities through the sale of equity securities, current market 
conditions have adversely affected the Company’s share price and its ability to finance planned activities and 
operations. 
 
Overall Performance and Market Conditions
The Company is in the exploration stage on its various properties and therefore it has no revenues to fund 
such activities.  The Company accesses the public markets to finance exploration activity; the ability to raise 
additional  capital  is  subject  to  prevailing  market  conditions.    The  projects  do  not  have  a  defined  mineral 
resource  in  place  whereby  the  Company  can  establish  a  measured  asset  value.  However,  based  on 
independent NI 43-101 technical reports and / or internal summary reports prepared on Company properties 
and adjacent properties, further exploration work is warranted. 
 
The market decline has made it very difficult to finance property exploration through issuance of equity.  Many 
junior mining companies trade at a significant discount to the underlying book value of their net assets. In 
order to attract investment it is necessary for a company to distinguish itself from its competitors.

Overall Performance and Market Conditions – continued 
 
Therefore, the Company is focusing on completing a financing to continue exploration of the Shining Tree 
Gold property (described under Properties), which has significant exploration potential.  To-date sixty six holes 
have  targeted  the  Herrick  deposit  in  addition  to  stripping,  trenching,  geophysical  surveys  and  geological 
mapping.  All holes drilled to date have intersected gold mineralization in the Central Zone, confirming the 
existence of a large structural gold system.   
 
Specialized soil sampling on the property has revealed persistent high gold values spatially aligned along a 9 
km east west composite shear structure tentatively identified as the Larder Lake Break or an associated splay. 
The gold in soil occurrences is interpreted to indicate the presence of one or more gold deposits which may 
be located on the Company’s property.  Exploration to locate these deposits will continue upon completion of 
financing. This is a provincially significant glacial gold dispersion train in terms of size and intensity and is 
highly prospective. Such large scale features may lead to discovery of commercial gold deposits. 
  
Management is optimistic that with progressive exploration the gold in till anomalies on the Shining Tree 
property and the Herrick gold deposit will evolve into significant commercial gold deposits. Subject to the 
availability  of  financing,  the  Company  plans  to  commence  a  20,000m  drill  program  in  2015  to  test  these 
targets. 
 
In April 2011, the Company vested its interest in the main portion of the Shining Tree property and in March, 
2012 the McBride lease within the claim group was acquired. In June 2012 a summary report on the Shining 
Tree property which includes an assessment of mineralization in the Herrick gold deposit was published. 
 
In  2012  new  regulations  were  posted  for  the  New  Mining  Act  in  Ontario.  The  new  regulations  require  a 
structured approach to prospecting and exploration such that for each property a company must apply for 
acceptance of a multi-year exploration plan for area specific work on the ground. 
 
Further for more intensive work such as drilling, an exploration permit must be granted by the Ministry of 
Northern Development, Mines and Forests.  Local land owners and First Nations where traditional territories 
overlap the property must be consulted as part of the permitting process. 
 
Platinex had its exploration plan accepted and its exploration permit granted in August and September, 2013 
respectively with the strong support of the Mattagami First Nation and the Matachewan First Nation. The 
permit covers a three year period in which the company intends to carry out at least 20,000m of drilling. The 
permit may also be renewed if warranted through repeating the application process. 
 
The Company holds a property with potential for base metals in the Ring of Fire area. Since this property was 
staked a major chromium discovery, believed to be the largest known chromium deposit in the world, has 
been discovered in this area. One of North America’s largest integrated steel companies, Cliffs Resources, 
acquired a controlling interest in two resource companies with properties in the Ring of Fire and planned to 
develop these properties and bring both permanent road and rail transportation into the area. Due to the lack 
of decisions, by the Province of Ontario, on access infrastructure and poorer market conditions Cliffs, has 
shut its Canadian offices and has sold its assets in the Ring of Fire. 
 
Statements have been made by some of the federal and provincial politicians that this is the most significant 
discovery in Canada in the last 100 years. In addition Noront Resources has released results of drilling the 
Eagle One deposit in the Ring of Fire intrusion. They revealed a combined resource of over 20 million tonnes 
of high grade Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization. This is a significant discovery. 
 
In February 2015, two blocks of claims on the South McFaulds property comprising 112 claim units for 1,696ha 
expired leaving one claim block with 480ha in good standing. 
 
In August, 2014 Platinex negotiated an option to acquire the Nabish Lake Ni-Cu-PGE prospect.

Properties 
 
The  Company  maintains  an  interest  in  several  large  gold  and  PGE  properties.  Each  property  requires 
assessment  work  to  keep  it  in  good  standing.  Work  may  involve  airborne  geophysical  surveys,  ground 
geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveys with line-cutting and drilling.  
 
The properties are described below:
a)  Shining Tree Gold Property
In 2011 the Company vested an option agreement with Skead Holdings Ltd., with respect to 139 claim 
units (5,680 acres or 2,299 ha), situated in Churchill, MacMurchy and Asquith Townships in Ontario (the 
“Shining Tree property”).  The Company now holds a 100% interest in the claims subject to a 3% NSR and 
advance royalty payments of $73,000 on April 11, 2018 and $10,000 per year commencing on April 2019.  
Further  Platinex  may  after  making  the  $73,000  payment  eliminate  the  requirement  for  future  advance 
royalty payments by making a one-time advance royalty payment of $100,000.  The 139 claim units have 
been placed in a trust and will revert to Skead Holdings Ltd. should the Company fail to make the $73,000 
advance royalty payment due in April 2018.  Conversely, upon the Company making the $73,000 payment 
the claims will be released from trust to the Company.  In two thirds of the 3% NSR may be reduced by 
payment of: $75,000 for each one-quarter percent for the first one-half percent; $150,000 for each one-
quarter percent for the second one-half percent; $250,000 for each one-quarter percent for the third one-
half per cent, and; $400,000 for each one-quarter percent for the final one-half percent ($1.75 million in 
aggregate). If Skead Holdings Ltd wishes to sell the residual royalty interest the Company retains a right 
of first refusal to purchase the NSR.  On May 10, 2012 the Company acquired a lease (40 acres, 16 ha) 
from Gary John McBride for 200,000 shares of the Company.  The lease is central to the Shining Tree 
property. 
 
The  Company  entered  into  two  agreements  in  August  2016  which  significantly  expand  the  size  and 
potential of its Shining Tree gold property. Both agreements are subject to regulatory approval. 
 
Platinex has entered into an option agreement with Skead Holdings Ltd. and Ashley Gold Mines Limited, 
with  respect 
in 
Ontario.  Platinex has the right to acquire a 100%-interest in the 48 claim units and 50% interest in a further 
8 claim units (896 ha or 2,240 acres), subject to a 2% NSR, by issuing 200,000 shares of Platinex, and by 
making  cash  payments  (or  share  equivalent)  of  $95,000  and  by  incurring  property  expenditures  of 
$500,000 during the ensuing four-year period to August 17, 2020. 
 
Platinex has also entered into an agreement with two prospectors to purchase 100% interest in four claims 
comprising  20  claim  units  (320  ha  or  800  acres)  in  Churchill,  MacMurchy  and  Asquith  Townships,  in 
Ontario by issuing 400,000 shares of Platinex. 
 
The property acquisition has encircled the former producing Ronda Gold Mine and enhances the Shining 
Tree property exposure to the intersection of a major east-west gold bearing structure and a north-south 
fault.  The  combined  property  created  by  the  acquisitions  comprises  216  claim  units  (3,456  ha  (8,640 
acres)). 
 
The  Company  SEDAR-filed  its  NI  43-101  technical report  dated  October  2,  2008,  by  J.G.  Bryant  and 
D. Jamieson (the “Report”) which examines the Herrick gold deposit on the Shining Tree property and 
seven other known gold prospects, some of which have been explored underground. The Report qualifies 
the sampling and drilling work by Unocal (1989) and Fort Knox (1990) compliant with NI 43-101 standards. 
 
The property is underlain by a northwest trending, steeply dipping, sequence of felsic to mafic metavolcanic 
rocks overlain by Temiskaming aged metasedimentary rocks and intruded by irregular trachyte porphyries 
and syenite stocks of Early Precambrian age.

b)  Herrick Deposit 
 
Shining Tree’s Herrick deposit was discovered in 1918 and subsequently was developed by a 94 m shaft 
with 345 m of lateral development on two veins. In 1989 Unocal Ltd. evaluated the historic data and, based 
on that, stated a potential for the system to carry 5,716 tonnes per vertical metre at 7.2 g/t Au over a width 
of 1.8 m (400 ounces per vertical foot), Unocal carried out diamond drilling of 11 holes for 1,473m and 
collected 201 channel samples and 35 composite grab samples on the Herrick vein. In 1990 Fort Knox 
Gold  Inc.  followed  this  work  with  45  further  channel  samples  and  confirmed  the  presence  of  gold 
mineralization over a 385 m strike length, obtaining samples grading up to 56.5 g/t Au over 1.0 m.  
 
The  Report  states  that,  “Judging  from  evidence  of  previous  results  on  the  Herrick  deposit  there  is  a     
potential to outline a small commercial gold deposit. On a larger scale the bulk of the property may be at 
the low temperature top of an epithermal system that could well be associated with a world-class gold 
deposit at depth.”   
 
Gold geologists recognize that the Shining Tree property is located on the westward extension of the 
Cadillac  Malartic/Larder  fault  systems  that  are  associated  with  several  gold  deposits  that  contained 
between 10 and 30 million ounces of gold.  Moreover, the least explored southwestern Abitibi has received 
additional attention in recent years resulting in the discovery of some of the larger gold deposits in the 
Abitibi region on three sides of the Shining Tree property. 
 
An  internal  valuation  of  the  Herrick  deposit  completed  in  May,  2012  estimated  potential  gold  content 
ranging from 111,000 oz to 172,000 oz Au within the defined vein structures to a depth of 300m.  The 
estimate is based on a minimum of 1,628,000 tonnes grading 2.11g/tonne to a maximum of 2,554,000 
tonnes grading 2.10g/tonne Au.  The estimate is derived from 3 narrow sub-parallel quartz vein breccias 
and an enclosing mineralized shear zone within a 380m strike length, to a 300m depth and within a 60m 
wide block.  A cutoff grade of 0.5g/tonne was used in the calculations. 
 
The  central  zone  of  the  Herrick  deposit  outcrops  for  most  of  its  length  and  is  a  continuously  readily 
definable body. The valuation also identified thicker gold zones between intersecting veins in some holes 
and in outcrops which are not included in the calculations.  These structures plunge vertically providing a 
prospective target for deeper exploration.  There is an undefined potential for a southwesterly plunging 
thickened enriched section that could contain from a depth of 300m to 1,500m some 14.6 million tonnes 
at a grade ranging from 2.0 to 5.0g/tonne Au for a gold content of 1.0 to 2.4 million ounces.  The potential 
quantity and grade is conceptual in nature.  There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral 
resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the delineation of a mineral resource.  The 
internal valuation was conducted by a qualified person who is not independent of the issuer and therefore 
according to standards set forth in National Instrument 43-101 no resource estimate is available. More 
sampling  of  existing  core  and  stripping  of  identified  thicker  mineralized  zones  where  these  project  to 
surface, is warranted and could increase the potential within the exploration envelope. 
 
Along the 380m length of the Herrick Central Zone 72 channel and composite grab sample sections have 
averaged 6.99 g/t Au / 1.9m true width.  Drilling of the same zone to a depth of 300m below surface in 59 
drill holes has averaged 2.16 g/t Au / 2.9 m true width.  The mineralized zone appears to be thickening at 
depth with zone widths of up to 46.1 m recorded in drilling. 
 
Platinex has commissioned an independent valuation of the Herrick deposit.
5
c)  Gold In Glacial Till 
 
Since October 2008, the Company has carried out an exploration program on the property.  Particular 
interest is focused on 446 samples recovered from basal till that have been processed by Overburden 
Drilling  Management.    Many  of  the  samples  contain  pristine  gold  grains  indicating  a  nearby  bedrock 
source.  In addition, 169 samples each returned more than ten gold grains (up to 144 gold grains in one 
sample) that suggest several nearby previously unexplored gold occurrences in the bedrock.
Noticeably a line of the highest counts was obtained along 9 km easterly trending shear believed to be 
the Larder Lake Break or an associated splay fault and correlating with XDS ORTHO anomalies and 
circumscribing a syenite stock.  In fact a pattern that has resulted from recognition of the syenite stock is 
that the better gold grain counts tend to correlate with the observed margins of the syenite stock. The 
occurrence, distribution and density of high gold counts are similar to such patterns over the Timmins and 
Matachewan gold camps. The Company views this result as the initial step in locating and identifying one 
or more major gold deposits, potentially leading to a new major gold camp. 
 
Gold is the best pathfinder to gold, intuitively providing the most direct path to a significant discovery. Less 
direct indicators of gold including other geochemical, geophysical and geological expressions are less 
reliable indicators of gold in the ground.  Not all major gold deposits in glaciated terrains provide evidence 
of their existence through gold dispersion trains. However, gold dispersion trains are always pathfinders 
to sources of gold in place and major gold dispersion trains are either associated with major gold deposits 
or multiple spatially concentrated gold deposits. This is the promise of the Shining Tree property.

d)  Exploration by the Company
The exploration program in 2008 and 2009 included an airborne geophysical survey, till sampling, and 26 
drill holes for a total of 1,270 m of diamond drilling.  In 2010 a comprehensive program of drilling on the 
Herrick deposit (23 holes for 4,253m) till sampling, and stripping was carried out to further evaluate the 
potential  of  the  property.  A  substantial  program  of  channel  sampling  was  carried  out  on  the  Caswell 
prospect.  In 2011 three holes for 930m were drilled on the Herrick deposit and seven holes for 1,070m 
was carried out to test the Caswell trenches.  Several good results were obtained including an assay of 
18.75g/Au over 0.5m within a broader zone assaying 4.5g/t over 2.52m. 
 
In  2010 the Company retrieved documents revealing results of testing near the old Westree or Caswell 
mine workings of its Shining Tree claim group in which a trench was bulk sampled in 1975 with 551 lbs 
(250.5kg) of vein material returning 2.960 oz/ton gold (101.3 g/t) and 1206.41 oz/ton silver (41,271.3 g/t) 
and 572 lbs (260.0 kg) of wall rock material returning 0.224 oz/ton Au (7.7 g/t) and 368.9 oz/ton silver 
(12,620.1  g/t).   A  second  bulk  sample  consisting  of  1742  pounds  (791.8  kg)  of  vein  material  taken 
approximately 125 feet (38.1m) west of the first sample returned 32.77oz./ton silver (1120.7g/t) and trace 
gold.  A 100 lb (45.45kg) grab sample of muck and rock taken from the trench between these samples 
returned 2.033 oz./ton gold (69.53g/t) and 1.08 oz./ton silver (36.94g/t). These results have been verified 
but require qualification. Stripping was carried out in the autumn of 2010 and drilling of seven holes was  
completed  for  1,070m  in  April  2011.  All  of  the  holes  intersected  gold  mineralization  with  one  hole 
intersecting a potentially commercial value. A nine km Pole-dipole IP survey was completed in March 2012 
by JVX Ltd.  Following the IP survey, a five hole 870m drilling program was carried out on previously 
undrilled portions of the property to test five very strong IP anomalies spatially associated with gold in till 
anomalies. All of the holes intersected thick zones of mineralization and/or alteration.  Logging, sampling 
and  assaying  of  the  core  is  partly  completed  and  initial  results  reported.    One  hole  intersected 
unmineralized, chloritized syenite with a few randomly selected character samples returning anomalous 
values up to 327 ppb Au.  The strong IP response was unexplained.  This area and its strike projections 
are a high priority for follow up exploration.  The clustering of the higher gold in till counts near the margins 
of  a  syenite  stock  is  suggestive  of  a  prominent,  recognizable,  and  readily  explorable,  geological 
environment on a large portion of the property.

d)  Exploration by the Company 
 
Subject to the availability of financing, further drilling is planned to follow up till and IP results and to further 
expand the known size of the Herrick deposit.
e)  Joint Venture  
 
The Company and Creso Exploration Inc. have entered into an agreement to combine claim holdings along 
the Larder Lake Break into a 50/50 joint venture in the Shining Tree gold area of Ontario. The nine claims 
(336ha) that constitute the joint venture property bring together the historic high grade vein systems that 
include the former Churchill, Gold Corona, Cochrane, and Pet occurrences.  A 1,003 m drilling program 
was carried out in October, 2010 on the joint venture claims.  The drill program was designed to begin 
outlining the dimensions and structural controls of an alteration zone and to guide further drilling toward 
the most prospective part of the system.   
 
Further  geophysical  surveys,  stripping  and  trenching  were  carried  out  on  the  joint  venture  in  2011. 
However since that time Creso failed to conclude the joint venture arrangements and most of the claims 
have  lapsed  so  the  Joint  Venture  has  not  been  continued.  On  April  2,  2014  Dundee  Sustainable 
Technologies Inc. and Creso Exploration Inc jointly announced an amalgamation under the name of the 
former.
The Ontario Department of Mines reported in 1934 that visible gold and significant gold values over 0.5 
opt were returned from channel samples on the principal N60E trending Churchill veins in the southeast 
part of the zone, where secondary veins in the area also showed gold values of up to 6.96 g/t. Select grab 
samples from the old Pet Vein on the Churchill Mining property, taken by Vernon Drylie (P.Eng.) for Creso 
Exploration in 2009, responded well to initial enhanced gravity concentration testing undertaken by the 
Knelson Research and Technology Centre, with feed material grading 14.7 g/tonne Au gave a Knelson 
concentrate grading 724.1 g/tonne Au at 39% Au recovery, in a mass pull of 0.8%, indicating good grade 
enhancement by gravity concentration techniques.  The drilling and surface sampling conducted in 2010 
exposed a broad zone of low grade gold mineralization in a formational zone of jasper iron formation and 
carbonates.  Sampling by The Company in the summer of 2011 returned values in grab samples up to 181 
g/t Au from the Pet Vein. 
 
f)  Option Agreement
The Company entered into an option agreement with Canadian Prospecting Ventures Inc. on September 
16, 2010, to acquire a one hundred percent interest, in a 12 claim unit (192 ha.) property. The property 
adjoins the Shining Tree property. The Company allowed this option to lapse in the second quarter of 
2012.
g)  Memorandum of Understanding
In July 2013, the 2009 exploration agreement with Mattagami First Nation was amended to include the 
Matachewan  First  Nation.    A  mineral  exploration  plan  under  the  New  Ontario  Mining  Act  has  been 
submitted and approved and an exploration permit has been issued by the Ontario government (refer to 
overall performance page 3).

h)  Nabish Lake 
 
On August 11, 2014 Platinex acquired an option to purchase the Nabish Lake Ni-Cu-PGE property located 
20 kilometres south of the Town of Dryden, Ontario. The property comprises 94 claim units covering 1,504 
hectares of the Nabish Lake mafic intrusive complex. The intrusion is one of several mineralized, well 
layered, mafic to ultramafic intrusions that ring the large Atikwa Batholith. Documents on record with the 
Ontario  Ministry  of  Northern  Development  and  Mines  report  samples  collected  on  the  property  have 
returned values of up to 3.5% Ni, 6.5% Cu and anomalous levels of PGE. In addition, a recent airborne 
VTEM survey over a portion of the property has outlined several unexplained geophysical conductors 
worthy of drill testing.  
 
On August 11, 2014, Rubicon Minerals Corporation agreed to grant the Company a four year option to 
purchase a one hundred percent (100%) undivided interest in 10 unpatented mining claims, subject to a 
1.5% NSR, in exchange for 800,000 common shares of  Platinex and $70,350 to be paid by the fourth 
anniversary according to a prescribed payment schedule. An initial issuance of 200,000 common shares 
recorded at the fair market value of $0.01 per share was made on August 19, 2014 and the first payment 
for $7,350 was to be made on the earlier of four months after signing or receipt of drilling permits and 
exploration financing; the payment is in default as at May 29, 2015. A second optional payment of $6,000 
on August 11, 2015 and a third payment of $10,000 on August 10, 2016 has not been made. The property 
comprises 10 claim units covering 1,504 hectares of the Nabish Lake mafic intrusive complex. 
 
h)  South McFaulds   
 
The South McFaulds property is located 25 km southwest of Noront Resources’ Eagle One and Double 
Eagle  nickel-copper-PGE  and  Blackbird  chromitite  discoveries  within  the  Ring  of  Fire  intrusion.  This 
property comprises 30 claim units in one claim block covering 480 ha (1,200 acres). The property adjoins 
a block formerly held by MacDonald Mines, on the northwest known as the Butler Property.  
 
McDonald’s former Butler property (now Noront Resources) has revealed occurrences of volcanogenic 
massive  sulphide  copper-zinc  mineralization  of  significance  and  vanadium  and  nickel-copper-PGE 
mineralization.  The  Company’s  property  was  staked  to  cover  a  layered  intrusion  that  is  coupled  with 
magnetic anomalies. A qualifying report was completed on this property in 2011. 
 
In 2011 a federal-provincial airborne gravity and magnetic survey covering the property has highlighted 
areas of potential for NI-Cu-PGE, Cu-Zn and vanadium deposits underlying the property.  A portion of the 
McFaulds South property was subjected to an airborne HELITEM and magnetic survey by Fugro 
Airborne Surveys, Corporation in September 2011and reported on in January 2012.  
 
After filing the report low priority portions of the property were allowed to lapse. This exploration work has 
enabled the Company to keep portions of the property in good standing until February 2015 when two 
blocks of claims on the South McFaulds property comprising 112 claim units for 1,696ha expired leaving 
one claim block with 480ha in good standing.
For the purpose of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis James R. Trusler, P.Eng., President and CEO 
of the Company is the Qualified Person.

Former Big Trout Lake Property, Ontario 
 
As described in detail in the Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2009, 
the Company made considerable efforts to attain lawful access to its property for the purpose of exploration 
through attempts to consult, engage and accommodate KI and then through litigation. 
 
During 1999, the Company acquired a 100% interest in 221 mining claims located in the Patricia Mining 
Division  of  northwestern  Ontario.    On  February  10,  2006  the  Company  acquired  a  100%  unencumbered 
interest in 81 renewable mining leases,  and approximately 7,000m of core (valued at $2,000,000) from a joint 
venture operated by INCO Limited for $162,312 cash and the issuance of $150,000 worth of the Company’s 
common shares (428,751 common shares issued).  The Company attempted to commence its exploratory 
drill  program  on  the  Big  Trout  Lake  property  in  February,  2006.  Members  of  the  First  Nation, 
Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (“KI”) restricted access to the property preventing commencement of the drill 
program. In April 2006, the Company commenced a lawsuit against KI for damages and sought unobstructed 
access  to  its  mining  claims  and  leases.  In  February  2008,  the  Company  delivered  written  notice  to  the 
Province of Ontario of its intention to proceed with legal action for recovery from Ontario of damages suffered 
by  the  Company  arising  from  the  dispute  with  KI.  In  accordance  with  Accounting  Guideline  AcG-11,  the 
capitalized asset value has been assessed as impaired due to the lack of access to the property and has 
accordingly been written down. The claims and leases were surrendered in December 2009 to the Ontario 
government in return for a payment of $5,000,000 plus additional mediation and negotiation costs totaling 
$377,056 and a retained 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty interest. A qualifying report published in 2006 estimated 
a potential for 1.7 billion tonnes grading 8.4% Cr2O3. Additional estimates of platinum group elements in 4 
deposits have not been qualified independently but based on a model for layered PGE deposits a potential 
for a resource of 100 million ounces of PGE plus gold to a depth of 1,000m was estimated internally and 
supported  in  principle  by  Lonmin’s  consulting  geologist.    Prior  to  the  initial  blockade  by  KI  Platinex  had 
concluded  a  confidentiality  agreement  with  Lonmin  PLC,  the  world’s  third  largest  platinum  producer,  and 
negotiated a joint venture agreement which contemplated carrying Platinex’s interest through to production. 
Execution of the agreement was contingent on a positive band council resolution from KI. The hold time on 
the confidentiality agreement put Platinex in an awkward position in the initial court appearance in 2006. In 
2012, Platinex donated core from the former property to the Ontario government in order to foster better 
understanding of the geology of such layered intrusions related to the Ring of Fire. Platinex remains optimistic 
that it can achieve further return from this asset given the facts that can now be fully revealed. 
 
Discussions with several parties are proceeding to sell the royalty in whole or in part as an alternative to other 
financing  initiatives  currently  being  pursued  by  the  Company.  An  internal  evaluation  of  the  royalty  was 
completed in 2014 for that purpose.

Results of Operations – Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 
 
In the first six months of 2016, the Company’s operations were focused on raising capital.  The first six month 
2016 operating expenses of $49,820 increased from the $17,502 of operating expenses incurred in the first 
six months of fiscal 2015 largely due to consulting fees and website re-design. The resulting fiscal 2016 first 
six month loss was $49,820 ($17,502 – 2015) with a basic and fully diluted loss per share for the first two 
quarters of $0.0009 ($0.0003 – 2015).  
 
In the first six months of 2016, 0 options (0 – 2015) were granted; in the first six months of 2016, 1,560,000 
options expired (1,020,000 - 2015). In the first six months of 2016 and 2015, 0 warrants expired; on June 28, 
2016, 8,000,000 warrants were granted (0 – 2015) in conjunction with the private placement disclosed on

Working capital (deficiency)
Working  capital  (deficiency)  is  defined  as  current  assets  net  of  current  liabilities,  which  is  a  non-GAAP 
measure.  Non-GAAP financial measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and 
therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.  However, management 
believes that it is a useful in assessing the Company’s liquidity. 
 
The Company has limited financial resources and no source of operating revenue.  In the past, it has relied 
on  debt/equity  financings  to  maintain  its  exploration,  environmental  permitting,  and  engineering  and 
development activities and meet its administrative costs.  The Company continues to seek capital through 
various means including the possible joint venturing of a direct interest in its projects and by the issuance of 
equity and/or debt.  If the Company experiences significant delays in obtaining additional funding necessary 
to  fund  its  ongoing  operating  and  capital  requirements,  this  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the 
Company’s financial condition, business and plan of operations.  
 
The mineral properties in which the Company currently has an interest are in the exploration stages and, 
consequently,  the  Company  has  no  current  source  of  operating  revenue  and  is  dependent  on  external 
financing to fund continued exploration and development of its mineral properties. Historically, the Company’s 
principal sources of funding have been the issuance of equity securities for cash and interest income from 
short-term investments. 
 
The challenging financial markets currently faced by companies in the junior mining sector generally, have 
had a significant adverse affect on the Company’s share price and on its ability to raise additional funds 
through  equity  financings  on  a  timely  basis.   The  Company  has  taken  steps  to  conserve  cash  pending 
completion of additional financings.

Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
Management’s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
 
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  have  been  designed  with  reasonable  assurance  that  all  material 
information related to the Company is identified and communicated on a timely basis.  Management of the 
Company, under the supervision of the President and Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the design 
and  operations  of  disclosure  controls  and  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.    There  have  been  no 
changes in the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures during the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
 
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over 
financial  reporting  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.  However, the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, believe that due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or 
detect all misstatements and fraud on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness 
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate. 
 
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the six months 
ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting.
