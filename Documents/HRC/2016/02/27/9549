</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited Honduras from 23 to 31 May 2006 at 
the invitation of the Government.  During the course of the visit, the Working Group met 
with the relevant authorities in the executive and judicial branches and with representatives of 
civil society and non-governmental organizations.  It visited 10 detention facilities, including 
police stations, prisons and young offender facilities and interviewed in private more than 
200 detainees, a few of whom had been previously identified but most of whom were chosen at 
random on the spot. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group observes that since the beginning of the 1990s the legal and 
institutional framework governing deprivation of liberty in Honduras has profoundly changed.  
The entry into force of a new Criminal Procedure Code in 2002 has expedited criminal 
proceedings and significantly reduced the number of detainees held on remand as well as the 
duration of detention without conviction.  Previously, a separate juvenile justice system had been 
established.  These and other reforms described below have put Honduras in a much better 
position to respect and ensure the rights of persons under its jurisdiction not to be arbitrarily 
deprived of liberty. 
</p>
<p> However, the Working Group identified several areas in which the reality does not live 
up to the high standards established by the Constitution and the laws of Honduras, giving rise to 
the serious and widespread occurrence of the phenomenon of arbitrary detention.  The first issue 
of concern addressed in the report regards the ineffectiveness of the institutions mandated to 
monitor the legality of detention.  The Working Group also noted serious shortcomings within 
the system of legal aid for indigent defendants and insufficient monitoring of the police during 
the course of the criminal justice process, as well as a lack of checks and balances between the 
police and the judiciary.  The powers of the police in the criminal justice process are 
insufficiently controlled and balanced.  The Working Group identified two main reasons to 
explain this situation.  First, the public prosecution lacks independence from the police and, 
secondly, the police rather than an independent penitentiary institution run the prisons, in which 
both remand detainees and convicts are held. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group also expressed concern with regard to two specific categories of 
detainees:  
</p>
<p> (a) The more than 1,800 detainees who were already in pretrial custody when the 
new Criminal Procedure Code entered into force four and a half years ago are still in detention, 
either awaiting trial or awaiting release after their acquittal because the prosecutor has filed an 
appeal; and  
</p>
<p> (b) The members of violent youth gangs (<i>maras</i>) - a phenomenon that raises 
considerable alarm in Honduras - whose treatment does not appear to be fully compatible with 
Honduras&#8217;s obligations under international human rights law. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes recommendations to the 
Government aimed at strengthening the control over the legality of detention at all stages of the 
criminal justice process.  The Working Group calls upon the Government to urgently address the 
situation of detainees held under the old Criminal Procedure Code.  It also recommends the 
establishment of a specific, professionally staffed penitentiary system separate from the police.  
Finally, the Working Group stresses the importance of strengthening prevention, law 
enforcement and criminal justice in dealing with the <i>maras</i> specifically, and with crime in 
general, instead of relaxing the rule of law and the protection against arbitrary detention. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which was established pursuant to 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991/42 and whose mandate was assumed by the 
Human Rights Council by its decision 1/102, visited Honduras from 23 to 31 May 2006 at the 
invitation of the Government.  The delegation consisted of Ms. Le&#239;la Zerrougui, 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group and head of the delegation, and Ms. Manuela 
Carmena Castrillo, member of the Working Group.  The delegation was accompanied by 
the Secretary of the Working Group, an official from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, and two interpreters from the United Nations Office 
at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group would like to express its gratitude to the Government of Honduras, 
as well as to the United Nations Country Team, which greatly assisted with the logistics of the 
visit, and to the Honduran civil society representatives whom it met. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>3. The delegation of the Working Group visited the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the cities of 
San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba.  The delegation was able to visit the following detention facilities:  
in Tegucigalpa, the Penitenciar&#237;a Nacional and the centres for juvenile offenders &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221; 
(male) and &#8220;Sagrado Coraz&#243;n&#8221; (female); in San Pedro Sula, the Centro Penal, the centre for male 
juvenile offenders &#8220;El Carmen&#8221; and the &#8220;Casitas Blancas&#8221; centre for girls at risk; and in 
La Ceiba, the Granja Penal &#8220;El Porvenir&#8221;.  The delegation further visited the holding cells of the 
police stations in all three cities. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of 
Security, with commanding officers of the National Police, judges of the Supreme Court and of 
trial and appeals courts, the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Chief Prosecutor and 
representatives of prosecutors&#8217; offices, and with lawyers of the Public Defender&#8217;s offices.  The 
delegation also held meetings with representatives of several non-governmental organizations 
and professional associations, including the bar association.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1. The transition from authoritarian Government  
to democracy and the 1982 Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>5. While the purpose of the present report is not to provide a history of the institutions 
dealing with public security, criminal justice and detention in Honduras, it is important to note 
that the country was governed by military regimes between 1963 and 1982.  In 1982 a new 
Constitution entered into force, providing for a President elected for a non-renewable four-year 
term as Head of State and Government, and a legislature, the National Congress.  In spite of the 
return to civilian rule during the 1980s, the armed forces nonetheless waged a systematic 
campaign of arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances and extrajudicial executions, 
particularly against left-wing activists. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The judicial branch 
(a) The Supreme Court 
</b>6. The Supreme Court of Justice, composed of 15 judges elected for a seven-year term by 
the National Congress, has a twofold mandate in Honduras.  On the one hand, it is the highest 
judicial court of the country and, on the other, it is also an administrative body responsible for 
the organization and administration of the judicial system. 
7. Among its administrative functions, the Supreme Court drafts the budget for the court 
system and submits it to the National Congress; divides the country into judicial districts; 
establishes, abolishes, merges or transfers trial courts, courts of appeal and other tribunals; 
manages public defenders&#8217; offices; and appoints and dismisses judges.  
8. As the country&#8217;s highest court, the Supreme Court sits in different chambers:  
Constitutional, Criminal, Labour, Administrative and Civil.  The chambers hear appeals in 
cassation of the decisions of the lower courts.  The Supreme Court also hears appeals on the 
constitutional remedies of habeas corpus, appeals on constitutional grounds (<i>amparo</i>), and cases 
of unconstitutionality.  
</p>
<p><b>(b) Trial and appellate courts 
</b>9. The oral and public trials in felony cases that are the hallmark of the new Criminal 
Procedure Code (CPP) take place before three-member trial courts (CPP, art. 57).  
</p>
<p>10. Individual judges hold hearings and rule on all issues arising at the pretrial stage, 
including preventive detention and other preventive measures.  They also hear cases tried in 
expedited proceedings, e.g. <i>procedimiento abreviado</i> (CPP, art. 403), which can be used if the 
accused pleads guilty. 
</p>
<p>11. Justices of peace (who are not necessarily trained lawyers) hear cases for minor offences 
(CPP, art. 59).  They also deal with urgent matters which would otherwise fall within the 
competence of the <i>juez de letras</i> or the prosecutor (such as ordering the detention of a suspect) 
when the latter cannot immediately intervene, which occurs mostly in remote rural areas. 
</p>
<p>12. Appeals against the decisions of a justice of peace are brought before an individual judge 
(CPP, art. 58.6), while appeals against the decisions of a trial court are brought before a court of 
appeal (CPP, art. 56).  The Supreme Court hears appeals in cassation.  
</p>
<p><b>(c) The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> 
</b>13. The mandate of the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n de penas y medidas de seguridad</i> (judge in charge 
of monitoring the execution of sentences and security measures, hereinafter &#8220;<i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i>&#8221;) 
is to ascertain that preventive detention and prison sentences are carried out in accordance with 
the law and the judicial decisions.  The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> is also competent to decide on all 
incidents arising during the execution of a prison sentence, as well as to ensure that the rights of </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>convicts are respected.  In discharging his or her duties, the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> hears and rules on 
requests from detainees regarding conditional release, complaints of unlawful disciplinary 
measures and violations of their fundamental rights (CPP, arts. 60 and 381-382).  In addition, the 
<i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> keeps track of the time spent in custody, including in pretrial detention (which 
is to be subtracted from the sentence).  Therefore, the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> also rules on the 
timeliness of applications for conditional release, and keeps both the detainee and the prison 
authorities informed on these matters.  Prison authorities are required to duly register such 
information (CPP, art 386).  For their parts, the public prosecutor and the convict can bring to the 
attention of the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> all questions pertaining to the execution of a sentence and 
conditional release.  The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> issues rulings on such matters after having held oral 
hearings (CPP, art. 386). 
</p>
<p>14. The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> is also responsible for monitoring the strict enforcement of the 
principle according to which preventive detention may not assume the nature of a sanction and 
should only be used to prevent flight, obstruction of justice or further criminal activity.  In case 
of non-compliance with such rules, the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> promptly informs the judge in charge of 
the criminal proceedings, who should, within 24 hours, rule on the matter. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The Public Prosecution Service 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Law of 1994 regulating public prosecution establishes a Public Prosecution Service 
independent of the other branches of Government.  It is responsible, inter alia, for investigating 
and prosecuting the case and for ensuring that the constitutional rights of the accused are 
respected.  According to article 33 of the Law, public prosecutors participate directly in the 
investigation:  they direct and supervise the police during the course of the investigation; decide 
whether to bring charges against suspects and act as prosecutors during the trial. 
</p>
<p>16. The 1994 Law on public prosecution provided the establishment of a directorate of 
criminal investigation (DGIC), under the responsibility of the Public Prosecution Service 
(art. 41).  However, the 1998 Law on the National Police, reallocated investigation to the 
Ministry of Security, leaving the Public Prosecution Service in charge only of providing 
guidance to the <i>Direcci&#243;n General de Investigaci&#243;n Criminal</i> (DGIC), which, under the new 
law, acts under the authority of the police.  The CPP of 2002 defines the relationship between the 
Public Prosecution Service and the police and its article 279 prescribes that in discharging their 
duties the members of DGIC act on their own initiative, in accordance with the general 
guidelines (<i>orientaciones</i>) provided by prosecutors and execute orders received from the 
prosecutors.  
</p>
<p>17. In recent years, specialized prosecution sections have been established within the Public 
Prosecution Service, inter alia to follow cases relating to violations of human rights, offences 
against women, protection of children, etc.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  The National Police 
</b></p>
<p>18. Until the 1990s, when it was placed under civilian control, the National Police were 
under the authority of the Ministry of Defence.  They are now governed by the Law on the 
National Police of 1998 and come under the authority of the Ministry of Security.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>19. The National Police are responsible for: 
</p>
<p> (a) Investigating offences:  the DGIC acts under the authority of the Ministry of 
Security and the legal guidance of the Public Prosecution Service, during the judicial 
investigative process (art. 30.2); 
</p>
<p> (b) Preventing, discouraging and combating all kinds of offences, restoring law and 
order (art. 37); and 
</p>
<p> (c) Managing the penitentiaries and ensuring their security (art. 52). 
</p>
<p><b>5.  The penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>20. All detention facilities (except military ones) are run by the police, which, with the 
DGIC, have holding cells for police custody and preventive detention ordered by the public 
prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>21. Judicially ordered preventive detention is carried out in regular prison facilities which are 
run by a separate directorate of the National Police, the <i>Direcci&#243;n General de Servicios 
Especiales Preventivos</i> (DGSEP).  Nonetheless, article 86 of the Constitution and article 191 of 
CPP provide that pretrial detainees shall be kept absolutely separate from convicted detainees, 
even though they may be held in the same facilities. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  The Honduran Institute for Childhood and Family and juvenile detention 
</b>22. In view of the lack of legal protection for minors, Honduras adopted a Childhood and 
Adolescence Code, in 1996, which established the Honduran Institute for the Childhood and 
Family (IHNFA) as the government agency responsible for the promotion and protection of the 
rights of the child, and profoundly renewed the juvenile justice system.  The age of criminal 
responsibility is set at 12 years of age, but until 18 offenders are to be dealt with exclusively in 
accordance with the Childhood Code (arts. 180 and 181). 
</p>
<p><b>7.  The Human Rights Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>23. The mandate of Human Rights Commissioner (CONADEH) was established in 1990 to 
guarantee the implementation of the human rights obligations contained in the Constitution and 
the international treaties to which Honduras is a party.  The Commissioner, nominated by the 
legislature for a six-year term, is independent from all branches of the Government and enjoys 
ample powers to investigate alleged human rights violations and to report about them. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group noted with satisfaction that the Commissioner has unrestricted 
access to all military and civilian facilities and detention centres as well as unrestricted access to 
all administrative and judicial files, including those classified as secret.  Besides, obstruction to 
the Commissioner&#8217;s functions has been criminalized. 
</p>
<p>25. The criminal procedure code provides also that DGIC shall inform the Commissioner 
without delay of any detention carried out (CPP, art. 280). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p><b>8.  The Office of the Public Defender and private lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Office of the Public Defender, mandated to assist criminal defendants who do not 
have the means to hire a private lawyer, is established under the umbrella of the Supreme Court 
and financed out of its budget. 
</p>
<p>27. Private lawyers are organized in a bar association. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The legal framework of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  International instruments ratified by Honduras 
</b></p>
<p>28. Honduras has ratified all seven major international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Constitutional guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Constitution of Honduras contains ample and detailed provisions ensuring the 
protection of fundamental rights.  With specific regard to criminal proceedings, it provides that 
nobody shall be arrested without a warrant issued by the competent authority, except for arrest 
in flagrante delicto (art. 84).  The Constitution sets strict limits on detention without criminal 
charges (24 hours without judicial order, six days on judge&#8217;s order (art. 71)); it establishes the 
right to legal aid (art. 83) and the right not to be coerced to make statements incriminating 
oneself or a member of one&#8217;s family, only recognizing the validity of statements made before the 
competent judge (art. 88) and reaffirming the presumption of innocence (art. 89). 
</p><p>30. With regard to places of detention, the Constitution provides that no one can be held in 
places other than those provided by law (art. 85); persons under trial must be held separately 
from the convicted (art. 86); prisons shall contribute to the rehabilitation of detainees and their 
reintegration to working life (art. 87). 
</p>
<p>31. Article 182 of the Constitution provides the respect of the writ of habeas corpus, which is 
available to any person unlawfully imprisoned, detained or restrained, or in case of mistreatment, 
torture, harassment, or unlawful demands during lawful detention. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The criminal trial 
</b></p>
<p>32. The new criminal procedure code entered into force on 20 February 2002.  The previous 
code reflected the inquisitorial model, in which the investigating judge was actively involved in 
determining the facts of the case and obtaining the confession of the suspect, which was the 
primary means to prove the offence (old CPP 163-173 and 219-235).  The new criminal 
procedure is inspired by the adversarial model in which prosecution and defence argue before the 
court their opposing versions of the facts and the applicable law, and an independent and 
impartial judge presides over the proceedings and decides questions of law. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Detention in the context of criminal proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Police power to arrest 
</b>33. The criminal procedure code defines the circumstances under which the police can 
proceed to arrest a person without a judicial order or warrant, mostly in flagrante delicto or 
immediately after the commission of an offence.  Within six hours from the arrest, the police 
have to inform the public prosecutor and the judge competent for the arrest.  If the arrest was 
carried out by the preventive police, the person shall be immediately placed at the disposal of the 
DGIC (art. 175 CPP). 
</p>
<p>34. At the time of arrest, the police have to inform the arrestee &#8220;with the greatest clarity 
possible&#8221; about: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The motives of the detention; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The right to contact a family member or other person of his or her choice; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The right to be assisted by a lawyer; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The right to be seen by a forensic doctor; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The right to remain silent and not to make statements against himself or herself 
and/or a member of his family or household, and the fact that only statements made 
before a competent judge will have evidentiary value (CPP, art. 282.6). 
</p>
<p>35. Moreover, at the time of the arrest the police are to record in a publicly accessible register 
all information relating to the place and time of the arrest (CPP, art. 282.7-8). 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Preventive detention ordered by the public prosecutor 
</b>36. The public prosecutor can order the preventive detention of a person suspected of having 
committed an offence for up to 24 hours (including the hours spent in police custody).  All 
detention thus ordered shall be brought to the attention of the competent judge without delay 
(CPP, art. 176). 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Judicial preventive detention 
</b>37. If the prosecutor takes the view that preventive detention is necessary beyond the 
initial 24 hours, an order placing the arrestee at the disposal of the competent judge within 
24 hours needs to be taken.  At this stage, the prosecutor can request an extension of the 
detention for up to six days, for which the arrestee shall be taken to the courthouse (CPP, 
art. 286).  The judge informs the arrestee of his rights, including the right to be assisted by a 
lawyer and to remain silent, and the arrestee makes a statement.  If an order of continuation of 
the detention is issued, it is carried out at a prison facility and no longer at police holding cell 
and the next hearing (the initial hearing) shall take place within six days at the latest.  The 
following hearing (the &#8220;preliminary hearing&#8221;) shall be held within 60 days, or in complex cases 
within 120 days, of the initial hearing (CPP, art. 300).  The judge shall decide on the trial date </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>within three days of the preliminary hearing.  Pretrial detention, that is preventive detention 
between the first appearance before a judge and the final decision on the case, can be ordered 
under one of the following circumstances: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Risk of flight of the accused; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Possible obstruction to the investigation by the accused; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Well-founded risk that the accused may rejoin the criminal organization to which he 
is suspected of belonging; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Well-founded risk that the accused may make attempts on the life or other reprisals 
against those who accused or denounced him (CPP, art. 178). 
</p>
<p>38. Orders of preventive detention are subject to appeal before an appellate court which shall 
rule within three days. 
</p>
<p>39. Preventive detention can last for a maximum of two years on charges for offences 
carrying out six or more years of imprisonment, and up to one year for lesser offences.  In cases 
in which the evidence to be gathered is particularly extensive or complex, the Supreme Court can 
exceptionally extend these maximum terms by six months.  In no case may the duration of 
preventive detention exceed more than half the minimum sentence available for the offence 
(CPP, art. 181).  Once the accused has been convicted in first instance, preventive detention can 
be extended for up to half the duration of the pronounced sentence (CPP, art. 181.4). 
</p>
<p>40. Once the preventive detention of an accused has reached its maximum duration the judge 
must provisionally release the detainee and decide on an alternative preventive measure (CPP, 
art. 181.5).  However, according to an amendment introduced in January 2005 regarding 
detainees charged with being members of an illicit association, preventive detention can never be 
substituted with an alternative measure (CPP, art. 184.6). 
</p>
<p>41. Preventive detention is forbidden in cases where the offence carries a maximum sentence 
of less than five years&#8217; imprisonment (CPP, art. 182), except if there is a reasonable suspicion 
that the accused may make reprisals against those who accused or denounced him. 
</p>
<p>42. If the accused is acquitted, the court shall order the immediate release.  However, until 
the acquittal has become final, the court may, upon request of the prosecutor, continue to impose 
preventive measures in order to ensure that the accused remain at the disposal of the court, 
insofar as such measures do not involve deprivation of liberty (CPP 339.2-3). 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Alternative measures to preventive detention 
</b>43. As already mentioned, the Criminal Procedure Code provides for a number of alternative 
security measures, such as house arrest, obligation to report to the judge or other surveillance 
authority, prohibitions to visit certain places or meet certain persons, and financial guarantees. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>(e) Preventive detention under the old CPP 
</b>44. Under the 1984 Criminal Procedure Code (1984 CPP), the investigating judge would 
automatically order the detention of anyone suspected of having committed a serious offence 
(1984 CPP, art. 162).  The detention order remained in place for as long as there was proof that a 
serious offence had been committed and elements reasonably pointing towards the involvement 
of the accused (1984 CPP, art. 177).  There were no limits on the duration of preventive 
detention, no effective possibility to challenge detention remand and no review of detention 
(once ordered) by the judge.  Even in cases of first instance acquittal, the judge ordered the 
&#8220;provisional release&#8221; of the defendant only if the charges carried imprisonment for less than 
three years (1984 CPP, art. 384). 
</p>
<p>45. In 1996 the National Congress enacted a law (<i>Ley del Reo Sin Condena</i>) which provided 
for the release of remand detainees provided that they (a) were not accused of certain particularly 
serious crimes; (b) had spent in preventive detention more than one third of the term of 
imprisonment applicable to the offence they were accused of; (c) had no criminal antecedents; 
and (d) had shown good conduct during their preventive detention. 
</p>
<p>46. Pursuant to article 446 of the 2002 CPP all criminal proceedings initiated under 1984 
CPP will continue to be governed by that law, with the exception of a few provisions of the new 
code.  The preventive detention regime established by the old CPP, as mitigated by the <i>Ley del 
Reo Sin Condena</i>, thus remains applicable to all persons who were in preventive detention 
before 20 February 2002. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Special provisions governing &#8220;illicit associations&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>47. Article 332 of the Criminal Code, governing the offence of &#8220;illicit association&#8221;, was 
revised in January 2005.  It now provides that the leaders (<i>jefes o cabecillas</i>) of youth gangs 
(<i>maras</i>, <i>pandillas</i>) and &#8220;other groups associating with the permanent objective of committing 
crimes&#8221; shall be punished with 20 to 30 years of imprisonment, while simple membership shall 
carry a term of imprisonment of a third less, that is between 13 and 20 years.  At the same time, 
a special provision was introduced in the Criminal Procedure Code regarding the preventive 
detention of persons charged with belonging to an &#8220;illicit association&#8221;, making it almost 
mandatory. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Juvenile justice and detention of minors 
</b>48. The Childhood Code provides that deprivation of liberty (referred to as &#8220;internment&#8221; and 
not &#8220;imprisonment&#8221;) shall be the exception in dealing with juvenile offenders (art. 198) and that 
preference be given to other &#8220;socio-educational measures&#8221;, which include orientation, warning, 
community service, restrictions on freedom of movement and semi-liberty (art. 188).  Internment 
shall be ordered only for minors guilty of crimes against life or serious attacks on the physical 
integrity of a person, or in cases of recidivism or repeated failure to comply with previous 
measures.  Internment shall be imposed only for the minimum duration necessary and the need 
for internment shall be reassessed every six months (art. 198).  Interned minors are entitled to 
&#8220;effective, regular and private&#8221; legal advice and should be fully informed about their status and 
rights (art. 199). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>49. In the pretrial phase and during trial, minors accused of serious offences may be 
subjected to preventive measures, including restrictions on liberty or even internment, which are 
pronounced on an exceptional basis (arts. 206 and 207).  Preventive internment (or other 
measures) can be ordered for up to 30 days and be prolonged for another of 30 days maximum, if 
necessary. 
</p>
<p>50. Juvenile court judges shall monitor the strict compliance with the measures (both 
preventive and socio-educational) they have ordered (art. 260).  No child shall be admitted to an 
internment centre without an order issued by the competent authorities (art. 262), and a file shall 
be kept for each detained child. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  POSITIVE ASPECTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Cooperation of the Government 
</b></p>
<p>51. During the entire visit, the Working Group has enjoyed the fullest cooperation of the 
Government in all respects.  The Working Group was able to visit all the detention centres or 
other facilities it requested and to meet with and interview whoever it wanted, detainees 
identified beforehand to the Government and detainees chosen at random.  The Government 
accepted several requests by the Working Group to change the programme of the visit.  The 
Working Group reiterates its gratitude for the authorities&#8217; transparency and cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Protection against arbitrary detention in the Constitution  
and the new Criminal Procedure Law 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Constitution of Honduras provides for very detailed guarantees against arbitrary 
detention.  The strict provisions concerning detention in unofficial sites, incommunicado 
detention, and judicial control over detention clearly demonstrate a strong will to prevent the 
recurrence of the arbitrary detention and disappearance practices of the-not-too-distant past. 
</p>
<p>53. The new Criminal Procedure Code provides for a fair, expeditious and transparent 
criminal trial.  It brings the Criminal Procedure Law into compliance with the Constitution of 
Honduras and the international human rights obligations of the country.  The institution of the 
<i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> is a mechanism with great potential for effective monitoring of the legality of 
detention.   
</p>
<p><b>C.  Decrease in the rate and number of detainees awaiting trial 
</b></p>
<p>54. The application of the new Criminal Procedure Code has resulted without any doubt, in 
greater transparency of judicial proceedings and reduced the delays besetting the administration 
of justice.  According to the most reliable statistics provided by the Government to the Working 
Group, the share of prisoners held without sentence, which in 2002 amounted to 76 per cent, had 
shrunk to approximately 62 per cent by March 2006.  The overall number of detainees was also 
reduced, though only slightly:  it had peaked in 2001 with more than 12,500 detainees and 
decreased to 12,020 as of end-2005. 
</p>
<p>55. The delegation has also observed that the authorities (judges, prosecutors and the police) 
take the strict deadlines for the various procedural steps and for detention set forth in the new 
code very seriously and generally show a strong will to respect them.   </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Juvenile justice 
</b>56. In a country in which one half of the population is below 18 years of age, the treatment of 
juvenile offenders is of major importance.  Regarding juvenile justice, the Childhood Code 
provide Honduras with a legislative framework fully compliant with the relevant provisions of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child:  a separate judicial system is established for minors in 
conflict with the law, the primacy of education and rehabilitation over punishment are stressed in 
unmistakable terms, the exceptional character of detention as a sanction for young offenders is 
clearly stated.  Moreover, the Honduran Institute for Childhood and Family (IHNFA), the 
government agency charged with the protection and promotion of the rights of the child and not 
the general penitentiary system, is in charge of managing the detention facilities for young 
offenders. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group has also noted that the new management of IHNFA, which had only 
been in office for a few months at the time of the visit, appears to be fully committed to turning 
the promise of the Childhood Code into reality.  The Inter-American Commission on Human 
Rights made a request for interim measures of protection in December 2004 in view of the 
terrible conditions of detention at the &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221; centre.  In October 2005 and April 2006 the 
Supreme Court of Honduras issued orders to IHNFA in habeas corpus proceedings initiated by 
the human rights prosecutors of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula in favour of the internees of the 
&#8220;Renaciendo&#8221; and &#8220;El Carmen&#8221; centres.  When the Working Group visited those two centres it 
observed that significant efforts were under way to improve the conditions of detention, 
particularly at &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221;, where the detained youths acknowledged, in private interviews 
with the members of the delegation, the efforts made by the new administration.  However, 
despite the efforts made recently by IHNFA, much remains to be done to improve the conditions 
of detention and to ensure respect for human dignity and detainees&#8217; rights. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Role of specialized human rights prosecutors  
and Human Rights Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>58. In addition to the institutions mandated under the Criminal Procedure Code with 
monitoring the legality of detention, that is primarily the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i>, the public prosecutor 
and the defence counsel, the Human Rights Commissioner has a role in the prevention of 
arbitrary detention.  In this respect, the Commissioner&#8217;s power of unrestricted access to all 
detention facilities and the police&#8217;s obligation to report all cases of detention to the 
Commissioner provide the population with important protection.   
</p>
<p>59. Also the creation of the special human rights prosecutors has the potential to add a layer 
of protection, as the habeas corpus proceedings brought by human rights prosecutors in favour of 
the detainees of the prisons in Tegucigalpa (Valle del Tamara), San Pedro Sula and Puerto 
Cortes, as well as of the internees of &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221; and &#8220;El Carmen&#8221; show.  Unfortunately, their 
number is limited and particularly in rural areas they are absent, also because of lacking 
resources. 
</p>
<p>60. At a more fundamental level, however, the Working Group notes that, as welcome as 
these institutions may be, their efforts cannot substitute for the effective functioning of the 
institution with primary responsibility in this respect, the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i>. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Abdication of the responsibility to monitor legality of detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The responsibility of the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> 
</b>61. In visiting detention centres, speaking to detainees and revising case files of detainees, 
the Working Group has found a number of cases in which the maximum length of detention on 
remand as dictated in the new criminal procedure code appears to have been exceeded.  The 
police in charge of the detention centres take the stance that they cannot release anyone without 
an order from a judge, even if that means keeping a person in detention without legal basis.  
Detainees who have accrued the right to benefits such as conditional release often remain in 
detention, because they have no means to exercise that right in practice, as they do not have a 
lawyer or family member who would raise the matter with the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i>, and no 
opportunity to speak with the judge or transmit a message to him or her.   
62. The CPP clearly establishes the responsibility of the <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> to ensure that 
preventive detention and prison sentences are carried out in accordance with the law and judicial 
decisions.  The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> is further mandated to keep record of the serving of prison 
terms, to determine at what time a convict can apply for conditional release, and to keep both the 
detainee and the prison authorities informed on these matters. 
</p>
<p>63. The reality in Honduras&#8217; prisons, however, is that where there should be control of the 
legality of detention there is instead a gaping void.  This situation is in part explained by the 
insufficient number of <i>jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i>.  According to the Supreme Court there should be 
24 <i>jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i>, but there are currently only 12.  In Tegucigalpa, two <i>jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i> 
are responsible for monitoring the legality of the detention of more than 3,000 persons deprived 
of liberty.  Considering the absence of a proper prison administration and of internal procedures 
for the resolution of issues arising in the penitentiary context (disciplinary measures, benefits, 
release), as well as the omnipresent corruption, which the Working Group all describes below, a 
ratio of one judge per 1,000 prisoners (or 1,500 in Tegucigalpa) is not sufficient.   
64. However, it is the Working Group&#8217;s impression that the insufficient number of <i>jueces de 
ejecuci&#243;n</i> only partially explains the almost complete absence of control over the legality of 
detention.  Many of the <i>jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i>, and the same applies for public prosecutors and 
public defence lawyers, appear to have to a great extent abdicated their mandate to exercise this 
control.   
</p>
<p>65. The <i>jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i> are also to receive complaints of detainees concerning 
disciplinary measures and to rule on them.  In practice, in violation of article 381 CPP, the <i>jueces 
de ejecuci&#243;n</i> do not exercise any ex officio control over the imposition of disciplinary measures, 
which are imposed at the whim of the prison police.  The Working Group was particularly 
troubled by the situation it encountered in the high security wing of the Penitenciar&#237;a Nacional, 
the main prison in Tegucigalpa, the so-called &#8220;Escorpi&#243;n&#8221;.  The detainees there are held in small 
isolation cells and do not get any exercise or other opportunity to leave their cells.  The Working 
Group was not able to determine the criteria and rules by which the detainees are sanctioned to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>be held in the &#8220;Escorpi&#243;n&#8221;, or whether these criteria are written down in a set of rules accessible 
to the detainees and the outside world.  There appear to be no written decisions referring 
detainees to &#8220;Escorpi&#243;n&#8221;, no accessible information on the motives and duration of the isolation 
measure, no means to challenge the sanction.  The <i>juez de ejecuci&#243;n</i> and public defence lawyers 
do not appear to ever enter the &#8220;Escorpi&#243;n&#8221;, so that the detainees there are basically 
incommunicado.   
</p>
<p><b>2.  The situation in the juvenile detention centres 
</b>66. Similarly, and notwithstanding the undoubted efforts recently made by those in charge of 
the juvenile detention centres &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221; and &#8220;El Carmen&#8221;, there are currently many juveniles 
deprived of their liberty without legal basis.  Registers and individual files of detainees in 
IHNFA facilities are in a catastrophic state.  They do not reflect the situation on the ground, but 
they are often sufficient to determine that the internee is being detained without a legal basis, 
either because he has served his socio-educative measure, as juvenile sentences are called, or 
because the preventive internment order has not been renewed, or because detention has been 
extended beyond the limits provided for in the law.  IHNFA argues that even when an internment 
order has expired it cannot release an internee without a judicial order to do so, and the Working 
Group does not doubt that this claim is made in good faith.  But this stance simply overlooks the 
fact that in the absence of a judicial decision justifying detention, the deprivation of liberty is 
without legal basis and thus arbitrary. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The situation in police stations 
</b></p>
<p>67. As stated above, the Working Group is under the impression that the police are generally 
taking their duty to comply with the strict and short time limits for police detention of suspects 
seriously.  However, as with prisons and juvenile facilities, records of arrests, detentions, 
transfers and releases at police stations are in a deplorable state and do in fact not allow a real 
control of the legality of detention.  In the course of the visit, the Working Group delegation 
repeatedly drew the attention of the police to the importance of registers showing whenever a 
person is taken into custody and all changes in the detainee&#8217;s status, with proof (stamp and 
signature) of the responsible authority, as an X-ray of detention essential for the prevention of 
abuses. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Lack of effectiveness of public defenders 
</b></p>
<p>68. The new criminal code introducing the adversarial system significantly increases the role 
and the responsibility of defence counsel in the criminal trial.  In a country like Honduras, in 
which a significant portion of the population is too poor to afford a private lawyer, the role of the 
public defender is absolutely central to equality of arms in the criminal process and the 
prevention of arbitrary detentions.  In fact, according to information received by the Working 
Group, more than half of the criminal defendants have to rely on a public defender.  In the four 
years since the entry into force of the new criminal procedure code, the number of public 
defenders has grown from 90 to approximately 250.   
</p>
<p>69. This sharp increase in the number of public defence lawyers is to be warmly welcomed.  
However, the resources assigned to this public service indispensable for the rule of law remain 
insufficient.  Public defenders appear to lack fundamental office equipment, such as computers </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>and reference materials.  The Working Group was told that they have difficulties visiting 
detention centres as they lack vehicles and fuel.  A further problem appears to be that the public 
defender assigned to a case may change repeatedly. 
</p>
<p>70. During the Working Group&#8217;s visit it emerged, however, that in addition to the lack of 
resources, the effectiveness of public defence is undermined also by the failure of many public 
defence lawyers to assertively play their role.  They appear to limit themselves to a purely formal 
role and passive presence at the hearings in which the legality and necessity of detention is 
decided on.  The Working Group has also received reports according to which public defence 
lawyers often press the defendants they assist to accept abridged proceedings or induce them to 
confess guilt in order to avoid a fully-fledged trial. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Excessive power of the police 
</b></p>
<p>71. Until a decade ago, the National Police were under control of the military and the 
military was itself strongly involved in internal security.  The police have since then been 
asserting themselves as a law enforcement force under civilian control.  However, they face 
formidable challenges:  in a country in which the population perceives crime and insecurity as 
dramatic problems, the police are only approximately 8,000 men and women strong.  By way 
of comparison, according to information received by the Working Group, there are more 
than 50,000 private often heavily armed security guards in Honduras.   
</p>
<p>72. The police also experience severe lack of material resources.  They do not have a 
sufficient number of vehicles to carry out their mandate, particularly in rural areas, and they do 
not have the means to purchase enough fuel to be able to use the vehicles whenever necessary.  
This can be the cause of detentions in violation of the law, such as when a suspect held in a 
police holding cell in a remote location cannot be brought before a judge, or when a minor 
cannot be immediately brought to one of the four IHNFA detention facilities, the only places 
minors can be lawfully held.  The police also lack advanced forensic equipment and training.  
The Working Group has further observed that not only the holding cells for suspects at police 
stations are degrading, but also - at least in some police stations - the living areas and sanitary 
facilities for the policemen. 
</p>
<p>73. While the shortage of resources weakens the police&#8217;s capacity to effectively perform its 
function, the law gives the Ministry of Security and the police excessive power in the criminal 
justice system.  In addition to its preventative mandate, the police are, through their General 
Directorate for Criminal Investigation (DGIC), in charge of the investigation of serious offences.  
While this function is in theory exercised under the direction of the public prosecution, in 
practice the 1998 law on the police has significantly weakened the control of the public 
prosecutors over criminal investigations by taking the DGIC away from the Public Prosecution 
and reincorporating it into the Ministry of Security.   
</p>
<p>74. As the National Police also runs the detention facilities, it exercises physical control over 
all persons in detention at all stages, and not only during the first 24 hours while they are in the 
holding cells of police stations.  Whether or not the police act in conformity with the law and in 
good faith, this situation seriously jeopardizes the integrity of the criminal process, which 
requires effective checks and balances. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>75. Moreover, although it has in general conformed its practice with the provisions of the 
criminal procedure code, the National Police continues in many instances to ill-treat detainees, 
both as a measure to further the investigative function assigned to it by law, and to maintain 
discipline in the detention facilities.<b>1</b>  Although there have certainly been efforts by some human 
rights prosecutors, who have opened proceedings regarding such abuses, it does not appear that 
their perpetrators are being effectively brought to justice.  The Working Group is very concerned 
by the apparent indifference of the majority of judges and prosecutors to the widespread 
ill-treatment of detainees by the police.   
</p>
<p><b>D.  The absence of a proper penitentiary system 
</b></p>
<p>76. As mentioned above, when detainees are transferred from police custody into the prison 
system, they continue to be under the control of the police.  They thus are dependent on the 
police in order to establish contact with their defence lawyer and in order to have petitions or 
motions delivered to the judge in charge of their case.  The Working Group was informed, both 
by detainees and by judges, of frequent instances in which the prison police fail to deliver 
judgements to a detainee, thereby preventing him or her from asking to be released or to exercise 
the right to appeal.  Moreover, the prison system completely lacks a functioning complaints 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>77. While the detainees are at the mercy of the police in the above-mentioned respects, the 
prison authorities (i.e. the police) have in fact, to a large extent, renounced their task to manage 
the detention centre.  Segregation between remand detainees and convicts, which is so 
emphatically prescribed in the Constitution and the laws, is non-existent in reality.  Food 
provided by the prison administration is minimal and most detainees rely on purchasing food for 
themselves.  Similarly lacking are hygienic and health services, adequate facilities and treatment 
for vulnerable groups such as detainees with serious bodily ailments and the mentally ill.  In the 
prisons of both San Pedro Sula and La Ceiba there is in practice no control over the interaction 
between male and female detainees.  The limits on the State budget allocated to the prisons and 
the pitiful remuneration of the police assigned to serve in prisons cannot justify the abdication 
from the public responsibility to provide the detainees with these services, which they currently 
can obtain only through constant unlawful payments and a bustling network of businesses run by 
the inmates, established or tolerated without any kind of control by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>78. This situation prevents the adequate design of a criminal justice policy in which the 
rehabilitation and reintegration into the community of the offender enjoys a primary importance.  
According to the director of the Penitenciar&#237;a Nacional, there is one social worker per thousand 
detainees in that prison.  As the Supreme Court has found in several decisions, the situation in 
the prisons violates article 87 of the Constitution of Honduras, which mandates the prison system 
with ensuring the rehabilitation of the detainees and their preparation for reintegration.  In its 
decision of 10 February 2006 on the habeas corpus petition brought by the Tegucigalpa human 
rights prosecutor on behalf of the detainees of the Penitencar&#237;a Nacional, the Supreme Court 
ordered the Ministry of Security to correct the situation in the Penitencar&#237;a Nacional within one 
year.  However, without a substantial increase in resources and a profound change in the attitude 
of the authorities, the Supreme Court decision is destined to remain a dead letter.   </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>79. A bill to create a separate, independent institution in charge of the penitentiary system 
was pending in the past legislature, and the Minister of Security informed the Working Group 
that the Government intends to revive this proposed legislation.  The Working Group considers 
that this would constitute a very important step in the direction outlined in the United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Constitution of Honduras.   
</p>
<p><b>E.  The situation of persons detained under the old criminal procedure code 
</b></p>
<p>80. The old criminal procedure code, providing for mandatory detention on remand and 
inquisitorial proceedings, continues to be applied to those who have been charged with an 
offence committed before the entry into force of the new system.  The Working Group is 
conscious of the reasons underlying the decision not to automatically extend the limits on 
preventive detention established in the new code to all defendants in preventive detention at the 
time the new code entered into force.  At that time, there were approximately 8,000 remand 
prisoners, and for many of them the maximum duration of remand detention under the new code 
had already been exceeded.  Immediately applying the new code to their cases would have meant 
the release - from one day to the other - of several thousand persons accused of serious crimes 
and would have caused justified alarm in the population. 
81. The current situation, however, is simply unbearable, as the discrimination between the 
two categories of prisoners lasts for more than four-and-a-half years by now.  While the Working 
Group has not been able to obtain reliable figures concerning the number of remand detainees 
awaiting trial under the old criminal procedure code, they are no less than 1,800, and probably 
significantly more.  These persons have been in detention without being found guilty of a crime 
for at least four-and-a-half years by now, in some cases identified by the Working Group more 
than 10 years.  The old code applied to them sets no time limits for the duration of the 
proceedings in their case and for the duration of their detention, and does not provide for their 
right to challenge continued remand detention or for ex officio control over the need therefore.  
The Working Group has further been informed that some <i>jueces de ejcuci&#243;n </i>refuse to deal with 
cases of persons held under the old code on the argument that, as the <i>juez de ejcuci&#243;n</i> was only 
established by the new code, they cannot be competent to deal with detainees whose trial is 
governed by the old code.  The Working Group was informed that this stance has been rejected 
by the Supreme Court in a recent decision, but it remains to be seen what fruits the Court&#8217;s 
decision will give in practice. 
</p>
<p>82. Instead of giving priority to the resolution of these cases, the prosecution and the courts 
are placing them &#8220;on the back burner&#8221;.  While this strategy is supported by the legitimate aim of 
using the scarce resources of the criminal justice system to comply with the deadlines provided 
by the current criminal procedure code for remand detention, the result is a serious violation of 
the right to a fair trial, which includes the right to be tried expeditiously, for those 1,800 or more 
detainees held under the old code.  Some interlocutors in the judiciary have pointed out to the 
Working Group that the transitional provisions governing the entry into force of the new code 
dictate that these cases shall be decided by the end of 2006.  This laudable goal, however, is by 
now completely unrealistic, and there do not appear to be any serious efforts under way to attain 
it.  On the contrary, the judicial authorities have informed the Working Group that they count on 
an extension of the deadline. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>83. Among the pretrial detainees held under the old criminal procedure code there is one 
category whose detention is particularly arbitrary:  persons found not guilty by the first 
instance court of the charges on which they have been deprived of their liberty for years, who 
now continue to be detained for years more because the prosecution has appealed the acquittal.  
The Working Group is relieved to have learned of two recent decisions of the Supreme Court in 
the case of four men in this situation ordering that they should be released.  Despite these 
Supreme Court judgements, it does not appear that the other detainees in the same tragic 
situation will be released as an immediate consequence of the Supreme Court rulings.  Their 
detention, which can only be qualified as arbitrary, thus continues. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Working Group expresses its concern with regard to the circumstance that despite 
the honesty of many professionals and officials in the administration of justice, corrupt practices 
would appear to continue to exist and are not fought with the necessary force and effectiveness.  
According to the 2006 Human Development Report for Honduras, less than a fifth of the 
population has trust in the justice system, with trust levels particularly low in rural areas and 
among the poorer population groups.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>85. Both during meetings with officials and representatives of civil society, the Working 
Group received numerous allegations of corruption among the judiciary.  It has moreover 
become clear that in the detention centres detainees have to make payments to the prison police 
in order to exercise their most basic rights and protect themselves against arbitrary detention, for 
instance in order to see the judge, to be handed the judgement in their case, to file an appeal. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Detention of members of youth gangs (<i>maras</i>) 
</b>86. As other Central American societies, Honduras is plagued with the phenomenon of the 
violent youth gangs (<i>maras</i>), which terrorize the population with extortion, robberies, and 
murders, the latter particularly in the fight between the two main gangs, the MS and the Mara 18.  
</p>
<p>87. Many countries deal with organized crime in its varied forms (from mafia to terrorist 
organizations) by making the membership itself of the criminal group a criminal offence, in 
addition to all the forms of criminal participation in offences perpetrated by the group, and 
international human rights law (e.g. art. 22 of the ICCPR) certainly allows for this.  Article 332 
of the Criminal Code, governing the offence of &#8220;illicit association&#8221; and commonly referred to as 
the &#8220;ley anti-maras&#8221;, is therefore not on its face incompatible with human rights law, although 
doubts can be expressed as to whether a term of imprisonment of 12 to 20 years is necessary in a 
democratic society for simple membership in a <i>mara</i>. 
</p>
<p>88. The practical application of article 332, however, does raise serious concerns.  The police 
(as well as the general public and <i>mara</i> members themselves) identify <i>mara</i> members by the 
tattoos they bear, highly visibly, all over their body.  As membership of an &#8220;illicit association&#8221; is 
a continuous offence, a tattooed young man or woman is permanently in flagrante delicto, and 
can be arrested by the police at any time without warrant and could be immediately rearrested 
upon release. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>89. Moreover, detention on remand is mandatory for persons detained on charges under 
article 332 of the Criminal Code.  This raises concern with regard to article 9 (3) ICCPR, 
providing that &#8220;[i]t shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in 
custody&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>90. In prison <i>mara</i> members, whether detained on remand or upon conviction, are segregated 
from the general population.  The police guarding the prison only ensure from outside that the 
prisoners do not escape, while inside the wing the <i>mara</i> leadership rules the life of the detainees 
without any interference by the authorities.  Rehabilitation and the preparation for a life outside 
the &#8220;illicit association&#8221; upon release thereby become all but impossible.  On the contrary, 
membership and hierarchical structures within the <i>mara</i> are cemented under the Government&#8217;s 
authority. 
</p>
<p>91. The Working Group also observes that it emerged clearly from its meetings with 
government officials that little effort is made to understand the phenomenon of the <i>maras</i> from a 
sociological and criminological point of view and its roots in poverty, lack of employment 
prospects for the adolescents and disintegration of the family structure.  Instead, the Government 
(and the media echoing the authorities) appear to be content to blame the <i>maras</i> for all or most of 
the violence and crime occurring in Honduras, which also is understood to relieve them from 
thoroughly investigating. 
</p>
<p>92. Finally, it cannot go unmentioned that more than 100 <i>mara</i> members have been killed in 
detention centres in the last four years under circumstances still awaiting clarification.  While 
these killings do not fall within the Working Group&#8217;s mandate, they are an integral part of the 
State&#8217;s response to the phenomenon of <i>maras</i> and further taint the policy under which <i>mara</i> 
members are detained. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Further issues of concern with regard to juvenile justice 
</b>93. The Working Group observed that, notwithstanding the reforms, judges continue to use 
deprivation of liberty as the primary means to combat juvenile delinquency.  Of particular 
concern is the general recourse to preventive detention with regard to youths accused of a 
serious offence.  In the centre &#8220;Renaciendo&#8221;, e.g. at the time of the Working Group&#8217;s visit 72 
out of 112 detainees were in preventive detention, and only 40 serving &#8220;socio-educational 
measures&#8221;.  Moreover, the juvenile justice system is understaffed.  There are only 9 or 
10 juvenile judges.  Although being a juvenile judge requires specific additional training and 
skills, the role is considered minor.  In parts of the country where there is no juvenile judge, 
young offenders will end up before the regular (adult) court system, at least during initial phase 
of criminal proceedings. 
</p>
<p>94. In the IHNFA facilities, far too little is done for the education of the minors and to teach 
them skills that will allow them to find a job upon release.  Moreover, as there are juvenile 
detention centres only in the Valle de Tamara near Tegucigalpa and in San Pedro Sula, young 
offenders are often isolated from their family and community.  These shortcomings risk standing 
in the way of IHNFA&#8217;s mission of putting the internees on a track that will not lead to relapsing 
into criminal activity once released. </p>

</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>95. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the legal and institutional framework governing 
deprivation of liberty in Honduras has profoundly changed:  the creation of the Human Rights 
Commissioner, the law on the Public Prosecutor, the creation of IHNFA and reform of juvenile 
justice, the creation of the public defenders&#8217; office, and, finally, the entry into force of the new 
criminal procedure code.  All these reforms have put Honduras in a much better position to 
respect and ensure the right of persons under its jurisdiction not to be arbitrarily deprived of their 
liberty. 
</p>
<p>96. In the Working Group&#8217;s opinion, there are two major institutional engineering initiatives 
which remain to be addressed:  establishing a real penitentiary system separate from the police, 
and measures to address the negative consequences of the &#8220;divorce&#8221; of the investigative police 
from the public prosecution. 
</p>
<p>97. The real challenge for Honduras, however, is to close the enormous gap between, on the 
one hand, the high standards set in its Constitution and laws and the reality on the other.  All 
institutions involved in the criminal justice system, from the judges and prosecutors to the police, 
to the private and public defence lawyers, are falling dramatically short of playing the eminent 
roles the Constitution and the laws assign to them.  The scarcity of material resources assigned to 
the system bears only part of the responsibility and should not be used as a convenient excuse.  
The primary victims of this failure are all those who - often guilty of an offence, sometimes 
innocent, but nearly always poor - end up in detention which, though in most cases lawful and 
justified at the beginning, becomes arbitrary as the checks on its legality and necessity fail to 
work.  But Honduran society at large can only suffer from this situation, which not only 
undermines the rule of law in the country, but also transforms the prisons in veritable &#8220;schools of 
crime&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>On the basis of its findings, the Working Group recommends the following 
measures.</b> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>With regard to the situation of the detainees held under the old criminal procedure 
code:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) All detainees held under the old criminal procedure code who have been 
acquitted in first instance should be released, in accordance with the Supreme Court 
judgements but without any need for further pronouncements of the Supreme Court.  This 
is a matter of urgency and can be solved within a few weeks; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) Significant resources need to be assigned to addressing the situation of 
preventive detainees held under the old code and priority should be given to solving their 
situation.  An ambitious but feasible time plan for resolving their cases should be drawn up 
expeditiously under the leadership of the Supreme Court.  There must be a time set in the 
not too distant future at which the rules on preventive detention of the new code shall apply 
to all detainees. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>100. <b>In order to strengthen the control over the legality of detention at all stages of the 
criminal justice process:</b> 
 <b>(a) All institutions in which persons are detained need to maintain complete and 
transparent records showing the legal basis for detention.  In particular, police stations 
need a single record book showing all information relevant to the case of each person 
passing through police custody, providing proof of the duration of each phase of custody 
and of the authority responsible, and certification by the relevant authority of all transfer 
of custody; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(b) <i>Jueces de ejecuci&#243;n</i> should carry out their mandate proactively as set forth in 
the criminal procedure code, and need to be equipped for the purpose (e.g. with vehicles 
and information technology); 
</b> <b>(c) Measures need to be taken to render public defence more effective.  These 
could include both providing material resources, such as offices, computers, vehicles, and 
providing training.  However, on a more fundamental level, thought will need to be given 
on how to strengthen their role as lawyers acting on behalf of a client, even if they are paid 
out of public funds; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(d) In all events, when the legal basis for deprivation of a person&#8217;s liberty has 
expired, whether held in a police station, a prison, or an IHNFA facility, the authority 
holding the detainee must release him or her, without any further need for a judicial 
decision. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Honduras needs to establish a penitentiary system as a separate institution, run by 
professional penitentiary management and staff, not connected to the police.  Such a 
separate system is necessary to prevent arbitrary detention and ensure that, as prescribed 
by the Constitution, detention is aimed at rehabilitation and preparation for a working life 
outside prison.</b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>In the meantime, already before legislation to this effect can be passed and put into 
practice, steps should be taken to bring the prison system closer to compliance with the 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.  Penitentiary facilities should 
respect the separation between remand and convict detainees; women should be held 
separately from men; persons with serious mental health problems and those terminally ill 
require special attention which is better provided outside prison.  Internal disciplinary and 
complaints procedures should be established and complied with, so that the rule of law 
extends to penitentiary facilities.</b> 
</p>
<p>103. <b>All branches of Government, seeking input from civil society as well, should 
reconsider the response of both the criminal justice system and the State in general to the 
young men and women belonging to <i>maras</i>.  The current system, based exclusively on 
repression, in particular rules governing detention which in practice violate international 
human rights law, does not appear to be able to either address the root of the problem or 
enhance the security of the population.</b> </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/40/Add.4 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Vigorous guarantees for defendants must  go hand in hand with a strong police and 
public prosecution service.  To this end, the investigative capacities of the public 
prosecution must be strengthened.  Serious thought should be given to providing the 
Ministerio P&#250;blico with its own investigative police, whether by reversing the 1998 
&#8220;divorce&#8221; between investigative police and public prosecution or otherwise.</b> 
</p>
<p>105. <b>On a more general level, the Working Group finds it useful to underline that in its 
experience it is through preventive action and vigorous, well-resourced law enforcement 
that rising crime levels are best fought.  Relaxing safeguards against arbitrary detention, 
which Honduras has strengthened through its recent criminal procedure reform, and 
thereby undermining the rule of law has not yet proved to be an effective way to respond to 
the justified demand of security of a society.
