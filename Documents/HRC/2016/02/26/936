   the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the United Nations, particularly with 
</p>
<p>regard to achieving international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction of any kind, such as 
</p>
<p>race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
</p>
<p>property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the obligation of States under the Charter of the United Nations to 
</p>
<p>promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the enhancement of international cooperation is essential for the 
</p>
<p>effective promotion and protection of human rights, which should be based on the 
</p>
<p>principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of 
</p>
<p>States to prevent human rights violations and comply with their human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>for the benefit of all human beings, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its mandate to promote advisory services, technical assistance and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building, to be provided in consultation with and with the consent of States 
</p>
<p>concerned, and provisions in Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 
</p>
<p>2007 and 16/21 of 25 March 2011 that aim to enable the Council to fulfil such a mandate, 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in rights, 
</p>
<p>and recalling the provisions of the Declaration on the Right to Development, which state 
</p>
<p>that human beings are the central subject of development and are entitled to participate in, 
</p>
<p>contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development, in which all 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, are of 
</p>
<p>crucial importance for all policies and programmes to eradicate poverty and promote 
</p>
<p>inclusive, equitable, people-centred and sustainable development, and that respect for and 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of effective work towards the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> proposed goals aimed at the eradication of poverty and promotion of 
</p>
<p>sustainable, inclusive and equitable development in the outcome document of the Open 
</p>

</p>
<p>promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and 
</p>
<p>political rights, in accordance with States&#8217; obligations under international human rights law, 
</p>
<p>and emphasizing that these proposed goals and considerations should be taken into account 
</p>
<p>in the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> that States have the primary responsibility for the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, and emphasizes the need to promote a cooperative and 
</p>
<p>constructive approach to international cooperation for the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and to enhance the role of the Human Rights Council in promoting advisory 
</p>
<p>services, technical assistance and capacity-building, particularly through the discussions 
</p>
<p>held under agenda item 10; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Reaffirms</i> <i>also</i> that each country must take primary responsibility for its own 
</p>
<p>development and that the role of national policies and strategies cannot be overemphasized 
</p>
<p>in the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and recognizes that 
</p>
<p>increased, effective national efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and 
</p>
<p>supportive international programmes, measures and policies, including technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation, aimed at expanding development opportunities and the building institutional 
</p>
<p>and technical capacities of developing countries, while taking into account national 
</p>
<p>conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership strategies and sovereignty, in line 
</p>
<p>with General Assembly resolution 67/224 of 21 December 2012 on the Second United 
</p>

</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To respond to the needs, and to promote the empowerment and realization of 
</p>

</p>
