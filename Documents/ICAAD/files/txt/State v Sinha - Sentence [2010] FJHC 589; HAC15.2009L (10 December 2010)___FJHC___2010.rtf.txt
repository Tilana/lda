MITIGATION

[5] You told me that you are 34 years of age, and prior to arrest you worked as a gardener and a farmer of root crops. You were educated to class 8 in Natadola, but you said you had a very unhappy childhood, your mother dying when you were 9 years old and your father thereafter taking a string of partners most of whom did not like you. Although you were academically bright your life was a life of drudgery having to do all of the household chores. Your first foray into dishonesty came when at 17 years of age, you stole a wallet from a tourist on Natadola beach, a crime which you told me rather alarmingly precipitated you into a long career of dishonesty. You have 16 previous convictions since 2000, all of them for dishonesty.

[6] You have a daughter of three years old, your wife having left you soon after you were charged with these offences. That little girl is now living with your mother-in-law who gave rather unsatisfactory evidence in mitigation on your behalf. She told me that she was struggling to support your daughter as well as a young girl of her own and she asked therefore that you be treated leniently so that you could be released early to help to provide for the family.

[7] You told me that your greatest worry about being incarcerated is that your daughter may fall prey to one or more of the many paedophiles abroad in this country. You claim to have received very little financial benefit from all of these offences  you tell me that two co-accused escaped to New Zealand with most of the money and your wife.

[8] You say that you have converted to Christianity (from Hinduism) in prison and that you will never come back before the Courts again. You have family land in Natadola where you wish to retire, farm and raise your daughter.

[9] The only true strength in your mitigation lies in your guilty pleas which save Court's time and the expense of what would have been at least three trials. Family circumstances carry little weight in mitigation because they are matters that should have been considered before embarking on a spree of crime.

OBTAINING MONEY BY FALSE PRETENCES

[10] One group of offences can be identified in those charged in the information. They are the offences of obtaining money by false pretences; thirty four offences altogether (1  28, 30, 35, 40, 45, 49 & 54). They all use the same modus operandi where you held yourself out to be a representative of an Australian employer and you took money from applicants for work, falsely advising them that the money (in most cases $555) was needed for a visa fee. Needless to say the money, nor a visa, nor the accused was even seen again. 

[11] The tariff for this offence under the Penal Code is from 18 months to five years; the difference being in the amount of money being obtained (Jona Saukilagi  HAC 21 of 2004).

[12] These offences were pre-meditated, cynical and despicable. They were all committed in the middle months of the year 2008 at a time when the unemployment rate was very high in Fiji and when young men (as most of these victims were) were desperate to find work to support their families and villages. The sum of $555 whilst not enormous must have been a huge amount for each of them to procure. This fact represents an aggravating feature of great force. I take as my starting point a term of two years and for the aggravating features referred to above as well as your lack of restitution I add to this sentence a further three years. You have entered unequivocal pleas of guilty which is very much to your credit and you tell me that you are remorseful (although a claim of remorse from a "conman" is not entirely convincing) and for these mitigating features I deduct a period of two years and six months; meaning that for each offence of obtaining money by false pretences you will serve a total term of two years and six months. These terms will be served concurrently with each other. Credit for time spent in custody has already been given to you by Justice Goundar in his recent sentence on you after you were convicted of 2 fraud offences (HAC 46 of 2008).

LARCENY

[13] You have pleaded guilty to one count of larceny (Count 29); the facts relating to that charge were that in collusion with another who worked at the Nadi Airport Office you stole 8 cheques drawn by FIRCA made payable to third parties all for a total mount of $213,843.84. This theft then enabled you to commit further offences of forgery and obtaining funds on the strength of those forgeries.

[14] Having been convicted previously of four larceny offences since the year 2000, the maximum penalty for this offence is ten years. Despite this high maximum and despite your shocking record, the tariff remains within the range of nine months to three years. As Shameem J said in Saukilagi (supra):

"The tariff for simple larceny on first conviction is 2 to 9 months and on second conviction a sentence in excess of 9 months. In cases of larceny of large amounts of money sentences of 1  years imprisonment and 3 years imprisonment have been upheld by the High Court (Sevanaia Via Koroi  C.A. HAA 31 of 2001). Muchdepends on the value of the money stolen and the nature of the relationship between victim and defendant. The method of stealing is also relevant."

[15] The theft of these cheques cannot be viewed as a simple larceny. It was a premeditated calculated theft of cheques belonging to the Fiji Government, and cheques destined for rightful recipients of government money through the agency of FIRCA. By stealing them, you interfered in Government to citizen financial transactions which greatly increases the severity of the offence. I take as a starting point for this offence a term of three years, considering the aggravation referred to earlier as well as reflecting the large value of the property stolen. Your plea of guilty entitles you to a discount of one year from that starting point which means you will serve a total of two years for this offence.

FORGERY GROUP 1

[16] There then follows a group of forgery offences of which you have been convicted. These forgeries are all forgeries of the eight FIRCA cheques stolen by you where you fraudulently altered the name of the payee on each cheque, thereby enabling you to commit other offences (which are irrelevant to the sentence on these offences). These altered (and therefore forged) cheques are the subject of Counts 32, 37, 43, 47, 48, 51, 56 and 59 on the information.

[17] The maximum penalty for forgery under the Penal Code is fourteen years imprisonment and the leading Fiji authorities of Kesi (HAC 24 of 2009) and Hu Jun Yun (HAA 24/2005) set a tariff range of 18 months to three years. For each of these forgery offences I take a starting point of three years, reducing each to a term of two years to reflect your plea of guilty. Each term of two years will be served concurrently with each other.

FORGERY GROUP 2

[18] You have been convicted of six forgery counts where you have altered the passports of six persons by way of "photosubstitution" (Counts 31, 36, 41, 46, 50 and 55). For these offences I sentence you to the same term of two years as I did for the forgery of the cheques (and for the same reasons). These sentences will be served concurrently with each other.

UTTERING

[19] You stand convicted of six counts of uttering: that is to say uttering six of the eight FIRCA cheques that you forged. Two of the cheques were not uttered but surrendered to the Police for investigation. (The uttering counts are Counts 33, 38, 43, 52, 57 and 60). The uttering is part and parcel with the forgeries and for the same reasons given for the forgery sentences, I sentence you to two years on each of the uttering charges to be served concurrently with each other. (These two year terms include a discount for your plea of guilty.

OBTAINING MONEY ON A FORGED DOCUMENT

 [20] You have convicted of five counts of obtaining money on a forged document (Counts 34, 39, 44, 53 and 58) and one count of causing payment of funds by virtue of a forged document (Count 61). These counts are derived from the uttering of the forged cheques where in five instances you obtained the money represented by the sums written on the cheques and in Count 61 you enabled another to obtain a very large sum of Government funds. For the five counts of obtaining money on a forged document I sentence you to the same two year sentence (taking into account your guilty plea) and each of these sentences is to be served concurrently with each other (i.e. Courts 34, 39, 44, 53 and 58).

[21] For Count 61, whereby you enabled one Faiyaz Khan to obtain $186,561 by means of a forged FIRCA cheque, the criminality is much more serious. I take a starting point of four years and deduct 16 months for your guilty plea. You will serve two years and eight months for this offence concurrently with the sentences on the other five obtaining money on a forged document counts.

HABITUAL OFFENDER

[22] The Sentencing and Penalties Decree 2009 makes provision for enhancing sentences for habitual offenders, however most unfortunately fraud offences are not covered by the offences listed on section 10. There is no obvious reason why they should not be, because offences of fraud including forgery, uttering, obtaining by deception etc are offences of great addiction leading to chronic recidivism. As this Court said in Atil Sharma (HAC 122 of 2010L) whether it was an intentional omission by the legislature or not, offences of fraud should be included in the categories listed in section 10, if but for the very protection of the gullible, the unsophisticated, the impressionable and the community at large. I would urge the authorities concerned to consider amending section 10 of the Decree by adding to the list of offences there, offences involving fraud or deception.

[23] Nevertheless, despite there being no provision for you to be legally classified as at habitual offender, I do for the purposes of this sentence regard you as such. I will call you a serious repeat offender, and will apply the same principles that can be applied to habitual offenders. With your very long history of dishonesty and fraud, the community at large (including banking institutions) must be protected from you; and your spree of crime between 10th May 2008 and 31st August 2008 must be visited with appropriate punishment. It is only proper that the offences of which you are convicted attract terms of imprisonment that are within the established tariffs and without removing all hope of rehabilitation for you, condign punishment can be visited upon you by means of concurrent and consecutive sentences. The sentences you will serve therefore are as follows:


	Counts	1 -	2 year 6 months
		2 -	2 year 6 months
		3 -	2 year 6 months
		4 -	2 year 6 months
		5 -	2 year 6 months
		6 -	2 year 6 months
		7 -	2 year 6 months
		8 -	2 year 6 months

		14 -	2 year 6 months
		15 -	2 year 6 months
		16 -	2 year 6 months
		17 -	2 year 6 months
		18 -	2 year 6 months
		19 -	2 year 6 months
		20 -	2 year 6 months
		21 -	2 year 6 months
		22 -	2 year 6 months
		23 -	2 year 6 months
		24 -	2 year 6 months
		25 -	2 year 6 months
		26 -	2 year 6 months
		27 -	2 year 6 months
		28 -	2 year 6 months
		30 -	2 year 6 months
		35 -	2 year 6 months
		40 -	2 year 6 months
		45 -	2 year 6 months
		49 -	2 year 6 months
		54 -	2 year 6 months


These terms will all be served concurrently with each other.


	Counts	29  -	2 years	Concurrent with 32
to 59, and with 31 to 55.
				
	Counts	32  -	2 years	Concurrent with each other.
		37  -	2 years	
		42  -	2 years	
		47  -	2 years	
		48  -	2 years	
		51  -	2 years	
		56  -	2 years	
		59  -	2 years	
				
	Counts	31  -	2 years	Concurrent with each 
other and concurrent 
with 32 to 39.

		36  -	2 years	
		41  -	2 years	
		46  -	2 years	
		50  -	2 years	
		55  -	2 years	
				
	Counts	33  -	2 years	Concurrent with each
other and concurrent 
with 29, 32 to 59, and
31 to 55.
		38  -	2 years	
		43  -	2 years	
		52  -	2 years	
		57  -	2 years	
		60  -	2 years	
				
	Counts	34 -	2 years	All concurrent with
each other and 
concurrent to Count 61.

		39 -	2 years	
		44 -	2 years	
		53 -	2 years	
		58 -	2 years	
				
	Count	61 -	2 years	8 months


[24] As this Court said in Etuate Suguturaga  HAC 43 of 2009L offences of obtaining on forged instruments must stand apart from their cognate offences of forgery and uttering, for the very reason that the obtaining or the fraudulent result of forgery and uttering and in this case as in Suguturaga it is effecting a commercial fraud on legitimate financial institutions. Bearing this nefariousness in mind, and in view of you being a serious repeat offender the sentences for Counts 34, 39, 44, 53, 58 and 61 whilst concurrent with each other will be served consecutively to the other sentences; making a total sentence to be served by you to be one of five years and two months.

[25] Whilst I am aware of the provisions of section 22(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree, 2009, I nevertheless direct that this term will be served consecutively to any existing sentence you are serving, and you will not be eligible for parole until you have served four years of this sentence.

[26] You have already received credit for time spent in custody while awaiting trial by Goundar J. in your case number HAC 46 of 2008.
