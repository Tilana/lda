SUMMING UP

1.      
ROLE OF THE JUDGE AND ASSESSORS.

Madam Assessor and Gentlemen Assessors:

(i)     
The learned Prosecutor, Ms. Low and the learned defence counsel, Mr. Maopa had concluded their duties in this trial by tendering evidence to support their respective cases and making their closing submissions. There will be no more evidence or submissions in this trial. It is now my duty to sum up the case to you. 

(ii)    
You will be given the opportunity to retire for your deliberations after my summing up. Once, each of you, madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, reach to a conclusion on your final opinion, the court will re-convene and your individual opinion will be asked. You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions at any time. The opinions of you three need not to be unanimous. Nevertheless, it would be desirable if you could agree on the final opinion. As the presiding judge of this case I am not bound by your opinions in delivering the final judgment of the court. Nevertheless, I assure you, that due weight and recognition will be given to your opinions when I deliver the final judgment.

(iii)   
In my Summing Up I will direct you on the relevant areas of law which apply to this particular instance. You must accept that legal position and act upon that. In another words, you must apply the law as I direct you to the facts of this case. Facts, as you heard and saw in this court room, are entirely within your domain. You are the masters of the facts or judges of the facts of this case. It is entirely up to you madam assessor and gentlemen assessors to determine whether Mr. Ravinesh Deo, (herein after referred as the 1st accused) and Mr. Ashneel Kamal (herein after referred as the 2nd accused) committed the offence of "Arson" by setting fire to the Westpac Bank branch in Labasa. 

(iv)    
In reaching to your final opinion, you have to rely on the evidence you saw and heard, from the witness box and the documentary evidence tendered in court, which includes the CCTV footages as well, and nothing else. You should simply disregard what you saw or heard from the printed or electronic media regarding this case or any related incidents before or during the trial. At the same time, any views or opinions expressed by your friends, family members, relatives or anybody should face the same fate. It is you who have to draw your own conclusions based on the evidence in this case. 

(v)     
 The learned counsel for the prosecution and the defence, when making their closing submissions highlighted certain facts and tried to formulate their opinions according to their case theories. You need not to accept those versions unless you agree with their contentions. Same principle applies to me as well. If I express any opinion or appear to do so regarding any of the facts, do not follow it, simply because it came from the Judge. It is solely your task to form your own opinions. In my summing up I might not touch all the areas or evidence which you think to be important. Please feel free to give due consideration to all the evidence you see fit, though I mention it or not.

(vi)    
You have to decide the credibility and truthfulness of each and every witness. In doing so, you can rely on not only what you heard, but what you saw as well. The way witnesses offered evidence from the witness box, how they face the cross examination, were they firm on their stand or evasive, can be helpful in determining their demeanor and in turn to judge their credibility as well. In furtherance to assessing the trustworthiness of the witnesses, in this instance, you have to pay a considerable amount of attention to the set of documents tendered to the court by the parties as well. This is a case basically depended on documents such as the two caution interview statements and the two charge statements of the two accused. Apart from assessing the truthfulness and the credibility of the witnesses, you are supposed to follow the same procedure in respect of the documents as well. 

(vii)   
I would like to emphasis that madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, you were chosen to be the judges of facts of this trial as you represent a cross section of the pulse of the society. Your common sense and the experience in day to day life must come into operation when you deliberate this case. That common sense and the life experience have to be utilized in deciding or assessing the credibility or honesty of witnesses and truthfulness of their evidence. In that task, you have the liberty to accept the whole version of a testimony of a witness or a portion of that testimony and reject the rest. You can refuse to accept even the whole testimony of a witness.

(viii)  
I must inform you that you must not be prejudiced or sympathetic towards anybody or any party involved in this case. You saw the photographs which provided you a rough idea of the damage caused to the bank premises. Prosecution alleges that the loss of this fire is over FJD 1million. This back ground does not warrant for you to be sympathetic or over emotional towards the complainant bank and be harsh on the accused. Your final opinion should not be tainted with passion towards anybody. Anyway, remind yourselves the oath that you administered at the commencement of this process, "give your true opinion without fear, favour or ill will in accordance with the evidence and law".

2.      
THE BURDEN OF PROOF

(i)     
When approaching the matter in hand, you madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, I would like to draw your attention to certain basic rules which govern our criminal justice system. The accused are presumed to be innocent, though they are charged before this court with one count of 'Arson', until they are found guilty by this court. Proving their guilt is the sole burden of the prosecution, as it was the prosecution, who accuses the accused of committing the offence of "Arson". The duty of the prosecution to prove the case against the accused continues throughout the trial and it never shifts to the accused. The law does not impose any obligation or duty upon the accused to prove their innocence or otherwise.

(ii)    
When proving the case against the accused, the law expects the prosecution to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. That means the prosecution must prove the case for you to be 'sure' of the guilt of the accused and nothing else will discharge their burden. There is no specific formula where you can have a mathematical precision to be 'sure'. It is all about your day to day experiences and common sense come into play once again. The ultimatum is that you, madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, must be 'sure' of the guilt of the accused based on the presented evidence in court by the prosecution. If you have a 'reasonable doubt' over the guilt of the accused the benefit of such doubt should immediately be awarded to the accused. Such a doubt, as stated, should definitely be a 'reasonable doubt'. A mere possible doubt or trivial and imaginary doubts will not create a reasonable doubt. It should be an actual or substantial doubt which shakes the foundation of the case of the prosecution. The doubts should stem out of the evidence what you saw and heard in court.

3. LAW

(i) Now you know that there are two accused who are facing one charge of "Arson".
When the prosecution discharges their burden of proving the allegation beyond reasonable doubt, they have to present evidence separately against both the accused to prove the allegation against each accused. Therefore you have to consider the case against each accused separately. The evidence against each accused is different and your opinion must be based on the available evidence for each accused.

(ii) Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors;

You are well aware by now that it is alleged by the prosecution that both the accused did make confessions to the police whilst they were in the police custody, implicating them to the offence charged.

(iii) The prosecution says those confessions were made voluntarily by the accused and therefore, you may rely on those. In contrary, both the accused say that they were assaulted, forced, induced and the police officer used their authority to obtain the said 'confessions'. It is the duty of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged two caution interview statements and charge statements of the two accused made voluntarily to the police. A 'confession 'to a person in authority, like the police officers in this instance, is a strong piece of evidence against its author or maker. But, you have to be satisfied on two things before you proceed to accept it. First, you must be sure that the 'confession' was made freely and voluntarily in its makers own free will, but not as a result of threats, assaults, promises or inducements made to him. Secondly, you have to decide that the contents of the confessions are truthful or not. If you are sure that the confessions were made voluntarily and the contents of it are true, you can rely on those confessions when considering your opinions. If the confessions do not meet the two fold requirements to your fullest satisfaction, you are entitled to disregard them.

(iv) There is another directive that I have to give you on the above discussed issue of confessions. A 'confession,' if you are ready to accept as evidence after meeting the two tests stated above, can be considered only against its maker. Whatever the implications or references to the co-accused should be disregarded when considering the co-accused's case. For instance, if the 1st accused had implicated the 2nd accused in his confession, you cannot take that implication into account when you consider the 2nd accused's case.

(v) You would recall that two doctors offered evidence during the trial. Being experts of their field, they are entitled to formulate their opinions in the field of medicine. The defense submitted that Doctor Krishna possesses only an experience of 5 years at the time of the examination of the 2nd accused and that is comparatively low when considered Doctor Farrales. But, it is you who have to decide whether you are going to accept or not those opinions formulated by the two medical personalities.

(vi) Finally, I direct you as a matter of law that when two or more persons get together
after forming a common intention to commit an unlawful act in conjunction with one another, and when an offence is committed as a probable result of such unlawful act each of them are deemed to have committed the offence in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. Here, in this instance, the prosecution says that the two accused shared a common intention and acted in joint enterprise to set fire to the bank. It is your task to decide whether or not the claim of the prosecution is been supported by their evidence.

He said he does not know why he was arrested on 31st December 2012, when he was in Royale Diner Hotel with Mr. Ashneel Kamal.

(ii)    
Recalling the events on 30th December 2012, Mr. Deo said that they were drinking beer at Royale Diner Hotel and went to North Pole Hotel and to 'Fusion' night club and then came back to Royale Diner Hotel. On 31st December 2012 morning, Mr. Deo said that he heard somebody knocking the door while they were sleeping and he went and opened the door. Then, he said several police officers including Mani and Aisea came inside the room and started punching and kicking to his face, ribs, chest and the back of his body. They had assaulted the 2nd accused as well. Mr. Deo had fallen on the ground as a result of the said assault. From the hotel room, he had been taken to Labasa police station, while the 2nd accused was still in the hotel room.

(iii)   
Mr. Deo said that he was assaulted again at the 2nd floor by 5  6 police officers with kicks and punches to his chest, ribs and the nose while been hand cuffed. He said Ashneel was brought to the station while he was sitting on the floor, after this assault. Talking about the 'black bag', Mr. Deo said that it was on a table when he was taken to the 2nd floor of the station and the officer asked him whether it belongs to him or not. He had told 'no'. The police officers had assaulted him while showing the items inside the black bag. Mr. Deo said that one police officer was writing 'something' while talking to him for about 1 hour and at last he signed those papers. He said he does not know what 'interview' is and he did not know that he was been interviewed at that time.

(iv)    
He claimed that his bruise was paining with some chest pains and though he told it to Sergeant Mani and other police officers they did not take him to the hospital. Mr. Deo stressed that even on 01st January 2013, he told the police officers that he did not set fire to the bank and the officers assaulted to his chest area. Referring to the 'reconstruction' of the scene, Mr. Deo said that he was assaulted again by the officers when he refused to climb to the bank roof, and in fact, officers showed him how to do so. He confirmed telling to his interviewing officer at the roof top of the bank that he did not set fire. One officer had assaulted Mr. Deo at that place as well. He denied making any statement during the charging process. Finally, he said that he informed the Magistrate about his injuries when he was first produced before court and he was referred for medical examination by the court. Mr. Deo firmly said that he did not set fire to Westpac and all in the statements are a lie. 

(v) Mr. Ashneel Kamal offered evidence next. He said that he was assaulted by slapping at the Royale Diner Hotel by Sergeant Mani on 31st December 2012, upon their arrest. Police Officer Vikash had kicked him on the way to Labasa Police Station. Mr. Kamal had seen the 1st accused with hand cuffs and bleeding lips, when he was taken to the Crime Office. Mr. Kamal had been assaulted at the Crime Office as well by kicking him to the back of his thighs. He said that the police officers forced him to tell that the 'black bag' belongs to the 1st accused. Upon agreeing to that, Mr. Kamal had been taken to where the 1st accused was kept. He had seen the 1st accused in pain around his 'ribs area'. Sergeant Mani had been slapping the 1st accused even at that time. Then Mr. Kamal had been taken to another room and assaulted with kicks and slaps by Sergeant Mani, Aisea and Vimal. He had fallen on the ground with the kicks.


(vi) Then he had been taken to Delailabasa Police Post by Sergeant Mani and Aisea. Sergeant Mani had assaulted Mr. Kamal at the Police Post and then left. Mr. Kamal said that one hand cuff was locked to a leg of a table while he was in Delailabasa Post. When Sergeant Mani and the team escorted him back to Labasa Police Station, Mr. Kamal said that Sergeant Mani promised to release him, give him money and look for a permanent job if he says that 1st accused's injury was due to a fight which took place at Pontoon night club. Mr. Kamal claimed that he did not know what they wrote and simply signed in the papers that the police officers gave him.


(vii) Mr. Kamal said that he was released on the following day and Sergeant Mani dropped him at home. But, he had to come again to sign the statement which was tendered to court marked as Defense Exhibit No. 02. Mr. Kamal denied the contents in the said document. Referring to his 2nd arrest, Mr. Kamal said that he was again assaulted with slaps and pushes by Mani. The police officers had twisted his ears. He had taken out of the police station to go to Korowiri, Y junction and at last to Westpac Bank with the hand cuffs. He had climbed the back gate of the bank to reach the roof top as ordered by the police officers. He had got a cut on his palm over a roofing iron.

(viii) The video footage had been shown to Mr. Kamal as well. He said that he did not recognize anybody in that. He refused him telling police officers that one out of the 'two figures' is him. The police officers had gone to his house and picked clothes of him, while he was in the police van. Mr. Kamal said that one of two trousers produced in court belongs to his father. He denied making any statement when he was charged. Mr. Kamal said that he told the Magistrate about his 'cut' on the palm when he was produced before court. He confirmed that he got his medical examination done at Labasa hospital and told the doctor what happened to him. Mr. Kamal totally denied the allegation of setting fire to the bank premises and making confessionary statements to the police during the caution interview and charging process.

9. ANALYSIS

(i) Madam assessor and gentlemen assessors,

 I have summarized you the evidence of both sides, as you heard and saw for several days. I saw you taking down notes when the evidence was offered from the witness box. So, I have no doubt that you are still fresh with your memories of what took place within the four corners of the court room and therefore I do not wish to analyze the evidence to a greater extent. The fact that there was a fire which caused a damage of over FJD 1 Million to the Labasa branch of the Westpac Bank is not in dispute. The issue to be determined here is whether the two accused willingly and unlawfully set fire to the bank or not. Paragraph # 05 of the Agreed Facts says that the two accused were in Labasa town between the 11th and 12th of December 2012. But, the 1st accused did tell in his evidence that he was at home during the material time. The 2nd accused could not recall where he was on that day.

(ii)    
Now you know that the only available evidence against the two accused is their
caution interview statements and charge statements. There is no direct or circumstantial evidence against them. I have already directed you as a matter of law, that if you are sure that the two accused made those statements voluntarily to the police officers and the contents of those statements are to be true, you can use the said statements against the two accused without any problem. Now it is left to you to decide which side of the story you are going to accept and believe.

(iii) The prosecution says that they have proved it beyond reasonable doubt or for you to be sure that the two accused made 'confessions' voluntarily, without any force, threat, inducement or promise. To support their version, the prosecution heavily relies on the two medical reports tendered to court marked as Exhibit No. 18 and 19. Prosecution Exhibit No. 18, the medical report prepared by Doctor Krishneel Kishna after examining the 2nd accused, says; 

D (11) Initial Impression
"Nil obvious distress noted" 

D (12) Specific Medical Findings 
"(a) There is no obvious discoloration/swelling on the face or neck.
(b) There is no obvious long deformities on the x-ray of the right forearm.
(c) There is no discoloration or swelling on the right and left thighs
(d) There is no discoloration or swelling noted on the hand. 
(e) There is no obvious swelling/deformities seen on right forearm.
(f)There is no obvious swelling/deformities seen on left knee.

D (14)  Professional Opinion
"It is difficult to comment on age of injuries as it has been more than one week of the date of the incident and there is no obvious injuries evident now".

 The learned prosecutor highlighted that these observations and findings were recorded after the 2nd accused narrated the following 'history' to Dr. Krishna.

"Victim was allegedly assaulted on 31st December 2012. Kicked in the stomach in safety boot, stepped on left knee, right hand, punched on the back of the head, kicked on both thighs and back. He was also allegedly assaulted on 04th January. 
He was kicked on the back of the right knee, back and slapped on the face."

Therefore, it was argued by the learned prosecutor, that the allegation leveled by the 2nd accused against the police officer is a fabrication as had it been true, the doctor should have noticed a patient who was in much more severe condition. She said that not only the doctor had observed nil injuries, but the much highlighted cut injury on 2nd accused's palm was also not to be in existence. The learned prosecutor stressed that the discharge of the 2nd accused on 01st January 2013, due to lack of evidence, shows the fairness of the way that the police performed their duties.

Referring to Prosecution Exhibit No. 19, the learned prosecutor said that the history narrated to Doctor Farrales by the 1st accused on 02nd January 2013 is totally different from what he said in court.

"He was allegedly punched by a Fijian police officer at Royale Hotel, Labasa at 9.00am Sunday (30/12/12)".

It was highlighted by the prosecution that all what Dr. Farrales had observed in the 1st accused is a bruise and 'slight tenderness' in certain parts of the body. The doctor in his evidence, admitted that a 'tenderness' means a 'response by the patient to a touch'. The doctor agreed with the learned prosecutor that the patient can pretend that he is in pain to a touch, though it is not the truth. Further, he admitted that he could have observed 'remarks' on the body of the 1st accused had he been kicked and punched and slapped by several police officers, especially who were wearing the safety boots, for number of times. Commenting on the 'lip injury', the doctor said that it looked like 'swollen' from outside and it was 'yellowish' only from inside. He said there could be other reasons such as hitting the lip on a table or floor or even self inflicted, instead of an 'assault'. Having considered the 'yellowish' color, the doctor said it could be 07-10 days old injury. When confronted with the doctor's evidence, the 1st accused said that even his nose was bleeding and the doctor did not write down the injuries that he showed to him. The learned prosecutor argued that the 1st accused is lying to court about his injuries as the bruise on the lip would have caused from something else and he deceived the doctor by pretending to be painful when touching certain parts of his body.

(iv) Her contention was that the police officers never assaulted the 1st accused, but treated him humanly by giving him a good rest of over 5 hours before recording the caution interview and offering him all the legal rights. The prosecution highlighted that Mr. Deo's interviewing officer had even recorded that Mr. Deo told him at the roof top of the bank during the reconstruction of the crime scene that neither he had cut the bank roof nor he had set the fire to the bank and that itself is evident of the fair manner the investigation was conducted. This caution interview notes to that effect is as follows;

1542hrs: 'At the roof of the Westpac bank the suspect then told me that he had not burned the Westpac bank neither he had cut the roof of the building.'

Q295: Since you have shown me all the places from where you have climbed the roof of the Westpac bank and upon climbing the roof of the Westpac bank you have told me that you have not set the fire to the Westpac bank. Can you tell me that have you set fire to the bank or no?
A295: Yes I had set the fire to the bank.

Q296: Why then upon climbing the roof of the Westpac bank with the police you have told the police that you had not set fire to the Westpac bank?
A296: When I climbed the roof of the bank again, I was frustrated and afraid and I lied to the police that I have not set the fire to the Westpac bank.

Q297: Why were you afraid?
A297: Because I saw the same place where I had cut the tin and set the fire again I got frightened.

Q298: Is this true that you had cut the roof top of Westpac bank and set fire to it?
A298: Yes.

Citing the above, the prosecution argued that the police officers had done their maximum to conduct the interviews fairly, without any violence and they could 
have easily avoided recording this, if they really wanted to do so.

(v) The crux of the prosecution argument is that you should accept the voluntariness and truthfulness of the contents of the caution interviews and charge statements of the two accused. Now you have to deliberate the prosecution evidence and assess the weight that you are going to attach to that.

(vi) The story of the defense is totally different. The 1st accused avers that he was continuously assaulted by the police officers from the point of arrest at Royal Diner Hotel until he was charged on 01st of January 2013. The assaults vary from slaps, kicks and punches to his face, ribs, chest, thighs and back of the body. Apart from the 'bruise' on his left lower lip, he claims that even he had a bleeding nose and fell on the floor for two times as a result of the said assaults by the police officers.

(vii) Mr. Deo maintained the position throughout his evidence that he told the police 
Officers that he did not set fire to the bank and even the 'black bag' containing several 'items' did not belong to him. He said the pieces of mosquito nets alleged to have found inside the 'black bag' and from his house are different from each other. He confirmed telling the interviewing officer at the roof top of the bank that he did not set fire. Mr. Deo claimed that he simply signed the papers given to him by the police officers without reading what was written in those papers. The suggestion of the learned prosecutor that certain things stated in the caution interview like that Mr. Deo had to pay the debts for his mother's land are exclusively known to him, Mr. Deo said that the police wrote things by their own and forced him to sign.

(viii) Referring to the statement alleged to have made by him during the charging that 
"the fire which I set in the Westpac Bank is a really biggest mistake I did and I ask forgiveness for that and assure not to do such things again," Mr. Deo said that he never made such a statement. His contention is that he was assaulted, threatened, forced and induced to sign the caution interview statement and the charge statement. Therefore Mr. Deo says he did not admit the charge or allegation of setting fire to Westpac bank and the contents of the statements are not true. You madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, now have to assess the version of the 1st accused separately, as I have directed you earlier, to see whether it appeals to your common sense or not.

(ix) Mr. Ashneel Kamal, the 2nd accused also claims that he was assaulted by the
police officers by kicks and slaps to his face and thighs, for almost 7 - 8 different times. Apart from the assaults, Mr. Kamal claimed that Sergeant Mani offered him a good job and payments if he implicates the 1st accused to the Westpac fire. He maintained from the very beginning that he always denied the allegation leveled against him and never made the statement "I have made a mistake and will never repeat this again" during charging. His position is that the police officers wrote whatever they want and given the paper for him to sign.

(x) Referring to the injury free medical report, Mr. Kamal said that he had injuries and he showed it to the doctor as well. The learned prosecutor asked whether the cut injury on the palm got disappeared when doctor examined him. Mr. Kamal said he showed that injury to the Magistrate as well. Mr. Kamal denied him admitting his presence at the bank premises on 11th December night and said he could not identify anybody by watching the video footages shown to him.

(xi) He admitted that he lodged a complaint against Sergeant Mani at the Namuka building over the alleged assaults, though he is not aware of the outcome of the same. He said that he was afraid to complain about Mani to anybody while he was at large from 01st of January 2013 to 04th January 2013. Now it is your task to weigh the evidence given by Mr. Kamal and see whether you are ready to accept and act upon on his version.

(xii) The CCTV footages played a significant role during the trial. You were shown the footages relied upon by the prosecution. It is the contention of the prosecution that though any specific person cannot be identified from the footages, the 2nd accused admitted his participation to the crime as it is clear from the recording the type of shoes that the two persons were wearing. The learned defense counsel argues that the video footages do not take you anywhere as it could only be seen below the knee level of two figures. Now you have to decide madam assessor and gentlemen assessors what claim appeals to your practical and common sense most.

(xiii) Apart from the specific allegations of assaults by the two accused, the learned 
Defense counsel points out to several issues pertaining to the records maintained by the police officers. You would recall that the learned defense counsel showed the time difference of the Station Diary and the Cell Book Diary, 08.55 hours, and 09.55 hours, on 31st December 2012 in respect of the 1st accused putting inside the cell, after the verbal interrogation in the 2nd floor at Labasa Police Station. The other instance is that the non-availability of records when the 2nd accused was taken to Delailabasa Police Post on 31st December 2012 and bringing him back to Labasa Police Station. Even the non-availability of the 'white gallon,' alleged to have found on the roof top, for the inspection of court during the trial was also highlighted by him. It was stressed that not a single finger print was identified at the scene and in particular, on this white gallon, if it was recovered from the roof top as alleged. The preparation of two Search Warrants, one to Royale Diner Hotel (Prosecution Exhibit No 12 B ) and the other to North Pole Hotel (Defense Exhibit No. 01) was questioned by the learned counsel whilst pointing that the search list prepared out of the items alleged to have taken into custody from the 'black bag', states as 'North Pole'. All these issues were highlighted to show that the investigation was not done legally and fairly and thus caused unfairness to the accused. At the end of the day you have to determine whether or not these factors caused any unfairness to the accused, during the investigating process, when determining the voluntariness of the 'confessions'.

(xiv) Finally, the 'black bag' alleged to have been recovered with certain items,
attracted much attention of both parties. The prosecution said that it clearly connects the 1st accused with the 'fire' in issue when considering the items found inside. It was highlighted that the piece of mosquito net, the tin cutter and the spanner clearly show the intention of the accused to set fire again to the bank. On the other hand, the defense argued that these items do not connect the 1st accused to the crime and were just some 'items', if at all those were recovered from the possession of the 1st accused. But, the 1st accused denied in court his involvement with the bag. You madam assessor and gentlemen assessors have to decide in which way that you are going to think of this 'black bag' after analyzing the presented evidence in court.

10. SUMMARY

(i)     
Now it is the time for you to retire for your deliberations. I remind you once again madam assessor and gentlemen assessors, that the prosecution must prove to your fullest satisfaction that the two caution interviews (Prosecution Exhibit No. 05 and 07) and charge statements (Prosecution Exhibit No. 06 and 08) of the two accused which contain admissions to the commission of the crime was in fact made voluntarily and are true in content. If you are sure of that, you may return with an opinion of 'guilty'.

(ii)    
If you are not sure of the voluntariness or truthfulness of those confessions, the benefit of your doubts should be awarded to the accused immediately and must return with an opinion of 'Not Guilty'. Please remind once again that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the elements of the charge of 'arson' individually against each accused. The accused do not have any burden what so ever. The fact that you do not believe the narrations of the two accused do not necessarily mean that the prosecution proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. Still they must establish all the elements of the charge to your fullest satisfaction.

(iii)   
Your possible opinions in this instance are 'GUILTY' or 'NOT GUILTY' to the charge of 'arson'. You will have to express separate opinion on each accused and that is why you were directed to consider evidence separately against each accused.

(iv)    
Before you retire for your deliberations, may I know whether there are any re-directions or further directions to be given to the assessors.
