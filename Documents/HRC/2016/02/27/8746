<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of  
judges and lawyers, Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque 
e Silva</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The report of the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers 
examines the need for continuing education in international human rights law for 
magistrates, judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers. The report begins by 
stressing the interconnected nature of the rule of law, democracy, the principle of 
separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary and the independence and 
impartiality of magistrates and judges. It refers to efforts that have already been undertaken 
by organs of the international community to identify the need for continuing legal 
education and training to enable magistrates, judges and lawyers to apply international 
human rights standards, norms and principles in the consideration of domestic cases. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur notes that, despite numerous reports, declarations and 
resolutions by international organs, there is still a considerable gap between the continuing 
human rights legal education offered to judges and lawyers, and the outcomes obtained 
with regard to the application of international human rights law in specific domestic cases. 
The Special Rapporteur considers that either capacity-building provision has been 
insufficient, or the tools and methodology used were not the most appropriate. Whatever 
the case, the specificities inherent to judges and lawyers, and their different levels and 
categories, should always be considered when designing or implementing human rights 
education programmes. 
</p>
<p> The report also notes that magistrates, judges, prosecutors and lawyers are faced 
with various difficulties with regard to attending continuing education programmes: work 
overload; high cost of training courses and seminars; lack of opportunity to attend courses, 
etc. The Special Rapporteur considers that if the objectives of having strong judiciaries and

</p>
<p>independent and impartial judges are to be reached, it is necessary to further explore 
existing educational possibilities, projects and programmes. 
 The report emphasizes that this problem should be tackled in two stages: first, a 
global thematic study should be carried out at the international level to assess the human 
rights education and continuing training of magistrates, judges, prosecutors, public 
defenders and lawyers. This would provide the scientific basis for a second stage, an 
international conference on the ways in which legal human rights education and training are 
to be provided. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur considers that she may play a role in stimulating the 
creation of a network for the exchange of judicial experiences, particularly between 
countries from the North and countries from the South; and from the East and the West. It 
should also be useful to create an international database so as to give States access not only 
to technical assistance, but also to best practices and case law on which they can base their 
own practice. 
</p>
<p> Human rights legal education should be provided using the latest training 
technologies, including interactive sessions, seminars and workshops. Collaboration with 
professionals from the education and technological sectors should also be investigated. 
Judicial human rights education, including continuous learning, should be designed in the 
broader context of judicial development strategies. 
 The report also describes, in chapter II, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities between 
August 2009 and February 2010, including country visits conducted during this period. In 
chapter IV, the report indicates the main recent developments in the area of international 
justice by looking at developments in cases before the International Criminal Court, the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations are presented in 
chapter V, which focuses on measures to be taken to strengthen the legal education and 
capacity-building of magistrates, judges, prosecutors, public defenders and international 
human rights lawyers.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque e Silva took up her functions as Special 
Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers on 1 August 2009. This is her first 
thematic report to the Human Rights Council. The report examines the need for the 
provision of adequate human rights education for judges and lawyers in order for them to 
discharge their function of applying human rights principles and standards in an 
independent manner. 
</p>
<p>2. In analysing this complex topic, the Special Rapporteur refers to international and 
regional principles, norms and standards relevant to the independence of the judiciary and 
of lawyers, the work of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and special 
procedures and the observations of her two predecessors, Param Cumaraswamy and 
Leandro Despouy. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International meetings 
</b></p>
<p>3. In September 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in an induction session for 
new special procedures mandate holders organized by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR). On this occasion, the Special Rapporteur met the permanent 
representatives of Azerbaijan, Colombia and Hungary to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva and members of several non-governmental organizations working in areas relevant 
to her mandate. 
</p>
<p>4. In October 2009, the Special Rapporteur attended the sixty-fourth session of the 
General Assembly, at which she outlined her vision of the mandate and presented the final 
report of her predecessor (A/63/271), which analysed safeguards to be established at the 
domestic level in order to ensure the independence of lawyers and the legal profession. On 
this occasion, the Special Rapporteur held a meeting with the Permanent Representative of 
Fiji to the United Nations. She also met the Rule of Law and Justice Adviser of the United 
Nations Development Programme and staff of the United Nations Department of Political 
Affairs and non-governmental organizations, among them, Lawyers for Lawyers. 
</p>
<p>5. On 9 and 10 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur was a keynote speaker at a 
meeting held in Brazil on the drafting of an Ibero-American regional treaty aimed at 
ensuring the independence of the judiciary. 
</p><p>6. On 16 and 17 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur attended the Colloquium for 
Judges, on Equality and Non-Discrimination, held in Bandos, Maldives, and gave a 
presentation on the role of judges in the application of international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>7. At the invitation of the Government of Colombia, the Special Rapporteur visited the 
country from 7 to 16 December 2009. The resulting mission report is contained in 
addendum 2 to the present report. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government 
of Colombia for its cooperation before and during the visit. 
</p>
<p>8. The Government of Mexico has invited the Special Rapporteur to carry out an 
official mission to the country during the second half of 2010. </p>


<p>GE.10-12622 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the following country visit requests are pending: 
Angola (requested in 2008); Bangladesh (2007); Cambodia (2006); Cuba (1995); Egypt 
(1999); Equatorial Guinea (2002); Fiji (2007); Iran (Islamic Republic of) (2006); Iraq 
(2008); Kenya (2000); Myanmar (2009); Nigeria (1995); Pakistan (2000); Philippines 
(2006); Sri Lanka (1999); Tunisia (1997); Turkmenistan (1996); Uzbekistan (1996) and 
Zimbabwe (2001).  
</p><p>10. During the first quarter of 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent reminders to Fiji and 
Kenya. She has also sent new requests for country visits to Bulgaria, Burundi, Guinea-
Bissau, Liberia, Mozambique and Romania. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Press statements 
</b></p>
<p>11. On 5 October 2009, the Special Rapporteur issued a press statement on the lack of 
transparency in the elections of the Supreme Court of Guatemala noting her disappointment 
that the recommendations made by her predecessor, Leandro Despouy, had not been taken 
into account.1 
</p>
<p>12. On 16 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur and the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders expressed their deep concern about the arrest of a judge in 
Venezuela. The judge was immediately arrested after having ordered the conditional release 
pending trial of a detainee whose detention had been declared arbitrary by the United 
Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on 1 September 2009, on the basis of 
serious violations of the right to fair trial. In spite of the appeal of the special procedures 
mandate holders, the Venezuelan judge continues to be held in an ordinary prison, 
alongside inmates convicted by her.  
</p>
<p>13. On 10 December 2009, on the occasion of the sixty-first anniversary of the adoption 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and together with other special procedures 
mandate holders, the Special Rapporteur issued a joint statement calling for stronger global 
commitments and more determined action to defeat discrimination. 
</p>
<p>14. On 8 March, the Special Rapporteur issued, jointly with other special procedures 
mandate holders, a press statement on International Women&#8217;s Day calling for a new vision 
of women&#8217;s rights informed by the lessons learned from the 15-year review of the 
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>15. A summary of communications sent to various Governments and the responses 
received for the reporting period is contained in addendum 1 to this report. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur was one of a group of seven independent experts invited by 
the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 10/33, to submit a report with 
recommendations on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
The report (A/HRC/13/56) was presented to the thirteenth session of the Human Rights 
Council.

</p>
<p><b> III. Continuing education on human rights as a guarantee for the 
independence of judges and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The rule of law, democracy, the principle of separation of powers and 
the independence of the judiciary 
</b>17. The former Commission on Human Rights identified the independence of the 
judiciary and the separation of powers as two essential elements of democracy.2 Separation 
of powers, the rule of law and the principle of legality are inextricably linked in a 
democratic society. The independence of the judiciary is a core component of democracy, 
the rule of law and good governance. It should be strengthened both in an institutional 
manner, vis-&#224;-vis other branches of power, as well as in an individual manner 
(independence of the judges). States should respect the United Nations Basic Principles on 
the Independence of the Judiciary, the United Nations Basic Principles on the Role of 
Lawyers and the Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>18. In the reports of her predecessor to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/11/41) and 
the General Assembly (A/64/181), an extensive analysis of parameters and safeguards to 
strengthen the independence of judges and lawyers was presented. In both reports, 
appropriate legal education for judges and lawyers was described as a determining factor 
for their independence.3  
</p>
<p><b> B. Efforts undertaken to improve continuing education on human rights 
for judges, prosecutors and lawyers 
</b>19. The quality of the administration of justice has a direct impact on democracy and the 
development of States, which is the reason why the independence of the legal profession 
needs to be strengthened. Judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers must be aware 
of, and sensitive to, human rights standards, principles, rules and jurisprudence, 
international human rights systems and international and regional courts in order to 
strengthen democracy, the rule of law and good governance at the national level. They 
should be competent to interpret and implement international human rights law at the 
domestic level, in addition to possessing practical administrative and managerial skills.  
</p>
<p>20. During her presentation to the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, the 
Special Rapporteur stated that she would try to encourage and stimulate periodic regional 
meetings with all actors in the judicial system. The examples of the Bangalore Principles of 
Judicial Conduct and the Harare Declaration by senior judges prove the importance of such 
meetings. The Special Rapporteur also stated that these meetings could involve training on 
international human rights principles and norms and, in addition, provide an opportunity for 
the exchange of information and ideas as to how their implementation can best be achieved 
in national judicial systems. The Special Rapporteur expresses the hope that such meetings 
will lay the building blocks for a genuinely judicial approach towards the implementation 
of international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p>21. Judges, when considering and deciding a case, first and foremost tend to turn to 
domestic legislation. Likewise, lawyers will, in the first instance, primarily rely on the

</b></p>
<p>national legal framework when advising and representing their clients. However, in many 
countries, there is a norm at the constitutional level prescribing that international treaties 
ratified by the country form an integral part of national law. In addition, such provisions 
often state that, in the case of a contradiction, the norms contained in the international legal 
instruments shall take precedence. In some States, judicial decisions by the highest instance 
instruct the courts to be guided by relevant international treaties, including human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>22. Thus, judges and lawyers are called upon to uphold not only the domestic law, but 
also international human rights standards. In disputes relating to an alleged violation of 
fundamental rights and freedoms, human rights are a key pillar in court cases and judicial 
deliberations. Consequently, judges and lawyers are required to be aware of, and apply, 
international human rights principles and standards in the cases before them. 
</p>
<p>23. In this report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the legal framework for adequate 
awareness-raising and continuing education on international human rights law for judges 
and lawyers, as well as the corresponding obligations of Member States, judicial bodies and 
lawyers&#8217; associations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The gap between the efforts undertaken and the local situation 
</b></p>
<p>24. In most of the countries visited by the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s two predecessors, 
insufficient awareness-raising initiatives and a lack of continuing education opportunities 
for judges and lawyers were apparent. In one of his country mission reports, the former 
Special Rapporteur, Leandro Despouy, emphasized that lack of adequate training and 
professional knowledge also means that judges are more easily influenced.4 The lack of 
appropriate capacity-building<b> </b>initiatives thus has a direct impact on judges&#8217; capacity to 
render justice independently and impartially. As a consequence, judges and lawyers require 
opportunities to enhance their capacity to develop argumentation and analyse issues from a 
human rights perspective. At times, judges may not adjudicate cases with reference to 
human rights norms as a result of unfamiliarity with, or lack of awareness of, the linkages 
between human rights and other branches of the law.5 
</p>
<p>25. United Nations human rights treaty bodies and other special procedures have, for 
their part, established these linkages. The examples mentioned below shed light on the 
broad array of human rights which are concerned in connection with legal education for 
judges and lawyers.  
</p><p>26. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, drawing attention to 
the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal 
justice system, has called for specific training for those working within the criminal justice 
system &#8212; police officers, lawyers, prosecutors and judges &#8212; in order to increase their 
awareness of relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and the International Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.6 The Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women called upon one Member State to set up a training programme for 
judges to address the international obligations the country had pledged to respect, including 
those pertaining to women&#8217;s rights and the protection of women from violence.7 The 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on another Member 
State to ensure that the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination

<p>against Women, the Committee&#8217;s general recommendations and related legislation are 
made an integral part of legal education and training of judicial officers, including judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers and to ensure that, in particular, judges and officers of tribunals 
and special courts are familiar with the Convention&#8217;s and the State&#8217;s obligations thereunder. 
</p>
<p>27. The Committee against Torture called upon one Member State to provide adequate 
training on the prohibition of torture to judges and prosecutors in order to strengthen the 
independence of the judiciary.8 The Human Rights Committee has also recommended that 
particular attention should be given to the training of judges in order to enable them to 
render justice promptly and impartially.9 
</p><p>28. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has 
developed human rights training materials in the field of the administration of justice.10  
</p>
<p><b> D. Provision of human rights education for judges, prosecutors and 
lawyers 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Judges 
</b>29. Courses for judges, prosecutors and lawyers should be grounded in the international 
human rights standards concerning the administration of justice, in particular article 14 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary. According to the Basic Principles and various regional 
standards,11<b> </b>appropriate education is one of the preconditions for selection for judicial 
office. The Special Rapporteur would like to point to Recommendation No. R (94) 12 
issued by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which specifically provides 
for training during the judicial career which should be free of charge and in particular 
concern recent legislation and case law.12 The Recommendation further enshrines the duty 
of the judges to undergo any necessary capacity-building in order to be able to carry out 
their duties in an efficient and proper manner. 
</p>
<p>30. The Statute of the Ibero-American Judge states that continuing training, which is 
generally voluntary, can be mandatory in specific cases such as the taking up of higher 
judicial duties or major legal reforms. Furthermore, it enshrines continuing training as a 
right of the judge and an obligation of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p><b>  Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that Principle 9 of the Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers provides that Governments must ensure that lawyers

<p>have appropriate education and training,13 so as to be able to exercise the rights and duties 
set out in Principles 12 to 15, consisting primarily in advising and protecting the rights of 
their clients and in upholding the cause of justice.  
</p><p>32. The International Bar Association&#8217;s (IBA) Standards for the Independence of the 
Legal Profession define the functions of lawyers&#8217; associations as including &#8220;to promote a 
high standard of legal education as a prerequisite for entry into the profession&#8221;. The 
functions of the lawyers&#8217; associations should also include the continuing education of 
lawyers and the public on the role of a Lawyers&#8217; Association. Also, Principle II (2) of 
Recommendation No. R (2000) 21 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, 
requires that all necessary measures be taken to provide for the continuing education of 
lawyers.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Roles and responsibilities of main stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Member States 
</b></p>
<p>33. The full implementation of all human rights obligation by a State can only be 
achieved if those obligations are enforced by judicial, administrative and other decisions or 
actions. States therefore have a specific interest in ensuring that those involved in the 
administration of justice have appropriate knowledge of human rights norms and are in a 
position to implement them. It is thus incumbent on the respective authorities and State 
institutions to put in place a legislative and policy framework facilitating and supporting 
human rights legal education and training for judges and lawyers.  
</p><p>34. In this context, it is imperative that the legislature ensures that the judiciary receive 
sufficient funding from the national budget specifically allocated to continuing legal 
education. The funding should cover the costs of both human and material resources. 
</p>
<p><b>  Judiciary 
</b>35. The judiciary has a critical role to play in assisting in the application of human rights 
principles and norms binding on the State. The decisions that are made by courts of law can 
advance, but also hamper, the enjoyment of human rights. Courts may thus contribute 
considerably to the upholding and implementing by the State of its international human 
rights obligations by referring to the commitments that the State has undertaken at the 
international level. The judiciary is central to reinforcing and ensuring accountability for 
the obligations that the State has undertaken to honour its commitments at the national 
level. In most jurisdictions, formal recognition of human rights in the constitution is an 
initial step. At times, the content of the rights has to be interpreted by the courts in cases of 
conflicting perceptions, vagueness or lack of conceptual clarity. The courts in this regard 
are important stakeholders in interpreting the standards and their applicability at the 
domestic level.  
</p>
<p>36. In this connection, the specific role of judges within the State structure confers upon 
the judiciary the obligation14 to provide for stringent entry exams for admission as judges 
and subsequently for a continuing scheme of legal education.

<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12622 
</p>
<p><b>  Lawyers&#8217; associations 
</b></p>
<p>37. Lawyers&#8217; associations and bar associations have a specific interest in maintaining 
the integrity, appropriate skills and quality of lawyers. An important aspect in this 
connection is to ensure the highest standards of legal education for admission to the 
profession, and to maintain these high standards through continuing legal education.15 
</p>
<p>38. Lawyers play a crucial role in the promotion and protection of human rights through 
client representation, case approaches and legal submissions and argumentation. This 
facilitates the application of human rights law by the courts.   
</p>
<p>39. Judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers should receive continuing 
education on human rights principles, norms, jurisprudence, declarations, guidelines and 
rules as a means of strengthening the national systems of administration of justice. In 
countries affected by armed conflict, training should also be provided on international 
humanitarian law. This should be delivered via standard courses, workshops and seminars. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Types of education and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Pre-service education and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>40. At the outset, it must be noted that education and awareness-raising play a major 
role prior to, and throughout, the career of a judge or lawyer. In order to ensure the quality 
of judges&#8217; and lawyers&#8217; work, it is necessary in the first place to pay particular attention to 
the curricula at university law schools and faculties. In several States, university law 
courses do not follow a unified framework. In this connection, previous Special 
Rapporteurs have noted that in times of political transition and economic liberalization 
there is often a &#8220;proliferation&#8221; of law faculties which operate in the absence of an approved 
and unified, or at least harmonized, national curriculum.16 Furthermore, in such situations 
one often notes shortages of qualified teaching personnel.17  
</p>
<p>41. While in some States there is a specific entry exam and possibly a preparatory and 
educational period for judges to be selected for office, there is no equivalent admission 
procedure for lawyers. In a number of States admission to the bar is granted on the basis of 
a university examination in law. In view of the varying educational quality of such 
university examinations, this may pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and 
effectiveness of the professional legal counsel provided by lawyers. The introduction of a 
mandatory training period prior to admission to the legal profession would certainly 
enhance the general quality of lawyers&#8217; services.18 
</p>
<p><b>  Initial education  
</b></p>
<p>42. In some States, judges, upon entry into office, are required to participate in induction 
courses for the judiciary. In other States, however, owing to the lack of a harmonized 
framework, the length and content of such courses or initiatives depend on the tribunal or 
court where the judge takes up his or her duty. In most States, this initially relates to the 
updating of relevant knowledge in the legal area in which the judges will perform their 
functions. The Special Rapporteur considers that initial education should also cover basic 
education on the country&#8217;s human rights international obligations. Incoming judges should 
also be made acquainted with the impact of decisions of international or regional judicial or

<p>quasi-judicial bodies, including treaty bodies and special procedures decisions, on domestic 
law.  
</p>
<p>43. Courts should develop and standardize induction courses and legal education 
programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>  Continuing legal education 
</b></p>
<p>44. Besides the importance of pre-service and initial educational initiatives, particular 
weight should be given to continuing learning opportunities for judges19 and lawyers20 to 
allow them to discharge their duties independently in accordance with the relevant 
professional standards and at a satisfactory level. United Nations treaty bodies have also 
made relevant observations and recommendations in this respect.21 
</p>
<p>45. Previous Special Rapporteurs noted that while, in certain cases, judicial organs have 
decided on the requirement of continuing legal education, no action had been taken to 
translate these requirements into legislation. In other cases, legislation reflects the 
requirement for continuing legal education for judges, but that requirement is not 
implemented in practice. 
</p>
<p>46. Courts should introduce and develop programmes of continuing legal education, 
including a range of presentations, conferences, interactive dialogues, workshops, seminars 
and electronic publications that address judges&#8217; educational needs in terms of human rights. 
Such programmes can provide an opportunity for the courts to evaluate and monitor 
progress in facilitating the enjoyment of human rights through judicial action by noting the 
gaps which remain in the domestic system and analysing the consistency of national laws 
with international norms.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Specificities of continuing education 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Content 
</b></p>
<p>47. Particular attention should be given to the different levels and categories of judges. 
Education programmes should be designed to take into account the different perceptions, 
expectations, responsibilities and interests of each level and category.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur notes that in a great number of States, pre-service, initial 
and continuing legal education focuses almost entirely on domestic criminal, civil, 
commercial and administrative law and the respective procedural provisions. Only in a few 
States does continuing legal education cover the international obligations entered into by 
the State, particularly in the human rights sphere. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion 
that pre-service, initial and continuing legal education should include relevant recent case 
law at the international and regional levels and major legislative changes, which often stem 
from the ratification of international or regional human rights instruments and other recent 
developments in human rights law. It should further increase capacity-building on human 
rights issues, in particular their application to specific cases.22  
</p>
<p>49. Sometimes, legal systems undergo an entire structural and systemic transformation 
such as has been witnessed by the Special Rapporteur in a recent country visit, notably at

<p>the criminal procedural level, with the transition from a written inquisitorial to an 
accusatorial system. In such cases, the obligations of the judge, prosecutor and lawyers 
change dramatically, as do the rights for the parties to cases. Such changes have major 
human rights implications, making constant hands-on updating of legal education, 
including human rights, indispensable.  
</p>
<p>50. The possibility of magistrates, experienced judges and practising lawyers acting as 
mentors in the planning and establishment of the courses should be explored.  
</p>
<p>51. Furthermore, in countries which have been affected by situations of armed conflict, 
particular attention should be given to continuing learning on transitional justice 
mechanisms especially designed to address issues of gross violations of human rights, such 
as truth and reconciliation commissions, justice and peace tribunals, hybrid tribunals or 
related initiatives.23 
</p>
<p>52. The goals and objectives of the programme of judicial education should be 
strategically developed. The priorities, structure and content of the curriculum should be 
clear from the outset.  
</p>
<p><b>  Institution  
</b></p>
<p>53. During several country missions, previous mandate holders noted with appreciation 
the existence of an institution providing for continuing legal education24 or recommended 
that States establish such an institution where one had not yet been set up.25 In some cases, 
they noted the establishment of an institute mandated to provide continuing legal education 
to all legal professions, which, in one case, was established under the auspices of the 
Ministry of Justice.26 In other cases, a specialized body, such as an academy of justice or 
school for the judiciary was established to provide both initial and continuing legal 
education solely for judges and court staff. The Special Rapporteur considers that such 
institutes or judicial academies should preferably be administered and run by an 
independent body in charge of the selection, appointment, promotion and disciplining of 
judges.27 In order to guarantee the independence of that institution and consequently the 
independence of the judges trained by that institute or school, it should neither be 
administered by, nor run under, any organ of the executive power. 
</p>
<p>54. In another case, a judicial training centre was established by the national judges 
association, which conducted continuing legal education courses for sitting judges, but had 
no mandate to educate incoming judges<b>.</b>28<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that such 
institutions provide both incoming and sitting judges with legal education in order to ensure 
the consistency and coherence of their levels of knowledge and awareness.  
</p>
<p>55. The body providing for continuing legal education for lawyers should ideally be 
established by the lawyers&#8217; or bar association and remain under its aegis. The 
corresponding legal foundation could either be established by the statute of the lawyers&#8217; or 
bar association or by legislation.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Compulsory or optional schemes 
</b></p>
<p>56. In many States, continuing legal education for judges and lawyers appears to be 
optional29 and at the discretion of the respective individual judges and lawyers. In other 
States, there is a predetermined scheme and schedule for such educational undertakings. 
Again in some other countries, there is a framework for continuing education. Judges 
should be required to undergo all necessary courses to allow them to carry out their duties 
in an efficient, impartial and proper manner.30 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that a basic scheme of continuing legal 
education should be compulsory for all judges31 and lawyers. Specific additional education 
should be undertaken in certain circumstances, for example in the case of taking up higher 
judicial duties or changing to another jurisdiction. Also, targeted additional continuing 
education should be conducted prior to and following major legal reforms. Such reforms 
are sometimes precipitated by the ratification of an international or regional human rights 
treaty, which should consequently also be part of the educational programme. 
</p>
<p><b>  Periodicity 
</b></p>
<p>58. A characteristic of human rights standards and rules is that they evolve over time. 
This requires legal education programmes for judges and lawyers to be planned and 
implemented on an ongoing basis at specific intervals.  
</p>
<p><b>  Examinations 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes that few States have judicial career systems with 
periodic examinations that serve to ensure the continuing quality of the administration of 
justice. She would like to emphasize the importance of such schemes, which should also be 
given due consideration in the promotion of judges and in the process of election for judges 
and magistrates. 
</p>
<p><b>  Costs and resources 
</b></p>
<p>60. Legal education programmes for judges should be free of charge and financed from 
the judiciary budget within a specific budget line. This should likewise be the case for 
lawyers while the budget should be covered by the membership fees paid by lawyers to 
their associations. 
</p>
<p>61. It is of paramount importance that educational institutions and structures for judges 
and lawyers be adequately equipped with human and material resources as otherwise the 
quality of the education may suffer and not bring about the expected results.32   
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes that there are good practices and standards in a 
number of States that it would be important and meaningful to share with other States. The 
Special Rapporteur will be sending out a questionnaire to Member States regarding certain 
aspects and practices of legal education for judges and lawyers.

</p>
<p><b> H. The continuing education of judges as a means to strengthening the 
independence of the judiciary 
</b>63. As mentioned above, judges can and should play an active role in the 
implementation of the human rights obligations of the State. This may take several forms. 
One possibility is that the judge &#8212; while making his/her deliberations &#8212; discovers that 
there is a discrepancy between the national constitution, which enshrines human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, and the legislation, traditional law or directives, which may not yet 
have been adapted to the obligations undertaken by the State. Thus, while many 
constitutions proclaim the promotion and protection of human rights, domestic legislation is 
not always in line with this proclamation. When considering cases, judges may be in doubt 
as to the constitutionality of a certain domestic provision which will be decisive for the 
judgement to be made. In several Member States, judges are then able to refer the question 
of whether the legislative norm is constitutional to a higher domestic court.  
</p>
<p>64. In other instances, when the constitution and other legislation do not meet the human 
rights obligations of the State concerned or where there is a legal vacuum, judges 
themselves refer in their judgements to the international standards. Sometimes, they even 
refer to the case law of international or regional courts, quasi-judicial bodies, treaty bodies 
or special procedures or their advisory opinions or views, particularly human rights 
mechanisms at the United Nations, in order to underscore their decision, because of a lack 
of familiarity with these international institutions. In these instances, judges take a 
proactive role and help the State to meet the obligations the country has entered into.  
</p>
<p>65. In previous reports, the need for the establishment of various safeguards necessary to 
effectively guarantee the independence of judges33 and lawyers34 was examined. In this 
report, the Special Rapporteur would like to point to several circumstances that prevent 
judges and lawyers examining international human rights standards and applying them 
when deciding cases or defending a client before the court. 
</p>
<p>66. In the first scenario, judges and lawyers are aware that their State has entered into 
international human rights obligations through the ratification of treaties or otherwise. 
However, in some cases, the texts of the international treaties are not available to judges 
and lawyers. In other cases, it appears that while the text of the treaty is available, the 
relevant case law is not available to judges and lawyers or can only be obtained at 
considerable financial cost and difficulty. In some Member States, international human 
rights standards are cited in decisions of the highest judicial instance, which instruct the 
lower court judges to be guided by those standards. However, those decisions are not 
always available to lower-level courts or judges. These impediments were detected by the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors in a number of countries. 
</p>
<p>67. Furthermore, in some States, the information flow entering the country is so slight or 
restricted that judges and lawyers are not even sure which international human rights 
obligations the State has undertaken, or if it has done so. In such situations, criteria for 
judicial decisions are often developed specifically to prevent judges from referring to 
human rights standards in their decisions. While the cold war era is a vivid example of such 
circumstances, the Special Rapporteur notes that such conditions still exist in a considerable 
number of countries.  
</p>
<p>68. Finally, in some States judges and lawyers are well aware of international human 
rights standards applicable to their countries and even of relevant case law established by 
</p>

<p>international or regional judicial or quasi-judicial bodies. However, the application of these 
standards is severely punished by the executive branch so that judges risk sanctions and 
even deprivation of liberty.35  
</p>
<p><b> I. An independent and informed judiciary to support good governance 
and to combat corruption 
</b></p>
<p>69. Courts have increasingly been called upon to adjudicate on matters relating to good 
governance, corruption, counterterrorism measures, ensuring democratic accountability, 
and promotion of human rights in relation to areas such as health, labour and property 
rights. The courts have also been instrumental in combating impunity, ensuring 
accountability for human rights violations and providing reparation for victims. An 
effective and independent judiciary is one of the key institutions in the promotion of the 
rule of law by confronting corruption, promoting security and political and social stability 
and providing effective remedies to litigants.  
</p>
<p>70. The judiciary has considerable responsibility for the promotion of the rule of law 
and upholding good governance by establishing or developing on existing human rights 
standards and enhancing their applicability at national level. In cases where the national 
statutory framework violates basic human rights standards, a proactive judiciary can 
recommend the repeal or amendment of a law or rule if inconsistent with international 
human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>71. The independence of the judiciary derives from its competence, professionalism and 
integrity and from maintaining its accountability as a service delivery institution. Despite 
the fact that the judiciary has a mandate in every jurisdiction to further good governance, 
the rule of law and the promotion and protection of human rights norms, there remains a 
discernible gap between the law and practice on the ground.  
</p>
<p>72. There are instances when the judiciary has acted to the detriment of litigants in areas 
such as social empowerment, equality and minority protection and has contributed to 
political insecurity. There are other trends which show that the judiciary has contributed 
towards the perpetuation of human rights violation by the continued application of domestic 
legal norms and provisions which are not consistent with international human rights 
practice. In other jurisdictions, the judiciary may have promoted and contributed to a 
culture of impunity.  
</p>
<p>73. Corruption is one of the most serious obstacles to the promotion and protection of 
human rights. Therefore, judges and lawyers should receive continued training on good 
governance, particularly in combating corruption in the public and private sectors, 
including the judiciary. Corruption has a detrimental impact on human rights, the rule of 
law and democracy. Corruption makes national institutions weak and public trust in them is 
eroded. 
</p>
<p>74. Corruption can be political, economic or corporate, but, in all its forms, it 
undermines democratic values and institutions and the enjoyment of human rights. Judicial 
integrity is a key element of impartial justice. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers should be 
trained in the need to combat corruption and in the international norms and declarations. In

 See for example the case of Venezuelan Judge Afiuni who was arrested after having ordered the

detention and whose detention was declared arbitrary by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
on 1 September 2009, citing serious violations of the right to fair trial. Available at:

</p>
<p>this aspect, particular attention should be given to the Bangalore Principles on Judicial 
Conduct.  
</p>
<p>75. Particular emphasis should also be given to the training of judges and lawyers on 
general issues of the rule of law. Sessions on the duty to combat and prevent impunity 
should be given specific emphasis. 
</p>
<p><b> J. An independent and informed judiciary to strengthen access to justice 
</b>76. Access to justice should not be understood exclusively as access to the judiciary. It 
also means access to less formal types of institutions and mechanisms such as national 
human rights institutions, ombudsmen, conciliators and mediators able to assist people to 
claim their rights. Vulnerable or disadvantaged groups, including members of minority 
groups, are generally deprived of access to justice owing to poverty, illiteracy, lack of 
education or discrimination. 
</p>
<p>77. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers should be educated in ways to combat this 
phenomenon and to guarantee the access to justice and protection of disadvantaged groups. 
They should receive awareness training on the special needs of disadvantaged groups, 
including rural women, indigenous people, Afro-descendants, members of minorities and 
the illiterate.   
</p>
<p><b> K. Need for an international conference 
</b></p>
<p>78. If the objective of strong judiciaries and independent and impartial judges and 
lawyers with a sound training in international human rights is to be achieved, it will be 
necessary to further investigate the existing educational options, projects and programmes. 
The problem should be tackled in two stages: firstly, a definitive thematic study conducted 
on a scientific basis of human rights education and the continuous training of magistrates, 
judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers should be carried out at the international 
level to assess the current situation. 
</p>
<p>79. This would provide a scientific basis for the second stage, which would be an 
international conference on how human rights education and training for the legal 
professions is to be provided. Among the objectives of the proposed international 
conference would be to identify means and mechanisms to enhance the continuing human 
rights education of judges in order to improve the work of courts and tribunals and the role 
of lawyers in the vindication of human rights and the provision of justice. The conference 
would also allow discussion on how international human rights law can be more effectively 
used by judges and national courts at all levels. Authorities from the judiciaries and 
attorneys&#8217; general or prosecutors&#8217; offices, representatives of associations of magistrates, 
judges and lawyers and members of the civil society could jointly identify the internal and 
structural features of judicial systems that affect their capacities to implement international 
and regional standards on human rights.  
</p>
<p>80. The proposed global thematic study and the conclusions of the international 
conference could be taken into consideration in the development of new guidelines for the 
continuing international human rights education of judges, prosecutors and lawyers.  </p>

<p><b> IV. Major developments in international justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International Criminal Court

<p>81. The Special Rapporteur intends to follow developments in international justice 
closely and to support efforts to strengthen the rules and procedures of these international 
judicial institutions.  
</p>
<p><b>  Situation in Darfur, Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>82. On 3 February 2010, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) rendered its judgment in the case of <i>The Prosecutor v. Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-
Bashir</i> on the Prosecutor&#8217;s appeal, reversing Pre-Trial Chamber I&#8217;s decision of 4 March 
2009, to the extent that Pre-Trial Chamber I decided not to issue a warrant of arrest in 
respect of the charge of genocide. The Appeals Chamber directed the Pre-Trial Chamber to 
decide anew whether or not the arrest warrant should be extended to cover the charge of 
genocide. The Appeals Chamber explained that it was not concerned with the question of 
whether Mr Omar Al-Bashir is, or is not, responsible for the crime of genocide. Rather, the 
Appeals Chamber addressed a question of procedural law, namely whether the Pre-Trial 
Chamber applied the correct standard of proof when disposing of the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
application for an arrest warrant. In its 4 March 2009, decision, Pre-Trial Chamber I 
rejected the Prosecutor&#8217;s application in respect of genocide stating that it would issue an 
arrest warrant for genocide only if the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s evidence, based on &#8220;proof by inference&#8221;, was that there were reasonable 
grounds to believe in the existence of genocidal intent. The Appeals Chamber found this 
standard of proof to be too demanding at the arrest warrant stage, which is governed by 
article 58 of the Rome Statute. This amounted to an error of law. The case has now been 
remanded back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to reconsider whether there were &#8220;reasonable 
grounds to believe&#8221; that Al-Bashir acted with genocidal intent. 
</p>
<p>83. The confirmation hearing for <i>Bahr Idriss Abu Garda</i>, the Chair and General 
Coordinator of Military Operations of the United Resistance Front, was held from 19 to 29 
October 2009, during which the prosecutors alleged that Abu Garda controlled the Justice 
and Equality Movement during the 2007 attacks, which resulted in the death of 12 African 
Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) soldiers and several injuries. On 8 February 2009, the Pre-
Trial Chamber I of the ICC issued a decision declining to confirm the charges against Bahar 
Idriss Abu Garda. The Chamber was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to 
establish substantial grounds to believe that Bahar Idriss Abu Garda could be held 
criminally responsible either as a direct or as an indirect co-perpetrator for the commission 
of the crimes with which he was charged by the prosecution. Abu Garda was charged with 
three war crimes, namely violence to life, intentionally directing attacks against personnel, 
installations, material, units and vehicles involved in a peacekeeping mission, and pillaging, 
allegedly committed during an attack carried out on 29 September, 2007, against the 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), a peacekeeping mission stationed at the 
Haskanita Military Group Site (MGS Haskanita), in the locality of Umm Kadada, North 
Darfur. The decision does not preclude the prosecution from subsequently requesting the 
confirmation of the charges against Abu Garda if such a request is supported by additional 
evidence. The prosecution can also submit a request to Pre-Trial Chamber I for leave to 
appeal the decision on the confirmation of charges.

Chamber II of the ICC decided to postpone the hearings in the case. The trial resumed on 
26 January 2010.  
</p>
<p><b>  Situation in Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>85. Almost five years have passed since the issue of arrest warrants for Joseph Kony and 
other senior Lords Resistance Army (LRA) commanders, including Okot Odhiambo and 
Dominic Ongwen for crimes against humanity and war crimes they are suspected to have 
committed between 2002 and 2004. They are alleged to have abducted children and used 
them as soldiers and sexual slaves. The suspects still remain at large. In July 2009, the ICC 
Office of the Prosecutor applauded past State cooperation in the effort to apprehend the 
LRA fugitives. The Office stated that it was encouraged by the fact that the Governments of 
the region are now acting together with the support of the United Nations Organization 
Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to address the issue of arresting LRA 
suspects. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kenya 
</b></p>
<p>86. On 26 November 2009, the ICC Prosecutor sought authorization from Pre-Trial 
Chamber II of the ICC to commence an investigation in relation to the crimes within the 
jurisdiction of the Court allegedly committed on the territory of the Republic of Kenya 
within the context of the 2007&#8211;2008 post-election violence. The Prosecutor claimed that the 
alleged crimes appear to constitute crimes against humanity. On 18 February 2010, Pre-
Trial Chamber II requested the Prosecutor to provide, no later than 3 March 2010, 
clarification and additional information in the process of assessing whether or not to 
authorize the Prosecutor to commence an investigation with regard to the situation in the 
Republic of Kenya. In response to this request, on 3 March, the Prosecutor clarified that 
senior political and business leaders associated with the main political parties organized, 
enticed and/or financed attacks against the civilian population on account of their perceived 
ethnic and/or political affiliation pursuant to or on furtherance of a State and/or 
organizational policy. The Prosecutor provided the ICC with a list of the most serious 
criminal incidents and a selected list of 20 names of persons who appear to bear the gravest 
responsibility for these crimes. The Prosecutor indicated that these names are indicative 
only at this stage and allegations will have to be measured against the evidence gathered 
independently by the Prosecutor&#8217;s office.

<p>87. In a statement, made on 19 February 2010, at the end of a three-day visit to Guinea, 
the Deputy Prosecutor of the ICC said that crimes against humanity may have been 
committed during the September 2008 events in Conakry, Guinea. Based on the findings of 
the visit, a preliminary investigation will continue.

<p>88. The trial of Radovan Karad&#382;i&#263; resumed on 1 March 2010. Prior to this, on 12 
February, the Appeals Chamber dismissed in its entirety Karad&#382;i&#263;&#8217;s motion against the 
imposition of a court-appointed lawyer. The Appeals Chamber ruled that an accused is not 
entitled to enjoy simultaneously both the right to defend himself in person and the right to 
be defended through legal assistance of his own choosing. The Chamber specified that as 
Karad&#382;i&#263; has chosen self-representation, he &#8220;does not enjoy any rights that are derived from 
choosing to be represented by legal counsel&#8221;. In December 2009, the Trial Chamber

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to stress the need for magistrates, judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers throughout the world to receive, in 
addition to legal training, continuing education in international and regional human 
rights standards and systems.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In a democratic State, the judiciary should be a partner with the other 
branches of Government, working together to vindicate human rights and provide 
justice. The courts alone cannot provide effective justice and remedies. In some 
countries, judges might enhance their ability to tackle deep patterns of human rights 
violations that persist year after year in their States. For this purpose, continuing 
education in international human rights law and continuous updating on its 
development is essential.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The principle of separation of powers is the basis on which the judicial 
independence and the impartiality of judges is founded. This principle must be 
respected by all States. Member States should give priority to strengthening their 
judicial systems, guaranteeing their full independence as institutions as well as the 
independence and impartiality of their magistrates and judges. An independent 
judiciary is fundamental for the respect of the rule of law and the development of 
democracy. It is also fundamental to combating corruption, to guaranteeing equal 
access to justice, to providing effective justice and remedies to citizens, to countering 
patterns or contexts of abuse and to guaranteeing health, labour rights and non-
discrimination. </b></p>


<p><b>20</b> GE.10-12622 
</p>
<p>94. <b>From the reports of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors and her own 
experience, the Special Rapporteur concludes that there is an imperative and urgent 
need for the systematic and continued international human rights law education of 
judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers. They should be given the 
opportunity of continuing education in international human rights principles, norms, 
rules and jurisprudence, from the United Nations and regional organs and treaty 
bodies, and from the United Nations special procedures on issues such as the due 
process of law or the right to a fair trial. Judges, prosecutors and lawyers must be 
given the necessary information on the possibilities of application, at the domestic 
level, of international human rights principles, norms and standards.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, this problem should be tackled in two 
stages. First, a global thematic study should be carried out at the international level to 
assess the human rights education and continuing training of judges, prosecutors, 
public defenders and lawyers currently in place. This would provide the scientific 
basis for a second stage, an international conference on the methods for the legal 
human rights education and training to be provided.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In this context, it seems necessary to determine the internal and structural 
features of domestic judicial systems that affect their capacities to contribute to the 
implementation of international and regional human rights principles, norms and 
standards. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers must be adequately 
educated and informed on a regular and continuing basis on new developments in 
international human rights law, principles, standards and case law. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The legal education and continuing training of judges, prosecutors, public 
defenders and lawyers is a theme which should be sustained. States should establish 
compulsory, periodic and continuing legal education for judges, prosecutors, public 
defenders and lawyers, particularly in the area of international human rights law, and 
in countries affected by armed conflicts, particularly in the area of international 
humanitarian law and transitional justice. Particular attention should be given to the 
methods for the domestic application of international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur submits to the Human Rights Council the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), in cooperation with the Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and 
lawyers, should support initiatives whereby the education and continuing education of 
judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers on international human rights law 
will be strengthened. Such initiatives should ensure the integration of human rights 
principles, norms and standards in their efforts to strengthening national justice 
systems and institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) The development of human rights education programmes for judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers is crucial to ensuring a solid foundation for 
democracy and the rule of law. International cooperation, including that provided by 
OHCHR, should be encouraged and supported; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Continuing learning on international case law and national case law 
relevant to human rights should be supported. An international database should be </b></p>


<p>GE.10-12622 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>created so as to give States access not only to technical assistance, but also to best 
practices and case law on which they can base their programmes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strategic partnerships with international, regional and national judges&#8217; 
associations and bar associations are critical to the work of the Special Rapporteur. 
The Special Rapporteur may play a role in stimulating the establishment of a network 
for an exchange of judicial experiences, particularly between countries from the North 
and from the South; and from the East and the West; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) States should give priority to strengthening judicial systems, particularly 
through continuous education in international human rights law for judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) International human rights law should be included in the curricula of all 
law faculties and law schools, and in the curricula of schools for the judiciary and the 
academic programmes of bar associations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Particular attention should be given to the different levels and categories 
of judges. Education programmes should be designed taking into account the 
expectations, responsibilities and interests of each level and category; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) The need to enhance the education of judicial staff (such as court 
secretaries, assistants, law clerks and registrars) should also be studied; 
 (i) Legal education for judges, prosecutors and lawyers should be delivered 
using the latest training methodologies, including interactive sessions, seminars and 
workshops. Collaboration with professionals from the education and technological 
sectors to establish modern methodologies and tools should be examined; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) States should undertake an assessment of the resources currently 
available and needed to establish the programmes of continuing international human 
rights law education, including infrastructure, human resources and financial 
requirements; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Judicial human rights education, including continuous learning, should 
be designed in the broader context of judicial development strategies; 
 (l) An effective partnership between the judiciary and the executive power 
should be developed to obtain adequate and sustainable resourcing while always 
preserving judicial independence; 
 (m) Universities and law faculties should operate within an approved and 
harmonized national curriculum, which should particularly include international 
human rights law education; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Bar associations and associations of magistrates have a crucial role to 
play in the effective training of judges and lawyers and their support to the Special 
Rapporteur and OHCHR is particularly important; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) The introduction of a mandatory human rights training period prior to 
being admitted to the bar is of paramount importance to ensuring the independence, 
integrity and effectiveness of professional legal counsel provided by lawyers; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) Initial education initiatives for judges should particularly cover basic 
education on the country&#8217;s international obligations with an emphasis on human 
rights. Incoming judges should also be acquainted with the impact of decisions of 
international or regional judicial or quasi-judicial bodies on domestic law. 
</b>100. <b>The Special Rapporteur should be apprised, on a regular basis, of requests 
made for advisory services and technical assistance to OHCHR in the area of </b></p>

<p><b>administration of justice, in particular with regard to the independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary and to the continuing human rights education of judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>In order to enhance the continuing education of judges, prosecutors, public 
defenders and lawyers in international human rights law, an international conference 
should be convened with the participation of State representatives, judiciary 
authorities and the public prosecutor&#8217;s offices, representatives of the magistrates and 
bar associations and members of the civil society. The objectives of the international 
conference would be, inter alia, to: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Identify the internal and structural features of judicial systems that 
affect their capacities to implement international and regional standards on human 
rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Identify means of improving the continuing human rights education of 
judges in order to improve the work of courts to vindicate human rights and provide 
justice; 
 (c) Enquire of judiciaries and judges as to what they are doing and what 
they might do to address and provide redress in relation to deeper patterns of human 
rights violations that persist year after year in their States; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Explore how the advances in international human rights law can be used 
more effectively by judges and national courts at all levels; 
 (e) Exchange information on how to better promote and use international 
human rights jurisprudence and precedents of deliberative bodies; 
 (f) Review challenges to the implementation of civil and political rights and 
economic, social and cultural rights.
