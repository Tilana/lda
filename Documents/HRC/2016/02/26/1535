of the law, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides, 
inter alia, that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion 
or belief, which shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice 
and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to 
manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression and full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can 
play in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance, and also that the 
exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and 
responsibilities, in accordance with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, 
</p>

<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at those acts that advocate religious hatred and thereby 
undermine the spirit of tolerance,

be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> <i>also</i> that violence can never be an acceptable response to acts of 
intolerance on the basis of religion or belief,

</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> about actions that wilfully exploit tensions or target individuals on the 
basis of their religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with deep concern</i> the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of 
violence in many parts of the world, including cases motivated by discrimination against 
persons belonging to religious minorities, in addition to the negative projection of the 
followers of religions and the enforcement of measures that specifically discriminate 
against persons on the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing concern</i> at the growing manifestation of intolerance based on religion or 
belief that can generate hatred and violence among individuals from and within different 
nations that may have serious implications at the national, regional and international levels, 
and in this regard emphasizing the importance of respect for religious and cultural diversity 
as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue aimed at promoting a culture of tolerance and 
respect among individuals, societies and nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the valuable contribution of people of all religions or beliefs to 
humanity and the contribution that dialogue among religious groups can make towards an 
improved awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that working together to enhance the implementation of existing 
legal regimes that protect individuals against discrimination and hate crimes, increase 
interfaith and intercultural efforts and expand human rights education are an important first 
step in combating incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence against individuals 
on the basis of religion or belief,

Organization in promoting intercultural dialogue, the work of the United Nations Alliance 
of Civilizations and the Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for Dialogue between

promoting interreligious, intercultural and interfaith harmony and combating discrimination 
against individuals on the basis of religion or belief, including the launching of the Istanbul 
Process, and taking note of the recent initiative of the chairmanship of Albania of the 
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe under the theme &#8220;United in diversity&#8221; and 
the initiative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Expresses deep concern</i> at the continued serious instances of derogatory

when condoned by Governments; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its concern</i> that incidents of religious intolerance, discrimination
