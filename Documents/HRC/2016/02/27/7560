<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression undertook an official visit to Italy from 11 to 18 November 2013. 
This was the second visit of a mandate holder to assess the situation of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression in the country. The previous visit was conducted in October 
</p><p>2004. 
</p>
<p>Throughout its recent history, Italy has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to 
ensuring the right to freedom of opinion and expression as defined by international law. Its 
national legal framework is mostly in line with the relevant international standards. 
Nevertheless, some concerns have emerged in the translation of commitments and norms 
into practice. 
</p>
<p>In this sense, the Special Rapporteur indicates his concerns regarding the continued 
criminalization of defamation, the vulnerability of the press to frivolous litigation, the 
unreasonable protection from insult given to public authorities, the existence of threats 
against some journalists and the deteriorating working conditions of journalists overall.

</p>
<p>With regard to the pluralism of the media, the Special Rapporteur notes his concerns 
regarding conflicts of interest of senior government officials with holdings in the media, 
</p>
<p>the removal of the ban on cross-ownership of broadcast and print media, the appointment 
processes for the management of the Public Broadcasting Services and the membership of 
the board of independent administrative entities such as the Communications Regulatory 
Authority. He also notes with concern the lack of transparency with regard to dissemination 
of information on private media ownership and control. 
</p>
<p>With regard to access to information, despite the adoption of important normative 
instruments, the Special Rapporteur notes the lack of framework legislation on access to 
information held by all public institutions, and not just the public administration. The 
responsiveness of public institutions to requests for information and the lack of consistency 
of the various norms should also receive further attention. The Special Rapporteur is also 
concerned at the recurrence of episodes of hate speech and, in that regard, underlines the 
importance of strengthening initiatives such as awareness-raising programmes, including 
information and education campaigns on diversity. 
</p>
<p>In his conclusions, the Special Rapporteur provides a set of recommendations for 
law and policy reviews relating to the multiple concerns discussed throughout his report.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, undertook an official visit to Italy from 11 to 
18 November 2013, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was carried out pursuant 
to his mandate to assess the compliance of Italy with international standards on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>2. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister of Integration and the 
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in Rome. He also met with the Under-Secretary of 
State on Publishing; the Under-Secretary of State for Justice Affairs; the Councillor to the 
Vice-Minister on Economic Development and Communications; the Director of the Postal 
Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior; the First President of the Court of 
Cassation; the Attorney General; the President of the IX Civil Chamber of the Rome 
Tribunal; the President of the Communications Regulatory Authority; the President of the 
Anti-Trust Authority; the President of the Personal Data Protection Authority; members of 
the Committee of Justice Affairs, the Bicameral Commission for Radio and Television 
Oversight, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the Committees on Infrastructure and 
Culture of the Chamber of Deputies; the Committees on Foreign Affairs and the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights of the Italian Senate; the President and Director-General of 
Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI); members of the Parliament and a number of other senior 
officials. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition, the Special Rapporteur met with journalists, academics and members of 
civil society organizations. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all the people he 
met for their time, valuable contributions and insights. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the President of the Senate, Senator 
Piero Grasso, and the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the Honourable Laura 
Boldrini, for hosting, and inviting him to, a public event on freedom of information at the 
Senate. That event brought together State media authorities and civil society organizations; 
he believes it might serve as a useful model for future multi-stakeholder dialogues on the 
subject. 
</p><p>5. The Special Rapporteur believes that his visit was timely, given the growing demand 
for more openness and freedom of expression in the country, as well as the desire expressed 
by the Government to embark on a new process of political reform.  
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>6. In the field of human rights, Italy has ratified a number of international 
conventions.1 In carrying out his assessment of the situation regarding the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression in Italy, the Special Rapporteur has been guided by the relevant 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child as well as 
its two Optional Protocols, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as 
its Optional Protocol. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>international legal standards. In the present case, the most pertinent treaties are the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter the Covenant), which was 
ratified by the country on 15 September 1978 and, at the regional level, the European 
Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European 
Convention on Human Rights) ratified on 26 October 1955.  
</p><p>7. Article 19 of the Covenant provides that:  
</p>
<p>1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.  
</p>
<p>2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, 
regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or 
through any other media of his choice.  
</p>
<p>3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries 
with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain 
restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:  
</p>
<p>(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;  
(b) For the protection of national security or of public order (<i>ordre 
</i></p>
<p><i>public</i>), or of public health or morals. 
8. Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights reads:  
</p>
<p>1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include 
freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without 
interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not 
prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema 
enterprises.  
</p>
<p>2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and 
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or 
penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the 
interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention 
of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the 
reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received 
in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur is also guided by relevant declarations, resolutions and 
guidelines of various United Nations bodies, including the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s 
general comment No. 34 (2011) on article 19: freedoms of opinion and expression,2 Human 
Rights Council resolutions 16/4 on freedom of opinion and expression and 21/12 on the 
safety of journalists, and the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation 
Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. In line with international standards, the Constitution of 27 December 1947 of the 
Republic of Italy refers in several articles to the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
In particular, article 17 states: &#8220;Citizens have the right to assemble peacefully and 
unarmed.&#8221; Article 18 states: &#8220;Citizens have the right to form associations freely, without

<p>authorization, for ends which are not forbidden to individuals by criminal law.&#8221; Article 21 
states, inter alia: &#8220;All have the right to express freely their own thought by word, in writing 
and by all other means of communication. The press cannot be subjected to authorization or 
censorship.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General overview 
</b></p>
<p>11. Italy is a multiparty parliamentary democracy and the executive authority is vested 
in the Council of Ministers, headed by the President of the Council. In the early 1990s, Italy 
went through a period of political turmoil which led to important reshaping of the political 
arena. Throughout the past decades, Italy has unequivocally stated its commitment to 
ensuring the right to freedom of opinion and expression as defined by international law.  
</p>
<p>12. The previous Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, Ambeyi Ligabo, conducted a visit to Italy from 20 to 
29 October 2004. The purpose of his visit was to ascertain whether the media 
concentration, coupled with conflict of interest, had an impact on the enjoyment of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, as well to investigate allegations of the deterioration 
of the work environment of media professionals in Italy. 
</p>
<p>13. The objective of the second visit to Italy was to reassess the situation of freedom of 
opinion and expression and to highlight new relevant developments in the country. This 
was done in the same spirit of cooperation and dialogue and bearing in mind the 
observations and the recommendations made by the previous Special Rapporteur in his 
report (E/CN.4/2005/64/Add.5). 
</p><p>14. Nine years later, the current Special Rapporteur notes that some concerns noted on 
the first visit to the country remain valid. In particular, he is concerned at allegations 
regarding issues such as the continued criminalization of defamation and insult, the 
emergence of hate speech, the protection of intellectual property at the expense of freedom 
of expression, the conflicts of interest of senior government officials with holdings in the 
media, the procedures for appointing members of the Board of the public broadcaster RAI 
and of independent administrative entities such as the Communications Regulatory 
Authority (Autorit&#224; per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM)). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Issues of concern 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Defamation 
</b></p>
<p>15. Defamation is a criminal offence under the Italian Criminal Code. It is described as 
the case when &#8220;anyone ... by communicating with more persons, offends the reputation of 
someone else&#8221;. Defamation is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up 
to 1,032 euros. If the offence consists of an allegation that cannot be proved as truthful, the 
fine can be doubled.3 Furthermore, in cases where the offence is directed at a &#8220;political, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Criminal Code, art. 595, paras. 1&#8211;2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>administrative or judiciary authority or one of their representatives&#8221; or at a collegial 
authority, the punishment can be further increased.4 
</p>
<p>16. In cases where defamation is committed &#8220;through the press or by any other means of 
publicity, or by public act&#8221;, it is punishable by imprisonment of between six months and 
three years or by a fine of no less than 516 euros.5 Furthermore, if it includes an allegation 
that cannot be proved as truthful, it is punishable by imprisonment of between one year and 
six years, in addition to a fine of no less than 250 euros.6 The director or deputy director of 
the publication, the publisher and the printing enterprise are criminally liable in all cases of 
defamation through the press.7 
</p>
<p>17. The crime of insulting a person is also punishable under the Criminal Code, 
according to which &#8220;whoever offends the honour or reputation of a present person&#8221; is 
punishable with up to six months&#8217; imprisonment or a fine of up to 516 euros.8 Furthermore, 
a journalist accused of defamation through the press must demonstrate the objective public 
interest of the facts reported, which should be exposed in a civilized way. Moreover, even if 
a journalist is acquitted of the crime of defamation, he or she is not entitled to claim 
compensation for the legal costs or moral and patrimonial damages. 
</p>
<p>18. In addition to the criminal lawsuit, an alleged victim of defamation can also pursue a 
civil lawsuit and claim moral and patrimonial damages.9 Further, in cases of defamation 
through the press, the amount of damages is determined &#8220;in relation to the seriousness of 
the offence and the level of dissemination of the publication&#8221;.10 Civil liability is also 
extended to the director or deputy director of the publication as well as to its publisher and 
the printing enterprise.11 In the case where a civil court rejects the claim for compensation 
and moral or material damages, it may decide to grant the journalist compensation for the 
legal costs.  
</p>
<p>19. The Italian defamation law remains a serious concern. The Human Rights 
Committee12 has indicated that defamation laws must be crafted with care to ensure that 
they comply with the requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, and that they 
do not serve, in practice, to stifle freedom of expression. The Special Rapporteur would like 
to recall resolution 1577 (2007) of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, in 
which that Assembly recommended the complete decriminalization of defamation for the 
protection of freedom of expression. Following the adoption of that resolution, defamation, 
libel and slander have become matters of civil action in most European countries. 
Considering that in Italy, under the amended defamation law, only the sanction of 
imprisonment is abolished, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Senate to fully comply 
with that resolution and completely decriminalize defamation, returning the bill to the 
Chamber of Deputies.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that a new defamation bill is before the 
Senate for final approval.13 That new bill has been revised and no longer contains a 
punishment of imprisonment. However, defamation remains a criminal offence under the 
Criminal Code and the fines imposed for defamation committed through the media have 
been significantly increased to between 5,000 and 10,000 euros. Moreover, if the offence 
consists of an allegation that cannot be proved as truthful, the fine can be increased up to 
60,000 euros.14 The bill also provides a temporary ban on the exercise of the profession of 
journalist for a minimum of one month up to a maximum of six months, in cases of 
repeated offences.15 Furthermore, the press is obliged to publish a rectification of the 
alleged defamatory statement without any further commentary. Failure to comply is 
punished with a fine of between 8,000 and 16,000 euros.16 However, the prompt publication 
of the rectification of the statement may only have an influence on the judge&#8217;s 
quantification of the damages if the defendant is found guilty. Civil liability is no longer 
extended automatically to the director or deputy director of the publication, but only if a 
&#8220;cause and effect&#8221; link is proved between neglected control of the publication and the 
damage. On the other hand, the bill establishes that, in cases of frivolous litigation, the 
plaintiff may be fined between 1,000 and 10,000 euros and no compensation is 
automatically granted for the legal costs of the defendant. The new bill also extends the 
crime of defamation through the press to online newspapers and the radio.17  
</p>
<p>21. The new bill also eliminates the sanction of imprisonment in cases of insult and 
defamation between private individuals; however, it provides for a significantly heavier 
fine. The fine for insult, including through the Internet, has increased to up to 5,000 euros 
and for defamation between private individuals up to 10,000 euros.18 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur heard from various interlocutors that removing the sanction 
of imprisonment for the crime of defamation was an important step forward by the 
Government of Italy. It was also explained that the protection of the honour and reputation 
of a person was still regarded as very important in the country. Therefore, monetary fines 
had been increased, as the established compensation to the victim was considered 
insufficient to prevent episodes of defamation. It was further stated that defamation could 
not be decriminalized completely, as the purpose was to target people who intentionally 
disseminated false information. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur reiterated that for a statement to be considered defamatory, 
it must be false, it must injure another person&#8217;s reputation and it must be made with 
malicious intent to cause injury to another individual&#8217;s reputation. He also indicated that the 
following principles must be respected with regard to defamation: (a) public figures should 
refrain from bringing defamation suits, as they are required to tolerate a greater degree of 
criticism than private citizens; (b) to require truth in the context of publications relating to 
matters of public interest is excessive; (c) with regard to opinions, it should be clear that 
only patently unreasonable views may qualify as defamatory; (d) the onus of proof for all 
elements should be on those claiming to have been defamed rather than on the defendant; 
where truth is an issue, the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff; (e) in defamation actions,

<p>a range of remedies should be available, including apology and/or correction, and penal 
sanctions, in particular imprisonment, should never be applied.19  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur commends the Chamber of Deputies for its initiative in 
removing the sanction of imprisonment for the crime of defamation, which he believes is an 
important step in guaranteeing freedom of expression. However, he considers that 
defamation should be decriminalized completely and transformed from a criminal to a civil 
action, with corrections or apologies being applied as remedies. He believes that 
criminalizing defamation limits the liberty with which freedom of expression can be 
exercised. He also believes that any criminal lawsuit, even without a prison sentence being 
foreseen, may have an intimidating effect, particularly on journalists. He would further like 
to draw attention to the fact that if an economic penalty is applied through criminal law, this 
will most likely be followed by civil economic reparation for the victim, thus imposing a 
double economic sanction.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur is concerned as to the amount of the reparation and the fines 
imposed. A recurring argument that was reiterated in many of the meetings during the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit with regard to keeping the crime of defamation a criminal 
offence was that a victim of defamation would normally prefer a criminal to a civil 
proceeding owing to the fact that a criminal procedure is considered faster than a civil 
procedure. In response to this argument, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline that 
the solution to this issue would be to establish a more efficient and expedient procedure in 
civil court proceedings in line with, inter alia, article 6 of the European Convention on 
Human Rights and article 19 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the right to rectification of information, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that it is important to uphold such a right, but that this should be level with the 
right of the press or the other party to present and defend their arguments. He believes that 
a public correction should eliminate the cause for any legal action by the offended party. 
The Special Rapporteur believes that the purpose of a rectification should only be to correct 
wrong information given and the harm that may have been done, but it should not entail a 
punishment. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern that frivolous litigation can become a 
form of &#8220;judicial harassment&#8221; against the press or anyone exercising the right to freedom of 
expression. A media enterprise can have its economic capacity seriously undermined when 
confronted by multiple defamation cases. Even if claims are dismissed at the preliminary 
hearing, the economic impact of the expenses generated by various lawsuits can intimidate 
the journalist or the media vehicle, with repercussions for the work of the entire press. In 
this regard, the Special Rapporteur noted with appreciation that the Committee of Justice 
Affairs of the Chamber of Deputies is conducting an investigation into cases of frivolous 
litigation. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Parliament to establish mandatory fines 
for frivolous litigation representing 25&#8211;50 per cent of the amount requested in frivolous 
claims, to enhance protection against judicial harassment of the press through lawsuits. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Crime of insulting public officials 
</b></p>
<p>28. In 1999, the crime of insulting a public official (art. 341 of the Criminal Code) was 
removed from the Code as it was no longer considered in line with &#8220;the current necessities 
and dominant social conceptions in modern society&#8221;.20 However, the Special Rapporteur

<p>has been informed that it was later reintroduced, with certain modifications, as article 341 
bis of the Criminal Code in the &#8220;Security Package&#8221; Law No. 94 of 15 July 2009, which 
entered into force on 8 August 2009.21 
</p>
<p>29. The new law defines insult as &#8220;in a public venue or a venue open to the public and in 
the presence of other persons, offend[ing] the honour and prestige of a public official who 
is performing an official duty and in the exercise of his powers&#8221;.22 It no longer includes 
insults that are uttered &#8220;through telegraph or telephone communications, or through 
writings or drawings directed at a public official and for reasons related to his duties&#8221;.23 The 
new law no longer provides for a &#8220;minimum penalty&#8221; of six months of imprisonment and it 
has increased the maximum penalty from two to three years of imprisonment. Furthermore, 
if the insult contains an allegation that cannot be proved as truthful, the punishment is even 
higher. However, the charges can be dropped if the defendant agrees to pay damages before 
the trial.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the reintroduction of the crime of insult 
directed at public officials in the presence of other people. He underlines that public 
officials should not be protected by a higher threshold for criticism or insult than any other 
people as, by its nature, their function is subject to frequent public debate and criticism. 
Furthermore, he is seriously concerned that the practice of allowing the defendant to pay 
compensation to the victim in order for the charges to be dropped can serve as a form of 
blackmail against anyone who would prefer to pay a fine rather than risk prosecution. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Conflict of interest 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Frattini Law No. 215 of 2004 contains provisions that regulate cases of conflict 
of interest between holding a government position and carrying out professional activities.24 
Specifically, the Law states that the position of manager of a company is incompatible with 
exercising public office. However, this incompatibility is not extended to the owner or the 
controlling shareholder of the company.25 The Law determines that there is a conflict of 
interest when an &#8220;act of commission &#8230; or omission&#8221; carried out by a public office holder 
has a &#8220;specific, preferential effect&#8221; on the assets of the office holder and also &#8220;of his or her 
spouse or relatives up to the second degree, or of companies or other undertakings 
controlled by them, to the detriment of the public interest&#8221;.26 Moreover, in the case of a 
breach of the rules on conflict of interest, it is the company manager and not the owner or 
controlling shareholder who is sanctioned. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur is aware that, in 2005, the European Commission for 
Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) in Opinion No. 309/2004 on the 
compatibility of the Laws &#8220;Gasparri&#8221; and &#8220;Frattini&#8221; of Italy with the Council of Europe 
standards in the field of freedom of expression and pluralism of the media, concluded that 
the Frattini Law did not adequately address the problem of conflict of interests. 
Furthermore, he has been informed that the recommendations made by the Venice 
Commission have to date not yet been implemented. The Special Rapporteur fully concurs 
with European Parliament resolution of 25 September 2008 on concentration and pluralism

ownership concentration and political power &#8230; are detrimental to free competition, a level 
playing field and pluralism&#8221;.27 
</p>
<p>33. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to exchange views with 
many relevant stakeholders with regard to media ownership and control. Although the 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the openness of the discussion on the legislation on 
transparency of the media, he believes that there is a need for legislative reform which 
would introduce an explicit incompatibility between holding elected or government office 
and ownership and control of media.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur considers that to ensure transparency, information on the 
full identity of the ownership of the media and the decision-making and control 
mechanisms should be disclosed. He understands that the disclosure of information on 
ownership, control and sources of revenue of the media would contribute to preventing 
monopolies, cross-ownership and unlawful concentration of the media, and would also 
allow people to better interpret the position of various media groups.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Public broadcasting service 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Gasparri Law (No. 112/2004) contains provisions overseeing a progressive total 
privatization of RAI and establishes that within 60 days of its adoption, &#8220;RAI 
Radiotelevisione Italiana Spa&#8221; should be incorporated into &#8220;RAI-Holding Spa&#8221;. The Law 
also provides that State-owned shares in RAI-Holding Spa should be sold progressively 
through a series of public offers until it is completely privatized. However, according to the 
law, single buyers may only buy up to 1 per cent of the shares. Furthermore, it does not 
allow the formation of trusts or voting collusion.28  
</p>
<p>36. According to the Gasparri Law and the Consolidated Broadcasting Act 
(No. 177/2005), the RAI Board is composed of nine members. The Special Rapporteur has 
been informed that the Ministry of Economy and Finance controls 99.5 per cent of the RAI 
shares and that the Minister of Economy and Finance and a special Parliamentary 
Commission for General Guidance and Supervision of the Broadcasting Services appoint 
members of the Board. The Minister appoints two Board members and also selects which of 
those two members will be the President of the Board, following the favourable opinion of 
two thirds of the special Parliamentary Commission. The Commission elects the remaining 
seven Board members, following a voting system which allows the majority to choose four 
of them and the opposition to choose the remaining three.29 The law also establishes that the 
Director-General of RAI is appointed by its Board &#8220;in agreement with the shareholders&#8217; 
assembly&#8221;. The Director-General is responsible for the management of RAI and has the 
authority to select the channels and news directors, subject to final approval by the Board.30  
</p><p>37. The existence of public service along with private and community broadcasting may 
often contribute to enhancing plurality in the media. Nevertheless, as indicated by the 
Human Rights Committee, States should ensure that public broadcasting services operate in

</p>
<p>an independent manner.31 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that two out of 
the nine RAI board members are directly appointed by the Government and that six other 
members are also nominated by the ruling coalition in Parliament. The Special Rapporteur 
is also concerned that the concession on the frequencies used by RAI, as well as the public 
service, is granted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. To ensure the independence of 
the Board from Government interference, the appointment of its membership should be 
fully revised and the transparency of the procedure enhanced. For example, members could 
be appointed at different of time and civil society should be involved in the procedure. 
</p>
<p>38. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to the recommendations of 
the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers and Parliamentary Assembly on 
guaranteeing the independence of public service broadcasting, which state that the rules 
governing the status of the boards of management of public service broadcasting 
organizations, especially their membership, should be defined in a manner which avoids 
placing the boards at risk of any political or other interference and recognize that public 
service broadcasters must be protected against political interference in their daily 
management and their editorial work.32 
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, with regard to the General Service Contract between RAI and the State, 
the Special Rapporteur believes that particular attention should be given to guaranteeing the 
implementation of the principle of diversity and pluralism. Furthermore, the right to 
judicially challenge the compliance of RAI with the provisions of that public service 
contract should not be limited to the contractual counterpart of RAI, i.e. the State as 
represented by the Minister of Economy and Finance, but should be extended to all citizens. 
</p>
<p>40. In this context, the Special Rapporteur encourages the promotion of open 
consultations with all stakeholders, including civil society, to discuss the future of the 
public broadcasting service ahead of the expiry of the licence contract between the State 
and RAI, which is scheduled to take place in 2016. 
</p>
<p>41. Another issue of concern is the provision of the Gasparri Law which establishes that 
RAI must guarantee the free broadcasting of messages that are deemed &#8220;socially useful&#8221;, at 
the request of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 
notion of &#8220;socially useful&#8221; is relatively unclear and subject to interpretations which could 
lead to abusive use of this mechanism. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur fully concurs 
with Council of Europe recommendation 99 (1) on measures to promote media pluralism, 
which was also quoted by the Venice Commission in its 2005 opinion. It states that &#8220;the 
cases in which public service broadcasting organizations may be compelled to broadcast 
official messages, declarations or communications, or to report on the acts or decisions of 
public authorities, or to grant airtime to such authorities, should be confined to exceptional 
circumstances.&#8221;33  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Communications Regulatory Authority  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) is an independent body 
which was established under the Maccanico Law No. 249 in 1997. It has the responsibility 
to ensure equitable conditions for fair market competition and to protect the fundamental

</b></p>
<p>rights of citizens in that regard. It also has competence over the publishing, radio and 
television broadcasting, and electronic communications sectors. AGCOM carries out the 
following functions, in particular:  
</p>
<p>(a) Implementation of liberalization in the telecommunication market through 
regulation and supervision activities, and through dispute resolution;  
</p>
<p>(b) Rationalization of resources in the audiovisual sector; application of anti-trust 
rules in the field of communications; conducting inquiries on dominant positions;  
</p>
<p>(c) Organization of the registry of communications operators;  
(d) Quality control and distribution of services and products, including 
</p>
<p>advertising and protection of children;  
</p>
<p>(e) Resolution of disputes between operators and consumers;  
(f) Fostering and safeguarding political, social and economic pluralism in 
</p>
<p>broadcasting.  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, AGCOM should also ensure that companies operating within the 
integrated system of communications that belong to a holder of a government post, his/her 
spouse or relatives up to the second degree, do not act in such a way as to provide 
privileged support to the particular holder of the government post concerned. In the case of 
misconduct by a company, AGCOM should order the company to stop questionable 
conduct and, if possible, to take corrective measures. In case of non-compliance, the 
company concerned can be fined. 
</p>
<p>44. As an independent authority, AGCOM has the mandate to oversee the 
implementation of the regulations established by the Maccanico Law and its subsequent 
amendments. For that purpose only, they are empowered to adopt their own administrative 
regulations, but should refrain from expanding their regulatory mandate. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that all regulations regarding constitutional rights should be approved 
by Parliament, in particular those affecting the right to freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>45. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur was informed that AGCOM can still issue 
regulations based on legislation by Parliament and that some of those norms are generic and 
may be loosely interpreted by various authorities and bodies, with consequences for the 
right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>46. The issue of intellectual property, for example, was discussed during the visit and a 
number of concerns were raised regarding the adoption of additional measures for the 
protection of copyright at the expense of freedom of expression. For the Special 
Rapporteur, the establishment of norms protecting intellectual property should remain 
exclusively within the purview of the Parliament.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur also underlines that, although AGCOM may by law apply 
some limitations on online content, the removal of online content should be decided by the 
Court on a case-by-case basis. In particular, he believes that in no case should the contents 
of an online newspaper be censored. Furthermore, there should never be any liability for the 
content by the intermediaries.  
</p>
<p>48. Another issue of concern is the procedure for the appointment of the five board 
members of AGCOM. The President of AGCOM is appointed by the President of the 
Republic upon the advice of the Prime Minister in agreement with the Minister for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>Economic Development. The Chamber of Representatives and the Senate appoint the 
remaining four members of AGCOM.34  
</p>
<p>49. In order to ensure the full independence of that regulatory body, additional measures 
need to be taken to enhance the transparency and objectivity of the procedure for the 
appointment of its members. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur suggests that the 
selection criteria for the AGCOM board members, and information on the qualifications 
and professional experience of the applicants should be published and made accessible to 
the public, including on the Internet. He also suggests that the shortlisted candidates should 
be called to a public hearing in Parliament and the final decision should be made through a 
public vote. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Anti-trust provisions 
</b></p>
<p>50. The anti-trust provisions of the Gasparri Law establish a ban on the creation and the 
maintenance of &#8220;dominant positions&#8221; in the broadcast media market.35 They also empower 
AGCOM to identify the existence of a relevant market &#8220;in accordance with the principles of 
articles 15&#8211;16 of Directive 2002/21/EC&#8221;36 (European Union Framework Directive), to 
verify the existence of dominant positions in the relevant market and to take measures 
necessary for eliminating or preventing the formation of dominant positions. The Gasparri 
Law also set a cap of 20 per cent on the total number of &#8220;television/radio programmes&#8221;37 
that a single broadcaster can operate and a cap of 20 per cent on the total revenues of the 
Integrated Communications System (SIC). SIC includes television, publishing, radio, the 
Internet, direct advertising activities, sponsorships, revenues from the RAI annual licence 
fee, sales of cinema tickets, rented or sold DVDs, and direct State grants to print publishers.  
</p>
<p>51. The anti-trust provisions of the Gasparri Law replace the norms of the Maccanico 
Law No. 249/1997, which provided, inter alia, that each operator should not own more than 
two nationwide analogue non-encrypted television channels. It also provided that any 
broadcaster with more than 30 per cent of the revenues from advertising, public fees (for 
public channels) or pay-per-view services in their respective media market would be 
considered as holding a dominant position.38 However, the Gasparri Law does not provide 
any reference to thresholds identifying what would constitute &#8220;dominant positions&#8221; in the 
respective media markets; it only contains thresholds related to the number of television 
channels and the revenues within SIC.  
</p>
<p>52. Furthermore, a recent amendment to the Gasparri Law replaced the 20 per cent cap 
on &#8220;television/radio programmes&#8221; with a broader definition of &#8220;television/radio 
programming&#8221;, which is defined as &#8220;a group of programmes &#8230; under the same editorial 
trademark and destined to the public&#8221; and which excludes &#8220;delayed transmission of the 
same programming&#8221;, &#8220;merely repetitive transmissions&#8221; and &#8220;pay-per-view programmes or 
programme packages&#8221;.39 
</p>
<p>53. Moreover, as of 31 December 2012, a provision of the Gasparri Law which regulates 
cross-ownership of broadcast and print media has removed the ban on television

</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the concern that was expressed by the 
previous mandate holder during his visit in 2004 regarding the negative impact of the 
concentration of private media in the hands of senior government officials, and of the 
State&#8217;s influence over the public media. Such an environment is conducive to a climate of 
intimidation in which public administrators might exercise censorship, limiting freedom of 
opinion and expression in the country. He is also concerned that such a climate could lead 
to a situation of self-censorship where journalists would refrain from making statements 
that might be construed as critical of the authorities.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the Human Rights Committee has already 
indicated in its general comment No. 34 (2011) on the right to freedom of expression that 
States parties should take appropriate action, consistent with the Covenant, to prevent 
undue media dominance or concentration by privately controlled media groups in 
monopolistic situations that may be harmful to a diversity of sources and views.41 In this 
regard, he regrets the amendment of the Gasparri Law and the removal of the ban on cross-
ownership of broadcast and print media. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the concerns 
raised by the Venice Commission, which stated that those amendments could allow 
incumbent broadcast media groups to expand into the print media sector.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Situation of journalists 
</b>56. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies from journalists and 
social communicators who had suffered threats, intimidation and assault in the exercise of 
their profession. A civil society study had compiled over 300 cases of intimidation against 
journalists in Italy in 2012, including 104 verbal and oral threats and 16 cases of assault.42 
The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets that in many cases, threats and attacks against 
journalists occur with impunity.  
57. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the deteriorating working conditions 
of journalists, which might expose them to further harm and affect their independence. He 
was appalled to hear about the proliferation of informal working arrangements through 
freelance contracts, and the low remuneration received in such cases. He was further 
informed that freelance journalists are paid between 5 and 50 euros per article, or 
sometimes receive 4 centimes per line. He is particularly concerned at the greater 
possibilities of exploitation due to the irregularity of their work. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore strongly recommends that standards be set and applied urgently, including tariffs 
for fair remuneration, in line with the cost-of-living indicators. 
</p>
<p>58. The role of journalists and social communicators is as relevant to a democratic 
society as is the role of human rights defenders, because they become a guarantee of the 
enjoyment of human rights and facilitate the provision of information to society, which 
allows the full participation of citizens in public life. Therefore, he believes that it is 
essential to create an environment of professionalism and independence within the media 
sector where media professionals can work without undue influence from the State. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the statement made by the President of the Senate 
in December 2012 recognizing the need for a law that will sanction anyone who obstructs 
the exercise of freedom of information.

</p>
<p><b> 8. Access to information law 
</b></p>
<p>59. Law 241/1995 (Administrative Procedure Act) is one of various instruments 
regulating access to information held by government institutions in Italy. A number of 
additional legal instruments43 have been adopted over the past five years introducing 
additional core principles, such as full disclosure of all information and total accessibility. 
Most importantly, Italy recently passed a new transparency law (33/2013) prescribing a 
number of measures for proactive disclosure. Despite recognizing important advances in 
the national norms, the Special Rapporteur notes that the current normative framework 
lacks consistency, since it only applies to government and related public administration 
bodies and does not cover all types of information, but only information already compiled 
in existing acts and documents.  
</p>
<p>60. Furthermore, a recent study44 identified important challenges to the implementation 
of norms relating to access to government-held information. It evaluated the response of 
State entities to 300 requests for information in various thematic areas, ranging from human 
rights to finance. Only 27 per cent of requests resulted in the provision of what was 
considered to be fully satisfactory information, which means that by far the majority of 
responses, 73 per cent, were inadequate. The study also noted the very high level of 
administrative silence: 65 per cent of the requests had received no response from public 
authorities after 30 years.  
</p>
<p>61. In his previous report to the General Assembly,45 the Special Rapporteur noted that 
the recent adoption of national laws protecting access to information was a positive step 
towards giving effect to central components of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression as established in international treaties. However, the implementation of those 
laws continues to be hampered by obstacles such as the reluctance of officials to release 
information, the prevalence of secrecy laws, complex bureaucratic procedures and limited 
technical capacity.  
</p>
<p>62. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur underlines the importance of adopting unique 
coherent framework legislation on access to information held by all the public institutions 
and not just limited to the public administration. The Special Rapporteur also highlights the 
need to revise procedures in all State institutions in order to ensure that access to 
information is rapid, inexpensive and not unduly burdensome.  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Hate speech 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur considers that the phenomena of hate speech and 
discrimination seriously affect and undermine the dignity of individuals. He is particularly 
concerned at the occurrence of hate speech against migrants and other minorities in 
electoral campaigns, which is unfortunately becoming common in many European 
countries, partly as a consequence of the impact of the recent financial crisis. He fully 
agrees with the statement made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights after her visit to Italy in March 2010 that deliberate negative stereotyping of any 
group of people was unacceptable and dangerous, and in which she urged politicians, the 
media and public officials not only to avoid that type of rhetoric themselves, but also to

<p>publicly campaign against such behaviour by others&#8221;.46 The Special Rapporteur stresses 
that, in accordance with article 20 of the Covenant, any advocacy of national, racial or 
religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be 
prohibited by law. He stresses that, although the State does not have the responsibility to 
protect individuals from offence, it has the responsibility to protect them from harm, 
whether it be discrimination or violence.  
</p>
<p>64. In a recent thematic report,47 the Special Rapporteur addressed the worrying increase 
in expressions of hate, incitement to violence and discrimination. In the study, he 
emphasized that the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of expression must go 
hand in hand with efforts to combat intolerance, discrimination and incitement to hatred. 
Accordingly, he emphasized that legal measures combating hate speech should be 
complemented by a broad set of non-legal measures to bring about genuine changes in 
mindsets. He recommended, for example, that political leaders actively promote tolerance 
and understanding towards others and support open debates and exchanges of ideas in 
which everyone can participate on an equal footing. He also called on public officials to 
systematically denounce and condemn hate speech publicly. 
</p>
<p>65. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to underline his strong support to 
the Government, and in particular the Ministry of Integration, in their fight against this 
scourge through the development of awareness-raising programmes, including information 
and education campaigns on diversity, which can contribute to better communication and 
understanding among different ethnic groups. He believes that prevention is the most 
important tool and that such educational programmes can contribute to eradicating 
ignorance, which is often the root cause of unacceptable attitudes and behaviour.  
</p>
<p>66. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed of a proposed bill on 
homophobia and transphobia. He strongly supports that initiative and believes that it is an 
important first step in addressing discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender population in the country. However, he underlines that the bill should not 
include any exceptions for institutions or particular groups which might generate loopholes 
in its application. He also encourages the Parliament to consider adopting a law on other 
forms of hate speech, such as misogynistic messages and incitement to violence against 
women and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> 10. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendations, made by the previous 
Special Rapporteur after his visit to Italy in 2004 and by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights after her visit to the country in March 2010, that the 
Italian authorities should create a national human rights institution in accordance with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions (the Paris Principles).48 The Special 
Rapporteur is aware that the Government of Italy, after the universal periodic review, did 
not accept the recommendation on the establishment of a national human rights institution 
by the end of 2010. He is also aware that the Government indicated that a bill on the 
establishment of such an institution &#8220;will be submitted to the Parliament as soon as the 
required budgetary resources are made available&#8221;.49

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3

<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>68. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that a bill on the 
establishment of a human rights commission had been presented to the Parliament in 
February 2013. The Special Rapporteur strongly supports that initiative and encourages the 
Parliament to adopt the bill, in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur believes that the creation of a national human rights 
institution is crucial for promoting and monitoring the effective implementation of 
international human rights standards in the country and that it can serve as an advisory body 
to the authorities in drafting new legislation that can have an impact on human rights. By 
reporting regularly, it would also highlight strong points and weaknesses in the legislation, 
which could then serve as important indicators to the authorities in developing policies. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>70. <b>Throughout all his activities, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance 
of freedom of opinion and expression in a truly democratic society. He emphasizes 
that the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression is at the heart of 
the promotion and protection of human rights. In this respect, he recalls Commission 
on Human Rights resolution 2003/42, in which the Commission stated that the 
effective promotion and protection of the human rights of persons who exercise the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression were of fundamental importance to the 
safeguarding of human dignity and that restrictions on the exercise of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression could indicate a deterioration in the protection, 
respect for and enjoyment of other human rights and freedoms.  
</b>71. <b>Italy has made clear commitments in ratifying multiple international treaties 
establishing the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The national legal 
framework of Italy mostly reflects those commitments. However, as indicated above, a 
number of concerns remain, both with regard to the persistence of inadequate 
legislation and to the implementation of existing regulations regarding issues such as 
defamation, media ownership and oversight.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur appreciates that Italy is in a period of transition and 
that the State authorities recognize the need to further debate this issue and enhance 
their attention to freedom of expression in the country. During its universal periodic 
review in 2010, Italy accepted recommendations related to concerns addressed in the 
present report, such as the need to adopt measures and safeguards to ensure the 
independent functioning of the media without the influence of the State, and the need 
to address concerns over media concentration.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>In this regard, to further strengthen the democratic foundations of Italy, the 
Special Rapporteur, in a spirit of constructive engagement, recommends the steps out 
below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Defamation 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Defamation should be decriminalized completely and transformed from a 
criminal to a civil action, in order not to dissuade freedom of expression. The Senate 
should revise the amount of reparation and maintain the principle of proportionality. 
The Parliament should repeal article 341 bis of the Criminal Code, which punishes 
insults directed to public officials in the presence of other people.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Government should promote a culture of tolerance regarding criticism, 
particularly of public officials and bodies and other influential figures, which is 
essential for democracy.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Defamation claims should never be used to stifle criticism of State institutions 
and policies. Public officials and bodies should refrain from filing defamation suits, as 
public office entails public scrutiny as part of the checks and balances in any 
democratic society. In order to further discourage the practice of frivolous litigation, 
in addition to the legal costs, the law should establish a mandatory economic penalty 
representing a percentage of the amount of civil reparation requested.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Media ownership and conflict of interest 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to promote and protect media 
diversity and pluralism by preventing cross-ownership of print and broadcast media. 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>The Frattini Law should be amended to introduce an explicit incompatibility 
between holding elected or government office and ownership and control of the media.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>In order to enhance transparency, an obligation to disclose the full identity of 
the ownership of the media and their internal decision-making mechanisms, should be 
established. This information should be made fully accessible to the public by the 
competent regulatory body, AGCOM.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>AGCOM should also make information on the sources of revenue of the media 
fully accessible to the public. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Public broadcasting service 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>RAI should be placed under the control of an independent body, such as a trust 
fund or a broadcasting institution, and be administered as a public asset.  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The appointment of the members of the Board of RAI should be conducted in a 
transparent way, as with regulatory bodies. The selection criteria for Board members, 
and information on the qualifications and professional experience of the applicants 
should be published and made accessible to the public, including on the Internet. The 
shortlisted candidates should be called to a public hearing in the Parliament and the 
final decision should be made through a public vote. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Communications Regulatory Authority 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Parliament should establish a mechanism that would ensure the 
transparency of the election processes for members of the boards of regulatory bodies. 
The selection criteria for the AGCOM Board membership, and information on the 
qualifications and professional experience of the applicants should be published and 
made accessible to the public, including on the Internet. The shortlisted candidates 
should be called to a public hearing in the Parliament and the final decision should be 
made through a public vote. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Anti-trust provisions 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>A legislative overhaul should be undertaken of the radio and television 
normative system, especially the anti-trust provisions. The lack of clarity on </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/30/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>thresholds identifying what would constitute &#8220;dominant positions&#8221; in the media 
market and the recent removal of the ban on broadcasters who operate more than one 
national channel owning or purchasing shares in newspaper publishing companies are 
among the concerns which would need to be addressed in the review. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Situation of journalists 
</b>85. <b>All acts of intimidation and violence against journalists need to be fully 
investigated. In this regard, consideration should be given to the adoption of specific 
initiatives dedicated to preventing and investigating attacks, and bringing those 
responsible to justice.  
</b>86. <b>Attention should be paid to the working conditions of journalists. Standards 
should be set, including tariffs for fair remuneration of journalists&#8217; work subject to 
periodic review.  
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Access to information law 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Parliament should enact a full access to information law applicable to all 
public institutions, which would guarantee access to public information on financial 
and political matters to citizens, with the fewest restrictions possible.</b> P<b>rocedures for 
accessing information need to be fully revised in order to ensure that access to 
information is rapid, inexpensive and not unduly burdensome. Access to information 
can be further enhanced through the appointment of a focal point, such as an 
independent information commissioner, or the establishment of a specialized 
institution to promote and monitor the implementation of national norms on access to 
information.  
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Hate speech 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Legal measures combating hate speech should be complemented by a broad set 
of non-legal measures to bring about genuine changes in mindsets. The Special 
Rapporteur underlines his full support to the work of the Ministry of Integration in 
developing awareness-raising programmes, including information and education 
campaigns on diversity. Political leaders and public officials must systematically 
denounce and condemn hate speech publicly, and actively promote a culture of 
tolerance. The proposed bill on homophobia and transphobia should be amended to 
eliminate all exceptions for institutions or particular groups.  
</b></p>
<p><b> I. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>A national human rights institution should be established in accordance with 
the Paris Principles. Such a body could play an important role in catalysing legal and 
policy initiatives relevant for the promotion of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression.
