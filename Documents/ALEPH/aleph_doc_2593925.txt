REVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
FY2016 net profit after tax (“NPAT”) of $20.5m represents an increase of $31.2m compared to the net loss 
before significant items of $10.7m in FY2015. The FY2016 NPAT result was driven by a strong operating 
performance with FY2016 EBITDA before significant items of $224.1m reflecting an increase of $93.8m (72%) 
compared to $130.3m in FY2015.
The return to profit in FY2016 was driven by the benefits of a significant increase in production and sales 
volumes along with a 12% increase in EBITDA margins to 19% from 17% in FY2015. The improved margin 
performance reflects a substantial reduction in unit costs of production which more than offset a lower average 
selling price realised for coal sold.

Directors’ Report

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONT.)
The key factors that contributed to the FY2016 NPAT result for the year include:
  Strong safety performance.
  The commencement of commercial production at Maules Creek. This underpinned the production result with
group ROM production of 15.8mt, up 55% compared to 10.2mt in FY2015. Run rate ROM production at 
Maules Creek at the end of FY2016 was above 9.5Mtpa.
  FOB costs per tonne of $56 in FY2016 have decreased by 8% from $61 reported in FY2015. FOB costs per
tonne have decreased for 3 ½ years since the first half of FY2013. These savings have contributed to the 
Group being able to consistently defend and grow average EBITDA margins. The key drivers of the 
significant reduction in unit costs during the year were:
o  The commencement of commercial production at Maules Creek at a lower unit cost than the mine
portfolio average.
o  Continued productivity improvements at Narrabri and the Gunnedah open cut mines:
  Narrabri production rates continue to improve due to an ongoing focus on operational and
technical improvements. Increased automation has led to consistent performance on the 
longwall, development rates continue to improve and longwall change-outs are increasingly 
efficient. Further productivity and cost improvements are expected when mining transitions 
to 400 metre wide panels late in FY2017.
  Narrabri unit cost performance was achieved despite the reduction in ROM production in
FY2016 caused by the impact of two change-outs during the year.
  Production in FY2016 from the Gunnedah Open Cuts was slightly above FY2015, however
overall unit costs decreased significantly due to an ongoing focus on containing costs, 
efficiencies associated with blasting and overburden movement initiatives and ongoing 
productivity improvements.
o  Procurement initiatives continue to result in contracts for goods and services being re-negotiated on
improved terms.
o  Stable production from Maules Creek has increased the resilience of the overall portfolio. This has 
reduced the impact of longwall change-outs and supported a further improvement in the utilisation 
of contracted rail and port capacity.
o  The decline in rail, port and demurrage unit costs reflects a sustained focus on logistics
management across the business.
o  Administration costs remain broadly consistent despite the growth in production of 55%.
o  The fall in world crude oil prices in FY2016 has contributed to decreased unit costs of coal
production.
  Gross revenue increased by $401.1m to $1,164.4m in FY2016. The increase was driven by increased sales
volumes with total sales of 15.5mt up by 63% on FY2015 sales volumes of 9.5mt. The increase in sales 
volumes was partly offset by a fall in A$ prices to A$75 per tonne in FY2016 from A$80 per tonne in FY2015 
average (US$ denominated coal prices fell 19% while the A$:US$ exchange rate improved by 14%).
  The mix of sales between thermal (84%) and metallurgical coal products (16%) in the year ended 30 June
2016 is slightly down on FY2015 where metallurgical coal sales represented 18% of total sales. The 
reduction in the proportion of metallurgical sales is primarily due to the mix at Maules Creek being below the 
portfolio average in the first year of commercial production. The proportion of metallurgical coal sales is 
expected to increase progressively over the next four years as the high quality Maules Creek semi-soft 
coking coal gains increased market acceptance and term based contracts are concluded.
  Realised prices have been supported by the quality of thermal coal from Maules Creek. Sales of Maules
Creek thermal coal have typically achieved substantial quality and energy premiums relative to the 
Newcastle Index price during the year. The quality of the thermal coal from Maules Creek has also provided 
opportunities to increase sales to customers in premium markets, particularly Japan and Taiwan.

Cash generated from operations of $269.3m increased by 76% from the prior year. The improvement is due to 
the following:
  An increase in EBITDA before significant items of $93.8m ($224.1m in FY2016 from $130.3m in FY2015),
largely driven by increased sales volumes and improved margins in FY2016.
  A net reduction in inventory during the year due to sales of produced coal of 15.4mt exceeding saleable
production of 15.1mt.
  Partially offset by increased investment in gate road development in FY2016 in preparation for the
increased length of upcoming longwall panels.
Investing cash flows
Investing cash outflows of $93.1m in the year ended 30 June 2016 is a decrease of $283.6m compared to 
FY2015. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in Maules Creek construction expenditure due to the 
substantial completion of the project during FY2015. Other factors which affected investing cash outflows 
include:
  Decreased main road development expenditure at Narrabri. 
  Expenditure of $21.2m in relation to the Narrabri 400m wide face expansion project.  
  Remaining capital spend across the group was tightly controlled and related to sustaining capital required at
each of the mines and expenditure at Vickery.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND BALANCE SHEET COMMENTARY
Cash on hand at 30 June 2016 of $101.5m is consistent with the cash balance at 30 June 2015.
Net Debt at 30 June 2016 was $859.1m, a decrease of $76.7m from 30 June 2015.  The decrease has primarily 
been due to repayments of $65m on the senior syndicated facility and principal amortisation of finance leases.
The gearing ratio has fallen due to the reduction in net debt at 30 June 2016. Undrawn capacity of $365m 
existed at 30 June 2016.

  Further sustainable cost reductions achieved at all operating mines during the year, continuing the trend of
reductions in unit costs for seven successive halves.
There were 843 FTE Whitehaven employees at the end of FY2016. Approximately 80% of these employees live 
in the region of our operations. This is consistent with Whitehaven’s aim to ensure that the local community is a 
key beneficiary of the Group’s operations. Employee and contractor numbers have grown from the beginning of 
FY2016 as Maules Creek has expanded. A total of 11% of the Group’s employees self-identify as Aboriginal 
and/or Torres Strait Islander. Approximately 10% of the Group’s employees are female.

2016 PERFORMANCE
The introduction of the seven “Safehaven Rules” in late FY2014 has embedded safety as a cornerstone of the 
Group’s culture. Ongoing education and training ensures that safety remains front of mind for all employees and 
continues to deliver improved safety outcomes at most operations.
  Both Rocglen and the Gunnedah CHPP achieved two years without a recordable injury.
  Whitehaven Coal Group TRIFR of 10.6 at the end of the year.
  The TRIFR is significantly below the NSW average coal mining rate of 15.5.

1FY2015 includes pre-commercial production and sales
Commercial production at Maules Creek commenced on 1 July 2015 with the mine producing 7.4Mt saleable 
coal in FY2016. The mine was operating at an annualised ROM production rate of over 9.5Mt at the end of 
FY2016 following its production ramp up during the year. Maules Creek was awarded Mining Operation of the 
Year by NSW Minerals Council, a significant achievement in its first year of operation.
Construction activities at the mine were effectively completed early in FY2016 with total capital expenditure for 
the project $701 million. The project came in under the budget of $767 million and ahead of the original 
schedule. Maules Creek is one of the lowest cost coal mining projects developed over the past decade.
A key feature of Maules Creek’s performance during FY2016 has been the high quality of its thermal and 
metallurgical coal products. Maules Creek thermal coal is one of the highest quality coals sold into the Asian 
seaborne market. Many of our customers are utilising this high energy, low ash coal in new High Energy Low 
Emission (‘HELE’) technology power stations to reduce their emissions. The quality of its metallurgical coal 
product has exceeded the expectations of most steel makers. Many steel makers have provided feedback in 
relation to the positive contribution of Maules Creek semi soft coking coal to their coking blends. Sales of semi-
soft coking coal during FY2016 were above expectations and sales are expected to increase as production 
ramps up to the approved production level of 13Mtpa.
Maules Creek’s coal reserves have been updated as part of Whitehaven’s annual update of its coal resources 
and reserves under the JORC code 2012. This update incorporates an increase in Maules Creek coal reserves 
to 510Mt. This represents an upgrade of 129Mt relative to the coal reserves of 381Mt declared at the end of 
FY2015.

The Narrabri underground mine continued to deliver excellent results and has broken a series of production 
records. In CY2015 the mine produced 8.3Mt ROM coal making it one of Australia’s most productive and lowest 
cost coal mines. The CY2015 result was followed in CY2016 by two monthly production records of 981kt in 
January and 1,057kt in April. Roadway development, which is important to maintain longwall mining continuity, 
increased to 22,098 metres from 19,800 metres in the previous year.
ROM coal production for FY2016 was 6.9Mt. The 11% reduction in FY2016 production relative to FY2015 was 
due to the completion of two full longwall change-outs during the year. This equates to approximately 12 weeks 
of lost production.
At the end of FY2016 mining had commenced in LW06, the final 300 metre wide panel. Mining in LW07, the first 
400 metre wide panel, is scheduled to commence in the second half of FY2017. Work on the longwall 
expansion has progressed well with the surface infrastructure and electrical upgrades being completed on 
schedule.
In December 2015 the NSW Department of Planning and Environment granted approval to increase Narrabri’s 
annual production limit from 8.0Mtpa to 11.0Mtpa ROM coal. This provides the necessary headroom to support 
an expected increase in production from the 400 metre wide panel.

Whitehaven’s three smaller open cuts – Tarrawonga, Rocglen and Werris Creek - performed strongly with ROM 
production of 5.8Mt and saleable production of 5.0Mt for the year. Sustainable cost reductions have been 
recorded at each of the mines, largely due to the implementation of more efficient mining practices and 
procurement driven cost savings.
Tarrawonga has successfully utilised improved mining techniques to reduce overburden removal costs. This has 
led to an improvement in its financial contribution to the Group and its record ROM production for the year.
Rocglen and the Gunnedah Coal Handling and Preparation Plant (“CHPP”) have both achieved two years free 
of injuries.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
VICKERY
Ownership: Whitehaven 100%
Vickery is a high quality metallurgical and thermal coal project with products that are expected to be sought after 
in the premium markets of Asia.  Approval is in place for a 4.5Mtpa mining operation at Vickery however 
Whitehaven is focussed on progressing an application for a larger scale 10Mtpa project. Several parties have 
expressed their desire to acquire an interest in the project.
Vickery has the potential to become Whitehaven’s third major mine in the Gunnedah Basin.  The timing of 
Vickery’s development is likely to follow the full ramp up of Maules Creek to its approved production level of 
13Mtpa ROM which is scheduled to occur for FY2019.
The Vickery open cut project was approved by the New South Wales Department of Planning and Infrastructure 
on September 19, 2014.  The approval is for an open cut project to produce 4.5Mtpa ROM coal, with the coal to 
be transported along an approved haulage route to the Gunnedah CHPP.
Since 2012, when Whitehaven lodged its application with the NSW Government for a 4.5Mtpa project, the 
Company has increased the total Resources and Reserves in the Vickery project area.  These larger Reserves 
support a higher annual production rate while maintaining a mine life of more than 20 years and  project 
economics improve significantly in the higher production case.
EXPLORATION PROJECTS
Whitehaven has several exploration and potential development projects in Queensland and New South Wales. 
These are early stage exploration projects.
In the current market environment the Company is focused on maintaining the tenements in good standing but 
continues to limit its spending on those projects.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Rail Track
Whitehaven contracts below rail capacity with the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC).
Whitehaven is working with ARTC to improve operating efficiencies and to provide additional capacity without 
the need to construct new rail infrastructure. The objective of this work is to improve supply chain productivity 
and to reduce the costs.
Rail Haulage
Whitehaven has two rail haulage contracts, one with Pacific National and one with Aurizon.  These contracts 
have a common expiry date in 2026.  The Pacific National contract provides for the haulage of up to 13Mtpa and 
the Aurizon contract provides for up to 16Mtpa.  The company is able to align planned increases in production 
with contract rail haulage capacity by giving notice to the rail providers of the need for additional capacity. The 
contract structures support the planned increases in Whitehaven’s managed production levels whilst minimising 
additional cost exposure.
Port Capacity
The company holds contracts for sufficient capacity at the port of Newcastle – either at NCIG or at PWCS – to 
support planned shipments in CY2017. Whitehaven will require additional port capacity for the forecast 
production ramp up over the next 5 years. Current surplus port capacity is expected to provide opportunity to 
secure Whitehaven’s requirements.

EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO REPORTING DATE
In the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report there has not arisen any item, 
transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors of the Company, to 
affect significantly the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the 
Group, in future financial years other than the following:
In July 2016, the Group repaid a further $35 million of debt drawn under the senior bank facility.
OUTLOOK AND LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS
OPERATIONS
In FY2016 Whitehaven’s Narrabri mine produced a record 7.3Mt of saleable coal to remain one of the most 
productive and lowest cost underground mines in Australia. Production in FY2017 is expected to increase. 
Mining is scheduled to transition to the first 400 metre wide panel around the start of the fourth quarter of 
FY2017.
Maules Creek will continue to ramp up its production level to an annualised rate of 10.5Mt ROM coal in the 
second half of FY2017 and is expected to produce 9.0Mt of saleable coal for the financial year. The smaller 
open cut mines will produce a similar amount of coal in FY2017 as in FY2016.
Management remains focused on improving productivity and lowering costs so as to remain in the lowest cost 
quartile.
DEMAND
Whitehaven’s high quality clean coals are attracting growing demand from new and existing customers. With the 
restricted availability of these coals in the seaborne market Whitehaven is well placed to increase the premium it 
receives for its coals and grow overall sales from both Maules Creek and Narrabri. It is positive to note that 
Whitehaven’s customers in Asia are adding more coal fired power station capacity and are seeking increased 
tonnages of coal from Whitehaven.
PRICING
After five years of declining prices coal markets appear to have found a bottom in the first quarter of CY2016. 
The Newcastle GlobalCoal Index coal price has increased from a low of about US$48/t in early January to be 
$68/t in mid-August. Metallurgical coal prices have also risen over the last year.
Whitehaven remains cautiously optimistic in the short term. However, in the medium to longer term, as demand 
for low priced reliable electricity continues to grow in the Asian region, Whitehaven is confident the coal prices 
will rise and that Whitehaven’s high quality coals will continue to attract a premium price in the market.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONT.)
RISKS RELATING TO WHITEHAVEN’S FUTURE PROSPECTS
Whitehaven operates in the coal sector. There are many factors, both specific to Whitehaven and to the coal 
industry in general, which may, either individually or in combination, affect the future operating and financial 
performance of the Group, its prospects and/or the value of Whitehaven. Many of the circumstances giving rise 
to these risks are beyond the control of the Whitehaven Directors and its management. The major risks believed 
to be associated with investment in Whitehaven are as follows:
MARKET RISKS
The Company’s future financial performance will be impacted by future coal prices and foreign exchange rates.
The factors which affect coal prices and demand include the outcome of future sales contract negotiations, 
general economic activity, industrial production levels, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in energy 
demand and demand for steel, changes in the supply of seaborne coal, changes in international freight rates or 
other transportation infrastructure and costs, the cost of other commodities and substitutes for coal, market 
changes in coal quality requirements and government regulation which restricts the use of coal, imposes 
taxation on the resources industry or otherwise affects the likely volume of sales or pricing of coal.
Sales made under export contracts are denominated in US dollars. The Company uses forward exchange 
contracts (FECs) to hedge some of its currency risk in line with its hedging policy.
OPERATING RISKS
The Company’s coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that could result in decreased coal 
production which could reduce its revenues. Operational difficulties may impact the amount of coal produced at 
its coal mines, delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. Such difficulties 
include (but are not limited to) weather (including flooding) and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance or 
technical problems, failure of key equipment, depletion of the Company’s Reserves, increased or unexpected 
reclamation costs and interruptions due to transportation delays.
GEOLOGY RISKS
Resource and Reserve estimates are stated to the JORC Code and are expressions of judgement based on 
knowledge, experience and industry practice. There are risks associated with such estimates, including that coal 
mined may be of a different quality, tonnage or strip ratio from those in the estimates.
DEVELOPMENT RISKS
There is a risk that circumstances (including unforeseen circumstances) may cause delays to project 
development, exploration milestones or other operating factors, resulting in the receipt of revenue at a date later 
than expected. Additionally, the construction of new projects/expansion by the Company may exceed the 
currently envisaged timeframe or cost for a variety of reasons outside of the control of the Company.

2016 REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)
Dear Shareholder
We present our Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 30 June 2016 (FY2016). The report is 
designed to explain to shareholders our remuneration arrangements as we strive to achieve our goal of 
becoming the premier independent listed coal producer in Australia.
The Board is committed to applying a fair and responsible executive remuneration framework, which operates 
effectively to appropriately incentivise and reward senior executives to execute our strategy while being aligned 
with shareholder interests. Our strategy has been to build a portfolio of assets that is in the best quartile of the 
coal cost curve and to develop and operate our assets in a safe and sustainable manner. The Board believes 
that the current framework has been effective and is proposing further enhancements as the Company grows.
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Paul Flynn, is supported by a strong executive leadership group 
and the Board believes that the Company is well positioned to continue to improve its performance and to 
deliver value for shareholders. At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, shareholders voted almost 96% in favour 
of our Remuneration Report.
Financial Year ended 30 June 2016 (FY2016)
The Remuneration Committee considered that the Executive Key Management Personnel (Executive KMP) 
have continued to successfully execute our strategy.  The Executive KMP have focused on key projects and 
initiatives including:
- 
-
-
- 
- 
-
Improving safety outcomes; 
ramping up coal production, coal processing and coal sales at Maules Creek (to achieve an annualised 
ROM production rate of 9.5mt);  
furthering engineering works and receiving all regulatory approvals necessary to deploy a wider 
longwall face at Narrabri; 
improving the sustainability of the Company by driving FY2016 costs lower to $56/t;  
improving  community engagement in the Gunnedah and Narrabri region; and 
reducing debt.
In FY2016, remuneration for Executive KMP was positioned between the 50th and 75th percentile of the market 
comparator group. Remuneration is benchmarked against an appropriate market comparator group consisting 
of Australian listed companies, which have been identified as relevant competitors for talent and operate in 
similar business environments. The Board considers company size, complexity and business challenges when it 
builds its comparator group. Our overarching objective is to motivate, attract and retain a leading management 
team while at the same time exercising appropriate restraint.
Short  Term  Incentive  (STI)  awards  to  Executive  KMP  for  their  performance  during  the  year  will  be  paid  in 
September 2016.   Executive KMP achieved between 72%  and 78% of the maximum possible award.  70% of 
each Executive KMP’s FY2016 STI award will be paid in September and 30% of each Executive KMP’s FY2016 
STI award will be deferred into equity which will vest in two tranches at the end of FY2017 and FY2018.
The  two  tranches  of  the  Long  Term  Incentive  (LTI)  that  were  tested  during  FY2016  each  lapsed  when  the 
Company’s Relative TSR performance failed to reach the required threshold vesting levels.

Whitehaven Coal Limited 
Directors’ Report
For the year ended 30 June 2016
The upcoming Financial Year (FY2017)
As the Company grows the Board continues to refine its remuneration arrangements. Changes proposed by the 
Board for FY2017 have been considered in the context of both our strategy and consideration of relevant 
benchmarks.
For FY2017 the total potential remuneration of our Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer will be 
increased, by increasing the STI potential to 100% of Total Fixed Remuneration (TFR). The uplift in STI will be 
delivered in deferred equity - the STI award will be 50% in cash and 50% in deferred equity.  This change will 
also align the CEO’s at-risk remuneration component with shareholder interests.
The introduction of a Costs Hurdle into our LTI structure in 2014 has been effective. Whitehaven is now in the 
lowest quartile for costs of production, and as a consequence, has returned to profitability in what are widely 
acknowledged as very difficult times for our industry. Tightly controlling costs of production is a key plank in our 
strategy. The Board has been considering whether relative TSR continues to be the most appropriate second 
hurdle. The Board continues to engage in stakeholder consultation on the selection of the second hurdle.  
Details of the final LTI structure and hurdles for FY2017 will be included in the Notice of Meeting for our 
upcoming AGM where the LTI grant for the CEO for FY2017 will be tabled for approval.
The Board has decided not to increase Non-executive Directors fees for FY2017, but will review them against 
the market in the coming year.
We thank our Executive KMP and their teams for their commitment and contribution to Whitehaven. We hope 
shareholders find the information provided in the Remuneration Report informative, and we welcome your 
feedback.
Yours sincerely,
The Hon. Mark Vaile AO 
Chairman

1.2   Summary of Company performance
Against a challenging environment of 7% lower AUD coal prices, Whitehaven has increased ROM production by 
30%, lowered costs by 8% and delivered a Net Profit after Tax of $20.5m.  The Company’s return to profit in 
FY2016 and the repayment of debt are the obvious indicators of strength of the performance of the Executive 
KMP and management.
There were many highlights in FY2016 including:
TRIFR of 10.6 improved by 6%
Net Profit After Tax of $20.5m
ROM Production of 20.5 Mt increased by 30%
Costs of Production $56/t decreased by 8%
Saleable Production of 19.7Mt increased by 35%
Cash generated from operations of $269m increased by 76%.
Coal Sales of 20.1Mt increased by 44%
EBITDA of $224m increased by 72%
As a consequence of the Group’s strong operational and financial outcomes, Whitehaven decreased net debt by 
$77m and leverage for the trailing twelve months has decreased to 3.8x EBITDA.

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE
This section describes the role of the Board, Remuneration Committee and external remuneration advisers when 
making  remuneration  decisions,  and  sets  out  an  overview  of  the  principles  and  policies  that  underpin  the 
Company’s remuneration framework.
2.1 Role of the Board and Remuneration Committee
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company’s remuneration structures are equitable and aligned with 
the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. Consistent with this responsibility, the  Board has 
established a Remuneration Committee, whose role is to:


review and approve the remuneration of the Executive KMP;
review and approve the remuneration policies and practices for the Group generally, including incentive plans 
and other benefits; and

review and make recommendations to the Board regarding the remuneration of Non-executive Directors.
The  Remuneration  Committee  comprises  three  Non-executive  Directors:  Christine  McLoughlin  (Committee 
Chairman), John Conde, and Mark Vaile. The Remuneration Committee has a formal charter, which sets out its 
roles  and  responsibilities,  composition  structure  and  membership  requirements.  A  copy  of  this  charter  can  be 
viewed on Whitehaven’s website.
Further information regarding the Remuneration Committee’s role, responsibilities and membership is set out in 
the Company’s Corporate Governance Statement.

2.2 Use of external remuneration advisors
From  time  to  time,  the  Remuneration  Committee  seeks  and  considers  advice  from  external  advisors  who  are 
engaged by and report directly to the Remuneration Committee. Such advice will typically cover Non-executive 
Director fees, Executive KMP remuneration and advice in relation to equity plans.
The  Corporations  Act  requires  companies  to  disclose  specific  details  regarding  the  use  of  remuneration 
consultants.  The mandatory disclosure requirements only apply to those advisers that provide a ‘remuneration 
recommendation’  as  defined  in  the  Corporations  Act.  The  Committee  did  not  receive  any  remuneration 
recommendations.
2.3 Executive KMP remuneration principles and framework
The Company’s Executive KMP remuneration policies are based on the following core principles:



to ensure the Company’s remuneration structures are equitable and aligned  with the long-term interests of 
the Company and its shareholders, having regard to relevant Company policies;
to attract and retain skilled executives;
to  structure  short  and  long  term  incentives  that  are  challenging  and  linked  to  the  creation  of  sustainable 
shareholder returns; and

to ensure any termination benefits are justified and appropriate.
These principles are reflected in the Company’s remuneration framework, which comprises both fixed and at-
risk remuneration components as indicated below.
Details of each of these components and how they applied during FY2016 are described in the table below and 
in section 3.

REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE KMP FOR FY2016
This section describes in greater detail the different components of Executive KMP remuneration for FY2016.
3.1  Mix and timing of Executive KMP remuneration
Executive KMP remuneration is delivered as a mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration.  At-risk remuneration can be 
earned through both STI and LTI and is delivered to Executive KMP over multiyear timeframes to create a layered 
retention effect and to encourage sustained performance.
The table below illustrates the remuneration mix for Executive KMP for FY2016 (assuming Target performance 
for at-risk components).

3.2 Benchmarking total remuneration
While  benchmarking  is  a  useful  starting  point,  it  is  only  one  input  used  by  the  Board  when  determining  total 
remuneration  for  Executive  KMP.    Remuneration  is  benchmarked  against  an  appropriate  market  comparator 
group adopted by the Board. The market comparator group consists of Australian listed companies, which have 
been identified as relevant competitors of Whitehaven that operate in similar business environments.  The Board 
considers company size, complexity and business challenges when it builds its comparator group. The objective 
of  the  Board’s  positioning  is  to meet  the  market so as  to attract  and retain  Executive KMP  while still  ensuring 
appropriate  restraint  in  respect  of  executive  remuneration.    Actual  market  positioning  for  each  individual  may 
deviate from the positioning policy (above or below) due to considerations such as internal relativities, experience, 
tenure in role, individual performance and retention considerations.

3.3 Fixed remuneration
Fixed remuneration received by  Executive KMP is subject to approval  by  the Remuneration Committee. Fixed 
remuneration  is  comprised  of  base  salary  and  superannuation.  In  line  with  Company  policy  and  executives’ 
service agreements, remuneration levels are reviewed annually based on market benchmarking and individual 
performance.
Fixed  remuneration  will  typically  be  positioned  between  the  50th  and  75th  percentile  of  the  market  comparator 
group adopted by the Board.
3.4 STI for FY2016
The following table details the terms of the STI that applied during FY2016.
Who participated?  All Executive KMP.
What was the 
performance 
period?
What was the 
target STI award?
What were the 
performance 
conditions, why 
were they chosen 
and how were 
they assessed?
The  STI  for  FY2016  operated  over  a  12  month  performance  period  from  1  July  2015  to  30  June 
2016.
Executive KMPs’ target STI was 50% of fixed remuneration over the 12 month performance period 
with up to 75% of fixed remuneration for stretch performance. The minimum possible total value of 
an STI grant is nil. The STI amount actually awarded to each Executive KMP in FY2016 is shown 
later in this section 3.7.
The following KPIs were adopted as performance conditions and applied to the FY2016 STI:
  Safety (TRIFR)

FOB cost per saleable tonne (equity basis)
  ROM production (managed basis)
  Net Profit After Tax (NPAT)

Leadership and individual key performance indicators as agreed between the Managing Director 
and Chief Executive Officer and the Board, for example project development targets.
These  performance  conditions  were  chosen  as  they  were  directly  linked  to  the  financial  and 
operational priorities of the Company.
At  the  commencement  of  FY2016,  the  Board  set  Target  KPIs,  the  achievement  of  which  was 
expected to be critical to the success of the Company as it continued to grow ROM coal production 
volumes closer to the Board target of 23Mtpa and as it commenced the debt repayment process at 
this time in the coal cycle.  The KPIs remain appropriate as they are aligned with  the interests of 
shareholders.  The Board designed these KPIs to ensure that the balance sheet of the Group was 
stronger at the end of the financial year even though difficult circumstances were anticipated.
The Group’s return to NPAT continues the story of delivering upon promises.  The Board was mindful 
that all Target KPIs had been met or exceeded, and resolved that the STI awards should therefore 
be approved as assessed.
The  Remuneration  Committee  and  the  Board  assessed  and  approved  the  STI  performance 
conditions applying to the  Managing Director’s STI award.  The performance conditions for  Other 
Executive KMP were assessed by the Managing Director and approved by the Board.

Additional detail on each KPI is set out below.
Safety
The emphasis on a safe working environment has continued to drive a sustained reduction in the TRIFR 
rate.  Against tough market conditions the Whitehaven view that “tonnes cannot come at the expense of 
safety” is embedded in the Company.  Our operations have performed very safely – our TRIFR of 10.6 is 
superior to the NSW coal industry average, and is a 6% improvement in TRIFR rate from our continuing 
operations when compared with FY2015.  The progress of the Company to improve safety processes and 
standards now positions the Company above the average for the NSW coal industry.
FOB cost per saleable tonne
The effort to lower operating costs continues.  Costs for FY2016 were driven substantially lower than the 
previous year and well below target.  The actual outcome for the FY2016 Costs target (equity basis) was 
$56/t FOB, which exceeded the stretch target.  This cost performance helped to increase EBITDA margins 
to $14/t in FY2016 from ~$13/t in FY2015 in the face of falling prices.
ROM production (managed)
In FY2016, first commercial production from Maules Creek was achieved.  Narrabri met its target and our 
Gunnedah open cut mines exceeded their respective production targets for the year.
NPAT
Cost control across overburden removal, coal mining, transportation, coal preparation, port, rail, sales and 
marketing  and  administration,  combined  with  record  production  and  sales  volumes  to  underpin  the 
Company’s return to profitability.  The reported NPAT of $20.5m approached the stretch target despite the 
very difficult coal price environment.
Individual Leadership KPIs
The  Managing  Director’s  KPIs  are  cascaded  into  the  Company  to  site  management  level.    Below  site 
management level a mix of specific site based and Company-wide targets are adopted as appropriate.  
The  STI  classification  weightings  that  apply  for  the  Managing  Director  are  broadly  consistent  when 
cascaded into the Company.

3.4 STI for FY2016 (cont.)
How is the 
STI 
delivered?
70% of the STI award will be paid to the Executive KMP in cash in September 2016.
The remaining 30% of the STI award will be deferred into rights to receive Whitehaven ordinary shares 
(Deferred  Equity),  which  will  vest  and  become  exercisable  subject  to  meeting  service  conditions.  In 
accordance with the service conditions, half of the Deferred Equity will vest and become exercisable at 
the  completion  of  FY2017,  while  the  other  half  will  vest  and  become  exercisable  at  the  completion  of 
FY2018.
There is no exercise price payable upon vesting or exercise of Deferred Equity. On exercise of Deferred 
Equity, each right entitles the recipient to one ordinary share in the Company.  Vested Deferred Equity 
that has not been exercised by 13 August 2025 (the expiry date) will automatically be exercised.
Deferred Equity will not vest if the Executive KMP resigns or is terminated for cause or the Board applies 
its discretion to clawback some or all of the Deferred Equity.  Dividends do not accrue on Deferred Equity.
Executive KMP are required to comply with the Company’s securities trading policy in respect of their 
Deferred Equity, which includes a prohibition on hedging or otherwise protecting the value of their 
unvested securities. In the event of a takeover or any proposed transaction that, in the Board’s opinion, 
is likely to result in a change of control, the Deferred Equity will vest and become exercisable.
3.5  LTI for FY2016
The following table describes the full terms of the FY2016 LTI grants to Executive KMP
Who participated?
All Executive KMP.
How much LTI was 
granted?
LTI is granted to Executive KMP in the form of performance rights, being rights to receive 
ordinary shares subject to meeting performance conditions and exercise by the Executive 
KMP.
There is no exercise price payable on vesting or exercise of the performance rights.  On 
exercise,  each  performance  right  entitles  the  recipient  to  one  ordinary  share  in  the 
Company.  Vested performance rights that have not been exercised by 13 August 2025 
(the  expiry  date)  will  automatically  be  exercised.    The  Managing  Director  was  granted 
performance rights with a face value equal to 100% of his TFR and the EGM Operations 
was granted performance rights with a face value equal to 90% of his TFR, Other KMP 
were granted performance rights with a face value equal to 80% of their TFR.  The number 
of  performance  rights  granted  was  determined  by  reference  to  the  volume  weighted 
average price of the Company’s shares over the 20 trading day period commencing 10 
trading days prior to 1 July 2015.  Shareholder approval was obtained at the 2015 Annual 
General Meeting for the FY2016 grant of performance rights to Mr Flynn.
What are the performance 
conditions?
The award was split into the following components:

TSR Rights: 60% of the award is subject to a relative TSR performance
hurdle, which compares the TSR performance of the Company with the TSR
performance of a peer group of companies operating in the Australian
resources sectors; and

Costs Target Rights: 40% of the award is subject to the Company
achieving a defined cost per tonne target Costs Hurdle – see below.

Whitehaven Coal Limited 
Directors’ Report
For the year ended 30 June 2016
Remuneration report (cont.)
3.5  LTI for FY2016 (cont.)
Why were these 
performance conditions 
chosen?
A relative TSR performance hurdle was chosen because:
1.
it allows for an objective external assessment of the shareholder value created 
by the Company relative to a comparator group of peers over a sustained 
period;
2.
it is familiar to shareholders.
The Costs Hurdle was chosen and set at a level which is aligned to the Company’s vision 
to  be  Australia’s  leading  independent  coal  producer  and  positioned  in  the  lowest  cost 
quartile of Australian coal producers.
Tight control of costs of production (i.e. in the  lowest cost quartile) is a key plank in our 
strategy.  For this reason we have a cost metric in both our short and long term incentive 
structures.  Lowest quartile costs protect and preserve shareholder value in difficult times 
and  support  enhanced  returns  when  the  commodity  cycle  recovers.    With  costs  in  the 
lowest quartile the Company has access to lower cost debt and larger liquidity pools, it is 
able to avoid dilutive and often expensive equity raisings, and its employees and suppliers 
have  confidence  in  the  Company’s  sustainability  and  ability  to  provide  opportunities  to 
grow.
What are the performance 
periods?
The  TSR  Rights  are  divided  into  two  equal  tranches  capable  of  vesting  and  becoming 
exercisable  after  a  three  and  four  year  performance  period  (respectively),  with  each 
performance period commencing on 1 July 2015.
The Costs Target Rights will be based on the FOB cost per saleable tonne achieved on a 
Company-wide basis for the year ending 30 June 2018.

3.5  LTI for FY2016 (cont.)
How will the performance 
condition be calculated for 
the TSR Rights?
The TSR of the Company for the FY2016 LTI grant is measured as a percentile ranking 
compared to the below comparator group of listed entities over the relevant performance 
period  for  the  tranche.    The  TSR  comparator  group  is  established  before  the 
commencement of the respective performance period.
BHP Billiton
Origin Energy
South32
Rio Tinto
Oil Search
Woodside Petroleum
Newcrest Mining
Caltex Australia
Santos
Fortescue Metals Group
Alumina
Iluka Resources
WorleyParsons
Sims Metal Management
Liquefied Natural Gas
BlueScope Steel
New Hope Corp
Sirius Resources
Whitehaven Coal
Beach Energy
Northern Star Resources
OZ Minerals
Evolution Mining
Independence Group
The level of vesting will be determined based on the ranking against the comparator group 
companies in accordance with the following schedule:




at the 75th percentile or above – 100% of the TSR Rights vest;
between the 50th and 75th  percentile –vesting will occur on a pro rata straight line 
basis;
at 50th percentile - 35% of the TSR Rights vest; and
below the 50th percentile - no TSR Rights vest.
Unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the TSR of a company for a 
performance period will be calculated adopting the following determination of the relevant 
opening and closing share prices:
the volume weighted average share price over the 20 trading day period commencing 
10 trading days before 1 July 2015 (opening share price); and
the  volume  weighted  average  share  price  over  the  corresponding  20  trading  day 
period at the conclusion of the performance period ending 30 June 2018 and 30 June 
2019, as applicable (closing share price).

How will the performance 
condition be calculated for 
the Costs Target Rights?
Re-testing
Do the performance rights 
attract dividend and voting 
rights?
The  Remuneration  Committee  has  set  the  LTI  Costs  Hurdle  having  regard  to  the 
Company’s  budgeted  cost  forecasts  and  to  the  current  coal  industry  cost  curve  as 
measured  by  a  recognised  expert.    The  Board  is  satisfied  that  the  LTI  Costs  Hurdle  is 
challenging and that achievement of the performance condition will place the Company in 
the lowest cost quartile of the current coal industry cost curve.
Testing  will  occur  at  the  end  of  FY2018  based  on  the  average  costs  achieved  on  a 
Company-wide  basis  over  the  12  month period  from  1 July  2017  to  30 June  2018. Full 
vesting  will  only  occur  if  the  Board  is  satisfied  that  performance  meets  or  exceeds  the 
Maximum as set out below. The Board may, where it is appropriate to do so, revise the 
targets  below  to  take  account  of  mergers,  acquisitions  and  divestments  or  other 
exceptional circumstances.
Vesting will occur based on the following schedule:
  Maximum or above – 100% of Costs Target Rights vest;
  Between Gateway and Maximum – 35% of the Costs Target Rights vest at Gateway 
performance  and  thereafter  additional  vesting  will  occur  on  a  pro  rata  straight  line 
basis up to stretch performance;
  Gateway - 35% of Costs Target Rights vest; and
  Below Gateway – no Costs Target Rights vest.
Due to the commercially sensitive nature of this hurdle, the exact target will not be 
disclosed until the year of testing.  However, retrospective disclosure of the outcomes 
against the target will be provided in the Remuneration Report for the year of testing.
To the extent that the Costs Hurdle is satisfied at the end of FY2018:


50% of the Costs Target Rights that vest will immediately become exercisable; and
The  remaining  50%  will  be  subject  to  a  further  one  year  service  condition  prior  to 
vesting and becoming exercisable.
Notwithstanding the vesting schedule above, the Board retains discretion to lapse any or 
all Costs Target Rights if the Board considers that vesting would be inappropriate in light 
of the intent and purpose of the target.
All performance rights that do not vest following testing will lapse immediately.  There is 
no re-testing of awards that do not vest.
Performance rights do not carry voting or dividend rights.
Shares allocated on exercise of performance rights rank equally with other ordinary shares 
on  issue,  including  in  relation to  dividend  and  voting  rights. Participants  are  required to 
comply with the Company’s securities trading policy in respect of their performance rights 
and any shares they receive upon exercise. They are prohibited from hedging or otherwise 
protecting the value of their performance rights.

3.5   LTI for 2016 (cont.)
What happens in the 
event of a change in 
control?
In the event of a takeover bid or other transaction, event or state of affairs that in the Board’s 
opinion is likely to result in a change in control of the Company, the Board has a discretion 
to  determine  that  vesting  of  some  or  all  of  any  unvested  performance  rights  should  be 
accelerated.
What happens if an 
executive ceases 
employment during the 
performance period?
In  general,  unless  the  Board  determines  otherwise,  where  an  executive’s  employment  is 
terminated:
for cause: all unvested performance rights will lapse
due to resignation or by mutual agreement with the Company: unvested performance 
rights will remain on foot and subject to the original performance hurdle. However, the 
Board may at its discretion determine to lapse any or all of the unvested performance 
rights and ordinarily, in the case of a resignation, would be expected to do so
for any other reason: unvested performance rights will remain on foot and subject to the 
original  performance  hurdle,  with  Board  discretion  to  determine  that  some  of  the 
performance rights (up to a pro rata portion based on how much of the performance 
period remains) will lapse. The performance rights that remain on foot will be tested in 
the normal course following the end of the relevant performance period

* To the extent that the Costs Hurdle is satisfied at the end of FY2018, 50% of the rights will vest and become exercisable immediately and the
remaining 50% will continue on foot, subject to a further one year service condition.
** The fair value for rights granted to the Executive KMP is based on the fair value at the grant date, measured using a Monte Carlo simulation
model. The factors and assumptions used in determining the fair value are set out in note 5.5 to the financial statements.
*** Service STI is the Deferred Equity component of FY2015 STI and is subject to service conditions of one and two years, respectively. There
is no exercise price payable on vesting or exercise of Deferred Equity. On exercise of Deferred Equity, each right entitles the recipient to one
ordinary share in the Company.  Vested Deferred Equity that has not been exercised by 13 August 2025 (the expiry date) will automatically
be exercised.
**** Contingent STI relates to STI amounts in FY2015 for above Target EBITDA performance and above Target Maules Creek performance that
were subject to further performance conditions. In August 2016 the Board confirmed that both elements had been achieved and therefore in
August 2016 the  Contingent STI vested and became exercisable.   On exercise of  Contingent STI,  each right entitles the recipient to one
ordinary share in the Company.  Vested Deferred Equity that has not been exercised by 13 August 2025 (the expiry date) will automatically
be exercised.

1   Fixed remuneration comprises base salary and superannuation. 
2   STI represents the total amount of STI that each Executive KMP is able to earn based on FY2016 performance including the 30% 
portion that is awarded as Deferred Equity, where vesting of rights is subject to meeting further service based conditions. Refer to 
section 3.4 for further details.
3   No LTI vested during FY2016. See section 3.5 for details of LTI. 
4   There were no cessation payments during FY2016. 
5   Other includes parking, motor vehicle benefits and other similar items. 
6   Deferred Equity STI refers to the amount of STI deferred into rights that are the subject to further service based conditions refer Section
3.4 for further details.
7   Contingent STI refers to STI amounts in FY2015 for above Target EBITDA performance and above Target Maules Creek performance 
that were subject to further performance conditions.  The first component (60%) would not vest unless the Company returned to profit 
prior to 30 June 2017 while the second component (40%) would only fully vest if the unexpended contingency for the Maules Creek 
Project exceeded a stretch target of $37m.  In August 2016 the Board declared that each of these contingent conditions had been met.  
The details of these contingent awards were fully disclosed in the Company’s Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 June 2015.

EXECUTIVE KMP EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS
The following section sets out an overview of key terms of employment for the  Executive KMP, as provided in 
their service agreements.
All Executive KMP contracts give the Company discretion to make payment in lieu of notice. No notice is 
required where termination is for cause. The contracts do not provide for any termination payments other than 
payment in lieu of notice.
Treatment of unvested incentives is dealt with in accordance with the terms of grant. In general, under the STI 
and LTI arrangements, unvested entitlements will be forfeited where an executive is terminated for cause or, 
subject to the Board’s discretion, where they resign. In all other circumstances where the Board considers the 
executive to be a ‘good leaver’, outgoing executives will generally retain their entitlements (subject to any 
applicable performance conditions in the case of LTI arrangements).
Managing Director
Paul Flynn was appointed as Managing Director and CEO of the Company on 27 March 2013. This table outlines 
the key terms of Mr Flynn’s contract of employment.
Fixed remuneration
Mr Flynn’s annual TFR for FY2017 is $1,352,520 (FY2016: $1,326,000) which includes salary, 
superannuation  contributions,  and  any  components  under  Whitehaven’s  salary  packaging 
guidelines and all Director fees. TFR is reviewed annually.
Short term incentive
Mr Flynn is eligible to participate in the annual STI plan, as described in section 3.4. At Target 
performance, his FY2017 STI opportunity is 100% of TFR (FY2016: 50%), with up to 125% of 
TFR for Stretch performance (FY2016:75%).
Long term incentive
Mr  Flynn  is  eligible  to  participate  in  the  LTI  plan  as  described  in  section  3.5,  and  subject  to 
receiving required or appropriate shareholder approval.  Mr Flynn’s LTI grant will be  100% of 
his TFR for FY2017 (FY2016: 100%).

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES AND FEE POOL
This section explains the fees for Non-executive Directors.
6.1  Setting Non-executive Director fees
Non-executive Directors fees are designed to ensure that the Company can attract and retain suitably qualified 
and experienced Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors do not receive shares, share options or any performance-related incentives as part of 
their  fees  from  the  Company.  However,  although  there  is  no  formal  minimum  shareholding,  Non-executive 
Directors are strongly encouraged to hold shares.
Non-executive  Directors  are  also  entitled  to  be  reimbursed  for  travel  and  other  expenses  reasonably  incurred 
when attending meetings of the Board or in connection with the business of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to Non-executive 
Directors’ fees and Committee fees.
In  2012  the  shareholders  approved  a  total  aggregate  maximum  amount  of  Non-executive  Directors’  fees  of 
$2,500,000 per annum.
6.2  Current Non-executive Director fee levels and fee pool
The  table  below  sets  out  the  Board  and  Committee fees  in  Australian  dollars  as  at  30  June  2016.  The  Board 
determined  that  there  would  be  no  fee  increases  for  Non-executive  Directors  for  FY2017.  Director  fees  have 
remained unchanged since 2012.

7.3  Movement in equity instruments held by Executive KMP (cont.)
(A)  The number of rights granted during FY2016 includes the Deferred Equity component of the FY2015 STI award and the 
FY2015 Contingent STI award, calculated by reference to the volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares 
for the 20 day trading period commencing 10 trading days prior to 1 July 2015. The grant date of the rights was 8 April 
2016.  Further details are provided in section 3.4.
(B)  The value of LTI performance rights granted in the year is the fair value of the performance rights at grant date using the
Monte Carlo simulation model.  
The value of deferred STI rights granted in the year has been calculated using the volume weighted average price of the 
Company’s shares for the 20 day trading period commencing 10 trading days prior to 1 July 2015.  
Unvested LTI performance rights and unvested STI rights have a minimum value of zero if they do not meet the relevant 
performance or service conditions.  
The maximum value of unvested LTI performance rights, unvested deferred STI rights and unvested STI deferred 
shares is the sale price of the Company’s shares at the date of vesting, or where applicable, exercise.
(C)  No LTI awards vested or were exercised during the period.
Tranche 2 of the FY2013 STI deferred shares vested during the period.  The vested value has been calculated using 
the volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares for the 20 day trading period commencing 10 trading days 
prior to the effective grant date of 27 August 2013.  
Tranche 1 of the FY2014 STI deferred shares vested during the period. The vested value has been calculated using the 
volume weighted average price of the Company’s shares for the 20 day trading period commencing 10 trading days 
prior to the effective grant date of 27 August 2014.
(D)  The year in which the lapsed performance rights, rights or deferred shares were granted.

1 The Group has made the decision to reclassify cash flows relating to Narrabri deferred development expenditure as ‘Cash paid to 
suppliers and employees’. The comparative period has been restated to reflect this change. ‘Purchase of property, plant and equipment’ for 
the year ended 30 June 2015 as previously reported was $430.6m. This has been reduced by $59.7m to align with the current year’s 
presentation. Correspondingly, ‘Cash paid to suppliers and employees’ for the year ended 30 June 2015 has been increased by $59.7m. 
The change has been made to improve clarity of financial information. Narrabri deferred development expenditure  includes the costs of 
developing future longwall gateroads, longwall move costs and gas drainage costs associated with future longwall panels. These costs are 
incurred and spent, deferred and the associated amortisation charge is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income when the longwall panel is mined.

Summary of other significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below, and in the notes, have been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries in the  Group. 
Other significant accounting policies are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to which 
they relate.
(i)
Basis of consolidation
The  consolidated  financial  report  of  the  Company  for  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2016  comprises  the 
Company and its subsidiaries and the Group’s interest in jointly controlled operations (together referred to as the 
‘Group’).
(ii)
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional  currency by applying the exchange rates 
ruling  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are 
retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Both the functional and presentation currency of the Company and of all entities in the Group is Australian dollars 
($).
(iii)
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
The notes to these consolidated financial statements have been organised into logical groupings to present more 
meaningful and dynamic information to users. To the extent possible the relevant accounting policies and numbers 
have been provided in the same note. The Group has also reviewed the notes for materiality and relevance and 
provided  additional  information  where  considered  material  and  relevant  to  the  operations,  financial  position  and

Group performance
2.1  Segment reporting
Accounting policy:
The  Group  identifies  its  operating  segments  based  on  the  internal  reports  that  are  reviewed  and  used  by  the  executive 
management team in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The performance of operating 
segments is evaluated at least monthly based on revenues and profit before taxes and is measured in accordance with the 
Group’s accounting policies.
a)  Identification of reportable segments
The Group has determined that it has two reportable segments: Open Cut Operations and Underground Operations.  
 
Unallocated operations includes coal trading, corporate, marketing and infrastructure functions which are managed on a 
group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments. 
 
The Group’s financing (including finance costs and finance income), depreciation and income taxes are managed on a group 
basis and are not allocated to reportable segments. 
 
The following table represents revenue and profit information for reportable segments:

Accounting policy:
Revenue from the sale of coal is recognised and measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable to 
the extent that:
i) 
ii) 
iii)
it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured;  
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer; and 
transfer of risk and rewards are considered to have passed to the buyer under the terms of the individual 
contracts.
Revenue from the sale of Maules Creek development coal in the previous year was offset against development costs 
capitalised on the consolidated statement of financial position until production reached commercial levels on 1 July 
2015.

1 During the prior year, the Group incurred redundancy costs of $0.6m as a result of a restructure of its workforce.
2 During the prior year, an impairment charge of $355m was taken in respect of early stage exploration assets. The impairment charge 
reflected the recently changed coal market environment and prospects for early stage exploration assets and particularly assets higher in 
ash and lower in energy. This included assets that would have been targeted towards customers in China.
3 De-recognition of MRRT related deferred tax balances in the prior year as a result of the enactment of legislation repealing the MRRT. This 
included the MRRT goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Aston $53.2m (allocated to the open-cut segment), Boardwalk ($29.9m) and 
Coalworks ($7.6m) that were not allocated during the year ended 30 June 2012 as a result of the recognition of deferred taxes on the 
implementation of the MRRT legislation. This MRRT goodwill, being an intangible asset was created upon the introduction of the MRRT. The 
carrying value of the MRRT goodwill was reviewed in the prior year following the enactment of legislation repealing the MRRT, and as a 
result was fully reversed, together with the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities initially recognised on introduction of the MRRT 
legislation.
4 The Company was advised in July 2014 that a domestic customer had been placed into voluntary administration. A provision was 
established to cover balances owed which were not expected to be recovered. This outstanding debt was written off in the current financial 
year.
5 During the prior year the company received a tax refund of $42.3m following conclusion of an outstanding tax matter resulting in a tax 
benefit being recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. As a result of the tax refund the company was required to 
pay franking deficit tax of $42.3m to rebalance its franking account, resulting in recognition of an income tax expense in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. This amount was paid on 31 July 2015 and will remain as a credit available to the company to offset 
future tax liabilities.

2.3
Taxes
Accounting policy:
Income tax
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax relating to items 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit or loss. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered or paid to the taxation 
authorities based on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised. The tax rate and laws used to determine the amounts 
are based on those enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date
Deferred tax expense is the movement in the temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or 
liability in the consolidated statement of financial position and its tax base. Deferred tax is not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of 
assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither accounting profit nor the taxable profit.
Deferred income tax assets, including unused tax losses, are recognised in relation to deductible temporary 
differences and carried forward income tax losses only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which these deductible temporary differences and carried forward income tax losses can 
be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the 
deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities, and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on 
the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a 
net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. 
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the 
liability to pay the related dividend.
Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT)
On 19 March 2012, the Australian Government passed through the Senate the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 
2012, with application to certain profits arising from the extraction of iron ore and coal in Australia. On 5 
September 2014 the MRRT Repeal and Other Measures Bill 2014 received Royal Assent. Following the 
enactment of this legislation the MRRT balances were derecognised (see Note 2.2).
Tax consolidation
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident controlled entities formed a tax-consolidated group with 
effect from 29 May 2007 and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. The head entity within the tax-
consolidated group is Whitehaven Coal Limited.
The Company and its wholly-owned Australian resident controlled entities continue to account for their own 
current and deferred tax amounts. The Group has applied the Group allocation approach in determining the 
appropriate amount of current taxes and deferred taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.
Any current tax liabilities (or assets) and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the subsidiaries is 
assumed by the head entity in the tax-consolidated group and are recognised as amounts payable (receivable) to 
(from) other entities in the tax-consolidated group in conjunction with any tax funding arrangement amounts (refer 
to next page).

2.3
Taxes (cont.)
Nature of tax funding arrangements and tax sharing arrangements
The head entity, in conjunction with other members of the tax consolidated group, has entered into a tax funding 
arrangement which sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax consolidated group in respect of tax 
amounts. The tax funding arrangements require payments to/from the head entity equal to the current tax liability 
(asset) assumed by the head entity and any tax-loss deferred tax asset assumed by the head entity, resulting in the 
head entity recognising an inter-entity receivable (payable) equal in amount to the tax liability (asset) assumed. The 
inter-entity receivable (payable) is at call. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of 
this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.
Goods and Services Tax
Revenues, expenses and assets (excluding receivables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax 
(GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these 
circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or 
payable to, the ATO is included as a current asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash flows are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows on a gross basis and the GST components of 
cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are 
classified as operating cash flows.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from unrecouped tax losses, capital losses and temporary differences, 
are recognised only where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the 
generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management's estimates of future cash flows. 
These depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes, operating costs, rehabilitation costs, capital 
expenditure, dividends and other capital management transactions. Judgements are also required about the 
application of income tax legislation. These judgements and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence 
there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position and the amount 
of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised which may require adjustment, resulting in a 
corresponding credit or charge to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

3.1  Trade and other receivables
Accounting policy:
Trade  receivables,  which  generally  have  between  5  and  21  day  terms,  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and 
subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method,  less  any  allowance  for  impairment. 
Recoverability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Inventories
Accounting policy:
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of coal inventories is determined using a weighted average basis. Cost includes direct material, overburden 
removal, mining, processing, labour, mine rehabilitation costs incurred in the extraction process and other fixed and 
variable  overhead costs  directly  related  to mining  activities. Stockpiles  are measured  by  estimating  the  number  of 
tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained coal is based on assay data, and the estimated 
recovery  percentage  is  based  on  the  expected  processing  method.  Stockpile  tonnages  are  verified  by  periodic 
surveys.
Coal stocks 1

Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost when 
goods and services are received, whether or not billed to the Group, prior to the end of the reporting period. Due to 
their short-term nature they are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of 
recognition.

Accounting policy:
Recognition and measurement
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.
Cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  mining  property  and  development  assets  include  initial  cost  to  acquire, 
construct, install or complete production and infrastructure facilities, such as cost of materials, direct labour, capitalised 
borrowing costs and transferred exploration and evaluation assets. Costs of dismantling and site rehabilitation are also 
capitalised, if the recognition criteria is met.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the  Group and its cost can be 
measured  reliably.  The  costs  of  the  day-to-day  servicing  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  recognised  in  the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

Resource assets and liabilities (cont.)
4.1  Property, plant and equipment (cont.)
Mining property and development
When commercially recoverable reserves are determined and such proposed development receives the appropriate 
approvals, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is transferred to mining property and development. All 
subsequent development expenditure is similarly capitalised, to the extent that commercial viability conditions continue 
to be satisfied.
Deferred development
Deferred development mainly comprises capitalised costs (deferred development expenditure) related to underground 
mining incurred to expand the capacity of a mine and to maintain production.
Deferred stripping
Expenditure  incurred  to  remove  overburden  or  waste material  during  the  production  phase  of  a mining  operation is 
deferred to the extent it gives rise to future economic benefits and charged to operating costs on a units of production 
basis using the estimated average stripping ratio for the area being mined. Changes in estimates of average stripping 
ratios are accounted for prospectively. The stripping activity asset is subsequently depreciated on a units of production 
basis over the life of the identified component of the ore body that became more accessible as a result of the stripping 
activity.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, deferred stripping costs are grouped with other assets of the relevant cash 
generating unit.
Depreciation
Depreciation and amortisation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight line 
basis at the rates indicated below. Depreciation  commences on assets when it is deemed they are capable of operating 
in the manner intended by management:
freehold land 
plant and equipment 
leased plant and equipment
 
 
 
  mining property and development, deferred development          units of production
not depreciated 
2% – 50% 
3% – 14%
and deferred stripping
The residual value, the useful life and the depreciation method applied to an asset are reassessed at least annually.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other inventories and deferred taxes, are reviewed at each 
balance  date  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the  asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, 
recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates 
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets 
(the ‘cash-generating unit’). The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in 
use  and  its  fair  value  less  costs  of  disposal  (‘FVLCD’).  In  assessing  FVLCD,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable  amount.  Impairment  losses  recognised  in  respect  of  cash-generating  units  are  allocated  to  reduce  the 
carrying amount of the assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.

Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Recoverable amount of assets
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units and individual assets have been determined based on the higher of 
value-in-use calculations and FVLCD. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions.
Expected  future  cash  flows  used  to  determine  the  FVLCD  of  tangible  assets  are  inherently  uncertain  and  could 
materially change over time. They are significantly affected by a number of factors including reserves and production 
estimates,  together  with  economic  factors  such  as  spot  and  future  coal  prices,  discount  rates,  foreign  currency 
exchange rates, estimates of costs to produce reserves, stripping ratio, production rates and future capital expenditure. 
It is reasonably possible that these assumptions may change which may then impact the estimated life of mine which 
could result in a material adjustment to the carrying value of tangible assets.
The determination of FVLCD for a CGU is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement, as they are derived from 
valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data. The Group considers the inputs 
and the valuation approach to be consistent with the approach taken by market participants.
The recoverable amount has been determined by the FVLCD method, determined based on the net present value of 
the future estimated cash flows. These cash flows are discounted using a real pre-tax discount rate of 11%. The coal 
prices and foreign exchange rates applied for the first three years of the cash flow estimates are based on detailed 
financial budgets approved by senior management which includes consideration of external sources. Long term 
estimates are based on a consideration of third party forecasts and management estimates in respect of long term 
incentive coal prices in the seaborne export coal market.
Costs to dispose are estimated based on the current market rate applied by advisors in respect of the disposal of 
mining assets.
Mineral reserves and resources
The  estimated  quantities  of  economically  recoverable  Reserves  and  Resources  are  based  upon  interpretations  of 
geological and geophysical models and require assumptions to be made requiring factors such as estimates of future 
operating  performance,  future  capital  requirements  and  short  and  long  term  coal  prices.  The  Group  is  required  to 
determine and report Reserves and Resources under the Australian Code for Reporting Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves December 2012 (the JORC Code). The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable investment assumptions 
to calculate reserves and resources. Changes in reported Reserves and Resources can impact the carrying value of 
property,  plant  and  equipment,  provision  for  rehabilitation  as  well  as  the  amount  charged  for  amortisation  and 
depreciation.

’Deferred development’ and ‘Deferred stripping’ were previously included in the ‘Mining, property and development’ asset class. These have now been reclassified into their own category in order to 
improve clarity of financial information. The depreciation expense for deferred development and deferred stripping assets is included in the ‘Operating expenses’ line in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. Spend on these assets incurred throughout the financial year is included in ‘Cashflows from operating activities’ in the Consolidated statement of cashflows.

4.1
Resource assets and liabilities (cont.)
Property, plant and equipment (cont.)
Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement 
and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset 
and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Group as lessee
Finance Leases
Finance  leases,  which  transfer  to  the  Group  substantially  all  the  risks  and  benefits  incidental  to ownership of  the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased 
asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Refer to Note 5.1.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised as an expense 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising 
the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease 
term.
Operating Leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease incentives are recognised as a liability when received 
and  subsequently  reduced  by  allocating  lease  payments  between  rental  expense  and  a  reduction  of  the  liability. 
Refer to Note 7.3.
The Group leases mining equipment under a number of finance lease agreements. At 30 June 2016, the Group’s net 
carrying  amount  of  leased  plant  and  machinery  was  $83,760,000  (2015:  $94,461,000).The  leased  equipment  is 
pledged  as security  for  the  related  finance lease  liabilities. During  the  prior  year  the  Group  entered into  sale  and 
leaseback transactions resulting in the reclassification of items of equipment between property, plant and equipment 
and leased plant and equipment.
4.2
Exploration and evaluation
Accounting policy:
Exploration and evaluation assets, including the costs of acquiring licences, are capitalised on an area of interest 
basis and only after the Company has obtained the legal rights to explore the area.
Exploration and evaluation assets are only recognised if the rights of the area of interest are current and either:
i)
the expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area of 
interest; or
ii)  activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date, reached a stage which permits a reasonable 
assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant 
operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest are continuing.
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if:
i)  sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability, and  
ii)  facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. For the purposes
of impairment testing, exploration and evaluation assets are not allocated to cash-generating units.
Where a potential impairment is indicated, an assessment is performed for each area of interest or at the CGU 
level, in line with the assessment disclosed at note 4.1. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected 
to be recovered it is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Once the technical feasibility 
and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are demonstrable, exploration 
and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified from 
intangible assets to mining property and development assets within property, plant and equipment.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in 
determining whether future economic benefits are likely, which may be based on assumptions about future events 
or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information becomes available. If, after 
expenditure is capitalised, information becomes available indicating that the recovery of expenditure is unlikely, the 
amount capitalised is written off in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period when the 
new information becomes available.

Impairment1
Exploration and evaluation assets include tenements granted by the Queensland State Government which are subject to 
periodic relinquishment requirements of up to 20% per year.
1During the prior year, an impairment charge of $355m was taken in respect of early stage exploration assets, which is not allocated to 
a segment. The impairment charge reflected the change in coal market environment and prospects for early stage exploration assets. 
Exploration and evaluation assets are carried at their fair value less impairment.
4.3
Intangible assets
Accounting policy:
Water access rights
The Group holds water access rights, which have been determined to have an indefinite life. The water access 
rights have been recognised at cost and are assessed annually for impairment. The carrying amounts of water 
access rights are reviewed at each balance date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. When 
reviewing for indicators of impairment, the Group considers mining plans, project approvals and market values, 
among other factors, in line with those disclosed at note 4.1.
Rail access rights
Rail access rights have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less, where applicable, any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Rail access rights are amortised over the life of the mine or 
access agreement.

Resource assets and liabilities (cont.)
4.4  Provisions
Accounting policy:
A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that resources will be expended to settle the 
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Mine rehabilitation and closure
Provisions are made for the estimated cost of rehabilitation relating to areas disturbed during the mine’s operation up 
to reporting date but not yet rehabilitated. Provision has been made in full for all disturbed areas at the reporting date 
based on current estimates of costs to rehabilitate such areas, discounted to their present value based on expected 
future cashflows. The estimated cost of rehabilitation includes the current cost of re-contouring, topsoiling and 
revegetation based on legislative requirements. Changes in estimates are dealt with on a prospective basis as they 
arise.
The amount of the provision relating to rehabilitation of mine infrastructure and dismantling obligations is recognised at 
the commencement of the mining project and/or construction of the assets where a legal or constructive obligation 
exists at that time. The provision is recognised as a liability with a corresponding asset included in mining property and 
development assets.
At each reporting date the rehabilitation liability is re-measured in line with changes in discount rates, and timing or 
amount of the costs to be incurred. Changes in the liability relating to rehabilitation of mine infrastructure and 
dismantling obligations are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than the unwinding of the discount 
which is recognised as a finance expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as it occurs.
For closed mines, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
The amount of the provision relating to rehabilitation of environmental disturbance caused by on-going production and 
extraction activities is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in determining the provision for mine rehabilitation as there are 
numerous factors that will affect the ultimate liability payable. These factors include estimates of the extent and costs 
of rehabilitation activities, technological changes, regulatory changes, cost increases, and changes in discount rates. 
Those uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided. The 
provisions at balance date represent management’s best estimate of the present value of the future rehabilitation costs 
required.

Increases in the provision for rehabilitation were made during the year as a result of additional disturbance at several 
mines and a reassessment of the areas of disturbance and rehabilitation rates. Rehabilitation expenditure is expected 
to occur over the life of the mining operations which ranges from 4 to 42 years. Refer above for details on the nature of 
the obligation.
Other provisions include amounts recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries as part of the purchase price allocation and 
amounts for costs expected to be incurred for maintaining Sunnyside mine in care and maintenance.

Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Accounting policy:
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable 
transaction  costs.  After  initial  recognition,  interest-bearing  loans  and  borrowings  are  subsequently  measured  at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
This note provides information about the contractual terms of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings.

Financing facilities
On 26 March 2015 the Company entered into a $1.4 billion senior secured bank facility. The facility has a maturity date 
of July 2019 and provides Whitehaven with lines of credit up to A$1.4 billion comprising of A$1.2 billion revolving and 
term facility, and $0.2 billion guarantee facilities. This facility was used to replace the Company’s previous $1.2 billion 
facility. As a result, in the prior year the Company wrote off $23.1 million of finance upfront costs relating to the $1.2 
billion facility.
During the current year $65 million of debt drawn under the senior bank facility was repaid (2015: An amount of $225 
million was drawn down under the old facility. A further $900 million was drawn down under the new facility, of which 
$850 million was used to repay debt drawn on the old facility). An amount of $9.5 million was drawn down under other 
loans (2015: $nil) and $8.6 million of other loans were repaid during the year (2015: $8.3 million). The security provided 
in relation to the facilities is a fixed and floating charge over substantially all of the assets of the Group.
During the year the Company entered into an additional $65 million of secured bilateral bank guarantee facilities.
Finance lease facility
At 30 June 2016, the Group’s lease liabilities are secured by the leased assets of $83,760,000 (2015: $94,461,000), as 
in the event of default, the leased assets revert to the lessor.

Finance income and expense
Accounting policy:
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign currency gains. Interest income is 
recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, foreign 
currency losses in relation to finance leases, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss, impairment losses recognised on financial assets, and losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, 
except where capitalised as part of a qualifying asset.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
Accounting policy:
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate 
fluctuations arising from operating activities. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on 
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value.
Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are hedges of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated 
with forecast sales and purchases that could affect profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the 
extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred out of equity and included in the measurement of the  hedged transaction 
(coal sales and asset purchases) when the forecast transaction occurs.
Each designated cash flow hedge is tested for hedge effectiveness at each balance date, both retrospectively and 
prospectively, by using the dollar offset method. If the testing falls within the 80:125 range, the hedge is considered 
to be highly effective and continues to be designated as a cash flow hedge.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if it no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
Economic hedges
Derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment of financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective  evidence that it is 
impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss for financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying 
amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets 
are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised 
in profit or loss.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss was recognised.
a)
Overview
The Group’s overall risk management program seeks to mitigate risks and reduce the volatility of the Group’s  
financial performance. Financial risk management is carried out centrally by the Group’s Audit and Risk 
Management Committee under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Committee reports regularly to the 
Board on its activities and also reviews policies and systems regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and 
Group’s activities.
The Group’s principal financial risks are associated with:
  market risk  
 

credit risk 
liquidity risk

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business. The Group defines capital as total shareholders’ equity and 
debt. The Board manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions 
and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust 
the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors 
capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Group’s gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity plus net debt.

Market Risk - Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and demurrage that are denominated in a currency 
other than the respective functional currency of the Group, the Australian dollar (AUD).The currency in which these 
transactions primarily are denominated is US Dollars (USD).
The Group uses forward exchange contracts (FECs) to hedge its currency risk from 100% of contracted sales 
where both volume and US dollar price are fixed to 50% of planned sales from existing operations for a period of 
12 to 24 months. No cover is taken out beyond 24 months other than contracted sales where both volume and US 
dollar prices are fixed.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net 
exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to 
address short-term imbalances.
During the current year ended 30 June 2016, a net foreign exchange gain of $1.3m was recognised (2015: net 
foreign exchange loss of $2.8m).
The Group designates its forward exchange contracts in cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 June 2016 was $0.3m (2015: $0.1m), 
comprising assets and liabilities that were recognised as derivatives.
At 30 June 2016, the Group had the following financial instruments that were not designated in cash flow hedges

Market Risk - Commodity price risk
The Group’s major commodity price exposure is to the price of coal. The Group has chosen not to hedge against the 
movement in coal prices.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables, available for sale financial assets, derivative financial instruments and the granting of financial 
guarantees. The Group‘s exposure to credit risk arises from potential default of the counter party, with a maximum 
exposure equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets, as outlined below.

Trade receivables
The  Group‘s  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  influenced  mainly  by  the  individual  characteristics  of  each  customer.  The 
demographics of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers 
operate, has less of an influence on credit risk. Approximately 34.4% of the Group’s revenue is attributable to sales 
transactions with three customers (2015: 36.1% with three customers).
More than 60% (2015: 88%) of the Group’s current customers have been transacting with the Group for over five 
years, and losses have occurred infrequently.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and generally does not require collateral in respect 
of trade receivables.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and as a result the exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The  Group  recognised  an  impairment  loss  for  trade  receivables  of  $nil  during  the  year  ended  30  June  2016 
(2015:$1,305,000).

Risk exposures and responses (cont.)
The Company was advised in July 2014 that a domestic customer had been placed into voluntary administration. A 
provision  was  established  to  cover  balances  owed  which  are  not  expected  to  be  recovered.  During  the  current 
financial year this balance was subsequently written off.
Guarantees
The  policy  of  the  Group  is  to provide  financial guarantees  for  statutory  bonding  requirements associated  with  the 
mining operations and for construction of the rail upgrade and other purposes such as security of leased premises. 
Guarantees are provided under the A$1.4 billion senior secured bank facility and $65 million of secured bilateral bank 
guarantee facilities. Details of outstanding guarantees are provided in note 7.4.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities  when  due,  under  both  normal  and  stressed  conditions,  without  incurring  unacceptable  losses  or  risking 
damage to the Group’s reputation.
Typically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet all expected operational expenses as and 
when  due,  including  the  servicing  of  financial  obligations.  This  excludes  the  potential  impact  of  extreme 
circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.

Net fair values
The Group complies with AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which requires disclosure of fair value 
measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
• Level 1 - measurements based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,
• Level 2 - measurements based upon inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices), and
• Level 3 - measurements based on inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
The Group held the following financial instruments carried at fair value in the consolidated statement of 
financial position:

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is derived using valuation techniques based on observable market 
inputs, such as forward currency rates, at the end of the reporting period. The amounts disclosed in the 
consolidated statement of financial position are the fair values and are classified under level 2 in the fair value 
measurement hierarchy.
The fair value of the Group’s investment in unlisted shares is classified under level 3 in the fair value measurement 
hierarchy. The Group’s holding in unlisted shares is minor and any reasonably possible change in assumptions 
would not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The carrying values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the financial statements materially 
approximates their respective net fair values, determined in accordance with the accounting policies disclosed in 
note 3.1, 3.3 and 5.1 to the financial statements.

5.5  Share-based payments
Accounting policy:
The grant date fair value of options and performance rights granted to employees is recognised as an expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to 
the options. The amount recognised is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest, except for 
those that fail to vest due to market conditions not being met. Once the instruments have vested, no further 
expenses are recognised nor reserves reversed in respect to costs already charged. However, where the share 
rights or options have lapsed after vesting the Group transfers the equivalent amount of the cumulative cost for 
the lapsed awards from the share based payments reserve to another component of equity.

The performance rights are subject to a performance measure linked to relative total shareholder return (TSR) 
and a costs hurdle. The TSR performance measure compares the TSR performance of the Company with the 
TSR performance of a peer group of companies operating in the Australian resources sector. The costs hurdle 
performance measure relates to the Company’s achieving a defined cost per tonne target. Detailed disclosures of 
outcomes against the target are provided in the Remuneration Report.

Group Structure
6.1  Group’s subsidiaries and interests in joint operations
Accounting policy:
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through 
its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the
investee)
  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and 

The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent 
of  the  Group  and  to  the  non-controlling  interests,  even  if  this  results  in  the  non-controlling  interests  having  a  deficit 
balance.
The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent 
accounting policies.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at their cost of acquisition in the Company’s financial statements.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Jointly controlled operations
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about 
relevant strategic and/or key operating decisions require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Group 
recognises its interest in jointly controlled operations by recognising its interest in the assets and liabilities of the joint 
operation. The Group also recognises the expenses it incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the sale of 
goods or services by the joint operation.
Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The Group assesses whether it has the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee by considering the rights it 
holds  with  respect  to  the  work  programme  and  budget  approval,  investment  decision  approval,  voting  rights  in  joint 
operating committees and changes to joint arrangement participant holdings. Where the Group has control judgement 
is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture.

Accounting policy:
Wages, salaries, annual leave and sick leave
Liabilities for wages, salaries, annual leave and sick leave are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the 
reporting  date.  They  are  measured  at  the  amounts  expected  to  be  paid  when  the  liabilities  are  settled  i.e.  at 
undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates including related on-costs, such as workers 
compensation insurance and payroll tax.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by 
the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Long-term service benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using expected 
future increases in wage and salary rates including related on-costs and expected settlement dates, and is discounted 
using  the  rates  attached  to  the  high  quality  corporate  bonds  at  the  balance  date  which  have  maturity  dates 
approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations.
Defined contribution superannuation funds
Obligations  for  contributions  to  defined  contribution  superannuation  funds  are  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred.

For the year ended 30 June 2016
7.5  Subsequent events
In the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report there has not arisen any item, 
transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the directors of the Company, to affect 
significantly the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group, in future 
financial years other than the following:
In July 2016, the Group repaid a further $35 million of debt drawn under the senior bank facility.
7.6  New accounting standards and interpretations
(i) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
of the previous financial year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective as of 1 July 
2015.
Several amendments apply for the first time in the current year. However, they do not impact the annual consolidated 
financial statements of the Group or the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.
AASB 2013-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Conceptual Framework, Materiality and 
Financial Instruments, Part C
Part C makes amendments to a number of Australian Accounting Standards, including incorporating Chapter 6 
Hedge Accounting into AASB 9 Financial Instruments.
AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031 
Materiality
The Standard completes the AASB’s project to remove Australian guidance on materiality from Australian Accounting 
Standards.
(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet effective 
and have not been adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2015 are outlined below:
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
A finalised version of AASB 9 which contains accounting requirements for financial instruments, replacing AASB 139 
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The standard contains requirements in the areas of classification 
and measurement, impairment, hedge accounting and derecognition. The Group has not yet determined the potential 
impact of the amendments on the Group’s financial report. This standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
AASB 15 provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. Guidance is 
provided on topics such as the point in which revenue is recognised, accounting for variable consideration, costs of 
fulfilling and obtaining a contract and various related matters. New disclosures about revenue are also introduced. The 
Group is in the process of determining the potential impact of the amendments on the  Group’s financial report. This 
standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
AASB 16 Leases
IFRS  16  provides  a  new  lessee  accounting  model  which  requires  a  lessee  to  recognise  assets  and  liabilities  for  all 
leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee measures right-of-use 
assets  similarly  to  other  non-financial  assets  and  lease  liabilities  similarly  to  other  financial  liabilities.  Assets  and 
liabilities  arising  from  a  lease  are  initially  measured  on  a  present  value  basis.  The  measurement  includes  non-
cancellable lease payments (including inflation-linked payments), and also includes payments to be made in optional 
periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to 
terminate the lease. IFRS 16 contains disclosure requirements for lessees. This standard applies to annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
AASB  2015-1  Amendments  to  Australian  Accounting  Standards  –  Annual  Improvements  to  Australian 
Accounting Standards 2012–2014 Cycle
The subjects of the principal amendments to the Standards in respect to AASB 119 Employee Benefits can be described 
below:
  Discount  rate:  regional  market  issue  -  clarifies  that  the  high  quality  corporate  bonds  used  to  estimate  the 
discount  rate  for  post-employment  benefit  obligations  should  be  denominated  in  the  same  currency  as  the 
liability. Further it clarifies that the depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds should be assessed at 
the currency level.

Independent auditor's report to the members of Whitehaven Coal 
Limited
Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Whitehaven Coal Limited, which comprises the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting 
policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the consolidated entity 
comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to time during the 
financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a 
true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 
and for such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of 
the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 
1.2, the directors also state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of 
Financial Statements, that the financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting 
Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity's internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.
90

2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a
