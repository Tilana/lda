MFC INDUSTRIAL ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF SPECIAL WARRANTS OF COMPTON
PETROLEUM CORPORATION
NEW YORK (July 16, 2012) . . . MFC Industrial Ltd. (NYSE: MIL) ("MFC" or the "Company") announces that it has 
acquired,  though  its  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  MFC  Acquisition  Inc.,  6,548,498  special  warrants  (the 
"Warrants") of Compton Petroleum Corporation ("Compton") at a price of $1.25 per Warrant pursuant to the special 
warrant  agreement  between  the  Company  and  Compton  dated  July  6,  2012  and  previously  announced  by  the 
parties on July 9, 2012. 
 
The  Warrants  are  convertible  into  common  shares  of  Compton  (the  "Compton  Shares")  on  a  one-for-one  basis. 
Conversion is automatic in certain events and otherwise at the option of MFC.  The Warrants are also redeemable, 
at the option of MFC and prior to conversion, at their subscription price upon the occurrence of certain events. The 
Compton Shares underlying the Warrants represent approximately 19.9% of the outstanding Compton Shares on a 
post-conversion basis as at the date hereof.  Proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants will be utilized by Compton 
to pay down its current bank facility. 
 
Together  with  Compton  Shares  and  cashless  warrants  of  Compton  held  by  the  Company  and  its  affiliates  and 
assuming conversion of the Warrants and cashless warrants, the Company would hold 6,835,998 Compton Shares, 
representing 20.7% of the outstanding Compton Shares based on the number of Compton Shares outstanding as at 
the date hereof. 
 
The Warrants were acquired for investment purposes. The Company will evaluate its ownership position in Compton 
from  time  to  time  and  intends  to  acquire  additional  securities  of  Compton  in  the  future  pursuant  to  its  previously 
announced offer to acquire all of the outstanding Compton Shares. The Company has filed a report (as contemplated 
by National Instrument 62-103 The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues) 
in connection with the acquisition of Warrants described herein. A copy of such report is available under Compton's 
profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and may also be obtained by contacting the Company at the contact particulars 
set forth herein.
