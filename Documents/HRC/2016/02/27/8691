<p>Sweden welcomes the recommendations made in the course of its Universal Periodic 
Review on 7 May 2010. After careful consideration, Sweden is pleased to provide the 
following responses, to be included in the outcome report: 
</p>
<p><b>  96.1 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Sweden signed the ICPPED in 2007. The Government will have to conduct the 
necessary review of the relevant legislation as a basis for a decision on ratification. It is the 
view of the Government that Swedish legislation meets the standards of the Convention in 
most respects.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.2 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation.  
</p>
<p>See 96.1. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.3 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Budgetary issues for public authorities and institutions are regularly reviewed. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.4 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Sweden regularly reviews its reservations to the ICCPR - most recently in 2009, in 
connection with the consideration of Sweden&#8217;s 6th periodic report by the Human Rights 
Committee. Sweden then found strong reasons for maintaining its current reservations. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.5 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does</b> <b>not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>See 96.4. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.6 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The Government is continuing to study the complicated issue of ratification of ILO 
Convention No. 169. When it comes to land rights, the Government must maintain a 
balance between the competing interests of all individuals, S&#225;mi and non-S&#225;mi, living in 
the same areas of northern Sweden. The areas where the S&#225;mi have reindeer herding rights 
are often owned and used by non-S&#225;mi. Before the Government can consider ratification, 
all issues relating to the legal consequences must be clarified.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.7 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation.  
</p>
<p>See 96.1 
</p>
<p><b>  96.8 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/11/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>Asylum seekers under the age of 18 and children who have gone into hiding are 
entitled to health and medical care on the same conditions as all other children domiciled in 
Sweden. Children staying in the country without having applied for the necessary permits 
have access to care on the same conditions as other temporary visitors. Nobody can be 
denied emergency care on the grounds of inability to pay. A government inquiry is 
currently examining the issue of subsidised health care for persons staying in Sweden 
without having applied for the necessary permits, and how health care can be expanded in 
relation to current legislation. The inquiry is to pay particular attention to the needs of 
children. Sweden can, against this background, accept the underlying principle of the 
recommendation. No definitive answer can be given as to the details of any future 
legislative framework.  
</p>
<p>Since July 2006, municipalities have been responsible for the reception of 
unaccompanied minors, including by taking appropriate measures under the Social Services 
Act, which include adequate housing for the children.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.9 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>This recommendation is accepted with the clarification that the proposed changes 
are being considered by the Swedish parliament, which will take the final decision in the 
matter.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.10 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>In 2006 the Government established a <i>Delegation for Human Rights in Sweden</i>. The 
Delegation is currently examining the issue of establishing an independent national human 
rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. The findings will be presented to 
the Government by 30 September 2010. Pending the result of the inquiry, the Government 
will take no position on the matter at hand.

</p>
<p>The four previous Ombudsmen working with discrimination were previously 
internationally accredited as one national human rights institution. In November 2008, the 
accreditation status lapsed due to the merging of these institutions into one agency. A new 
application is currently being prepared by the new Equality Ombudsman.

</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>While from a broader social perspective, families in all their various manifestations 
play a crucial role in society, and while they in many central ways can contribute to the 
protection of children&#8217;s human rights in accordance with the CRC, Sweden emphasises the 
fact that human rights are the entitlement of each individual human being. There is, as such, 
no human rights imperative to strengthen the institution of the family. 
</p>
<p>Work in the field of family law primarily consists of amending the laws to keep pace 
with developments in society at large to encompass all families, including single or 
divorced parents. One of the guiding principles is to act in the best interests of the child. 
</p>
<p>As of 1 May 2009, new rules concerning marriage and marriage ceremonies apply. 
A person's sex no longer has any bearing on the possibility of entering into marriage. The 
Marriage Code and other statutes involving spouses have been made gender-neutral and the 
Registered Partnership Act (1994:1117) has been repealed. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.18 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Sweden will continue to cooperate closely with all UN special procedures in the 
field of human rights, including by answering questionnaires when the Government has 
relevant input to share. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.19 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The Swedish position is that the provisions on <i>agitation against a national or ethnic 
group, unlawful military activity, inciting rebellion, conspiracy</i> and <i>preparation, attempt 
and complicity in crimes</i> contained in the Penal Code mean that organisations engaged in 
racist activities cannot pursue such activities without breaking the law. 
</p>
<p>There is a constitutional ban on censorship. It is not permitted for a public authority 
to scrutinise, prior to dissemination, a text or other message intended for dissemination. 
However, the Penal Code prohibits the dissemination of information containing threats or 
expressing contempt for a national, ethnic or other such group of persons with allusion to 
race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual orientation.  </p>

<p><b>  96.24 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the first part of the recommendation, and the recommendation to 
prosecute perpetrators, but does not accept the remainder of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Sweden has comprehensive legislation in place to address racism. The Penal Code 
contains two provisions directly concerning contempt or discrimination on the ground of 
race, colour or national or ethnic origin; namely those relating to <i>agitation against a 
national or ethnic group</i> and <i>unlawful discrimination</i>. The Act on Responsibility for 
Electronic Bulletin Boards also counteracts agitation against a national or ethnic group and 
could be applied to racist propaganda. 
</p>
<p>The Penal Code provides for aggravated sentencing when the motive for an offence 
is xenophobic, or otherwise motivated by hatred. This provision is applicable to all 
categories of crimes.

</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>It is the view of the Swedish Government that CAT does not oblige a state party to 
incorporate a definition of torture in domestic legislation and that Swedish legislation 
corresponds to Sweden&#8217;s international obligations. While there is no specific provision in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/11/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>the Penal Code prohibiting torture and cruel and inhuman treatment, such acts are penalised 
under other provisions.

</p>
<p><b>  96.31 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation.  
</p>
<p>The Swedish procedural system is based on the principle of free examination of 
evidence. While there is no explicit prohibition as regards the use in court of information 
obtained under torture, a number of procedural safeguards would in practice effectively 
exclude such evidence from judicial proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.32 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Sweden emphasises the fact that human rights are the entitlement of each individual. 
While families can in many central ways contribute to the protection of children&#8217;s human 
rights according to the CRC, there is, as such, no human rights imperative to strengthen the 
institution of the family. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.33 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Swedish legislation includes criminal provisions prohibiting incitement to hatred 
against groups of a certain faith or ethnic background, amongst others. In the case with the 
poster of Prophet Mohammed, reactions were swift. A complaint was immediately made at 
the Police Authority and an investigation is currently being carried out. </p>
<p>Freedom of religion, as well as freedom of expression and freedom of the press are 
enshrined in the constitution. Censorship of the media is prohibited. The Freedom of Press 
Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression exclusively regulate whether, and 
in which cases, interventions against content in the media may take place. Incitement to 
racial hatred is a serious offence under Swedish law. The law imposes a penalty against 
statements that threaten or express disdain for an ethnic group with reference to, for 
example, their belief or national or ethnic provenance. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.34 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation to pay more attention to the issues of 
Islamophobia, hatred towards Muslims and incitement to hatred against Muslims, while </p>

<p><b>  96.35 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the first part of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>It is a priority for the Government to eliminate unwarranted pay differentials 
between women and men and several measures have been taken in this regard. However, 
the Government is not in a position to &#8220;ensure&#8221; equal remuneration. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.36 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>A basic element of Swedish S&#225;mi policy is to support and promote S&#225;mi self-
determination on issues directly affecting the S&#225;mi people. 
</p>
<p>In 2006, the Government submitted a bill on increased S&#225;mi influence. In the bill, 
the Government designated the S&#225;mi Parliament as the central administrative agency 
responsible for reindeer husbandry and transfered a number of administrative tasks. The bill 
was endorsed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>The Government is open to transferring further responsibilities to the S&#225;mi 
Parliament on issues directly affecting the S&#225;mi people in order to strengthen their 
participation in decision-making.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.37 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>A bill on Swedish S&#225;mi policy was due to have been presented to the Swedish 
parliament in March 2010. A proposal to introduce a Swedish consultation process 
regarding questions of interest to the S&#225;mi was one of the key issues to be included in the 
bill. 
</p>
<p>Due to criticism directed by the S&#225;mi parties at the proposals, the Government has 
postponed the process for the purpose of entering into a closer dialogue with S&#225;mi interest 
groups. 
</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to involving the S&#225;mi and the S&#225;mi Parliament 
in decision-making processes that affects them on an equal footing with others. However, it 
is difficult to guarantee representation at all levels.  
</p>
<p><b>  96.38 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>All persons belonging to the S&#225;mi people naturally have the same right as all other 
Swedish citizens to legal aid on an individual basis. 
</p>
<p>However, under the Legal Aid Act, legal aid is not granted to legal entities. The 
S&#225;mi villages are therefore, like other legal entities, referred to private legal protection 
insurance. 
</p>
<p>Regarding the question of legal costs it is a principle in the Swedish legal system 
that the party that has failed to prove their case in court pays for their own legal costs and 
for the costs of winning party. In its judgment of 30 March 2010 in the case of 
Hand&#246;lsdalen S&#225;mi village and others v. Sweden, the ECHR tried a claim for legal costs </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/11/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>and found that, under the current Swedish system, the S&#225;mi villages were afforded 
reasonable opportunity to present their cases effectively before the national courts. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.39 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and irregular migrants in Sweden may be detained only on certain 
grounds, and all such detainees have access to legal counsel, consular assistance and 
adequate information. Detention is used only to a very limited extent. An alien may not be 
detained for more than two weeks, unless there are exceptional grounds for a longer period. 
In accordance with the European Returns Directive, Sweden will adopt new provisions 
concerning maximum detention periods. Further, an Inquiry has been appointed by the 
Government to thoroughly examine the legal framework on detention under the Swedish 
Aliens Act. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.40 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>See 96.8. 
</p>
<p>However, as this recommendation relates also to the access of adults to the full 
health care system, Sweden is not in a position to accept this recommendation at present. 
The inquiry referred to in 96.8 is currently examining this issue. Pending the result of the 
inquiry, the Government will take no position on the matter at hand. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.41 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The Health and Medical Care for Asylum Seekers and Others Act (2008:344) 
regulates health and dental care for asylum seekers beyond immediate treatment. The Act 
stipulates that all asylum seekers shall have access to health and dental care that cannot be 
postponed; this also include subsequent related treatments. Asylum seekers are also offered 
voluntary physical check-ups. 
</p>
<p>See 96.8. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.42 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the first part of the recommendation.  
</p>
<p>All children in Sweden between the ages of 7 and 16 are required to attend school, 
and have the right to education free of charge in the nine-year compulsory school system. 
No child is denied its right to education on the grounds of belonging to a minority.  
</p>
<p>Children seeking asylum have the right to education, but education is not 
compulsory. An inquiry set up by the Government recently proposed that, as a rule, all 
children residing in Sweden, including children without a permit for their stay, should have 
the right to education, pre-school activities and school-age child care. The proposals have 
been circulated widely to state bodies and NGOs for consultation. Against this background, 
Sweden can accept the underlying principle of this part of the recommendation but no 
definitive answer can be given as to the details of any future legislative framework.

<p>It is the policy of the Swedish Government that diplomatic assurances are

safeguards.

<p><b>  96.48 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>accepts</b> the recommendation to uphold the rights of citizens while 
combating terrorism on the Internet, and has already implemented it. The purpose of the 
Signals Intelligence Act (2008:717), however, is not to combat terrorism on the Internet, 
but to collect intelligence for the security of the realm. 
</p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the second part of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>Prohibiting Swedish services providers from hosting certain persons or groups 
would conflict with the constitutional ban on censorship. However, criminal acts committed 
by individuals belonging to such organisations can be prosecuted under Swedish law. 
</p>
<p>See 96.19, 96.24, 96.25. 
</p>
<p><b>  96.49 
</b></p>
<p>Sweden <b>does not accept</b> the recommendation.  
</p>
<p>Sweden has not been involved in so-called renditions or any other use of Swedish 
territory as a transit territory for flights by the CIA or any other government intelligence 
and security agency of the USA.  
</p>
<p>The two cases in 2001 for which Sweden has been criticised by the Human Rights 
Committee and the Committee against Torture did not constitute the use of Swedish 
territory as a transit territory for flights by any US government intelligence or security 
agency. 
</p>
<p>The decision to deport the two Egyptian citizens was made by the Government in 
accordance with the Aliens Act in force at the time, and the decision was enforced by the 
Swedish Security Service in cooperation with US authorities.  </p>

</p>
<p>The Chancellor of Justice has awarded damage compensation on behalf of the 
Government to the two persons concerned. Furthermore, public prosecutors at different 
levels have considered whether criminal investigations should be initiated, deciding that 
there were no grounds to initiate such investigations.
