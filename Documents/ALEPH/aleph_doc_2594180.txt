Management’s Discussion and Analysis
August 12, 2016
In  this  document:  (i)  unless  the  content  otherwise  requires,  references  to  “our”,  “us”,  “its”,  “the
Company” or “Exeter” mean Exeter Resource Corporation and its subsidiaries; (ii) information is
provided as at June 30, 2016, unless otherwise stated; (iii) all references to monetary amounts
are  to  Canadian  Dollars,  unless  otherwise  stated;  and  (iv)  “$”  refers  to  Canadian  Dollars  and
“US$” refers to US Dollars.
The following discussion is management’s assessment and analysis of the results and financial
condition  of  Exeter  and  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  accompanying  unaudited
condensed interim consolidated financial statements and related notes.
Forward Looking Statements
 
This  MD&A  contains  “forward-looking  information”  and  “forward-looking  statements”  (together,
the “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws and the United
States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.  All statements other than
statements of historical fact are forward looking statements.
These forward-looking statements, principally under the heading “Outlook”, but also elsewhere in
this  document  include  estimates,  forecasts  and  statements  as  to  the  Company’s  belief  with
respect to, among other things, potential economics and development options for Caspiche as
set out in the amended preliminary economic analysis study released December 19, 2014, the
timing  of  its  drilling,  exploration  programs  and  exploration  results,  objectives  of  and  the
completion  of  various  studies,  potential  to  secure  adequate  quantities  of  water  and  power,
permitting,  the  Company’s  ability  to  mitigate  against  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  ability  of  the
Company to access capital to fund its activities, the ability of the Company to respond to market
fluctuations and government regulations and the ability of the Company to demonstrate that a
commercially viable mineral deposit exists on its Caspiche project, and the merits of the legal
challenge to the easement over surface rights at Caspiche granted by the Chilean government.
These forward-looking statements appear in a number of different places in this document and
can  be  identified  by  words  and  phrases  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  “estimates”,  “plans”,  “is
expected”,  “objectives”  or  variations  of  such  words  or  phrases,  or  statements  that  certain
activities, events or results “may”, “would” or “could” occur. While the Company has based these
forward-looking  statements  on  its  expectations  about  future  events  as  at  the  date  that  this
document  was  prepared,  the  statements  are  not  a  guarantee  of  the  Company’s  future
performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which could
cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-
looking  statements.  The  Company’s  forward-looking  statements  are  based  on  the  beliefs,
expectations  and  opinions  of  management  on  the  date  the  statements  are  made,  and  the
Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances
or  management’s  beliefs,  expectations  or  opinions  should  change  except  as  required  by  law.
Such  factors  and  assumptions  include,  amongst  others,  the  effects  of  general  economic
conditions;  changing 
foreign  exchange  rates  and  actions  by  government  authorities;
uncertainties  associated  with  negotiations;  misjudgements  in  the  course  of  preparing  forward-
looking statements; fluctuations in gold, copper, silver and other commodity prices and currency
exchange rates; uncertainties relating to interpretation of drill results and the geology; continuity
and grade of mineral deposits; uncertainty of estimates of capital and operating costs; price and
availability  of  capital  equipment;  price  of  various  other  inputs  such  as  fuel,  electricity  and
reagents;  recovery  rates,  production  estimates  and  estimated  economic  return;  the  need  for
cooperation of government agencies and native groups in the exploration and development of
properties  and  the  issuance  of  required  permits;  the  need  to  obtain  additional  financing  to
develop  properties  and  uncertainty  as  to  the  availability  and  terms  of  future  financing;  the
possibility  of  delay  in  exploration  or  development  programs  or  in  construction  projects  and
uncertainty  of  meeting  anticipated  program  milestones;  risks  associated  with  project
development,  including  risks  associated  with  the  failure  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
Company’s agreement with Anglo American on its Caspiche project which could result in loss of
title; uncertainty as to timely availability of permits and other governmental approvals, uncertainty
of the outcome of the legal challenge to the grant by the Chilean government of the easement
over surface rights, uncertainty regarding the potential to secure adequate water, and other risks
and uncertainties disclosed under “Risks” below and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in
the  Company’s  current  Annual  Information  Form,  filed  with  the  Canadian  securities  regulatory
authorities  and  other  information  released  by  it  and  filed  with  the  appropriate  regulatory
agencies.    Although  the  Company  has  attempted  to  identify  important  risk  factors  that  could
cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking
statements,  there  may  be  other  risk  factors  that  cause  actions,  events  or  results  not  to  be  as
anticipated, estimated or intended.  There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements
will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from
2
those anticipated in such statements.  For the reasons set forth above, readers should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  All statements are made as of the date of this
MD&A and the Company is under no obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statements
except as required under applicable securities laws.
Cautionary note to U.S. Investors concerning reserve and resource estimates
This MD&A and other information released by Exeter have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements  of  the  securities  laws  in  effect  in  Canada,  which  differ  from  the  requirements  of
United  States  securities  laws.    The  terms  “mineral  reserve”,  “proven  mineral  reserve”  and
“probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with Canadian
National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on
Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves,  adopted  by  the  CIM  Council,  as  amended  (“CIM
Standards”).    These  definitions  differ  from  the  definitions  in  SEC  Industry  Guide  7  under  the
United States Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  Under SEC Industry
Guide 7 standards, a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-
year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves
and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental
authority.
In  addition,  the  terms  “mineral  resource”,  “measured  mineral  resource”,  “indicated  mineral
resource” and “inferred mineral resource” are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-
101  and  the  CIM  Standards;  however,  these  terms  are  not  defined  terms  under  SEC  Industry
Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed
with the SEC.  Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in
these categories will ever be converted into reserves.  “Inferred mineral resources” have a great
amount  of  uncertainty  as  to  their  existence,  and  great  uncertainty  as  to  their  economic
feasibility.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be
upgraded to a higher category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources
may  not  form  the  basis  of  feasibility  or  pre-feasibility  studies.    Investors  are  cautioned  not  to
assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally
mineable.    Disclosure  of  “contained  ounces”  in  a  resource  is  permitted  disclosure  under
Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization
that does not constitute “reserves” by SEC Industry Guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and
grade without reference to unit measures.
Accordingly, information contained in this MD&A contains descriptions of our mineral deposits
that may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the
reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder.

Report on Operations
Second Quarter 2016
The Company continued its work on the Caspiche gold-copper project in the Maricunga region of
Northern Chile in an effort to advance the project. The primary focus in 2016 is the advancement
of  programs  related  to  securing  water  and  investigating  infrastructure  requirements  for  the
Caspiche project as well as the ongoing assessment of lower capital alternatives for the potential
development of the project.
Caspiche represents one of the largest mineral discoveries made in Chile in recent years. The
unique  characteristics  of  the  deposit,  with  its  surface  oxide  gold  zone  and  higher  grade  gold-
copper core, offer future mining opportunities that range from modest scale oxide heap leach gold
production, to larger scale open pit/underground mining of the underlying gold-copper zone.
An  amended  preliminary  economic  assessment  (“2014  PEA”)  for  Caspiche  released  on
December  19th,  2014  (with  an  effective  date  of  April  30,  2014)  identified  three  new  potential
development  options  focussed  on  lower  throughputs  and  the  higher  grade  core  of  the
deposit.    All  three  required  lower  Capex  and  would  use  lower  quantities  of  water  to  support
mining  operations  compared  to  previous  studies.    The  2014  PEA  titled  “Amended  NI  43-101
Technical Report on the Caspiche Project, Atacama Region, Chile” dated December 19th, 2014
prepared  by  Santiago  based  engineering  consultancies,  NCL  Ingeniería  y  Construcción  and
Alquimia Conceptos S.A. can be found at www.exeterresource.com or on SEDAR.
PROJECTS
CHILE
Caspiche Project
Northern Chile - Maricunga
In  2005,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Anglo  American  with  respect  to  seven
properties in the Maricunga region of Chile.  The terms of the agreement provided for increasing
annual drilling and exploration commitments over five years, and the phased reversion of five
properties to Anglo American.  Exeter satisfied its obligations under the agreement, having spent
more  than  the  required  minimum  of  US$2.55  million,  including  completing  more  than  15,500
metres  (“m”)  of  required  drilling,  and  exercised  its  option  to  acquire  a  100%  interest  in  the
Caspiche property in February 2011. Anglo American retains a 3% net smelter royalty (“NSR”)
from  production  from  the  property  and  has  the  right  to  buy  the  property  back  by  reimbursing
certain  of  the  Company’s  expenditures  incurred  on  the  property  if  it  is  not  put  into  production
within 15 years from the date the Company exercised its option.  In addition, the Company will be
required to pay a further 0.08% NSR from production pursuant to an agreement with a private
entity.
The Company is required to make an advance annual royalty payment of US$250,000 up until
March 31, 2020 (US$1,500,000 paid to June 30, 2016) and thereafter US$1 million annually for
the period March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2025 or until commencement of commercial production,
should  production  commence  prior  to  March  31,  2025,  at  which  time  the  advance  royalty  will
cease and the NSR will be payable.
The  Caspiche  project  is  located  in  a  prolific  region  of  gold-porphyry  deposits,  15  kilometres
(“km”) (10 miles) southeast of Kinross Gold’s Maricunga open pit mine (formerly known as the
Refugio mine) and 11 km (7 miles) north of Barrick Gold – Kinross Gold’s Cerro Casale project.
Water agreement
In January 2014, the Company’s Chilean subsidiary, Sociedad Contractual Minera Eton Chile
(“Eton”),  negotiated  new  water  exploration  agreement  (“Water  Agreement”)  terms  with  the
Chilean  subsidiary  of  Canadian  company  Atacama  Pacific  Gold  Corporation  (“Atacama
Pacific”).  The new terms amend the original agreement entered into between the parties in May
2013.  The Water Agreement allows Eton to earn an additional 40% interest, for an aggregate
90% interest, in any water rights granted following the discovery of water near Peñas Blancas
(Laguna Verde) in the Maricunga region, northern Chile.  To earn the additional 40% interest,
Eton  is  required  to  incur  an  additional  40%  (total  of  90%)  of  all  expenditures  relating  to
exploration  and  potential  development  on  the  water  tenements.    In  addition,  in  the  event  of
approval  of  water  rights  by  the  General  Directorate  of  Water  Resources  (“DGA”),  Eton  will
assume Atacama Pacific’s obligation to pay Hydro Exploraciones SpA (“Hydro”), an Atacama
4
Pacific affiliate, US$15,000 per litre per second (“l/s”) of DGA approved water rights.  Atacama
Pacific will remain obligated to pay Hydro US$15,000 per l/s on its 10% interest.  Regardless of
the  total  amount  of  DGA  approved  water  acquired,  payments  to  Hydro  are  capped  at  US$1
million.  These payments are not applicable to Eton’s original 50% interest in any water rights
acquired.    In  addition,  Eton  will  pay  US$5,000  per  month  to  Hydro  from  the  date  of  any
application for water rights for assisting with securing such water rights.  The aggregate of the
monthly payments are deductible from any amount payable to Hydro for water rights acquired.
Land easement
The Company has a lease agreement with the Chilean Government for the surface rights that
correspond to its initial mineral rights in the area and subsequent to June 30, 2016 the lease was
renewed for a further 10 year period at an annual rate of approximately US$40,000. On June 10,
2013  the  Company  announced  that  its  application  for  surface  rights  at  Caspiche  had  been
granted  by  the  Chilean  Government,  this  easement  extends  this  area  to  cover  most  of  its
additional tenements as well as areas that may be required for potential development of a mine
at  Caspiche.  In  order  to  maintain  these  rights,  which  are  valid  for  25  years,  the  Company  is
required  to  make  total  payments  of  158,876  Unidades  de  Fomento  (UF)*,  an  equivalent  of
approximately US$6.5 million of which US$3.0 million has been paid to June 30, 2016. Seven
annual payments of approximately US$505,000 each remain payable. Early in 2014, Eton Chile
was served with a court claim challenging the Chilean Government’s grant of the Easement. The
claim, filed before the Santiago Civil Court, was filed by a private Chilean mineral exploration
company,  Compañía  Minera  Cerro  del  Medio  SCM  (“SCM  Cerro  del  Medio”).  Under  Chilean
mining  law  there  are  provisions  which  provide  for  securing  necessary  surface  access  for  the
development  of  mineral  deposits.  SCM  Cerro  del  Medio’s  claim  cites  “non-compliance  by  the
Chilean Government of certain legal formalities required to approve the easement” and “that the
easement granted overlaps SCM Cerro del Medio’s Santa Cecilia project mining properties”. A
review of the claim by Eton Chile’s Chilean legal counsel has concluded that SCM Cerro del
Medio’s claim has no grounds under Chilean law and should be rejected.
* Unidad de Fomento (UF). This is a unit of account used in Chile. The exchange rate between
the  UF  and  the  Chilean  peso  is  constantly  adjusted  to  inflation  so  that  the  value  of  the  UF
remains constant.

The Company began 2016 with 88,407,753 common shares outstanding and ended the second
quarter  with  88,482,753  common  shares  outstanding.  During  the  six  months  ended  June  30,
2016, the Company received proceeds of $37,500 and issued 75,000 common shares upon the
exercise of options.
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, the Company received proceeds of $77,500 and issued 155,000
common shares upon the exercise of options.
As at August 12, 2016 the Company had 88,637,753 shares outstanding.
Summary of Financial Results
Selected Information
The Company’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the second
quarter  ended  June  30,  2016  (the  “Interim  Financial  Statements”)  have  been  prepared  in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as applicable to interim
financial reports including IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”. The following selected financial
information is taken from the Interim Financial Statements.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
At June 30, 2016, the Company had $19.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $2.7 million less
than  the  $22.3  million  that  was  held  at  December  31,  2015.  The  decrease  relates  to  the
Company utilizing its cash resources to fund ongoing project costs, mainly water exploration, and
administrative requirements.
The Company currently has no revenue generating activities. Interest income of $106,000 was
recognized  in  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2016  compared  to  $160,000  in  the  six  months
ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in 2016 was due to less cash in treasury as it was utilized in
funding project expenditures and administrative activities.
5
Loss for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was $3.2 million compared to $4.7 million in
the same period of 2015.
Significant variances for expenses:
·Mineral property expenditures: $2.0 million ($3.6 million in 2015) – The higher expenditure in
2015 was largely attributable to costs related to the completion of the water exploration drilling
program at Peñas Blancas. Expenditures on drilling, field camp and IVA tax were cumulatively
higher by approximately $1.3 million.
·Administration  salaries  and  consulting:  $252,000  ($431,000  in  2015)  –  the  higher  amount  in
2015 is mainly due to higher salary costs and the recording of a provision for staff terminations
which are partially offset by higher stock based compensation in 2016.
·Directors’  fees:  $250,000  ($75,000  in  2015)  –  the  change  is  mainly  due  to  stock  based
compensation  of  approximately  $197,000  recognized  in  2016  due  to  the  timing  of  grant  and
vesting of options which is partially offset by voluntary reductions of fees implemented in Q4
2015 of approximately $11,000.
·Shareholder communications: $268,000 ($209,000 in 2015) - the higher amount in 2016 is due
to increased marketing related activities.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
The Company ended its second quarter ended  June  30,  2016  with  $19.6  million  in  cash  and
cash  equivalents,  and  incurred  approximately  $868,000  in  project  expenditures  during  the
period.  Total  expenses  for  the  three  months  period  ended  June  2016  were  $1.5  million  ($1.8
million in 2015) including share-based compensation expense of $193,000 ($34,000 in 2015).
The loss in the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $1.4 million is $400,000 less than the loss
of $1.8 million incurred in the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Significant variances for expenses:
·Mineral property expenditures: $868,000 ($1.3 million in 2015) – the higher amount in 2015 is
mainly related to costs required for the completion of the water exploration drilling program in
Peñas  Blancas.  Expenditures  for  drilling  and  IVA  tax  in  2015  were  higher  by  approximately
$444,000.
·Administration salaries and consulting: $113,000 ($262,000 in 2015) – the decrease in 2016 is
mainly due to higher salary costs and the recording of a provision for staff termination in the
2015 period.
·Directors’ fees: $108,000 ($37,000 in 2015) – the change is mainly attributable to share-based
compensation  of  approximately  $82,000  recognized  in  2016  due  to  the  timing  of  grant  and
vesting of options which is partially offset by voluntary reductions of fees implemented in Q4
2015 of approximately $11,000.
·Shareholder communications: $145,000 ($82,000 in 2015) – the 2016 amount is higher mainly
due to an increase in marketing related activities.

The lower loss in Q2 2016 compared to the previous quarter is mainly the result of the payment of
the  annual  advanced  royalty  of  US$250,000  and  stock  exchange  filing  fees  incurred  in  Q1  of
approximately $101,000. The decrease in the loss in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the
previous quarter was mainly due to higher project expenditures and the annual land easement
payment incurred in Q4 2015. The loss in Q4 2015 is higher than the previous quarter mainly due
to  the  annual  payment  for  the  land  easement  at  Caspiche  of  approximately  $643,000.  The
increase in the loss of the third quarter in 2015 compared to the previous quarter is mainly due to
higher  share  based  compensation  recognized  in  Q3  which  is  partially  offset  by  lower  project
expenditures incurred in the same period. The decrease in the loss in the second quarter 2015
compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to lower project expenditures in Q2 due to the
completion of the water exploration program early in Q2, exchange filing fees of approximately
$122,000  and  the  payment  of  the  annual  advance  royalty  of  US$250,000  incurred  in  Q1.The
decrease in the loss in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the previous quarter was mainly due
to  higher  exploration  expenditures,  mostly  water  exploration,  and  the  annual  land  easement
payment incurred in Q4 2014. The increase in the loss in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to
the  previous  quarter  of  that  year  was  related  to  the  water  drilling  program  at  Peñas  Blancas
which was conducted during the Chilean summer with exploration activities curtailed in winter.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 totalled $19.6 million compared to
$22.3 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of about $2.7 million. The Company continues
to utilize its cash resources to fund project expenditures and administrative requirements. Aside
from  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  the  Company  has  no  material  liquid  assets.    While  the
Company has successfully raised funds through past capital financings, there are no guarantees
that such sources of funds will be available in the future.
Management  continues  to  evaluate  and  adjust  its  planned  level  of  activities  to  ensure  that
adequate  levels  of  working  capital  are  maintained.    The  availability  of  funding  will  affect  the
planned  activity  levels  at  the  Caspiche  project  and  expenditures  will  be  adjusted  to  match
available funding.
Currently,  the  Company  intends  to  continue  to  fund  the  exploration  and  development  of  its
properties, with specific focus on Caspiche, and for general working capital purposes.
The Company has no loans or bank debt and there are no restrictions on the use of its cash
resources. The Company has not issued any dividends and management does not expect this
will change in the near future.

Financial Instruments
The Company’s activities potentially expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk,
foreign exchange currency risk, liquidity and interest rate risk.
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument, will fail to discharge an obligation
and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.  Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.  The
Company deposits the majority of its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial
institutions  in  Canada  and  holds  balances  in  banks  in  Chile  as  required  to  meet  current
expenditures.  The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of
any allowances for losses, represents the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and due to and from related parties approximates fair value due to the short
term nature of these financial instruments.
The Company operates in Canada and Chile, and it is therefore exposed to foreign exchange
risk arising from transactions denominated in a foreign currency.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities are denominated in several currencies (mainly Canadian Dollars, Chilean Pesos, US
Dollars  and  Australian  Dollars).    Foreign  currency  balances  which  are  held  in  the  Canadian
parent are subject to fluctuation against the Canadian Dollar.  Foreign currency balances which
are held in the Chilean subsidiary are subject to fluctuation against the Chilean Peso.
The Canadian parent company had the following balances in foreign currencies as at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015:

Based on the above net exposures as at June 30, 2016, and assuming that all other variables
remain  constant,  a  10%  depreciation  or  appreciation  of  the  US  dollar  and  Australian  dollar
against  the  Canadian  dollar  would  result  in  an  increase/decrease  of  $20,300  and  $1,700
respectively (2015 - $8,700 and $1,600 respectively) in the Company’s net loss.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  The Company’s interest rate risk mainly arises
from the interest rate impact on the cash and cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents earn
interest based on current market interest rates, which at June 30, 2016 ranged between 0.90%
and 1.20%.

Based on the amount of cash and cash equivalents held at June 30, 2016, and assuming that all
other variables remain constant, a 0.5% change in the applicable interest rate would result in an
increase/decrease of approximately $98,000 in the interest earned by the Company per annum.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they
fall  due.    The  Company  manages  its  liquidity  risk  by  forecasting  cash  flows  required  by
operations and anticipated investing and financing activities.  The Company had cash at June
30,  2016  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $19.6  million  in  order  to  meet  short-term  business
requirements. At June 30, 2016, the Company had current liabilities of approximately $348,000
which are due on demand or within 30 days.
Contractual Obligations
The Company leases offices in Canada and Chile and has expenditure, option payment, land
easement payments and advance royalty obligations related to its properties. Option payments
and property expenditure obligations are contingent on exploration results and can be cancelled
at any time should exploration results so warrant. Other financial commitments are summarized
in the table below:

Outlook
The  Company  will  continue  to  optimize  Caspiche  development  options  and  importantly
investigate infrastructure alternatives that could enhance project economics. The intention is to
continue the process of de-risking the project such that it stands out, as one of the few projects
with the potential to be advanced rapidly.
The 2014 PEA reflects the staged development potential at Caspiche with initial development of
an open pit mine focussed on the near-surface, gold only oxide zone followed by further open pit
or  underground  development.  The  preliminary  economics  and  modest  capital  requirements,
demonstrate  that  advancing  the  standalone  surface  oxide  gold  zone  through  to  a  production
decision, is a logical potential development option for Caspiche.
With  the  staged  development  potential  at  Caspiche,  the  Company  continues  to  focus  on
identifying, evaluating and securing water sources to support the heap leach oxide gold stage
and the follow-on gold – copper sulphide stage of a potential mine development.
Additional  steps  also  include  planning  for  and  commencing  a  detailed  scientific  and
environmental program using experienced consultants. The objective of this next program will be
to accurately model the zone for potential mine development, its interactions with adjacent areas,
consult  on  possible  uses  with  other  stakeholders  and  communities  as  a  basis  for  future
development plans.
A secondary focus for Exeter is to actively review corporate opportunities with the possibility of
acquiring assets that will provide additional value for shareholders. In particular, the Company is
focusing  on  securing  assets/projects  in  the  America’s.  The  Company  remains  committed  to
prudently managing its capital, while seeking to maximize shareholder value.
