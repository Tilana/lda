</b>Agenda item 10 
<b>Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report is submitted pursuant to resolution 17/21 of the Human Rights 
Council requesting the High Commissioner to present a report on the situation of human 
rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire at its eighteenth session. It provides an update on the human rights 
situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since the report presented by the High Commissioner to the 
Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/49) at its seventeenth session and covers events from 1 
June to 31 August 2011. 
</p>
<p> The fragile security situation, coupled with existing resentment within several 
communities, especially in Abidjan and the west, continues to breed inter-community 
tensions, which often result in violence, with negative implications for the human rights 
situation. Civilians, particularly women and children, remained the primary victims of 
human rights violations and abuses and continued to face difficulties in accessing the 
criminal justice system, which is experiencing serious logistical and human resource 
challenges as a result of the conflict. 
</p>
<p> There are reports of human rights violations by the Forces R&#233;publicaines de la C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI), including extra-judicial and summary executions, torture, inhumane and 
degrading treatment, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and detention, 
violations of economic and social rights through acts of extortion, threats and intimidation. 
The fragile security situation has also encouraged vestiges of militia groups to continue 
carrying out targeted attacks against the population in areas in the west amid heightened 
levels of tension among various communities. 
</p>
<p> While corrective action has been taken, in the form of arrests of some of the 
perpetrators of human rights violations which occurred during the recent crisis, the 
Government needs to intensify its efforts to address human rights violations by the FRCI. 
Amid the current challenges facing the justice system, in particular the criminal justice 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>system, victims of sexual and gender-based violence continue to face considerable 
difficulties obtaining redress. This situation has largely contributed to a climate of impunity 
in relation to sexual and gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p> Concerns have been raised regarding the situation of former President Gbagbo and 
his close associates: their incommunicado detention, the lack of access to lawyers and the 
delay in formally bringing the charges against them. 
</p>
<p> While the swift establishment of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (DTRC) by President Ouattara represents an important step toward truth and 
reconciliation, some stakeholders have expressed concerns about what is perceived to be an 
attempt by the Government to rush the process through without proper consideration of the 
challenges involved and without extensive public participation. The Government needs to 
ensure that international standards and principles are respected in the establishment of 
transitional justice mechanisms. OHCHR is currently engaged with the Government and 
other relevant stakeholders with a view to supporting and enhancing the setting up of 
transitional justice mechanisms.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. Since the last report presented by the High Commissioner to the Human Rights 
Council at its seventeenth session, there has been increasing evidence of a return to 
normalcy in the country, including the appointment of a new government and a new chain 
of command in the security forces and an improvement in the security situation, as well as 
the resumption of commercial activities. However, the country remains fragile as the 
Government faces numerous challenges in addressing the legacy of gross human rights 
violations in a fair and impartial way. Other challenges include integration of various forces 
into the new army, the proliferation of arms, the deteriorating socio-economic situation, the 
provision of education and health services, the preparation of legislative elections before 
the end of the year and the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
to their respective communities.  
</p>
<p>2.  Despite the improvement in the security situation in Abidjan and in the northern 
part of the country, the human rights situation remains serious. There are numerous reports 
of extra-judicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention as well as other 
violations.  Vestiges of some militia groups continue to pose constant threats to the fragile 
security situation in the western part of the country. In addition, the security vacuum 
prevailing in several parts of the country due to the breakdown in the security and judicial 
apparatus, and the slow return to work of some security officials, remains a major area of 
concern with significant implications for the human rights situation.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Developments during the reporting period 
</b></p>
<p>3. Following his official inauguration, President Ouattara reshuffled his cabinet on 1 
June by confirming and appointing ministers to his Government. Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s Front 
populaire ivoirien (FPI) is not represented in the Government. On 7 July, President Ouattara 
also appointed top military commanders of the FRCI. During an official meeting with the 
military commanders in Abidjan on 22 July, President Ouattara admonished them to remain 
professional while emphasizing his intention to create an armed force that respects human 
rights and responds to the aspirations of the population. He specifically informed them of 
their command responsibility vis-&#224;-vis their subordinates and acts thereof. 
</p>
<p>4. On 20 July, President Ouattara announced the creation of a national commission of 
inquiry to investigate human rights violations committed during the post-electoral period. 
The presidential decree establishing this Commission indicated that it is a non-judicial 
body. Efforts were also undertaken to strengthen the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (DTRC) particularly through the enactment of an Ordinance creating the 
Commission, its membership and functions and the appointment of the members of the 
DTRC, on 5 September 2011. On 24 June, the Minister of Justice announced the creation of 
a special unit to investigate human rights violations committed in connection with the post-
election violence. 
</p>
<p>5. A United Nations electoral needs assessment mission dispatched to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
from 18 to 30 June concluded that legislative elections could be held by year&#8217;s end so long 
as the security situation improved and the international community stepped in to support the 
process. The normalization of political life and the creation of an enabling environment 
based on full respect for civil and political rights will be essential in ensuring that elections 
are held in a free, fair and participatory manner.  </p>


<p><b> III. Key human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p>6. During the reporting period, there have been reports of human rights violation 
including extra-judicial and summary executions, torture, inhumane and degrading 
treatment, sexual and gender-based violence, arbitrary arrest and detention, violations of 
economic and social rights through acts of extortion, threats and intimidation, and impunity 
for human rights violations. These allegations were brought to the attention of the 
Government by the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Operation in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI). Many of these human rights abuses appear to be the result of individuals 
using their positions for personal gain with impunity. The human rights violations appear 
also to be the result of recurring weaknesses and structural shortcomings of State 
institutions. The FRCI has filled the gap created by the lack of State authority, the collapse 
of public administration and of the delivery of public services in key areas of the country by 
taking on a number of State prerogatives such as the collection of commercial, mine and 
border taxes. The FRCI also usurps the role of the law enforcement and judicial authorities 
regarding the resolution of criminal and economic disputes. Only civil affairs are being 
referred to courts.    
</p>
<p>7. While there are cases of arrest and detention of members of the FRCI for alleged 
involvement in armed robberies and theft, the response of the FRCI hierarchy and other 
relevant authorities so far has been inadequate in relation to the gravity of the violations. 
While acknowledging the efforts undertaken to arrest perpetrators coupled with the 
Government&#8217;s intention to create a professional armed force with clear command and 
control channels, the relevant authorities are urged to put in place concrete measures to 
address the impunity being enjoyed by some members of the FRCI who have been involved 
in human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Extra-judicial and summary executions 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since the last report, the Human Rights Division (HRD) of UNOCI has documented 
71 cases of alleged summary execution, 54 of which have reportedly been committed by the 
FRCI and others by unidentified armed groups. While some of the victims were alleged to 
be former militiamen, others were reportedly executed after being suspected of petty 
offences and encounters with members of the FRCI. For example, on 5 June, in Becouefin 
(110 km from Abidjan), during a clash between a group of village youths and the FRCI, 
who alleged that the former did not recognize their authority, at least three persons were 
killed by the FRCI, including a 10-year-old girl. About 26 people were arrested during the 
incident. On 9 July, the bodies of three people who had previously been arrested by the 
FRCI on 6 July in the village of Guitrozon (5 km from Du&#233;kou&#233;) were found in Bahoubly 
and Fengolo (respectively 13 km and 5 km from Duekou&#233;) half-naked and with their hands 
tied. On 11 July, in the Att&#233;coub&#233;-Sant&#233; neighbourhood of Abidjan, three people were 
killed and a fourth seriously wounded in the arm by a member of the FRCI attached to the 
Groupement Guerrier pour la Dignit&#233; et la Justice en C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The victims were in a 
group of 10 people accosted in an abandoned building by the perpetrator on suspicion of 
stealing a mobile phone. The perpetrator was subsequently arrested and detained at the 
Brigade anti-&#233;meute (BAE) in the Yopougon District.  
</p>
<p>9. The Human Rights Division of ONUCI has brought these issues to the attention of 
the Minister of Justice. On 18 August, the Minister of Justice informed the Human Rights 
Division that he had demanded the immediate arrest of two FRCI members involved in the 
summary execution of two civilians. The Minister of Justice also requested the Human 
Rights Division to refer cases of summary executions by FRCI elements to the judicial 
authorities. There is in addition a positive emerging trend regarding the police bringing </p>


<p>cases of human rights violations committed by the FRCI to the attention of the ONUCI 
Human Rights Division and the judicial authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment 
</b></p>
<p>10. During the reporting period, human rights officers have also received numerous 
allegations of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. In a number of cases, persons 
alleged to have committed crimes were reportedly arrested by FRCI soldiers and subjected 
to physical assault to coerce them into admitting their culpability and/or involvement in the 
crimes. In other cases, FRCI elements upon conducting an arrest inflicted direct physical 
pain on the victims before conditioning their release on fixed sums of money. For example, 
on 16 June, elements of the FRCI reportedly raided Goulikaho and Doukouya villages 
(respectively 135 km and 120 km south of Yamoussoukro) and physically assaulted 
supporters of the FPI. At least 27 people, including 15 women perceived to be FPI militants 
were severely beaten, arrested and detained. As a result of the incident, two of the women, 
who were pregnant, suffered miscarriages. On 5 July in Bouake, FRCI members inflicted 
razor blade cuts on a farmer in a bid to obtain a confession with regards to his alleged 
involvement in a cow theft incident. The farmer suffered burns as melting patches of plastic 
bags were poured on his body.<b> </b>On 22 August, two Burkina Faso nationals, aged 21 and 25 
respectively, suspected of stealing crops and personal items belonging to a villager in 
Sibably (35 km north-east of Duekou&#233;) were arrested and severely ill-treated by six 
members of the FRCI. The two suspects were taken to the FRCI post, where they were 
severely beaten by the FRCI members who also poured hot water on their bodies. Both 
victims sustained serious wounds and were abandoned there without any medical 
assistance. The FRCI members subsequently went to the suspects&#8217; homes, threatened their 
wives with death and then stole FCFA 200,000 (around USD 460) and a motorcycle. The 
victims filed a complaint with the FRCI authorities in Duekou&#233;. However, at the time of 
reporting, none of the perpetrators had been arrested. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Sexual and gender-based violence  
</b></p>
<p>11. There have also been reports of sexual and gender-based violence during this period, 
sometimes concerning children as young as seven and eight years old. While significant 
efforts are being made by both national and international partners to provide the required 
care to victims, access to justice remains a major challenge and needs to be adequately 
addressed. 
</p>
<p>12. During the reporting period, the Human Rights Division documented 14 rapes and 4 
female genital mutilation cases. For example, on 20 May, in Gbokora neighbourhood (4 km 
north of Daloa), four women and two minor girls aged 16-17 were raped by three men 
believed to be members of the FRCI. In an interview with one of the victims Human Rights 
Officers were informed that the perpetrators, who were armed and dressed in military attire, 
had broken into their house and introduced themselves as FRCI members. They separated 
the younger from the older women and took turns in raping the former group. In other 
situations, the violence occurred within the families but the justice system having collapsed, 
the rights of victims remain unaddressed.   
</p>
<p>13. According to the Gender-Based Violence Sub-Cluster&#8217;s assessments conducted in 
the west between 8 and 12 August, there has been a resurgence of gender-based violence in 
Bas-Sassandra and Haut Sassandra regions. One of the worst affected areas is reportedly 
Tabou, where at least 12 victims of rape accessed specialized medical care during the 
month of July alone. Efforts are being made to address this issue in collaboration with the 
Ministries of Health and Social Affairs. </p>


<p><b> D. Arbitrary arrest, detention and acts of extortion 
</b></p>
<p>14. During the reporting period, at least 306 persons were arrested and detained by the 
FRCI in several parts of the country without charges. In most cases, the detainees are 
physically assaulted, dispossessed of their personal belongings and ordered to pay for their 
release. In addition, in order to facilitate the systematic extortion and racketeering of the 
civilian population, some FRCI elements have established the practice of setting up road-
blocks at which travellers were obliged to pay the &#8220;passage fees&#8221;, creating a sense of 
insecurity in some parts of the country. Resistance to this often resulted in physical assault, 
arbitrary arrest and detention. For instance, on 2 July, the President of a transport syndicate 
(Collectif des Syndicats des Transports et Chauffeurs du Bas Sassandra) was arrested and 
physically assaulted with a rifle butt by an FRCI element for refusing to pay the sum of 
FCFA 12,500 (approximately USD 27) at a roadblock. In similar incidents, two drivers 
were physically assaulted on 10 and 19 July respectively in Tiassal&#233; (115 km from 
Yamoussoukro) and Divo (186 km from Abidjan) by FRCI elements for arguing over the 
payment of the &#8220;passage fees&#8221;. One of them was tied and only released after making a 
payment of FCFA 170,000 (approximately USD 340). This pattern of assaults and extortion 
is brewing disillusionment within the population and could lead to violent clashes. 
</p>
<p>15. Armed groups, sometimes affiliated to the Government or with the support of 
members of the FRCI, are reported to have been conducting searches and intimidating the 
population. According to some reports, these actions would be conducted against those 
perceived to be pro-Gbagbo, this determination being made, in some cases, on the basis of 
ethnicity. Issues related to land also contribute to these tensions. For instance, from 17 to 19 
August, Soci&#233;t&#233; de D&#233;veloppement des For&#234;ts Class&#233;es de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (SODEFOR) 
agents, accompanied by two gendarmes and FRCI members, reportedly raided Morokro 
village in the classified forest of Brassu&#233; (25 km from Abengourou). They destroyed, burnt 
and ransacked private homes and confiscated mobile phones, livestock and other personal 
items. The SODEFOR Regional Director in Abengourou claimed that villagers were 
defying SODEFOR authority by illegally planting crops in a protected area. Concerns have 
been raised about the continuing arrest and detention of individuals under the suspicion of 
being pro-Gbabgo supporters or alleged members of pro-Gbabgo militias. The Human 
Rights Division of UNOCI is following up the case with local authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Intercommunity violence and attacks by militia groups 
</b></p>
<p>16. Despite several interventions by the Government to enhance national reconciliation 
and social cohesion within the different communities, especially in the west, inter-
community tensions remain a major challenge. During the reporting period, three separate 
incidents between communities led to the death of at least six people including two Burkina 
Faso nationals. On 6 June, in Lossingu&#233; (97 km east of Odienn&#233;) a cattle breeder was shot 
and killed by unidentified persons after his animals were alleged to have destroyed some 
food crops. On 3 July in Tai Department, two Burkina Faso nationals were killed by a 
group of five unidentified men dressed in civilian and military attire. In a similar case, on 5 
July, three people were killed after the dozos (traditional hunters) attacked some members 
of the guer&#233; ethnic group in Guetuezon (42 km from Daloa). The FRCI was reported to 
have arrested those behind the attacks. The propensity of these to ignite into violent 
confrontations cannot be over-emphasized and demonstrates the need for more concerted 
and immediate action by all partners concerned. 
</p>
<p>17. In the meantime, remnants of the pro-Gbagbo militia groups have continued to pose 
a serious security threat in some areas in the west, undermining respect for human rights in 
the area. For instance, on 19 July, at least nine persons, including a woman, a two-year-old </p>


<p>baby girl and an eight-year-old girl were reportedly killed and seven others wounded in an 
attack by guer&#233; militiamen in Daobly/Ponan (120 km south-east of Duekou&#233;) in Tai 
Department. Among the wounded were three minors, including a girl aged 8 and two boys 
aged 12. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Internally displaced persons and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>18. Many people who were displaced during the post-electoral crisis remain in IDP 
camps and are afraid or unable to return because of the security situation in some 
neighbourhoods of Abidjan and in the Western part of the country. Those still in the camps 
are facing security threats as well as a number of challenges to meeting their basic needs. 
Reports also allege that some IDPs are being forced to leave sites while the conditions for 
return in dignity are not yet in place. 
</p><p> 
19. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR), 
the population of IDPs on sites across five regions of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire continues to fluctuate. 
In Abidjan, the IDP population has reportedly increased by 28 per cent mainly due to 
evictions, with 5,032 IDPs now living on 17 sites. Five sites in the Bingerville, Mafere and 
Yopougon neighbourhoods of Abidjan have closed down, resulting in the eviction of 2,657 
persons while 1,239 IDPs who remain on seven other sites in Cocody, Aboisso and Grand-
Bassam face imminent eviction. The majority of evicted families come from Abobo and 
Yopougon. Their continued stay on sites is explained by perceived insecurity in certain 
neighbourhoods, destruction, looting or occupation of their habitual places of residence. To 
date, a total number of 242,649 people have returned to their zones of origin in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire with more than 155,000 returning during the month of August alone. An estimated 
171,362 Ivorian refugees remain in Liberia after fleeing the country during the post-
electoral violence. In Ghana, the number of Ivorian asylum-seekers stands at 17,023 and the 
number of refugees at about 10,000.  
 
20. A joint assessment mission comprised of the protection cluster members, including 
the Human Rights Division, and the representative of IDPs, conducted in the west (area of 
Tai) on 4 August, has reported continuing population movements within the zone as they 
fear possible new attacks by militia and mercenaries still active in the area.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Arrest, detention and trial of former leaders 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the reporting period, top military commanders of the former regime who are 
alleged to have directly committed and/or have been involved in the commission of human 
rights violations during the crisis were arrested and/or indicted by the Military Prosecutor. 
Notable among them are Generals Dogbo Bl&#233;, Vagba Faussignaux and Allah Kassi, 
respectively, erstwhile Commander of the Republican Guards, Commander of the Navy and 
Commander of the Lokodjoro Naval Base respectively. On 20 August, General Guiai Bi 
Poin, the former commanding officer of the Centre des op&#233;rations de s&#233;curit&#233; (CECOS) 
was also arrested and detained at the Koumassi commando camp in Abidjan by the 
National Gendarmerie following the discovery of four alleged mass graves within the 
premises of the &#201;cole de gendarmerie. Similarly, reports indicate that two army officials, all 
drivers of armoured personnel carriers (APCs), who were alleged to have been involved in 
attacks against women in the Abobo District of Abidjan, on 3 March 2011, have also been 
arrested.  
</p>
<p>22. International arrest warrants have been issued for several other important figures of 
the Gbagbo regime who are currently in hiding, for their alleged involvement in crimes </p>


<p>committed during the post-electoral crisis, including Mr. Charles Bl&#233; Goud&#233;, Mr. Ouattara 
Gnonzi&#233;, former Minister of Communication, Mr. Dosso Charles Rodel, former State 
Secretary for War Victims, Mr. Kouam&#233; S&#233;cr&#233; Richard, President of the General Council in 
Bondoukou and former Minister of Tourism, Mr. Nyamien Messou N&#8217;Guessan, former 
Minister of Labour, Mr. Kon&#233; Katina Justin, former Minister in charge of the Budget, Mr. 
Alphonse Mangly, former General Director of Customs and Mr. Bohoun Bouabr&#233;, member 
of the FPI. 
</p>
<p>23. UNOCI has continued to monitor the detention conditions and treatment of former 
president Gbagbo and some of his close associates who are currently being detained in 
several locations throughout the country.  <b> 
</b> 
24. During his visit by the Special Representative on 4 July, Mr. Gbagbo intimated that 
he was being well treated but complained about limited access to information and his 
lawyers. On 4 August, he informed the Human Rights Division of UNOCI that, contrary to 
the statement made by the authorities that he had been under house arrest, he is in fact in 
24/24 incommunicado detention in a secret villa somewhere in the city of Korhogo. The 
main door of the house is locked and he is confined indoors all the time. He stated that he 
has only been taken to the presidential residence of Korhogo, where he was believed to be 
under house arrest, on a few occasions, such as for visits by the group of elders in April, the 
Minister of Justice, the Special Representative, Mr. Choi, the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Human Rights Division of UNOCI. He also reported that 
some of his lawyers visited him on three occasions and others have reportedly been denied 
visas to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire by the Government. Mr. Gbagbo confirmed that he has not been 
subjected to any physical ill-treatment except the state of isolation to which he is confined, 
the lack of access to an evangelical pastor and the fact that he is not allowed to go for a 
daily walk to improve his health.  
<b> 
</b>25. On 2 August, the Human Rights Division of UNOCI visited Ms. Simone Gbagbo for 
the first time since her transfer from Abidjan to Odienne, in the north-east of the country. 
She reported that she is being well treated and that the conditions of her detention are 
satisfactory. However, Ms. Gbagbo has only limited access to visit certain authorized 
persons and is not allowed to make or receive telephone calls at any time. She does not 
have any contact with her family.  
<b> 
</b>26. In the prison in Bouna, where seven public figures associated with the Gbagbo 
regime are being held, the detainees reported that they had not been subjected to any form 
of ill treatment. They deplored the decision by the Government to freeze their assets as well 
as the fact that since their interrogation by the Public Prosecutor, no charges had been 
brought against them. There are also reports of complaints about a leaking roof, forcing the 
cell&#8217;s five inmates to group themselves at one corner of the cell and also of the isolation to 
which they are subjected, making it impossible for them to communicate with or receive 
visits from family members.   
 
27. With respect to the status of the criminal procedure against Mr. Gbagbo and his 
associates, on 5 August 2011, a judge went to the prison in Bouna to formally charge seven 
public figures close to Mr. Gbagbo with crimes against national integrity, tribalism, 
xenophobia, plotting against State authority, incitement to disturb public order, leading or 
participating in armed groups, incitement to rebellion and misuse of title. One of them was 
also charged with stealing, using weapons and violence, embezzling State revenues, tax 
fraud, looting and crimes against the State economy. On 18 August, the State Prosecutor of 
Abidjan announced the indictment of ex-president Gbagbo and his wife for economic 
crimes. On 13 September, President Ouattara stated that Mr. Gbagbo would be tried for 
economic crimes in the country and that his Government would also request him to be tried </p>


<p>by the International Criminal Court to ensure a transparent trial. In total, 47 pro-Gbagbo 
civilian associates and 62 Pro-Gbagbo military elements have been detained in the northern 
part of the country and several in Abidjan. On 24 August, Guiai Bi Poin was indicted for 
economic crimes, theft, embezzlement, looting and threats to the national economy. <b> 
 
</b>28. On 10 August 2011, UNOCI shared the findings of the detention monitoring 
missions with the Government in order to take the necessary steps to address the issues 
raised by Mr. Gbagbo and his associates. The Government gave reassurances that the 
necessary steps would be taken. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has taken a series of judicial and non-judicial 
measures that are being implemented in order to address the legacy of human rights abuses 
committed in the country, particularly during the post-electoral crisis. These measures 
include criminal prosecutions at the national and the international levels, the establishment 
of the DTRC, and institutional reforms. OHCHR has been working with the Government 
and relevant transitional justice mechanisms including the Special Investigations Unit 
created by the Government within the Prosecutor&#8217;s office, to investigate and prosecute 
alleged perpetrators of human rights violations committed during the electoral crisis.   
</p>
<p>30. According to the Public Prosecutor, inquiries have been carried out into three 
categories of crimes: economic crimes, crimes against the security of the State, and violent 
crimes. For the first category, preliminary investigations ended in May. For the second, 
more than 100 victims or witnesses have reportedly been heard and legal proceedings have 
been instituted against 25 members of the pro-Gbagbo camp, currently detained in 
Boundiali Prison. For the third category, the prosecutor indicated that there are reasons to 
believe, based on testimonies and evidence, that about 3,000 people have been killed and 
3,000 injured in connection with the crisis. A total number of 846 autopsies have been 
conducted to date.  
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR has also been providing support to the DTRC. As a follow-up to the 
request received from Mr. Charles Konan Banny, the president of the DTRC, an OHCHR 
technical team was dispatched to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire from 1 to 6 August to assess the needs of 
the DTRC. The Mission met with a variety of stakeholders, including the President of the 
DTRC and its technical staff, representatives of the Ministries of Human Rights, Justice, 
Defence and Interior, representatives of political parties, NGOs, religious groups, victims, 
and the diplomatic community.  
</p><p> 
32. While the swift establishment of the DTRC represents an important step toward 
achieving the right to truth and reconciliation, some stakeholders have expressed concerns 
about what is perceived as an attempt by the Government to rush the process through 
without proper consideration of the challenges involved and without extensive public 
participation. The OHCHR mission raised a number of issues, including with regard to the 
scope of the mandate as detailed in the Ordinance establishing the Commission with the 
national authorities. In particular, it expressed concerns about the following aspects: there is 
no provision setting out the powers of the Commission, including search and seizure, 
subpoena, access to important documents and imposing penalties for obstruction of 
investigations. There is no provision for reparations, for victim and witness protection, or 
for victim and witness support (e.g. medical, psychosocial) and assistance to enable them to 
provide a statement to the DTRC. Other matters of concern include the issue of financial 
independence, the lack of clarity on the period to be covered by the investigations of the </p>


<p>DTRC, the swift appointment of the president of the DTRC and the adoption of the terms of 
reference of the Commission without prior consultation with the stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>33. Given the positive collaboration with the Government, the legal and institutional 
framework of the Commission can still be improved, including through the drafting of the 
rules and regulations of the Commission and the preparation of the relevant operational 
guidelines. OHCHR recommended the organization of national consultations to boost the 
legitimacy of the Commission and ensure ownership of the process by Ivorians. In addition, 
it was suggested that a conference on transitional justice would provide a platform for more 
consultations in order to seek the views of various stakeholders on transitional justice 
options and to share information on international standards and good practices from the 
region in the area of transitional justice.  
34. The International Criminal Court, in response to a formal request made by President 
Ouattara in May 2011, sent a delegation to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire headed by the Deputy Prosecutor. 
The delegation signed a judicial cooperation agreement with the Government that would 
allow the Office of the Prosecutor to conduct investigations into war crimes and crimes 
against humanity committed since 28 November 2010. The delegation also held separate 
consultations with various stakeholders. Prior to this visit and pursuant to Article 15 of the 
Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court (ICC), the Chief Prosecutor requested 
authorization from ICC judges to open an investigation into war crimes and crimes against 
humanity allegedly perpetrated in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since 28 November 2010. On 17 June, the 
ICC Chief Prosecutor gave public notice that victims of the post-election violence have 30 
days to submit testimonies to the court. 
 
35. The way in which justice is administered is essential to the promotion and protection 
of human rights and the rule of law. A number of stakeholders have referred to the 
difficulties that can arise from selective prosecutions and how these can undermine the 
perception of fairness.<b> </b>The success of current initiatives designed to address impunity in 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire will be tested by whether the process was fair, not by the number of 
prosecutions or convictions. The impartiality of the process will not only guarantee respect 
for the rights of the accused but will enhance efforts aimed at national reconciliation.  
 
36. In this regard, it is essential to ensure justice for victims of all sides of the conflict. 
President Ouattara has consistently expressed his commitment to fight against impunity in a 
fair and balanced way by pursuing all the perpetrators regardless of their status or political 
affiliation. There is a need to ensure that investigations are opened into the allegations of 
gross human rights violations committed by the members of the FRCI. Similarly, the 
ongoing efforts to end impunity in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, undertaken both at the national and the 
international levels, should also be extended to international crimes and gross human rights 
violations committed in the country since 19 September 2002. They were documented by 
the 2004 International Commission of Inquiry set up by the United Nations to investigate 
violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since the 
events of 19 September 2002.   
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>While efforts are being undertaken to enhance national reconciliation and 
social cohesion, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire continues to face serious human rights challenges. 
Impunity of FRCI members for human rights violations is of particular concern. The 
justice system is not fully operational and the transitional justice process is nascent. </b></p>


<p><b>Meanwhile the need to build the capacity of national human rights institutions, 
particularly the security sector institutions, remains crucial. FRCI elements will have 
to be trained in international human rights standards and international humanitarian 
law with a view to curbing the current spate and pattern of violations of right to life, 
physical integrity and liberty and security of persons. The Government is urged to 
take prompt steps to address the current high levels of impunity enjoyed by the FRCI.
