NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
ORGANIZATION
As used in this report, the terms “Tesoro,” “we,” “us” or “our” may refer to Tesoro Corporation, one
or more of its consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole. The words “we,” “us” or
“our” generally include Tesoro Logistics LP (“TLLP”) and its subsidiaries as consolidated
subsidiaries of Tesoro Corporation with certain exceptions where there are transactions or
obligations between TLLP and Tesoro Corporation or its other subsidiaries. When used in
descriptions of agreements and transactions, “TLLP” or the “Partnership” refers to TLLP and its
consolidated subsidiaries.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Tesoro
Corporation and its subsidiaries have been prepared by management without audit according to
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and reflect all
adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results
for the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise
disclosed. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been condensed from the
audited consolidated financial statements at that date. Certain information and notes normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations. However, management believes that the
disclosures presented herein are adequate to present the information fairly. The accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP,
which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We review our estimates on
an ongoing basis. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and
actual results could differ from those estimates. The results of operations for any interim period
are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Certain prior year balances have been
aggregated or disaggregated in order to conform to the current year presentation. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $10 million,
net of tax, due to the recognition of a settlement loss for one of our executive retirement plans and
remeasurement of the pension liability. Due to there being no material impact to accumulated
other comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
consolidated statements of comprehensive income have been omitted.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period presentations to conform to the current
year. In 2016, we revised the process by which we reclassify certain logistics costs, primarily
recognized by TLLP, during consolidation from operating expenses and selling, general and
administrative expense to costs of sales in order to best reflect distribution costs related to
Tesoro’s sale of refined products during the ordinary course of business. This change in process
did not impact current or prior segment operating results, rather we reclassified $46 million and
$121 million from costs of sales and recognized $23 million and $91 million in operating
expenses and $23 million and $30 million in selling, general and administrative expenses of the
condensed statement of consolidated operations for the three and six months ended June 30,
2015, respectively, to conform to current period presentation.
TLLP. Our condensed consolidated financial statements include TLLP, a variable interest entity.
TLLP is a publicly traded limited partnership that was formed to own, operate, develop and
acquire logistics assets. Its assets are integral to the success of Tesoro’s refining and marketing
operations and are used to gather crude oil and natural gas, process natural gas, and distribute,
transport and store crude oil and refined products. TLLP provides us with various terminal
distribution, storage, pipeline transportation, natural gas liquids processing, trucking and
petroleum-coke handling services under long-term, fee-based commercial agreements. Many of
these agreements, with the exception of the storage and transportation services agreement,
contain minimum volume commitments. We do not provide financial or equity support through
any liquidity arrangements or financial guarantees to TLLP.
Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner
of TLLP. We held an approximate 33% and 36% interest in TLLP at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, including the general partner interest (approximately 1.9% and
2% at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively) and all of the incentive distribution
rights. This interest at June 30, 2016 includes 32,445,115 common units and 1,900,515 general
partner units. As the general partner of TLLP, we have the sole ability to direct the activities of
TLLP that most significantly impact its economic performance. We are also considered to be the
primary beneficiary for accounting purposes and are TLLP’s primary customer. In the event TLLP
incurs a loss, our operating results will reflect TLLP’s loss, net of intercompany eliminations.
Under our various long-term, fee-based
6 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
commercial agreements with TLLP, transactions with us accounted for 57% of TLLP’s total
revenues for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 56% of TLLP’s total
revenues for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. On September 25, 2013, we completed the sale of all of our
interest in Tesoro Hawaii, LLC, which operated a 94 thousand barrels per day Hawaii refinery,
retail stations and associated logistics assets (the “Hawaii Business”). The results of operations
for this business have been presented as discontinued operations in the condensed statements
of consolidated operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. There
were no revenues for either the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015. We recorded
a gain for the six months ended June 30, 2016 of $17 million and $11 million before and after tax,
respectively, related to the calendar year 2015 earn-out owed to Tesoro. There was no gain or
loss recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2016. There were $6 million and $4 million
recorded losses before and after tax, respectively, for each of the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015. Cash flows from discontinued operations were $12 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016. There were no cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Unless
otherwise noted, the information in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements
relates to our continuing operations.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSURES
REVENUE RECOGNITION. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with
Customers” (“ASU 2014-09”), which provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from
contracts to provide goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 given the FASB’s recent deferral of ASU
2014-09’s effective date. Entities may choose to early adopt ASU 2014-09 as of the original
effective date. The standard allows for either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective
adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our financial statements and
related disclosures. Based on our initial evaluation, we believe that the standard could impact the
amount and timing of revenues we recognize in our TLLP operating segment as certain revenue
arrangements require TLLP to provide multiple services and may include variable consideration.
CONSOLIDATION. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis” (“ASU 2015-02”). This standard modifies existing consolidation
guidance for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should
consolidate certain legal entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires either a retrospective or a modified
retrospective approach to adoption. We adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective
approach as of January 1, 2016 and performed the required reassessments outlined by the
guidance. For further information on the results of the reassessments, refer to Note 4, Investments
- Equity Method and Joint Ventures.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Simplifying
the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments” (“ASU 2015-16”). The standard requires
an acquirer to recognize the cumulative impact of adjustments to provisional purchase price
amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period, in which the
adjustment amounts are determined. The standard also requires an entity to present separately
on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in
current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods
if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU
2015-16 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and must
be applied prospectively to adjustments that occur after the effective date. We adopted this
guidance as of January 1, 2016 with no impact to our financial statements.
LEASES. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” (“ASU 2016-02”), which
improves transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize
a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. It also requires
additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires a modified retrospective
approach to adoption. Early adoption is permitted. At this time, we are evaluating the potential
impact of this standard on our financial statements.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
“Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”), which
simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions
including accounting for income taxes, cash flow presentation of tax impacts, forfeitures, and
liability versus equity accounting due to statutory tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 is
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption
permitted. As of January 1, 2016, we early adopted ASU 2016-09 and with respect to the
guidance on forfeitures, we have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant to
account for the estimated number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be
rendered. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had a $13 million impact for the three months ended
March 31, 2016 resulting in a lower effective tax rate and immaterial changes to our cash flow
presentation. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized an additional benefit
of $3 million related to additional share vestings during the quarter.

We recorded a lower of cost or market reserve adjustment to cost of sales of $143 million and
$359 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for our crude oil, refined
products, oxygenates and by-product inventories to adjust carrying value of our inventories to
reflect replacement cost as of those reporting dates. We reverse any lower of cost or market
reserve in the subsequent period because the inventories are sold or used and then perform a
complete lower of cost or market assessment of ending inventories at the end of each reporting
period to determine if a reserve is required.

We capitalize interest as part of the cost of major projects during the construction period.
Capitalized interest totaled $6 million and $9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and $12 million and $18 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and is recorded as a reduction to net interest and financing costs in our
condensed statements of consolidated operations.
ACQUISITIONS
GREAT NORTHERN MIDSTREAM. On January 8, 2016, we closed the acquisition of Great
Northern Midstream LLC, a crude oil logistics provider which owns and operates a crude oil
pipeline and gathering system, along with transportation, storage and rail loading facilities in the
Williston Basin of North Dakota. The acquisition includes a 97-mile crude oil pipeline, a
proprietary 28-mile gathering system in the core of the Bakken, and a facility that has capacity of
154 thousand barrels per day (“Mbpd”) for rail loading and 657,000 barrels of storage in Fryburg,
North Dakota. This acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated financial
statements.
FLINT HILLS RESOURCES. On June 20, 2016, we closed the acquisition of Flint Hills
Resources’ (“FHR”) wholesale marketing and logistics assets in Anchorage and Fairbanks,
Alaska. This acquisition includes all FHR’s wholesale fuel marketing contracts in Alaska and an
Anchorage terminal with 580,000 barrels of storage capacity, a truck rack, and rail loading
capability. In addition, the acquisition includes a Fairbanks airport terminal that includes 22,500
barrels of jet fuel storage and a truck rack, as well as a multi-year terminalling agreement at
FHR’s North Pole terminal, which will provide efficient rail offload capabilities and provide
access to Alaska’s interior. This acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated
financial statements.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
DAKOTA PRAIRIE REFINING. On June 28, 2016, we acquired Dakota Prairie Refining, LLC,
which owns a refinery near Dickinson, North Dakota, with strategic access to advantaged
Bakken crude oil and is located just 100 miles west of the Tesoro Mandan Refinery. This
acquired refinery has a crude oil capacity of 20 thousand barrels per day and produces ultra-low
sulfur diesel, naphtha and atmospheric residuals. Tesoro plans to continue to market the ultra-
low sulfur diesel to local customers and utilize the naphtha and atmospheric residuals in its
integrated value chain system. This acquisition was immaterial to our condensed consolidated
financial statements.
NOTE 4 – INVESTMENTS - EQUITY METHOD AND JOINT VENTURES
For each of the following investments, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
each of these investments through our participation in the management committees, which make
all significant decisions. However, since we have equal or proportionate influence over each
committee as a joint interest partner and all significant decisions require consent of the other
investor(s) without regard to our economic interest, we have determined that these entities should
not be consolidated and apply the equity method of accounting with respect to our investments in
each entity.
•
•
WATSON COGENERATION COMPANY (“Watson”). We own a 51% interest in Watson, which
produces steam and electricity at a facility located at our Los Angeles refinery. Our transactions
with Watson, which do not have intra-entity profits requiring elimination, consist of sales of fuel
gas and water, purchases of steam and electricity and charges for general and administrative
support.
VANCOUVER ENERGY. We own 50% of a joint venture with Savage Companies to construct,
own and operate a unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at Port of Vancouver, USA
(the “Vancouver Energy” terminal) with a total capacity of 360 Mbpd allowing for the delivery of
cost-advantaged North American crude oil to the U.S. West Coast.
RENDEZVOUS GAS SERVICES, L.L.C. (“RGS”). TLLP has a 78% interest in RGS, which owns
and operates the infrastructure that transports gas from certain fields to several re-delivery points
in southwestern Wyoming, including natural gas processing facilities that are owned by TLLP or
a third party. Prior to 2016, Tesoro and TLLP consolidated RGS, however, upon the
reassessment performed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2015-02 as of January 1,
2016, we determined RGS represents a variable interest entity to TLLP for which we are not the
primary beneficiary. Under the limited liability company agreement, we do not have voting rights
commensurate with our economic interest due to veto rights available to our partner in RGS.
Certain business decisions, including, but not limited to, decisions with respect to significant
expenditures or contractual commitments, annual budgets, material financings, dispositions of
assets or amending the members’ gas servicing agreements, require unanimous approval of the
members.
THREE RIVERS GATHERING, LLC (“TRG”). TLLP owns a 50% interest in TRG which operates
natural gas gathering assets within the southeastern Uinta Basin and is primarily supported by
long-term, fee-based gas gathering agreements with minimum volume commitments.
UINTAH BASIN FIELD SERVICES, L.L.C. (“UBFS”). TLLP owns a 38% interest in UBFS which
owns and operates the natural gas gathering infrastructure located in the southeastern Uinta
Basin and is supported by long-term, fee-based gas gathering agreements that contain firm
throughput commitments, which generate fees whether or not the capacity is used, and is
operated by TLLP.

The reassessment of the investments performed by TLLP resulted in the deconsolidation of
RGS and the reporting of RGS as an equity method investment. TLLP recognized an increase
of $295 million to equity method investments as of January 1, 2016 as a result of the
deconsolidation in addition to a cumulative effect reduction to opening equity of $2 million
related to the difference in earnings under the equity method of accounting in prior periods.
The carrying amount of our investment in RGS exceeded the underlying equity in net assets
by $138 million at June 30, 2016.

NOTE 5 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, our profit margins, earnings and cash flows are impacted by
the timing, direction and overall change in pricing for commodities used throughout our
operations. We use non-trading derivative instruments to manage our exposure to the following:
•
price risks associated with the purchase or sale of feedstocks, refined products and energy
supplies related to our refineries, terminals, marketing fuel inventory and customers;
•price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels;
•future emission credit requirements; and
•exchange rate fluctuations on our purchases of Canadian crude oil.
Our accounting for derivative instruments depends on whether the underlying commodity will be
used or sold in the normal course of business. For contracts where the crude oil or refined
products are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business, we apply the normal
purchase normal sale exception and follow the accrual method of accounting. All other derivative
instruments are recorded at fair value using mark-to-market accounting.
Our derivative instruments include forward purchase and sale contracts (“Forward Contracts”),
exchange-traded futures (“Futures Contracts”), over-the-counter swaps, including those cleared
on an exchange (“Swap Contracts”), options (“Options”), and over-the-counter options (“OTC
Option Contracts”). Forward Contracts are agreements to buy or sell the commodity at a
predetermined price at a specified future date. Futures Contracts are standardized agreements,
traded on a futures exchange, to buy or sell the commodity at a predetermined price at a
specified future date. Options provide the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the commodity
at a specified price in the future. Swap Contracts and OTC Option Contracts require cash
settlement for the commodity based on the difference between a contracted fixed or floating price
and the market price on the settlement date. Certain of these contracts require cash collateral to
be received or paid if our asset or liability position, respectively, exceeds specified thresholds.
We believe that we have minimal credit risk with respect to our counterparties.
The following table presents the fair value of our derivative instruments as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The fair value amounts below are presented on a gross basis and do not
reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of our master netting
arrangements including cash collateral on deposit with, or received from, brokers. We offset the
recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty in our financial statements when a legal right of offset exists. As a result, the asset
and liability amounts below will not agree with the amounts presented in our condensed
consolidated balance sheets.

June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had provided cash collateral amounts of $80

collateral amounts are netted with mark-to-market derivative assets.

NOTE 6 – FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We classify financial assets and liabilities according to the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets
and liabilities classified as level 1 instruments are valued using quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices, such as liquidity, that
are observable for the asset or liability. Our level 2 instruments include derivatives valued using
market quotations from independent price reporting agencies, third-party brokers and commodity
exchange price curves that are corroborated with market data. Level 3 instruments are valued
using significant unobservable inputs that are not supported by sufficient market activity. We do
not have any financial assets or liabilities classified as level 3 at June 30, 2016 or December 31,
2015.
Our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivative
instruments. Additionally, our financial liabilities include obligations for Renewable Identification
Numbers (“RINs”) and cap and trade emission credits for the state of California (together with
RINs, our “Environmental Credit Obligations”). See Note 5 for further information on our
derivative instruments. Our Environmental Credit Obligations represent the estimated fair value
amount at each balance sheet date for which we do not have sufficient RINs and California cap
and trade credits to satisfy our obligations to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)
and the state of California, respectively. RINs are assigned to biofuels produced or imported into
the U.S. as required by the EPA, which sets annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels that
must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the U.S. As a producer of petroleum
transportation fuels, we are required to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that
will meet the EPA’s quota. We must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy the requirement
if we are unable to blend at that rate. Our liability for cap and trade emission credits for the state
of California represent the deficit of credits to satisfy emission reduction requirements mandated
in California’s Assembly Bill 32 for each period which stationary or transportation fuel carbon
emissions exceed the level allowed by the regulation.

Certain of our derivative contracts, under master netting arrangements, include both asset and
liability positions. We offset both the fair value amounts and any related cash collateral
amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty
when there is a legally enforceable right and an intention to settle net or simultaneously. As of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had provided cash collateral amounts of $80
(a)
million and $12 million, respectively, related to our unrealized derivative positions. Cash
collateral amounts are netted with mark-to-market derivative assets.
We believe the carrying value of our other financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities approximate fair value.
Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term
duration of the instruments and the expected continued insignificance of bad debt expense,
which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The borrowings under the Tesoro
Corporation revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), the TLLP senior secured
revolving credit agreement (the “TLLP Revolving Credit Facility”) and the secured TLLP drop
down credit facility (the “TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility”), which include variable interest rates,
approximate fair value. The fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on prices from recent trade
activity and is categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of our debt
were approximately $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, and the fair values of our debt were approximately $4.8 billion and $4.1 billion at
June 30, 2016 and

Borrowing base is the lesser of the amount of the periodically adjusted borrowing base or the
agreement’s total capacity of $3.0 billion.
TESORO CORPORATION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. Our Revolving Credit Facility
provides for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically
adjusted borrowing base, which consists of Tesoro’s eligible cash and cash equivalents,
receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving
Credit Facility’s total capacity of $3.0 billion. We had unused credit availability of approximately
100% of the eligible borrowing base at June 30, 2016. Our Revolving Credit Facility is
guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries, excluding TLGP, TLLP
and its subsidiaries, and certain foreign subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of
Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries’ crude oil and refined product inventories, cash and
receivables.
The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit
agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. Our uncommitted letter of credit agreements had $24
million outstanding as of June 30, 2016. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements
incur fees ranging from 0.40% to 0.90% and are secured by the crude oil inventories for which
they are issued. Capacity under these letter of credit agreements is available on an uncommitted
basis and can be terminated by either party at any time.
TLLP REVOLVING CREDITY FACILITY AND DROPDOWN CREDIT FACILITY. The TLLP
secured Revolving Credit Facility provides for total loan availability of $600 million as of June 30,
2016. The TLLP secured Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP,
and is guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries, with the exception of certain non-wholly owned
subsidiaries, and secured by substantially all of TLLP’s assets. Borrowings are available under
the TLLP secured Revolving Credit Facility up to the total loan availability of the facility. TLLP
had no borrowings outstanding under the TLLP secured Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in the
full loan availability of the borrowing capacity as of June 30, 2016.
14 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Additionally, the secured TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility provides for total loan availability of
$1.0 billion as of June 30, 2016. The primary use of proceeds under this facility will be to fund its
asset acquisitions. The terms, covenants and restrictions under this facility are substantially the
same as the secured TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. There was $239 million of borrowings
outstanding under the TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility, resulting in a total unused loan availability
of $761 million or 76% of the borrowing capacity, as of June 30, 2016. The weighted average
interest rate for borrowings under the TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility was 4.51% at June 30,
2016.
The total aggregate available facility limits for the secured TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and the
secured TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2016. TLLP is allowed to
request the loan availability for both the secured TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and the secured
TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility be increased up to an aggregate of $2.1 billion, subject to
receiving increased commitments from the lenders. The secured TLLP Revolving Credit Facility
and the secured TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility ratably share collateral comprised primarily of
TLLP property, plant, and equipment and both facilities mature on January 29, 2021. In addition,
upon an upgrade of TLLP’s corporate family rating to investment grade, certain covenants and
restrictions under each facility will automatically and permanently be eliminated or improved.
TLLP SENIOR NOTES ISSUANCE. On May 9, 2016, TLLP completed a registered offering of
$250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (“2021 Notes”) and
$450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (“2024 Notes”). TLLP
used the proceeds of the offering of the 2021 Notes to repay amounts then outstanding under the
TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility and the proceeds of the offering of the 2024 Notes to repay
amounts outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and for general partnership
purposes.
The 2021 Notes were issued under the same indenture governing the existing $550 million of
TLLP’s 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 issued in August 2013 and have the same terms as
those senior notes. The 2021 Notes have no sinking fund requirements. TLLP may redeem some
or all of the 2021 Notes, prior to October 15, 2016, at a make-whole price plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any. On or after October 15, 2016, the 2021 Notes may be redeemed at
premiums equal to 4.594% through October 15, 2017; 3.063% from October 15, 2017 through
October 15, 2018; 1.531% from October 15, 2018 through October 15, 2019; and at par thereafter,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. TLLP will have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
principal amount at 106.125% of face value with proceeds from certain equity issuances through
October 15, 2016. The 2021 Notes are unsecured and guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries,
except Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp., the co-issuer, and are non-recourse to Tesoro, except for
TLGP, and contain customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuance of non-
investment grade securities.
The 2024 Notes have no sinking fund requirements. TLLP may redeem some or all of the 2024
Notes, prior to May 1, 2019, at a make-whole price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or
after May 1, 2019, the 2024 Notes may be redeemed at premiums equal to 4.781% through May
1, 2020; 3.188% from May 1, 2020 through May 1, 2021; 1.594% from May 1, 2021 through
May 1, 2022; and at par thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest. TLLP will have the right to
redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at 106.375% of face value with proceeds
from certain equity issuances through May 1, 2019. The 2024 Notes are unsecured and
guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries, except Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp., the co-issuer,
and are non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP, and contain customary terms, events of default
and covenants for an issuance of non-investment grade securities.
TLLP REPAYMENTS. On February 3, 2016, TLLP repaid the full amount of its unsecured term
loan facility (“TLLP Unsecured Term Loan Facility”), including accrued interest, with proceeds
drawn from the TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility. All commitments under the TLLP Unsecured
Term Loan Facility were terminated effective with the repayment.
TLLP SENIOR NOTES EXCHANGE. On February 26, 2016, TLLP commenced an offer to
exchange (the “Exchange”) its existing unregistered 5.50% Senior Notes due 2019 (“2019
Notes”) and 6.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (“2022 Notes”) (together, “Unregistered Notes”) for an
equal principal amount of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2019 and 6.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the
“Exchange Notes”), respectively, that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. On April 14, 2016, the Exchange was completed for all of the 2019 Notes and
substantially all of the 2022 Notes. The terms of the Exchange Notes are identical in all material
respects (including principal amount, interest rate, maturity and redemption rights) to the
Unregistered Notes for which they were exchanged, except that the Exchange Notes generally
are not subject to transfer restrictions. The Exchange fulfills all of the requirements of the
registration rights agreements for the Unregistered Notes.

NOTE 9 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental remediation
liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal
and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these
accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably
estimated. Additionally, we have recognized environmental remediation liabilities assumed in
past acquisitions from the prior owners that include amounts estimated for site cleanup and
monitoring activities arising from operations at refineries, certain terminals and pipelines, and
retail stations prior to the dates of our acquisitions. Our environmental accruals are based on
estimates including engineering assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change
and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available.
Our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled $232 million and $255 million at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, including $24 million and $33 million for TLLP,
respectively. These accruals include $177 million and $192 million at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, related to amounts estimated for site cleanup activities arising
from operations at our Martinez refinery and operations of assets acquired from BP’s integrated
Southern California refining, marketing and logistics business (“Los Angeles Acquisition”) prior to
their respective acquisition dates. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial
activities that may be required at the Martinez refinery and for assets acquired in the Los Angeles
Acquisition and it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs
for site cleanup activities as more information becomes available. The environmental
remediation liabilities assumed in the Los Angeles Acquisition include amounts estimated for site
cleanup activities and monitoring activities arising from operations at the Carson refinery, certain
terminals and pipelines, and retail stations prior to our acquisition on June 1, 2013. These
estimates for environmental liabilities are based
16 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
on third-party assessments and available information. Our estimates for site cleanup activities
reflect amounts for which we are responsible under applicable cost-sharing arrangements.
On July 10, 2015, a federal court issued an order denying coverage pursuant to insurance
policies for environmental remediation liabilities at our Martinez refinery and those liabilities are
included in our accruals above. The insurer had filed a declaratory relief action challenging
coverage of the primary policy assigned to us when we acquired the refinery. The policies
provide for coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-
insurance. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries under the policies and have
appealed the order.
OTHER CONTINGENCIES
On July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA lodged a complaint along
with a Consent Decree with the Western District Court of Texas (the “Court”). Subject to a 30-day
public comment period, the Consent Decree is the final settlement of the EPA’s allegations that
we violated certain Clean Air Act regulations at our Alaska, Washington, Martinez, Mandan and
Utah refineries as well as the notices of violations received from the EPA between 2005 and
2011 alleging violations of various provisions of the Clean Air Act at our refineries. The
settlement also resolves similar allegations relating to our former Hawaii refinery, which we sold
in September 2013, and have recognized $46 million as expense associated with discontinued
operations prior to 2016 specifically related to the projects required at our former Hawaii refinery.
Upon final approval by the Court, terms of the Consent Decree require Tesoro to spend material
capital expenditures. Prior to 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, we have
capitalized approximately $210 million and $33 million, respectively, for capital projects to satisfy
requirements of the Consent Decree, including amounts capitalized for interest and labor. These
expenditures have not been material to our financial position or liquidity in any previous year.
The remaining capital expenditures will be primarily spent in 2016 and 2017 with additional
amounts through 2019. Additionally, the Consent Decree imposes a fine, which is not material to
our financial statements and for which we have previously accrued, and certain funding of
community projects that will be expensed as incurred in future periods. All remaining
expenditures associated with the Consent Decree will not have a material impact on our liquidity,
financial position or results of operations.
OTHER MATTERS
In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and
governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and
sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have
not established accruals for these types of matters unless a loss is probable, and the amount of
loss is currently estimable.
TAX. We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly
enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result
in increased expenditures in the future. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign
taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in
claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. However, we believe that resolution of any
such claim(s) would not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of
operations.

respectively, primarily for stock option exercises under our equity-based compensation plans.
See Note 11 for more information on stock-based compensation.
As a result of the reassessment performed in conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2015-02,
we deconsolidated RGS, causing the derecognition of noncontrolling interest for the reporting
of RGS as an equity method investment.
Includes the closing of TLLP’s registered public offering of 6,325,000 common units

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share if the effect of including such securities in the calculation would have been
anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities were 0.4 million and 0.6 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 0.3 million and 0.4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
SHARE REPURCHASES
We are authorized by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) to purchase shares of our common
stock in open market transactions at our discretion. The Board’s authorization has no time limit
and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases of our common stock can also be
made to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards and to meet our
obligations under employee benefit and compensation plans, including the exercise of stock
options and vesting of restricted stock and to fulfill other stock compensation requirements.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we purchased approximately 1.3 million
and 3.1 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million and $269 million,
respectively.
CASH DIVIDENDS
We paid cash dividends totaling $61 million and $121 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, based on a $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend on common
stock. We paid cash dividends totaling $53 million and $107 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively, based on a $0.425 per share quarterly cash dividend on
common stock. On August 3, 2016, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.55 per share
payable on September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2016.

The income tax effect recognized in the income statement for stock-based compensation was a

respectively, and a benefit of $18 million and $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Included in the tax benefit of $6 million and $18 million for the three and
six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, was $3 million and $16 million, respectively, of
tax benefit attributable to excess tax benefits from exercises and vestings that occurred during the
period, the effects of which are recorded to the income statement pursuant to ASU 2016-09. The
reduction in current taxes payable recognized from tax deductions resulting from exercises and
vestings under all of our stock-based compensation arrangements totaled $6 million and $9
million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $36 million and
$63 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

NOTE 12 – OPERATING SEGMENTS
Our refining segment owns and operates seven petroleum refineries located in California,
Washington, Alaska, North Dakota and Utah that manufacture gasoline and gasoline
blendstocks, jet fuel, diesel fuel, residual fuel oil and other refined products. We sell these refined
products, together with refined products purchased from third parties, to our marketing segment
through terminal facilities and other locations and opportunistically export refined products to
foreign markets. TLLP’s assets and operations include certain crude oil gathering assets, natural
gas gathering and processing assets and crude oil and refined products terminalling and
transportation assets acquired from Tesoro and other third parties. Revenues from the TLLP
segment are generated by charging fees for gathering crude oil and natural gas, for processing
natural gas, and for terminalling, transporting and storing crude oil, and refined products.
Tesoro’s marketing business supplies gasoline and diesel across 16 states through both
branded and unbranded marketing channels. We utilize various operating models in the
operation of our retail stations. Since we do not have significant operations in foreign countries,
revenue generated and long-lived assets located in foreign countries are not material to our
operations.
We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on segment operating income.
Segment operating income includes those revenues and expenses that are directly attributable to
management of the respective segment. TLLP and marketing revenues include intersegment
transactions with our refining segment. Corporate depreciation and corporate general and
administrative expenses are excluded from segment operating income.

NOTE 13 – CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Separate condensed consolidating financial information of Tesoro Corporation (the “Parent”),
subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors is presented below. At June 30, 2016, Tesoro and
certain subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our 4.250% Senior
Notes due 2017, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022, and 5.125% Senior Notes due 2024. TLLP, in
which we had a 33% ownership interest as of June 30, 2016, and other subsidiaries have not
guaranteed these obligations. As a result of these guarantee arrangements, we are required to
present the following condensed consolidating financial information, which should be read in
conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto. This information is provided as an alternative to providing separate financial statements
for guarantor subsidiaries. Separate financial statements of Tesoro’s subsidiary guarantors are
not included because the guarantees are full and unconditional and these subsidiary guarantors
are 100% owned and are jointly and severally liable for Tesoro’s outstanding senior notes. The
information is presented using the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries.
Certain intercompany and intracompany transactions between subsidiaries are presented gross
and eliminated in the consolidating adjustments column. Additionally, the results of operations of
the Hawaii Business have been reported as discontinued operations in these condensed
consolidating statements of operations and comprehensive income for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and three and six months end June 30, 2015.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward-
looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-
Looking Statements” section for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those projected in these statements. This section should be read in conjunction
with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW
STRATEGY AND GOALS
As the leading integrated refining, marketing, and logistics company in our strategic foot print, we
are driven to create value. We underpin our approach to our value creation by driving business
improvements and an enduring commitment to execution. Across all of our businesses, we seek
to leverage a highly integrated business model to achieve our vision through the following
strategic priorities:
•
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS. Continuously improving safety,
compliance, reliability, system improvements and cost leadership;
VALUE CHAIN OPTIMIZATION. Enhancing margin capture through our supply and trading
•
•
•activities, optimization of our integrated businesses and customer focus;
FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE. Maintaining a strong financial position by exercising capital discipline
and focusing on a balanced use of free cash flow;
VALUE-DRIVEN GROWTH. Extending our capabilities and growing earnings through growth in
our logistics and marketing businesses and other strategic opportunities accretive to
shareholder value; and
HIGH PERFORMING CULTURE. Fostering a performance-based culture that is committed to
building leadership at all levels of the organization and across our value chain with employees
from diverse backgrounds and experiences who are accountable for delivering on our
commitments.
•
We take a principle-based approach to conducting our business seeking to create shared value
for key stakeholders such as employees, communities, business partners, government, and the
environment. We believe our value chain creates a competitive advantage by maximizing
business integration across our different regions through the combination of refining, marketing
and logistics assets. Our marketing assets provide a secure and ratable offtake of high value
gasoline and diesel production from our refineries, our logistics assets and in-region placement
allow us to minimize transportation costs and maximize our overall performance. Our waterborne
and land-based logistics assets enable system optimization across our businesses and between
our regions. Tesoro Logistics LP’s (“TLLP”) gathering logistics assets also allow us to capture
integrated crude oil and natural gas commercial opportunities in the mid-continent basins.

SYNERGY AND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT OBJECTIVES
Tesoro has a proven track record of delivering on our commitments by focusing on our strategic
priorities, business improvement efforts and growth in our logistics and marketing businesses.
Our plans, as presented in December 2015, are to deliver an additional $400 to $500 million of
annual improvements to operating income during 2016. These improvements include $200 to
$250 million in Refining, $175 to $200 million in Logistics and $25 to $50 million in Marketing
reflecting improvements expected to be achieved within a twelve month period following the
completion of each initiative. Through the first half of the year, estimated Refining improvements
are trending towards the high end of the range, Marketing improvements are on track with full
year expectations and estimated Logistics improvements are tracking slightly below the range,
primarily attributable to slower than expected organic growth due to the weak commodity price
environment. Our 2016 achievements included the following:
•Los Angeles improvements include:
◦Crude optimizations from sourcing new crudes;
◦Crude blending capabilities at the Carson crude terminal that resulted in higher throughput
volumes;
◦New cargo sharing with our Martinez refinery;
◦Improved pipeline connectivity between the Los Angeles refinery sites; and
◦West Coast integration of naphtha and gasoline blendstocks.
Re-distributed in-bound crude oil to our Kenai refinery during maintenance and turnaround
activities at our Anacortes refinery to optimize our west coast system; and
•Benefit from the completed second phase of the Salt Lake City Refinery Expansion project.
•
CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS
DOMESTIC. The markets in which we operate have continued to experience volatility. The price
of Brent crude oil (“Brent”) in the second quarter began below $40 per barrel and ended near $50
per barrel. Supply outages in Canada and Africa were supportive to crude prices while
uncertainty over global demand growth and increased production in the Middle East and Russia
were of concern. The decline in domestic U.S. crude oil production resulted in continued narrow
U.S. domestic crude differentials
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 31
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
compared to prior periods. In addition, supply outages, changing logistical infrastructure and
improving domestic macroeconomic conditions have influenced all portions of our business.
In the markets in which we operate, product margins continued to reflect global fundamentals as
gasoline demand remained strong and diesel demand was lower than prior expectations. On a
national level, inventories of both gasoline and diesel were above the 5-year range though
stronger gasoline demand mitigated the impact of the absolute level of inventory and was within
the 5-year range in terms of days-of-supply. However, diesel inventories were high on both an
absolute and days-of-supply basis. With diesel inventories reflecting a global excess, the global
market value of diesel was substantially lower than historical norms and weighed heavily on
product cracks even though regional fundamentals were near normal levels. Across the quarter,
gasoline margins approached seasonal norms, although diesel margins were substantially
lower. We continue to monitor U.S. and global demand trends and the impact of changes in
market prices and fundamentals on our business.
GLOBAL. The market for crude oil, natural gas and refined products was affected by changes in
economic conditions and the associated supply and demand balance changes. Product values
and crude oil prices were set by the market and are outside our control. We expect global market
conditions to drive continued volatility in our markets. During the second quarter, the global
energy markets experienced volatility from uncertainty on growth in the developing regions of the
world and the resulting consequences of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.
Diesel experienced lower prices due to a global excess of diesel inventories as a result of higher
production and weaker demand.
TESORO LOGISTICS LP
TLLP was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets to gather crude oil and
natural gas, to distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products and to process and
fractionate natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”). Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), a
wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, serves as the general partner of TLLP. We held an
approximate 33% interest in TLLP at June 30, 2016, including an approximate 1.9% general
partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”). In the first six months of 2016,
57% of TLLP’s revenue was derived from us primarily under various long-term, fee-based
commercial agreements that generally include minimum volume commitments.
TLLP’s strategy, which has remained constant, is to grow earnings through four ways by:
•Focusing on stable, fee-based business;
•Optimizing our existing asset base;
•Pursuing organic expansion opportunities; and
•Continued growth through strategic acquisitions.
Through our ownership of TLLP and TLLP’s continued growth, we expect the logistics operations
to maximize the integrated value of assets within the midstream and downstream value chain.
This includes creating shareholder value through the lower cost of capital available to TLLP as a
limited partnership and receipt of TLLP’s quarterly distributions. As the distributions per unit
increase, our proportion of the total distribution will grow at an accelerated rate due to our
incentive distribution rights. We believe TLLP is well positioned to achieve its primary business
objectives and execute business strategies based on its long-term fee-based contracts,
relationship with us, assets positioned in the high demand Williston Basin, and financial flexibility
provided by its balanced capital structure, revolving credit facility capacity, dropdown credit
facility, ability to access equity capital markets through its continuous issuance program and
financial support from us. Refer to the “Capital Resources and Liquidity” section for further
discussion of resources available to TLLP.
•
Relative to these goals, in 2016, TLLP intends to continue to implement this strategy and has
completed or announced plans to:
expand TLLP’s assets on its crude oil gathering and transportation system, located in the
Bakken Region (the “High Plains System”) in support of growing third-party demand for
transportation services and Tesoro’s increased demand for Bakken crude oil in the mid-
continent and west coast refining systems, including:
◦further expanding crude oil storage and transportation capacity and capability of TLLP’s
common carrier pipeline in North Dakota and Montana;
◦expanding TLLP’s gathering footprint in the Bakken Region, including crude oil, natural gas and
water, to enhance and improve overall basin logistic efficiencies;
◦adding other origin and destination points on the High Plains System to increase volumes; and
◦pursuing strategic assets in TLLP’s footprint including potential acquisition from Tesoro.
32 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
◦
•
expand and optimize TLLP’s natural gas gathering and processing assets located in the Green
River Basin, Uinta Basin and Vermillion Basin in the states of Utah, Colorado and Wyoming
including:
increase compression on its systems in the Green River and Vermillion basins to enhance
natural gas volumes recovered from existing wells and support potential new drilling activity;
and
◦expand its gathering footprint and increase compression capabilities in the Uinta basin to
increase volumes on its gathering systems and through its processing assets.
•grow TLLP’s terminalling and transportation business across its Western U.S. footprint through:
◦increasing its terminalling volumes by expanding capacity and growing third-party services at
certain terminals;
◦optimize Tesoro volumes and grow third-party throughput at its terminalling and transportation
assets; and
◦pursuing strategic assets in TLLP’s footprint including completing the acquisition of Tesoro's
recently acquired terminalling assets from Flint Hills Resources in Alaska.
ALASKA LOGISTICS ASSETS PURCHASE. Effective July 1, 2016, TLLP entered into an
agreement to purchase certain terminalling and storage assets owned by Tesoro for total
consideration of $444 million to be completed in two phases. On July 1, 2016, TLLP completed
the acquisition of the first phase consisting of tankage with a shell capacity of approximately 3.5
million barrels, related equipment and ancillary facilities used for the operations at Tesoro’s
Kenai Refinery. The second phase purchase consists of refined product terminals in Anchorage
and Fairbanks with combined storage capacity of over 600,000 barrels, expected throughput of
approximately 10 thousand barrels per day (“Mbpd”) and rail loading of 7 Mbpd. Consideration
paid for the first phase was $266 million, which comprised of approximately $239 million in cash,
financed with the borrowings under TLLP’s secured dropdown credit agreement (the “TLLP
Dropdown Credit Facility”), and TLLP’s issuance of equity to Tesoro with a fair value of $27
million. Consideration for the second phase is expected to be $178 million, comprised of
approximately $160 million in cash, expected to be financed with borrowings under the TLLP
Dropdown Credit Facility, and TLLP issuing equity securities with a fair value of approximately
$18 million.
Total market value of TLLP units held by Tesoro was $1.6 billion at both June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, Tesoro held 32,445,115 common units at a market value
of $49.53 per unit based on the closing unit price as of that date. At December 31, 2015, Tesoro

VANCOUVER ENERGY
Consistent with our strategic priorities to drive value chain optimization and capture value-driven
growth, we entered into a joint venture in 2013 with Savage Companies to construct, own and
operate a unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at Port of Vancouver, USA with a total
capacity of 360 Mbpd allowing for the delivery of cost-advantaged North American crude oil to
the U.S. West Coast. The entire project scope is estimated to cost $210 million. While there is the
potential that additional scope changes may result from the final Energy Facility Site Evaluation
Council (“EFSEC”) review, we do not expect those changes will be material to the estimated
costs.
The project is progressing through the EFSEC permitting process in the state of Washington.
EFSEC released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in November 2015 and concluded
adjudicative hearings on July 29, 2016. We expect EFSEC will soon begin deliberating its
recommendation to the governor of Washington. The joint venture will begin construction of the
facilities upon the governor’s approval of the project and issuance of permits. Project construction
is estimated to take nine to twelve months, however initial operations are expected to begin
within a few months of construction start.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented
below. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, together with the
following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our
historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future
performance.
ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY
The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets
acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers
between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of our refining and
TLLP segments contained herein have been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical
results of the assets acquired in the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each
acquisition for all periods presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined
financial results of the TLLP predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”). We refer to the TLLP
Predecessor and, prior to the acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as
“TLLP’s Predecessors.”
NON-GAAP MEASURES
As a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses certain
“non-GAAP” measures to analyze our results of operations, assess internal performance against
budgeted and forecasted amounts and evaluate future impacts to our financial performance as a
result of capital investments, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic projects.
During the second quarter of 2016, management revised its internal and external use of non-
GAAP measures to eliminate any adjustments to U.S. GAAP net earnings and earnings before
interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense (“EBITDA”) for items
previously considered “special items.” We believe our revised presentation of net earnings and
EBITDA and descriptions of significant activities impacting U.S. GAAP net earnings are sufficient
to convey our financial performance to the users of our financial statements.
Following these changes, our non-GAAP measures include the following:
•Financial non-GAAP measure of EBITDA, as defined above; and
Debt to capitalization ratio excluding TLLP, reflects the ratio achieved by dividing the net result
of our consolidated debt less all debt owed by TLLP (both net of unamortized issuance costs) by
the sum of our consolidated debt less TLLP’s total debt (both net of unamortized issuance costs)
and our total equity less noncontrolling interest associated with the public ownership of TLLP.
•
We present the measures defined above because investors, analysts, lenders and ratings
agencies may use these measures to help analyze our results of operations and liquidity in
conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to the following:
•
our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the refining,
logistics and marketing industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;
•our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment
of various investment opportunities.
•
In addition, these measures are used by management to assess internal performance. We
believe these measures, when supplemental to information presented under U.S. GAAP, may
provide meaningful information to the users of our financial statements. Each of the performance
measures should not be used in isolation from their comparable U.S. GAAP measure and thus
should not be considered as alternatives to any U.S. GAAP measure. Non-GAAP measures have
important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect
net earnings and operating income.

THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
2015
OVERVIEW. Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation
were $418 million ($3.47 per diluted share) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 (“2016
Quarter”) compared to $586 million ($4.62 per diluted share) for the three months ended June 30,
2015 (“2015 Quarter”).
GROSS MARGINS. Our consolidated gross margin decreased by $251 million during the 2016
Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter driven primarily by lower gross refining margins. Our gross
refining margin decreased $217 million, which reflects a benefit of $363 million from a lower of
cost or market (“LCM”) reserve adjustment during the 2016 Quarter, driven by a lower margin
environment. This translates into an overall decrease of $3.43 in our gross refining margin per
barrel. Our gross marketing margin decreased $50 million primarily driven by less favorable
market conditions partially offset by our increased portfolio of branded stations and stronger
demand.
OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased $5 million to $606 million in
the 2016 Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter. Our selling, general and administrative
expenses were $94 million in the 2016 Quarter compared to $84 million in the 2015 Quarter
primarily attributable to additional costs associated with our enterprise resource planning project
and changes in stock-based compensation expense during the 2016 Quarter as compared to the
2015 Quarter, the majority of which related to our stock appreciation rights that are adjusted
based on the market price of the stock each period. The stock-based compensation impact on the
2016 Quarter results include an expense of $11 million as compared to the 2015 Quarter, which
included an expense of $7 million.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. Our depreciation and amortization expense
in the 2016 Quarter was $210 million versus $182 million in the 2015 Quarter. The increase was
primarily driven by various projects being placed into service in late 2015 as well as additional
depreciation associated with acquisitions completed in 2016.
OTHER INCOME, NET. Other income, net for the 2016 Quarter was $25 million, which included
insurance proceeds related to a shipment of contaminated crude oil that was received in 2014 as
well as a refund of certain tariff charges that were disputed.
INCOME TAXES. Our income tax expense totaled $237 million in the 2016 Quarter versus $334
million in the 2015 Quarter. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 34.5%
and 34.9% during the 2016 Quarter and the 2015 Quarter, respectively.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
OVERVIEW. Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation
were $476 million ($3.94 per diluted share) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (“2016
Period”) compared to $731 million ($5.77 per diluted share) for the six months ended June 30,
2015 (“2015 Period”).
GROSS MARGINS. Our consolidated gross margin decreased by $356 million during the 2016
Period compared to the 2015 Period driven primarily by lower gross refining margins partially
offset by fuel margins and TLLP revenues. Our gross refining margin decreased $447 million
during the 2016 Period compared to the 2015 Period, which included a net LCM reserve
adjustment benefit of $216 million during the 2016 Period compared to a benefit of $42 million for
the 2015 Period. The decreased gross refining margin translated in an overall decrease of $4.23
in our gross refining margin per barrel. Our gross marketing margin increased $50 million
primarily driven by strong demand and increased portfolio of branded stations. TLLP revenues,
net of operating expenses, increased $37 million due to higher storage revenue due to acquired
assets and higher gathering throughput volumes for crude oil gathering and increased rates for
gas gathering.
36 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $176
million in the 2016 Period compared to $182 million in the 2015 Period primarily attributable to
the decrease in stock-based compensation expense during the 2016 Period as compared to the
2015 Period, the majority related to our stock appreciation rights that are adjusted based on the
market price of the stock each period. The stock-based compensation impact on the 2016 Period
results include an expense of $8 million as compared to $35 million for the 2015 Period.
Offsetting this decrease were additional costs associated with our enterprise resource planning
project.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. Our depreciation and amortization expense
in the 2016 Period was $422 million versus $361 million in the 2015 Period. The increase
primarily driven by various projects being placed into service in late 2015 as well as additional
depreciation associated with acquisitions completed in 2016.
OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. Included in other income (expense), net of $32 million for
the 2016 Period were insurance proceeds related to a shipment of contaminated crude oil that
was delivered in 2014, a refund of certain tariff charges that were disputed and a gain recognized
during the 2016 Period by TLLP on a settlement of amounts disputed by one of its customers on
the annual calculation of the natural gas gathering rate. TLLP assumed the obligation for this
litigation with the acquisition as part of its purchase price allocation for the natural gas business
acquired in 2014 and recognized an estimated settlement amount in excess of the actual amount
paid in March 2016.
INCOME TAXES. Our income tax expense totaled $267 million in the 2016 Period versus $430
million in the 2015 Period. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 32.8%
and 34.6% during the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period, respectively. The 2016 Period rate
benefited from a $16 million decrease in expense related to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09.
See Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 for additional
information on ASU 2016-09.
SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
REFINING SEGMENT
We currently own and operate seven petroleum refineries located in the western United States
and sell transportation fuels to a wide variety of customers. Our refineries produce the majority of
the transportation fuels that we sell. Our seven refineries have a combined crude oil capacity of
895 Mbpd. We purchase crude oil and other feedstocks from domestic and foreign sources,
including the Middle East, South America, western Africa, Canada, and other locations either
through term agreements with renewal provisions or in the spot market. Our marketing segment,
including its branded retail network, provides a committed outlet for the majority of the gasoline
produced by our refineries; however, we also sell gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel,
diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils and residual products in bulk and opportunistically export refined
products to certain foreign markets.
MARKET OVERVIEW. Results from our refining segment are heavily influenced by our gross
refining margin and refinery throughputs. The gross refining margin is the difference between the
prices of all manufactured refined products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks
used to produce refined products, including the cost of transportation and distribution. The market
for crude oil and products is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand
balance. Product values and crude oil prices are set by the market and are outside of our control.
When evaluating the markets in which we operate, we utilize the U.S. Energy Information
Administration and other industry sources, to gather supply, demand, utilization, import and
export information to forecast and monitor market conditions for our operating regions. We focus
on PADD V, or the West Coast of the U.S. where the majority of our operations are located.
PADD V is defined by the Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (“PADD”) as the states
of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we utilize the
West Coast and Mid-Continent crack spreads. The crack spread is a measure of the difference
between market prices for crude oil and refined products and is a commonly used proxy within
the industry to estimate or identify trends in gross refining margins. Crack spreads can fluctuate
significantly over time as a result of market conditions and supply and demand balances. The
West Coast 321 crack spread is calculated using 3 barrels of Alaska North Slope crude oil
(“ANS”) producing 2 barrels of Los Angeles California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) gasoline
and 1 barrel of Los Angeles CARB diesel. The Mid-Continent 321 crack spread is calculated
using 3 barrels of West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) producing 2 barrels of Group 3
gasoline and 1 barrel of Group 3 diesel.
Our actual gross refining margins differ from these crack spreads based on the actual slate of
crude oil we run at our refineries and the products we produce or yield. The global commodity
markets for crude oil and refined products are subject to significant volatility resulting in rapidly
changing prices and margin environments. Our refineries process a variety of crude oils that are
sourced from around the world. The slate of crude oil we process can vary over time as a result of
changes in market prices and
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 37
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
shipping rates. Additionally, our refining gross margin is impacted by the changing crude oil
differentials, which is the difference between the benchmark crude oils, WTI and Brent, and the
actual crude oil we run at our refineries. We may experience financial risk associated with price
volatility of crude oil and refined products and we may utilize financial hedge instruments to help
mitigate such risks where possible.

WEST COAST. Average U.S. West Coast crack spreads margins were down approximately 34%
in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to second quarter of 2015 and were down
approximately 29% in the first half of 2016, as compared to the first half of 2015. Despite the
increased product demand year over year along with some unplanned refinery outages, margins
were down significantly compared to 2015. During the first half of 2015, product supply was
disrupted by several unplanned refinery outages in the region along with the work stoppages at
our Anacortes, Washington and Los Angeles and Martinez, California refineries, which results in
a strong crack spread environment.
MID-CONTINENT. Average Mid-Continent crack spreads margins were down approximately
33% in the second quarter of 2016, as compared to the second quarter of 2015 and were down
approximately 36% in the first half of 2016, as compared to the first half of 2015. The lower
margin environment along with lower mid-continent crude oil differentials have negatively
impacted our results. The WTI to Bakken differential has decreased by approximately $1.21 per
barrel in the second quarter of 2016 increasing the price of Bakken, which resulted in lower gross
margins. Bakken crude oil represented over 50% of the crude oil consumed by our Mid-Continent
system in the first half of 2016.
OPERATIONAL DATA AND RESULTS. Management uses various operating metrics to
evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare profitability to other companies in the
industry. These measures include:
Gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin (revenues less
costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution and before any
LCM) by total refining throughput; and
Manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”) per
barrel is calculated by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput.
•
•
Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in
the industry on the basis of operating performance.

Included in the Mid-Continent region’s other operating expenses are $22 million and $43
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, related to our
acquisition of Great Northern Midstream LLC. Revenues associated with those costs are
recognized in gross refining margin.
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income for our refining segment decreased $237 million, or 31%, to $520
million during the 2016 Quarter as compared to $757 million during the 2015 Quarter, which
reflects an incremental benefit of $363 million related to our LCM adjustment for the 2016
Quarter. There was no impact related to LCM in the 2015 Quarter. The decrease was driven by
an overall decline in the margin environment during the quarter. Average U.S. West Coast crack
spreads margins were approximately $18 per barrel, down over $9 per barrel in the 2016 Quarter
as compared to the 2015 Quarter.
REFINING THROUGHPUT. Total refining throughput was higher at 802 Mbpd compared to 783
Mbpd during the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter primarily due to the timing of
planned and unplanned maintenance at a few of our facilities plus the completion of a crude unit
expansion project in 2015.
GROSS REFINING MARGIN. Total gross refining margin decreased $217 million, or 16%, to
$1.1 billion in the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter. On a per barrel basis, our gross
refining margin decreased $3.43 per barrel, or 18% to $15.70 per barrel in the 2016 Quarter as
compared to the 2015 Quarter given a weaker margin environment across the regions in which
we operate. Partially offsetting the decrease was an incremental benefit of $363 million related to
the LCM reserve adjustment recognized as of June 30, 2016. There was no benefit for the 2015
Quarter. Gross refining margin in the Mid-Continent region was positively impacted by the
reflection of revenues associated with our 2016 acquisition of Great Northern Midstream LLC.
MANUFACTURING COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. Total manufacturing
costs decreased from $397 million in the 2015 Quarter to $365 million in the 2016 Quarter
primarily as a result of lower repairs and maintenance costs. Other operating expenses increased
by $30 million year over year for a total expense of $111 million in the 2016 Quarter.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$27 million during the 2016 Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter due to the amortization of
turnaround and catalyst replacement costs incurred at our California refineries and the
acquisition of assets in our Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent regions from the second quarter
of 2015 through the end of the 2016 Quarter.
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income for our refining segment decreased $522 million, or 55%, to $420
million during the 2016 Period as compared to $942 million during the 2015 Period due to a
weaker margin environment due to an overall decline in market prices for crude oil and refined
products during the period. Average U.S. West Coast crack spreads margins were approximately
$18 per barrel, down over $7 per barrel in the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period. The
2016 Period reflects a benefit $216 million compared to a benefit of $42 million for the 2015
Period.
REFINING THROUGHPUT. Total refining throughput was significantly higher at 792 Mbpd
compared to 740 Mbpd during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period primarily due to
the impacts of the work stoppage experienced in the 2015 Period. However, throughput during
the 2016 Period was also negatively impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance at
several of our facilities.
GROSS REFINING MARGIN. Total gross refining margin decreased $447 million, or 21%, to
$1.7 billion in the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period, which includes a benefit $216
million compared to a benefit of $42 million for the 2015 Period related to the LCM reserve
adjustment. On a per barrel basis, our gross refining margin decreased $4.23 per barrel, or 27%
to $11.70 per barrel in the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period given a weaker margin
environment across the regions that we operate.
MANUFACTURING COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. Total manufacturing
costs decreased from $794 million in the 2015 Period to $760 million in the 2016 Period primarily
as a result of lower repairs and maintenance costs. Other operating expenses increased by $60
million for a total expense of $204 million in the 2016 Period.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
$58 million during the 2016 Period compared to the 2015 Period due to the amortization of
turnaround and catalyst replacement costs incurred at our California refineries and the
acquisition of assets in our Pacific Northwest and Mid-Continent regions from the second quarter
of 2015 through the end of the 2016 Period.
TLLP SEGMENT
TLLP is a publicly traded limited partnership that was formed to own, operate, develop and
acquire logistics assets. Its assets are integral to the success of Tesoro’s refining and marketing
operations and generate revenue by charging fees for gathering crude oil and natural gas, for
terminalling, transporting and storing crude oil and refined products and for processing natural
gas and fractionating NGLs.
OPERATIONAL DATA AND RESULTS. Management uses average revenue per barrel and
average revenue per million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) to evaluate performance and
compare profitability to other companies in the industry. We calculate average revenue per barrel
as revenue divided by total throughput or keep-whole processing volumes. We calculate average
revenue per MMBtu as revenue divided by gas gathering and fee-based processing volume.
Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in
the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be
considered as an alternative to segment operating income, revenues and operating expenses or
any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Prior to the deconsolidation of Rendezvous Gas Services, L.L.C. (“RGS”) as of January 1,
2016, fees paid by TLLP to RGS were eliminated upon consolidation and third-party
transactions, including revenue and throughput volumes, were included in TLLP’s results of
operations. Third party volumes associated with RGS, included in gas gathering volume for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, were both 146 thousand MMBtu/d and
reduced our average gas gathering revenue per MMBtu for both periods by $0.05.

TLLP segment revenues from services provided to our refining segment were $168 million and
$154 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $337
million and $302 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation.
TLLP segment operating expenses include amounts billed by Tesoro for services provided to
TLLP under various operational contracts. Amounts billed by Tesoro totaled $34 million and
$29 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $71 million
and $58 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating
expenses also include imbalance gains and reimbursements of $5 million and $11 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $12 million and $19
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are
eliminated upon consolidation. TLLP segment third-party operating expenses related to the
transportation of crude oil and refined products related to Tesoro’s sale of those refined
products during the ordinary course of business are reclassified to cost of sales in our
condensed statements of consolidated operations upon consolidation.
TLLP segment general and administrative expenses include amounts charged by Tesoro for
general and administrative services provided to TLLP under various operational and
administrative contracts. These amounts totaled $16 million and $18 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $33 million and $35 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are eliminated upon
consolidation. TLLP segment third-party general and administrative expenses are reclassified
to cost of sales as it relates to Tesoro’s sale of refined products in our condensed statements
of consolidated operations upon consolidation.
(c)
THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,
2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income for TLLP increased $21 million to $125 million for the 2016
Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter primarily as a result of increased storage revenue and
assets acquired.
44 | Tesoro Corporation 2016
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
REVENUES AND THROUGHPUT. Mainly due to acquired storage assets and higher
throughput volumes across TLLP’s business, revenues increased $18 million to $293 million
during the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter. Crude oil gathering throughput
volumes increased primarily as a result of open seasons and the continued expansion of the
High Plains System, which were offset by gas gathering volumes declining, excluding the impact
of deconsolidating the RGS volumes, compared to 2015 Quarter, lower trucking throughput as
more volumes were placed on the High Plains System and NGL processing throughput volumes
decreased as a result of lower production.
OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased $3 million during the
2016 Quarter primarily due to the impact of the deconsolidation of RGS as certain transactions
are no longer being eliminated in consolidations and higher pipeline throughput volumes, costs
associated with acquired storage and handling assets. General and administrative expenses
decreased $6 million to $22 million in the 2016 Quarter compared to the 2015 Quarter primarily
due to higher costs in 2015 due to integration efforts in connection with the acquisition of the
natural gas business.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income for TLLP increased $43 million to $251 million due to increased
storage revenue as a result of acquired assets as well as higher gathering throughput across our
natural gas and crude oil gathering systems along with higher NGL processing throughput in the
2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period.
REVENUES AND THROUGHPUT. Mainly due to acquired storage assets and higher
throughput volumes across TLLP’s business, revenues increased $55 million to $593 million
during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period. NGL processing throughput volumes
increased as a result of optimization of our processing facilities. Additionally, TLLP received
pass-through revenue from Tesoro during the 2016 Period, which recovered a temporary fee
charged to TLLP related to right-of-way costs. Crude oil gathering throughput volumes increased
primarily as a result of open seasons and the continued expansion of the High Plains System
partially offset by declines in trucking volumes due to producers utilizing the expanded High
Plains System. Gas gathering volumes, excluding the impact of deconsolidating the RGS
volumes, decreased due to lower production compared to the 2015 Period.
OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased $18 million during the
2016 Period primarily due to the impact of the deconsolidation of RGS as certain transactions are
no longer being eliminated in consolidations, and costs associated with acquired storage and
handling assets.
MARKETING SEGMENT
We sell gasoline and diesel fuel in the western United States through branded and unbranded
channels. Our branded operations include transportation fuel sales through retail stations and
agreements with third-party dealers and distributors (or “Jobber/Dealer”). Our unbranded, or
wholesale, operations include volumes sold through agreements with third-party distributors. Our
branded and unbranded channels provide committed outlets for nearly all of the gasoline
produced by our refineries. Our marketing segment includes a network of retail stations under the
ARCO®, Shell®, Exxon®, Mobil®, USA GasolineTM, RebelTM and Tesoro® brands.
OPERATIONAL DATA AND RESULTS. Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare
fuel results to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel
margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel
margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts
may use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the
basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered an alternative
to revenues, segment operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Fuel margin and fuel margin per gallon include the effect of
intersegment purchases from the refining segment.

2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income decreased $51 million to $161 million during the 2016 Quarter as
compared to the 2015 Quarter primarily as a result of a weaker margin environment, partially
offset by continued growth in our branded station network.
GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin decreased $50 million to $252 million during the 2016 Quarter
as compared to the 2015 Quarter. We experienced a weaker fuel margin as above average 2015
Quarter gasoline margins returned to the 5 year average in the 2016 Quarter, partially offset by
additional fuel sales. Fuel sales increased 6% during the 2016 Quarter compared to the 2015
Quarter from growth in our portfolio of branded stations.
SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 VERSUS SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
OVERVIEW. Operating income increased $43 million to $388 million during the 2016 Period as

in our branded station network.
GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin increased $50 million to $570 million during the 2016 Period as
compared to the 2015 Period. We experienced higher fuel margin driven by volatility in the West
Coast gasoline market and additional fuel sales. Fuel sales increased 5% during the 2016
Period compared to the 2015 Period from growth in our branded station network.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
OVERVIEW
We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by
changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market
uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level
of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal
demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global
economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for
further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as
borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these
conditions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
DEBT OVERVIEW AND AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY
Our debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, to capitalization ratio was 36% and 34% at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our debt, net of unamortized issuance costs, to
capitalization ratio, excluding TLLP, was 19% at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015;
this calculation excludes (a) TLLP total debt, which is net of unamortized issuance costs, of $3.2
billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and
(b) noncontrolling interest of $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. TLLP’s debt is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP.
The Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and senior notes
each limit our ability, under certain circumstances, to make certain restricted payments (as
defined in our debt agreements), which include dividends, purchases of our stock or voluntary
prepayments of subordinate debt. The aggregate amount of restricted payments cannot exceed
an amount defined in each of the debt agreements. The indentures for our senior notes also limit
certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to make certain payments and distributions. We do not believe
that these limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends or buy back stock under our current
programs. There have been no material changes to the Revolving Credit Facility covenants
during the six months ended June 30, 2016. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as
of and for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations with additional sources available
under borrowing capacity from our revolving lines of credit. We ended the second quarter of 2016
with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $239 million borrowings under the TLLP
Dropdown Credit Facility. There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or
TLLP’s senior secured revolving credit agreement (the “TLLP Revolving Credit Facility”). We
believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working
capital and debt service requirements.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES. Net cash from operating activities during the 2016 Period totaled
$628 million as compared to a use of cash of $907 million in the 2015 Period. The increase in
cash from operations was primarily driven by the change in working capital during the 2016
Period compared to the 2015 Period. The impact of non-cash items primarily drove the decrease
in net earnings of $250 million.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used in investing activities increased $258 million to $806
million in the 2016 Period as compared to $548 million in the 2015 Period, primarily due to the
acquisitions in the 2016 Period partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Net cash from financing activities during the 2016 Period totaled $357
million as compared to net cash used in financing activities during the 2015 Period which totaled
$381 million. The change of $738 million is primarily attributable to TLLP’s financing activities
during the 2016 Period including senior note issuances of $700 million partially offset by net debt
repayments of $319 million. In addition, TLLP had $289 million more in net proceeds from
issuances of common units during the 2016 Period compared to the 2015 Period. Purchases of
common stock were $169 million higher in the 2015 Period compared to the 2016 Period. The
change in other financing activities of $64 million partially offset these sources of cash.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
Our capital spending reflects the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including
continued focus on safe, compliant, reliable operations and value-driven growth. Growth capital
expenditures include purchases or construction of new assets and expansion of existing facilities
or services that increase throughput capacity or operational capabilities of our assets.
Maintenance capital expenditures include projects to extend the life or maintain equipment
reliability and integrity. Tesoro regulatory capital expenditures include projects to attain or
maintain compliance with regulatory standards. We monitor the effectiveness of our investments
in capital projects as part of our focus on financial discipline and continuous improvement. In
addition, for major capital projects, we routinely review project assumptions and project
execution as well as obtain third-party evaluations to assist in improving our project planning and
execution. Actual and estimated amounts described below include amounts representing
capitalized interest and labor. Tesoro primarily funds capital expenditures with cash generated
from operations. TLLP primarily funds its capital expenditures with cash generated from
operations, reimbursements for certain growth and maintenance capital expenditures, borrowings
under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility and issuances of
additional TLLP debt and equity securities, as needed.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Company has revised the 2016 capital program expectations to approximately $970 million,
which includes approximately $700 million for Tesoro and approximately $270 million for TLLP.
This is a reduction of approximately $530 million from the Company’s earlier expectations of
approximately $1.5 billion. The reduction is primarily attributable to reduced spending as a result
of permit timing changes for the Los Angeles Refinery Integration Project and permit timing
changes as a result of the additional environmental impact studies required related to the Clean
Product Upgrade Project. Tesoro still expects to complete these projects over the next few years,
but at a slower pace than previously planned. These anticipated reductions in 2016 capital
expenditures are not expected to impact our current year business improvement targets. TLLP’s
reduction in its capital spending was primarily driven by several growth projects in both the
Rockies and Bakken regions that have been delayed beyond 2016 due to the current low
commodity price environment.
MAJOR PROJECTS. Cost estimates for projects currently in process or under development are
subject to further review, analysis and permitting requirements resulting in revisions to our current
spend estimates.

The integration and compliance project at the Los Angeles refinery is designed to improve the
flexibility of gasoline and diesel yields and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The proposed
project, subject to project scoping, engineering and regulatory approval, includes
decommissioning the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our Wilmington refinery. Of the total
expected capital expenditure related to this project, we anticipate a portion may be incurred
and paid by TLLP.
(b)
(c)
(d)
The Enterprise Resource Planning Project will simplify business processes by implementing a
standardized and scalable platform across the Company to transform our business information
and technology systems and to further streamline our operations, reduce costs and provide for
future growth. We expect this project to be a complex, multi-year process that will require
significant investments in software and technology. We are currently in the design phase of
this process.
The regulatory and compliance project for the Avon Wharf in Martinez, California is required
under the California building code for Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance
Standards (“MOTEMS”). The project will replace the existing berth with a MOTEMS compliant
structure that will improve clean product movements and has received all regulatory approval
and permits.
Collectively referred to as the Clean Product Upgrade Project, the mixed xylenes and naphtha
isomerization projects at our Anacortes, Washington refinery will help diversify our product mix
through the extraction of existing mixed xylene from gasoline and will improve our capability to
deliver cleaner local transportation fuels and global feedstocks, primarily for polyester.
Additionally, the upgrades associated with the project will lower the sulfur content in gasoline,
which aligns with the new Federal Tier 3 standards. The project and its components remain
subject to final board and regulatory approval.
On July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the EPA lodged a complaint along
with a Consent Decree totaling $425 million with the Western District Court of Texas. Through
June 30, 2016, Tesoro has already incurred or accrued $256 million of expenditures for capital
projects in response to the Consent Decree including $46 million related to our former Hawaii
refinery. Our expected capital expenditures for 2016 contain $85 million, including amounts to be
capitalized for interest and labor, for these projects. Additionally, we expect to spend
approximately $70 million, including amounts to be capitalized for interest and labor, for all
remaining capital expenditures between 2017 and 2019 in response to the Consent Decree.

SHARE REPURCHASES
On October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a new $1.0 billion share
repurchase program to become effective upon the full completion of our current $1.0 billion share
repurchase authorization. With the new program, we have $1.3 billion remaining under our
authorized programs as of June 30, 2016. In addition, we are authorized by our Board to
purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions to offset the dilutive effect of
stock-based compensation awards and to meet our obligations under employee benefit and
compensation plans, including the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and to
fulfill other stock compensation requirements. The Board’s authorization has no time limit and
may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, we purchased approximately 1.3 million and 3.1 million shares of our common stock for
approximately $100 million and $269 million, respectively.
CASH DIVIDENDS
We paid cash dividends totaling $61 million and $121 million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, respectively, based on a $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend on common
stock. We paid cash dividends totaling $53 million and $107 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2015, respectively, based on a $0.425 per share quarterly cash dividend on
common stock. On August 3, 2016, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.55 per share
payable on September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 31, 2016.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that
would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS
We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and
income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the
ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities
when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact
on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have
a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we
accrue receivables for probable third-party recoveries.
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 51
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. We are subject to extensive federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the
discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the
environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various
sites, install additional controls or make other modifications to certain emission sources,
equipment or facilities. See further discussion in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-
K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for
environmental remediation liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated
refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities totaling $232
million and $255 million, including $24 million and $33 million for TLLP, at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively.
On July 10, 2015, a federal court issued an order denying coverage pursuant to insurance
policies for environmental remediation liabilities at our Martinez refinery and those liabilities are
included in our accruals above. The insurer had filed a declaratory relief action challenging
coverage of the primary policy assigned to us when we acquired the refinery. The policies
provide for coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-
insurance. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries under the policies and have
appealed the order.
OTHER MATTERS
In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and
governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and
sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have
not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable, and the amount of loss is
currently estimable.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL. The U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency lodged a complaint and Consent Decree on July 18, 2016 resolving
allegations that we have violated certain provisions of the Clean Air Act at our Alaska,
Washington, Martinez, North Dakota and Utah refineries. We also retained the responsibility for
resolving similar allegations relating to our former Hawaii refinery, which we sold in September
2013. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1, and read
in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for
additional information on our environmental contingencies.
TAX. We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly
enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result
in increased expenditures in the future. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial
statements for additional information on our tax matters.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISK MANAGEMENT
We have established a risk committee comprised of senior level leadership from our financial,
strategic, governance, administrative and operational functions. The risk committee’s
responsibilities include the performance of an annual review to assess and prioritize the
Company’s risks in coordination with our subject matter experts, assessment of the status and
effectiveness of risk prevention and mitigation activities, identify emerging risks and facilitating
management’s development of risk assessment and management practices. The risk committee
is also responsible to assess and advise management on the Company’s system of controls to
ensure policies and procedures are properly followed and appropriate accountability is present.
See further discussion in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
Tesoro Corporation 2016 | 53
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
COMMODITY PRICE RISKS
Our primary source of market risk is the difference between the sale prices for our refined
products and the purchase prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Refined product prices are
directly influenced by the price of crude oil. Our earnings and cash flows from operations depend
on the margin, relative to fixed and variable expenses (including the costs of crude oil and other
feedstocks), at which we are able to sell our refined products. The prices of crude oil and refined
products fluctuate substantially and depend on many factors including the global supply and
demand for crude oil and refined products. This demand is impacted by changes in the global
economy, the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products, geo-
political conditions, the availability of imports of crude oil and refined products, the relative
strength of the U.S. dollar, the marketing of alternative and competing fuels and the impact of
government regulations. Our refined product sale prices are also affected by local factors such as
local market conditions and the level of operations of other suppliers in our markets.
In most cases, an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding
increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products. The timing, direction
and the overall change in refined product prices versus crude oil prices could have a significant
impact on our profit margins, earnings and cash flows. Assuming all other factors remained
constant, a $1 per barrel change in average gross refining margins, based on our quarter-to-date
average throughput of 802 thousand barrels per day, would change annualized pre-tax operating
income by approximately $290 million. This analysis may differ from actual results.
We maintain inventories of crude oil, intermediate products and refined products, the values of
which are subject to fluctuations in market prices. Our inventories of refinery feedstocks and
refined products totaled 45 million barrels and 48 million barrels at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. Since the replacement cost of our inventories declined to a
level below our average cost, we recorded a LCM reserve of $143 million and $359 million as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
We use non-trading derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risks
associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products and inventories above or
below our target levels. We also use these instruments to manage the impact of market volatility
and arbitrage opportunities for crude oil where the price of crude oil is higher in the future than
the current spot price. For the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products to be used in
our normal operations, we may enter into physical commodity forward purchase and sale
contracts (“Forward Contracts”), which are not typically classified and reported as derivatives for
accounting purposes. The gains or losses associated with these Forward Contracts are
recognized as incurred in our financial statements separate from the gains or losses associated
with other derivative instruments reported below and in Note 5 to our financial statements in Item
1.
Also, we may enter into derivative contracts such as exchange-traded futures, over-the-counter
swaps, options and over-the-counter options, most of which had remaining durations of less than
one year as of June 30, 2016, to economically hedge price risk associated with our physical
commodity Forward Contracts or to take advantage of other market opportunities. We mark-to-
market these derivative instruments each period during the contract term, which can create timing
differences for gain or loss recognition in our financial statements. The derivative gains or losses
presented below do not reflect the realized losses or gains, respectively, from the settlement of
our physical commodity transactions. Both the derivative and the physical commodity Forward
Contracts’ gains and losses are reflected in our gross refining margin in the refining segment. We
evaluate our performance based on all contract types available to manage our risk, which
includes contracts that may or may not be classified and reported as derivatives for accounting
purposes.
We believe the governance structure that we have in place is adequate given the size and
sophistication of our commodity optimization, inventory management and trading activities. Our
governance over commodity activities includes regular monitoring of the performance of our risk
management strategies and limits over dollar and volume based transactional authority,
commodity position, aggregate spread, stop-loss and value-at-risk. Performance against our
strategies and authorized limits is monitored daily via position reports and profit and loss analysis
and is reviewed on a regular basis, at least monthly, by our risk committee.
Net earnings during the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 included a net loss of $82 million and
$76 million, respectively, on our commodity derivative positions.

Our open derivative positions at June 30, 2016 will expire at various times through 2017. We
prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk associated with our
derivative instruments. This analysis may differ from actual results. Based on our open net
positions at June 30, 2016, a 1% change in quoted market prices of our derivative instruments,
assuming all other factors remain constant, could change the fair value of our derivative
instruments and pre-tax operating income by approximately $3 million.
COUNTER PARTY CREDIT RISK
We have exposure to concentrations of credit risk related to the ability of our counterparties to
meet their contractual payment obligations, and the potential non-performance of counterparties
to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. Customer concentrations
within the refining industry may affect our overall exposure to counterparty risk because these
customers may be similarly impacted by changes in economic or other conditions. See further
discussion in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Our use of fixed or variable-rate debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt,
such as our senior notes, exposes us to changes in the fair value of our debt due to changes in
market interest rates. Fixed rate debt also exposes us to the risk that we may need to refinance
maturing debt with new debt at higher rates, or that we may be obligated to pay rates higher than
the current market. Variable-rate debt, such as borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility,
exposes us to short-term changes in market rates that impact our interest expense. The carrying
values of our debt were approximately $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, and the fair values of our debt were approximately $4.8 billion
and $4.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These carrying and fair
values of our debt do not consider the unamortized issuance costs, which are netted against our
total debt.
We currently do not use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk;
however, we continue to monitor the market and our exposure, and in the future, we may enter
into these transactions to mitigate risk. We believe in the short-term we have acceptable interest
rate risk and continue to monitor the risk on our long-term obligations. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility or TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and $239
million borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility as of June 30, 2016.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the
information that we are required to disclose in reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), is accumulated and appropriately communicated to
management. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined by applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules) during the
quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect these controls.
We carried out an evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures at the end of the reporting period. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RISK FACTORS
PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and
governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and
sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters and
certain matters may require years to resolve. Although we cannot provide assurance, we believe
that an adverse resolution of the matters described below, except as may be specifically
disclosed, will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of
operations.
On July 18, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) lodged a complaint along with a Consent Decree with the Western District Court
of Texas (the “Court”). Subject to a 30-day public comment period, the Consent Decree is the
final settlement of EPA’s allegations that we violated certain Clean Air Act regulations at our
Alaska, Washington, Martinez, North Dakota and Utah refineries. This settlement resolves a
notice of violation (“NOV”) received in March 2011 from the EPA alleging violations of Title V of
the Clean Air Act at our Alaska refinery, which arose from a 2007 state of Alaska inspection and
inspections by the EPA in 2008 and 2010 and NOVs received in 2005 and 2008 alleging
violations of the Clean Air Act at our Washington refinery. The settlement also resolves similar
allegations relating to our former Hawaii refinery, which we sold in September 2013. Upon final
approval by the Court, terms of the Consent Decree require Tesoro to spend material capital
expenditures. However, the majority of these expenditures have been spent in prior years or are
budgeted in 2016. The remaining expenditures will be primarily spent in 2017 with additional
amounts through 2019. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I,
Item 1 and the Capital Resources and Liquidity in Part I, Item 2 for further discussions. All
remaining expenditures associated with the Consent Decree will not have a material impact on
our liquidity, financial position or results of operations. Additionally, the Consent Decree requires
the payment of a civil penalty totaling $10.45 million plus accrued interest for which $10 million
was previously accrued in 2014.
On January 14, 2016, we received an offer to settle a NOV we received on November 20, 2013,
from the EPA alleging 46 violations of the Clean Air Act Risk Management Plan requirements at
our Washington refinery. The EPA conducted an investigation of the refinery in 2011, following
the April 2010 fire in the naphtha hydrotreater unit. While we are continuing settlement
discussions, EPA filed an Administrative Complaint on April 14, 2016 for the assessment of civil
penalties. We cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of this matter but
the outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of
operations.
On February 12, 2016, we received an offer to settle 35 NOVs received from the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District (“BAAQMD”). The NOVs were issued from May 2011 to November
2015 and allege violations of air quality regulations for ground level monitors located at our
Martinez refinery. While we are negotiating a settlement with the BAAQMD and cannot currently
estimate the timing of the resolution of this matter, the outcome will not have a material impact on
our liquidity, financial positions, or results of operations.
On February 25, 2015, an arbitration panel issued its binding order that the previous owner of our
Washington refinery take nothing from its January 2015 demand for indemnity for the damages
they incurred in the civil litigation involving us and the previous owner brought by the families of
those fatally wounded in the April 2010 refinery fire. We settled our involvement in the civil
litigation in 2012.
On April 19, 2016, we received an offer to settle two NOVs received from the California Air
Resources Board (“CARB”). The NOVs were issued in February 2016 and allege certain batches
of fuels produced in June and July 2015 at our Martinez and Los Angeles refineries violated fuel
standards within the California Code of Regulations. While we are actively discussing a
settlement of the allegations with CARB, we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the
resolution of this matter.
