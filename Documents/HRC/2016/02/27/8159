<p><b>  Letter to the Government  
</b></p>
<p>2. On 29 July 2011, the former Special Rapporteur sent the following letter to the 
Government of Egypt. 
</p>
<p>3. I have the honour to address you in my capacity as Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/RES/15/15 of 7 October 
2010, and in the spirit of our dialogue developed with your Excellency&#8216;s former 
</p>
<p>Government since my fact-finding mission to Egypt held from 17 to 21 April 2009 
(A/HRC/13/37/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>4. In light of a number of developments that have taken place since the conduct of my 
visit, including the recommendations issued in March 2010 following the Universal 
Periodic Review of Egypt,2 and the report of the OHCHR mission to Egypt between 27 
March and 4 April 2011,3 I wish to follow up with your Excellency&#8216;s Government on a 
selected number of issues that I elaborated on in my mission report on the legal and 
institutional counter-terrorism framework and practice in your country. In the following I 
therefore take the opportunity to address some of the recent developments reported to me 
that have taken place at the national level. 
</p>
<p>5. During my visit and in the Human Rights Council report related to that visit, I urged 
the Government of Egypt to lift the state of emergency and repeal the Emergency law, 
including all decrees under it, with a view to restoring the rule of law and full compliance 
with human rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR). As an essential step in this direction, I recommended that article 179 of the 
Egyptian Constitution would be revised (A/HRC/13/37/Add.2, para. 49). I welcome 
therefore the new constitutional declaration of Egypt&#8216;s Supreme Council of the Armed 
</p>
<p>Forces (SCAF) of 30 March, which abolished article 179.4

<p>to Egypt, 27 March - 4 April 2011, available at

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>6. At the time of my visit, the previous Government was committed to enact a new 
anti-terrorism law in order to lift the state of emergency that has been in force, almost 
continuously, for more than 50 years. In May 2010, the Emergency law was again renewed 
however. The presidential decree renewing the measure states in article 2 that enforcement 
&#8213;will be limited to cases of combating the dangers of terrorism and its finance and the 
</p>
<p>purchase, export and trafficking in narcotics.&#8214; Promises to lift the state of emergency have 
been made since 2005, and the SCAF and Prime Minister Essam Sharaf have reiterated 
these promises this year, stipulating that the state of emergency would be lifted before the 
parliamentary elections would take place in November. While the SCAF has the 
responsibility to maintain law and order in Egypt, it is not clear in which cases it is still 
applying articles 3 (1) and (5) of the Emergency Law, which permit restrictions on the 
freedom of persons to assembly, movement, residence and passage in certain places or 
times; the arrest and detention of suspects or those representing a danger to public security 
and order; and the search of persons and places without regard for provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure. In this context, I am concerned about consistent reports that members 
of the military have allegedly arrested, detained and even ill-treated innocent protesters in 
the aftermath of the revolution. 
</p>
<p>7. In my mission report, I stressed my deep concern about the jurisdiction over 
terrorism cases by military courts and Emergency Supreme State Security Courts 
(A/HRC/13/37/Add.2, paras. 32 <i>et seq</i>.). This concern is still valid since I learned about the 
referral of the case of 48 defendants of the Imbaba events, in which sectarian clashes 
between Copts and Muslims led to the death of 15 people and 242 injured, to the Supreme 
State Security Court. The fact that judgments pronounced in first instance by this Supreme 
State Security Court are not subject to appeal, and become final after the ratification of the 
President, is not sufficient to reach compliance with article 14 (5) of the ICCPR. I am 
further concerned by admissions of the Government that at least 10.000 civilians have been 
convicted on the basis of the emergency law by military courts since former President 
Mubarak resigned on 11 February 2011, often on the basis of their participation in protests 
which were suppressed by the military. The trial of civilians in military and Emergency 
Supreme State Security Courts raises concerns about the impartial and independent 
administration of justice and furthermore does not comply with the right to have a 
conviction and sentence fully reviewed by a higher court. I urge your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government to ensure that all these cases are tried in strict compliance with each of the 
guarantees as spelled out in article 14 of the ICCPR, including the stipulation in article 14 
(3) (d) that a suspect has to be able to defend himself in person or through legal assistance 
of his own choosing. 
</p>
<p>8. My concerns with the Emergency law also relate to its use as a basis for other laws, 
which are not compatible with international human rights standards. In April 2011, Law 
34/2011 entered into force, which provides for punishment with imprisonment or a fine for 
all those who during the state of emergency call for demonstrations, strikes, sit-ins, or 
gatherings, or participate in any of the above, leading to the impediment or the obstruction 
of any of the state institutions or public authorities from performing their role. The law also 
penalizes incitement, calls, writings, or any other public advertisements for a protest or 
strike with imprisonment. The vaguely drafted law undermines the right to strike as 
guaranteed under article 8 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (ICESCR) and the right to peaceful assembly under article 21 of the ICCPR. I was 
made aware that in June 2011 five workers from the Ministry of Petroleum were brought to 
trial under the new law. The five were charged with carrying out a sit-in protest in front of 
the oil ministry, along with about 200 colleagues, and were sentenced to suspended prison 
sentences of one year. I fail to see how punishing a peaceful protest outside a ministry is 
necessary or proportionate to counter terrorism or drug-related offences. The adoption of 
this law does not seem to take into account the recommendation of my mission report, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>which stated that any counter-terrorism measure that results in the restriction of human 
rights, in particular pertaining to peaceful assembly and association, be brought into 
compliance with the requirements of necessity and proportionality and applied in 
accordance with clearly defined legal criteria (A/HRC/13/37/Add.2, para. 52).  
</p>
<p>9. I urged the Government of Egypt in my mission report to abolish any legal 
provisions, including article 3 (1) of the Emergency law, allowing for administrative 
detention and to take effective measures to release or bring to trial all detainees currently 
subjected to that regime (A/HRC/13/37/Add.2, para. 53). The former Government has said 
in 2010 that &#8213;hundreds&#8214; of administrative detainees were released in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>presidential decree amending the Emergency Law in May 2010, including detainees held in 
connection with bomb attacks at Taba in 2004, but disclosed no details about those who 
continued to be detained. On 11 June 2010, Mufid Shehab, Minister of Human Rights and 
Parliamentary Affairs, specified before the Human Rights Council that about 453 detainees 
had been released. On 12 March 2011, the new Minister of Interior announced that 1,659 
administrative detainees had been released since early February, but there is no information 
available as to what the criteria were to release these people, and how many people are still 
being detained. 
</p>
<p>10. In the overwhelming majority of cases the State Security Intelligence (SSI) was 
responsible for administrative detention, which was often unacknowledged and 
accompanied by practices of torture. These human rights violations by the SSI were 
widespread and of a systemic nature. When protesters stormed the headquarters of the SSI 
in Nasr City in the beginning of March 2011, they did not only find thousands of burned or 
shredded records, but also torture devices and secret underground prison cells whose 
existence the Egyptian Government had vehemently denied. I note that all administrative 
branches and offices of the State Security Investigation Service (SSI) were dissolved on 15 
March 2011 and that its head, General Hassan Abd al-Rahman, was arrested, and currently 
faces an investigation into the ordering of killings of anti-government protestors. Another 
47 SSI officers appeared to have been detained on suspicion of destroying incriminating 
evidence. However, in order to truly eradicate the culture of impunity at the SSI, 
investigations into the actions of the SSI should go beyond issues of involvement related to 
the violence against the protesters during the revolution. In this context, I reiterate my 
earlier recommendation that the Government of Egypt should establish an independent 
investigatory body to promptly and thoroughly clarify all elements that indicate its 
collaboration and extended reception of persons subjected to &#8213;extraordinary renditions&#8214; 
</p>
<p>carried out within this programme (A/HRC/13/37/Add.2, para. 59). 
</p>
<p>11. The SSI has been replaced by a new &#8213;National Security Agency&#8214; (NSA), which, 
according to statements made by the Minister of Interior, will now be mainly responsible 
only for investigating terrorism. It has to be noted that lessons should be learned from the 
past in order to avoid that this new agency becomes, again, a state within the state. Firstly, 
since the SSI could arrest, detain, torture and kill with impunity under the shield of the 
Emergency Law, it is of utmost importance that this law is immediately abolished in Egypt. 
The success of any reform of the security apparatus is dependent on this measure. 
Secondly, a new agency needs to be established on the basis of a clear and precise law, 
which outlines the mandate and powers of this agency. Element of good practices in this 
context can be found in my 2010 report &#8213;Compilation of good practices on legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks and measures that ensure respect for human rights by intelligence 
agencies while countering terrorism&#8214; (A/HRC/14/46). Last but not least, to eradicate the 
culture of human rights abuses and impunity committed by Egypt&#8216;s security forces, 
including the military and the General Intelligence Services (<i>Mukhabarat al-</i>&#8216;Amma) 
measures need to be taken to ensure truth, justice and reparation for victims of human rights 
violations by these forces. I agree with the OHCHR mission that &#8213;there is a need for a 
comprehensive approach to transitional justice with regard to all serious recent and past </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>human rights violations, and for the organization of national consultations on transitional 
justice so as to identify the most appropriate options.&#8214;5 
</p>
<p>12. Finally, and in connection with the issues elaborated above, I would be grateful if 
your Excellency&#8216;s Government could provide me with detailed substantive information on 
the following matters, and any other matters that your Excellency&#8216;s Government deems 
</p>
<p>appropriate in following up on my recommendations in my country visit report, at your 
earliest convenience, but no later than 29 August 2011: 
</p>
<p>1. Could your Excellency&#8216;s Government provide me with statistics concerning 
the use of the administrative detention regime on terrorist suspects, including as regards the 
particular acts for which the detainees in question are being held? 
</p>
<p>2. How many convictions of civilians in military courts relate to the fight 
against terrorism? 
</p>
<p>3. What steps has your Excellency&#8216;s Government taken to hold SSI officials and 
military officers accountable for acts of torture, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings 
and other human rights violations? 
</p>
<p>4. What steps have been taken in particular to investigate the death of Mr. al-
Sayyid Bilal, who was found dead after being summoned to the SSI facility in Alexandria 
after the bombings at the Two Saints Church in Alexandria in January 2011? 
</p>
<p>5. Is there a vetting system put in place for the integration of former SSI 
officials in the police force and the new state security force? 
</p>
<p>6. What steps are taken to preserve the archives of the State Security 
Intelligence? 
</p>
<p>7. Which steps are taken to guarantee that no evidence of human rights abuses, 
including evidence of unlawful killings, is tampered with or destroyed and that 
investigations into all killings follow the methods set out in the UN Principles on the 
Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extralegal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions? 
</p>
<p>8. What is the present status of the proposed anti-terrorism law? 
</p>
<p>9. When does Egypt plan to revise its national legislation so as to ensure that the 
definition of torture in the Criminal Code is in full compliance with international human 
rights norms, in particular with the Convention against Torture? 
</p>
<p>10. Which steps is your Excellency&#8216;s Government taking to ratify the Rome 
Statute of the International Criminal Court; the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture? 
</p>
<p>11. Will your Excellency&#8216;s Government create an independent oversight 
mechanism as to hold security forces and all law enforcement officials to account for 
human rights violations? 
</p>
<p>13. As my own term as Special Rapporteur is coming to an end, I want to thank your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government for its cooperation so far and to express the wish that this 
</p>
<p>cooperation will continue with my successor. With reference to earlier exchanges, I hope 
that your Excellency&#8216;s Government will invite my successor into the country, including in 
</p>
<p>follow up on my mission report and to visit places of detention under the Standard Terms of

<p><b> B. Follow-up to mission to Israel, including visit to the occupied

<p><b>Palestinian territories</b>6<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Letter to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>15. On 1 May 2012, the Special Rapporteur sent the following letter to the Government 
of Israel. 
</p>
<p>16. I have the honour to address you in my capacity as Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/19, and in the spirit of the 
constructive dialogue developed between my predecessor, Mr. Martin Scheinin, and your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government since his fact-finding mission to Israel, including a visit to the 
occupied Palestinian territories (oPt), conducted from 3 to 10 July 2007 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4). 
</p>
<p>17. In light of a number of developments that have taken place since that visit both in 
Israel, including the oPt, and at United Nations level, including the recommendations issued 
in January 2009 following the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Israel,7 and the 
adoption of the respective concluding observations on Israel by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in March 2012,8 the Human Rights Committee in July 
2010,9 the Committee on the Rights of the Child under the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 
March 2010,10 and the Committee against Torture in June 2009,11 I wish to follow up with 
your Excellency&#8216;s Government on a selected number of issues that were elaborated on in 
the mission report on the legal and institutional counter-terrorism framework and practice 
in your country. I therefore take the opportunity to address some of the recent developments 
reported to me that have taken place at the national level. 
</p>
<p>18. Since the country visit of my predecessor, your Excellency&#8216;s Government has made 
efforts to address some of the issues in relation to the promotion and protection of human 
rights noted then in his report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of terrorism and related issues 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the report, it was recommended to your Excellency&#8216;s Government that Israel, in 
the development of its counter-terrorism legislation, ensure that definitions of terrorism and 
security suspects are precise and limited to the countering of terrorism and the maintenance 
of national security, respectively. Definitions surrounding the countering of terrorism

<p>should be restricted to the suppression and criminalization of acts of deadly or otherwise 
serious physical violence against civilians, i.e., members of the general population or 
segments of it, or the taking of hostages, coupled with the cumulative conditions identified 
by the Security Council in its resolution 1566 (2004). All legislation, regulations and 
military orders must comply with the requirements of the principle of legality with regard 
to accessibility, precision and non-retroactivity. Having achieved those requirements, the 
enactment by the Knesset of this new legislation should be accompanied by a repeal or 
revocation of all current counter-terrorism legislation, regulations and military orders. My 
predecessor further recommended that the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law be 
repealed, without replacement (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 55). 
</p>
<p>20. Since then, the Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations, has 
equally recommended that Israel should ensure that its definitions of terrorism and security 
suspects be precise and limited to countering terrorism and the maintenance of national 
security and are in full conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, para. 13). Referring to the report of my predecessor, the 
concluding observations by the Committee on the Rights of the Child also urged your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government to ensure that any definition of terrorist crimes is brought in line 
with international standards and norms (CRC/OPAC/ISR/CO/1, para. 35 (d)). The report of 
the Working Group on the UPR of Israel also contains recommendations in the context of 
countering terrorism and human rights, including a recommendation that Israel intensify its 
efforts to ensure that human rights are fully respected in the fight against terrorism and that 
the country redouble its efforts to guarantee the protection of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in the fight against terrorism, paying particular attention to the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism on this subject (A/HRC/10/76, para. 
100.30). 
</p>
<p>21. I am encouraged by the efforts of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to review its 
terrorism legislation and to provide for a comprehensive counter-terrorism legislation on 
the basis of the Counter-terrorism Memorandum Bill published by the Ministry of Justice 
on 21 April 2010, and the Memorandum Bill with a view to revoking parts of the 1945 
Defense (Emergency) Regulations published by the Ministry of Justice on 27 February 
2012. With respect to the Counter-terrorism memorandum Bill, while I am not in a position 
to review the Bill in its entirety due to linguistic constraints, I am concerned by reports that 
I have received that it includes an overly-broad definition of terrorism and related crimes. It 
is reported that the definition of a &#8213;terrorist organization&#8214;, for example, might apply to 
organizations which do not carry out terrorist acts <i>per se</i>, but are seen to promote other 
organizations that are terrorist in nature through specific humanitarian activities. Coupled 
with the increase of prison sentences for crimes that are defined as terrorist crimes in the 
Bill in comparison to &#8213;ordinary&#8214; criminal acts as prescribed by the Penal Law of Israel, and 
</p>
<p>broad and vague definitions of new ancilliary offences of terrorism such as publicly 
supporting a terrorist organization, attempting to recruit members, inciting terrorist acts, 
failure to prevent a terrorist act, threatening to perpetrate a terrorist act, or training or 
providing instructions to perpetrate a terrorist act, this might give rise to concerns in 
relation to the principle of legality as enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights and other rights and freedoms such as the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression or freedom of association, as protected by articles 19 and 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I would further like to register my 
concerns about reports received that the Bill would introduce a rule of reversed burden of 
proof on a person that was once determined to be a member of a terrorist organization to 
prove that membership has ceased. I would also like to highlight my concerns about reports 
that the Memorandum Bill concerning the partial revocation of the 1945 Defense 
(Emergency) Regulations contains a provision to the effect that, if adopted, it would make </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>the revocation of the relevant provisions of the 1945 Defense (Emergency) Regulations 
conditional upon the entry into force of the provisions of the Counter-terrorism 
Memorandum Bill. This could be interpreted as a move to discourage the Israeli High Court 
of Justice from striking down as unconstitutional, once it enters into force, the Counter-
terrorism Memorandum Bill, or parts of it that cover the same subject matter, as this would 
mean that the provisions of the 1945 Defense (Emergency) Regulations, which are immune 
against judicial scrutiny because they predate the Israeli constitutional provisions contained 
in the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, regained legal force. 
</p>
<p>22. My understanding is that the Counter-terrorism Memorandum Bill was presented, on 
27 March 2011, to the Ministerial Committee for Legislation, and approved by this 
Committee, but that this approval was appealed by three Ministers (as members of this 
Committee) on 22 June 2011. I am informed that the complete Bill was officially published 
on 27 July 2011 and passed the first reading in the Knesset on 3 August 2011; and 
subsequently transferred for deliberations in the Constitution and Law Committee. 
</p>
<p>23. As regards the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law, I share the concerns of 
the Human Rights Committee at its continued application and declaration of conformity 
with the Basic Law by Israel&#8216;s Supreme Court (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, para. 13), 
recently by its decision Administrative Detention Appeal 3133/11 in the case of <i>Sarsak v. 
State of Israel, </i>and reiterate my recommendation, to repeal the Law without replacement, 
alongside the one of the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, <i>ibid</i>.) and 
the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4/Add.1, para. 17). 
</p>
<p><b>  Interrogation methods 
</b></p>
<p>24. In the country mission report, my predecessor welcomed the decision of the Israeli 
Supreme Court, sitting as the High Court of Justice, in <i>Public Committee against Torture in 
Israel v. The State of Israel</i>, HCJ 5100/94, determined regarding interrogation techniques 
by the Israeli Security Agency (ISA) but recommended that urgent steps be taken by your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government to ensure full compliance with that decision and associated 
</p>
<p>international obligations. Since the proper application of the necessity defence under article 
34 (11) of the Penal Law cannot validate conduct amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment, it was further recommended that steps be taken to establish 
mechanisms by which victims of such conduct are provided with an effective remedy. 
Given the concerns that my predecessor had with the independence of the ISA complaints 
inspector, the non-derogable and peremptory nature of the prohibitions, and the apparent 
lack of understanding by ISA officers of the parameters of the necessity defence, it was 
further recommended that all complaints of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment be referred to the Attorney General&#8216;s office for immediate actions to be taken 
</p>
<p>against the individual interrogator, and that only the courts may pronounce on the 
applicability and effect of the necessity defence (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 56).  
</p>
<p>25. The Committee against Torture, in its most recent concluding observations on Israel, 
reiterated its previous recommendation that your Excellency&#8216;s Government completely 
remove necessity as a possible justification for the crime of torture (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, 
para. 14), after having established that the &#8215;necessity defense&#8216; exception may still arise in 
</p>
<p>cases of &#8215;ticking bombs,&#8216; i.e., interrogation of terrorist suspects or persons otherwise 
holding information about potential terrorist attacks, despite the abovementioned decision 
of the Israeli Supreme Court (<i>ibid.</i>). Furthermore, concerned by numerous, ongoing and 
consistent allegations of the use of methods applied by Israeli security officials that were 
prohibited by the abovementioned September 1999 ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and 
that are alleged to take place before, during and after interrogations, the Committee 
recommended that Israel should ensure that interrogation methods contrary to the 
Convention against Torture not be utilized under any circumstances and that all allegations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>of torture and ill-treatment be promptly and effectively investigated and perpetrators 
prosecuted and, if applicable, appropriate penalties be imposed. The Committee further 
reiterated that, according to the Convention against Torture, &#8213;no exceptional 
</p>
<p>circumstances&#8214; including security or war or threat to security of the State justifies torture 
(CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 19). Moreover, the Committee recommended that your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government duly investigate all allegations of torture and ill-treatment by 
creating a fully independent and impartial mechanism outside the ISA based on data that 
none of the over 600 complaints of ill-treatment by ISA interrogators received by the 
Inspector of Complaints between 2001 and 2008 had resulted in a<b> </b>criminal investigation, 
and that out of 550 examinations of torture allegations initiated by the GSS inspector 
between 2002 and 2007, only 4 resulted in disciplinary measures and none in prosecution 
(CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 21), as explained in the report of my predecessor 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 19). 
</p>
<p>26. I am very concerned about reports I have received alleging that the decision of the 
Supreme Court of 1999 is not fully complied with by the General Security Service (GSS) in 
the interrogation of security suspects. There are allegations that there is still a permit system 
in place based on GSS &#8213;necessity interrogations regulations&#8214; by which the authorization of 
</p>
<p>the use of &#8213;special means&#8214; in interrogation is given by the Head of the GSS, although both 
</p>
<p>the use of physical means during the course of interrogations and such regulations have 
been prohibited by the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>27. I note the Committee against Torture&#8216;s assessment that according to non-
governmental organizations the decline in the number of complaints of torture and ill-
treatment submitted was allegedly due to a sense of futility based on the absence of 
indictments and a sense of <i>de facto </i>impunity (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 21). I also note the 
information and statistics provided by your Excellency&#8216;s Government to the Committee 
</p>
<p>pursuant to its follow up procedure on examinations by the Inspector for Complaints 
against ISA interrogators which indicate that none of the examinations opened during the 
years 2006 &#8211; 2009 resulted in the submission of criminal charges. I note that your 
Government attributes this to the fact that all interrogations had been conducted according 
to law and procedures, and no ill-treatment or torture took place during the interrogations 
(CAT/C/ISR/CO/4/Add.1, paras. 23 &#8211; 29).  
</p>
<p>28. While welcoming the modification of certain procedures and interrogation 
techniques as a result of some investigations (<i>ibid</i>.) as a very first step in the right direction, 
I regret that it would appear that your Excellency&#8216;s Government has not taken steps to 
</p>
<p>separate the investigations into complaints directed against ISA and GSS interrogators in 
the security and counter-terrorism context. I reiterate the non-derogable and peremptory 
nature of the prohibition of torture and urge your Excellency&#8216;s Government to give serious 
</p>
<p>consideration to providing for courts of law as the proper venue for the examination of 
complaints during a criminal trial. The ratification as soon as possible of the Optional 
Protocol on the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) would further strengthen the 
independent monitoring of the conduct of Israel&#8216;s security agencies. 
</p>
<p><b>  Arrest and detention of security suspects, including children in the military  
</b></p>
<p><b>court system 
</b></p>
<p>29. With regard to arrest and detention, it was recommended in the report of my 
predecessor that Israel take steps to ensure that all persons are informed of the reasons for 
their detention at the time of their arrest and the amendment of the Criminal Procedures 
(Non-Resident Detainee Suspected of Security Offense) (Temporary Provision) Law 2006 
to ensure that security suspects are provided with immediate and continued access to legal 
counsel and, where appropriate, family visits. In the context of administrative detention, it 
was recommended that the terms &#8213;security of the area&#8214; and &#8213;public security&#8214;, currently </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>under Military Order 1229, be defined with precision, and that steps be taken, such as the 
establishment of a panel of security-cleared counsel, to ensure that representations are able 
to be made to the district court on behalf of a detainee upon the making or extension of 
administrative detention orders. Furthermore, my predecessor urged that the practice of 
military or other courts authorizing administrative detention on the basis of evidence 
available neither to the detainee nor counsel be discontinued as incompatible with article 14 
(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 
57). He further urged your Excellency&#8216;s Government to ensure that counter-terrorism law 
and practice are never used as a pretext for preventing or undermining the development of 
democracy in Palestinian territory. He specifically recommended that the detention or 
imprisonment of a child be used as a measure of last resort, that solitary confinement never 
be used by prison authorities as a means of coercion or punishment of children, and that all 
facilities in which children are detained provide educational care appropriate to the age of 
each child (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 58). 
</p>
<p>30. Since the publication of the report, and based on continuing concerns it had in this 
respect, the Human Rights Committee recommended to your Excellency&#8216;s Government that 
any person arrested or detained on a criminal charge, including persons suspected of 
security-related offences, has immediate access to a lawyer, for example by introducing a 
regime of Special Advocates with access to all evidence, including classified evidence, as 
well as immediate access to a judge (CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, para. 13). The Committee 
also recommended that your Excellency&#8216;s Government should refrain from using 
administrative detention, in particular for children, and ensure that detainees&#8216; rights to fair 
trial are upheld at all times (<i>ibid.</i>, para. 7). The recommendations of the Committe against 
Torture are also relevant in this regard. In its concluding observations the Committee called 
on Israel to examine its legislation and policies in order to ensure that all detainees, without 
exception, are promptly brought before a judge and have prompt access to a lawyer. The 
Committee also emphasized that detainees should have prompt access to an independent 
doctor and family member, as these are important means for the protection of suspects, 
offering added safeguards against torture and ill-treatment and should always be guaranteed 
to persons accused of security offenses (CAT/C/ISR/CO/4/Add.1, para. 15). Based on 
similar concerns the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination also has 
recently recommended that Israel should ensure equal access to justice for all persons 
residing in territories under the State party&#8216;s effective control, and urged Israel to end its 
</p>
<p>current practice of administrative detention since it was operated in a discriminatory 
manner and thus constitutes arbitrary detention under international human rights law 
(CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 27). 
</p>
<p>31. I regret that despite the recommendation of my predecessor (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, 
para. 57) it is the intention of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to include, in its revised anti-
terror legislation, provisions based on the Criminal Procedures (Non-Resident Detainee 
Suspected of Security Offence) (Temporary Provision) Law 2006. These provisions allow 
for significant pre-trial delays before providing access to a lawyer, as well as for decisions 
on the extension of detention to be taken, in exceptional circumstances, in the absence of a 
suspect (cf. CCPR/C/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, para. 13). It is further regrettable that the validity of 
the Law itself, which was supposed to be of a temporary nature, pending the completion of 
the enactment of the new anti-terrorism legislation, was extended until 31 December 2012. 
It contains a modified provision of its article 5, which enables courts to conduct detention 
hearings <i>in absentia</i> for suspects charged with security offences, in substantially the same 
terms as the provision that was struck down by the Supreme Court of Israel on 
proportionality grounds. 
</p>
<p>32. It is my understanding that there have not been any amendments to Military Order 
1229, which in my view lacks precision in relation to the terms &#8213;security of the area&#8214; and 
</p>
<p>&#8213;public security&#8214; used as a basis for administrative detention orders. In addition, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>military &#8213;Order on Security Provisions [Consolidated Version] (Judea and Samaria) (No. 
</p>
<p>1651) 5770-2009&#8214; of 1 November 2009, which entered into force on 2 May 2010, as 
amended by the amendments promulgated by the Israeli Defense Force Military 
Commander on 2 February 2012, purporting to consolidate relevant Military Orders issued 
in the West Bank on issues such as detention, criminal and criminal procedure law, and 
administrative orders, still provides for pre-indictment detention by a military commander 
for up to three months, if approved by a military judge and a military appeals judge, on the 
basis of &#8213;reasonable grounds to believe that reasons of regional security or public security&#8214; 
</p>
<p>without defining the terms &#8213;regional security&#8214; or &#8213;public security&#8214;. Although judicial 
</p>
<p>review within 96 hours of the administrative detention order is foreseen in the Security 
Provisions, and the previous maximum period of detention was lowered from six to three 
months by the amendments of February 2012, I am concerned about the still excessive 
length of permissive pre-charge detention periods, and the fact that the judge may deviate 
from rules of evidence, which includes the possibility of accepting evidence in the absence 
of the detainee or his/her representative or without disclosing it to them, if the judge is 
convinced that disclosing the evidence to the detainee or his representative may harm 
regional security or public security. I understand that such decisions can be made in the 
absence of the detainee and his/her legal representative. This is in conflict with several 
guarantees contained in articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>33. According to the statistics provided by the Israeli Defence Force and the Israeli 
Prison Service, at the end of March 2012, Israeli authorities were holding a total of 4,386 
Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including 1 detainee under the Incarceration of 
Unlawful Combatants Law and 320 administrative detainees. I am particularly concerned 
about reports I have received that your Excellency&#8216;s Government continues to detain 
Palestinian minors from the age of 12, mainly on security related grounds and that certain 
of these children have alleged that they have been beaten, kicked, verbally abused or 
threatened upon arrest or in detention and that many claim to have confessed during 
typically coercive interrogations. In addition, solitary confinement of minors is still 
reported. I share the particular concern expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination in its recent conlcuding observations concerning Israel that there has 
been an increase in the number of arrests and in the detention of children and in the 
undermining of their judicial guarantees. I also share the Committee's concern about the 
maintenance of an administrative detentions system for Palestinian children and adults alike 
based on evidence that is kept secret for security reasons (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, 
para. 27). 
</p>
<p>34. The report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the implementation of 
Human Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 also reports on the ongoing violations 
in this respect (A/HRC/16/71, para. 48). In two of its Opinions, the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention considered the detention of Palestinians who were minors at the time of 
their arrests, and were served with several consecutive administrative detention orders 
approved by a military court under Military Orders No. 378 and 1591 on the basis of secret 
evidence. The Working Group considered these actions to amount to arbitrary detention on 
a number of grounds (Opinions No. 5/2010 and 9/2010 &#8211; A/HRC/16/47/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>35. At the end of November 2011, there were reportedly 33 juvenile detainees under the 
age of 16 and 126 detainees in the age bracket of 16 to 18 in various Israeli Prison Service 
detention facilities, including detainees detained inside Israel in violation of article 76 of 
the Fourth Geneva Convention. I regret the decision of the Supreme Court of Israel sitting 
as the High Court of Justice of 28 March 2010 in the case of <i>Yesh Din et al v. Commander 
of the Military Forces in the West Bank</i>, which approved this general policy since both the 
decision and the policy are incompatible with international customary law and because they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>infringe the right of the concerned Palestinian detainees to respect for their family life due 
to the travel restrictions imposed on residents of the West Bank.  
</p>
<p>36. I concur with the recommendation in the concluding observations of the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child concerning Israel, namely that it should never hold criminal 
proceedings against children in military courts and should never subject children to 
administrative detention (CRC/C/OPAC/ISR/CO/1, para. 35). I fail to see how the creation 
of a juvenile military court in September 2009 has contributed to any improvement in the 
situation when there appear to be few substantive differences between adult and juvenile 
military courts. According to reports I have received, in 2009 the rate prison terms imposed 
on Palestinian juveniles by military courts was 83 per cent compared to 6.5 per cent in the 
Israeli civilian juvenile justice system. While again I do not make a judgement as to the 
impartiality of individual military judges, the fact remains that military courts have an 
appearance of a lack of independence and impartiality, which on its own brings into 
question the fairness of trials (cf. A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 29) and other proceedings 
especially when applied to minors. 
</p>
<p><b>  Construction of a barrier and Jewish settlements in the oPt and its impact on the  
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian people 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b> </b>My predecessor noted, in his country mission report, the negative impact of the 
barrier on the enjoyment of human rights by the Palestinian people, and the continuing 
deterioration in the socio-economic conditions of many parts of the West Bank attributable 
to it. He noted these deleterious effects notwithstanding the correlation between the 
construction of the barrier and the reduction in the number of successful terrorist attacks 
against Israeli civilians (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 31). He was also troubled by the 
approach of the Supreme Court of Israel, which rejected the outcome of the Advisory 
Opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),12 and instead accepted the legitimacy 
and continued construction of the barrier on the basis of military necessity and the need to 
secure the safety of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. He acknowledged that decisions 
of the Supreme Court had addressed the exact route of the barrier and often ordered 
changes to it, but had failed to address the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 34). Given the illegality under international law of the existence 
and continued development of Jewish settlements in the oPt, my predecessor recommended 
in his report, that a decision be made immediately to withdraw all such settlements and to 
replace the still unfinished barrier, extending deep into Palestinian territory, with a security 
infrastructure that, by its geographical position, respects the Green Line or is otherwise 
accepted by the Palestinians. During the process of implementing such a decision, my 
predecessor recommended urgent action to ensure that the permits regime, the 
administration of checkpoints, and all other associated measures in the oPt do not have a 
disproportionate impact on the enjoyment of civil, cultural, economic, political and social 
rights in the territory. It was also recommended that security measures be civilianized 
through means other than their privatization (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 59). 
</p>
<p>38. I am concerned about the reports I continue to receive about the expansion of Israeli 
settlements in the oPt and the ongoing construction of the barrier in the West Bank, which 
both continue to have a devastating effect on the life of Palestinians living in the oPt as is 
evidenced by numerous reports published since the mission to Israel, including the oPt, in 
July 2007. Two reports from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs &#8211; 
occupied Palestinian territory (OCHA/oPt) and the World Health Organization&#8216;s West 
</p>
<p>  
 12 <i>Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Advisory 
</i></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>Bank &amp; Gaza Office from July 201013 and from OCHA/oPt from July 201114 illustrate the 
concerns that have already been expressed in my predecessor&#8216;s report that the barrier has 
</p>
<p>counterproductive effects by contributing to conditions that are conducive to the 
recruitment to terrorism (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 43). The continued construction of the 
barrier that will run to 85% inside the West Bank once completed, rather than along the 
Green Line, coupled with its associated gate and permit regime, impact on the lives of the 
Palestinian people, especially in rural areas where agricultural practice has been severely 
curtailed and livelihoods and access to work, education, and health, including emergency 
medical treatment, undermined. It is striking that more than 90 per cent of applications of 
Palestinians for &#8213;visitor&#8214; permits to enter their land situated in the Closed Area or &#8213;Seam 
</p>
<p>Zone&#8214; (i.e. the area between the Green Line and the barrier) in the northern West Bank 
between 2006 and 2009 were said to have been rejected due to a failure to prove 
&#8213;connection to the land&#8214; rather than due to security concerns, according to data of the 
</p>
<p>Israeli State Attorney.15 The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the 
right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this 
context, stressed similar concerns upon conclusion of her visit on official mission to Israel 
and the oPt between 30 January and 12 February 2012.16 
</p>
<p>39. It is therefore with great regret that I have learned about a series of decisions of the 
Supreme Court of Israel sitting as the High Court of Justice rejecting legal challenges 
against the barrier and the accompanying gates and permit regime. I am aware that on 
occasion the Court has ordered the Government to modify the route of the barrier in order 
to reduce the impact on the affected people. A recent decision of 22 August 2011 concerned 
a petition of the village of Voluja, whose Northern part is situated within the municipality 
of Jerusalem, whereas its Southern part lies within the West Bank. I understand that the 
village petitioned against the proposed route of the barrier on the ground that it will cut 
through the village. They also petitioned against the seizure of land ordered by the Israeli 
Defence Forces&#8216; (IDF) military commander in the West Bank for its construction. 
</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Court accepted the planned route of the barrier following modifications 
made by the State as striking a proportionate balance between the security concerns of 
Israel and the harm caused to the village and its people. In another decision of 5 April 2011, 
the Court rejected a petition to revoke the permit regime, whilst ordering your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government to introduce some adjustments to the system, including the provisions 
permitting the passage of permanent residents through any available access point along the 
barrier, and provisions expanding the grounds for the granting of &#8213;visitor&#8214; or resident 
</p>
<p>permits and setting a reasonable time frame for the processing of application. 
</p>
<p><b>  Use of force in counter-terrorism operations, including targeted killings 
</b></p>
<p>40. As the underlying premise of this decision runs counter to the Advisory Opinion of 
the ICJ, for the reasons outlined above and in the mission report of my predecessor, I call 
on your Excellency&#8216;s Government to halt the construction of the barrier, dismantle the 
</p>
<p>sections already completed, and repeal the gate and permit regime in compliance with the 
ICJ Advisory Opinion, General Assembly17 and Human Rights Council resolutions18 and 
recommendations by the Human Rights Committee (CCPRC/ISR/CO/3, para. 16), and the

<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16,

</p>
<p>41. In relation to operations of IDF, my predecessor recommended to your Excellency&#8216;s 
Government to respect the rules of international humanitarian law, including the 
fundamental requirement of distinguishing between civilians and military objectives when 
resorting to the use of force. This is a binding obligation on your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
irrespective of whether Israel is responding to an armed attack from Gaza, Lebanon or 
elsewhere and whether or not it classifies the attack as an act of terrorism 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 60). While acknowledging that military necessity may dictate 
the deliberate killing of enemy combatants during an armed conflict, it was further 
recommended that transparent laws and guidelines on the practice of targeted killings be 
established, and that they be strictly limited to persons directly participating in hostilities 
and as a means of last resort after all possible measures to apprehend the person have been 
taken. All such killings must be followed by a thorough and independent investigation as to 
the accuracy of the identification of the target, whether alternative means were available, 
and whether the action was undertaken in a manner ensuring that no civilian casualties were 
caused. The result of such investigations should be made public and, where violations of 
law are established, adequate reparation made (A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, para. 62). 
</p>
<p>42. I am concerned about the conclusions of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission 
on the Gaza Conflict19 (the Fact-Finding Mission) from 27 December 2008 to 18 January 
2009, which, among other things, found that &#8213;[i]n a number of cases Israel failed to take 
feasible precautions [...] to avoid or minimize incidental loss of civilian life ...&#8214; (<i>ibid</i>., para. 
1919), and &#8213;[f]ound numerous instances of deliberate attacks on civilians [...] in violation of 
the fundamental international humanitarian law principle of distinction, resulting in deaths 
and serious injuries.&#8214; (<i>ibid.</i>, para. 1921). The incidents cited include the use of Palestinians 
by Israeli armed forces as &#8213;human shields&#8214; in violation of international humanitarian law 
and the right to life as protected by article 6 ICCPR (<i>ibid.</i>, para. 1925). According to the 
information at my disposal, this resulted in the deaths of 764 Palestinians in the Gaza strip 
who were not taking part in the hostilities.  
</p>
<p>43. According to the Human Rights Committee, at the time of the adoption of its 
concluding observations on Israel, there had only been limited independent and credible 
investigations into alleged violations of international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law by your Excellency&#8216;s Government, and few indictments or convictions.20 
The Committee of Independent Experts, established by the Human Rights Council by 
resolution 13/9 to follow up the conclusions of the Fact-Finding Mission, raised concerns in 
its first report about the operation of Israel's military investigations system. Specifically, the 
Committee concluded that the dual role of the Military Advocate General (MAG) in 
providing legal advice to the IDF with respect to the planning and execution of &#8213;Operation 
Cast Lead&#8214; and at the same time having responsibility for the conduct of all prosecutions of 
</p>
<p>alleged misconduct by IDF soldiers during the operations in Gaza, gives rise to a clear 
conflict of interest. This is particularly so in light of the Fact-Finding Mission's provisional 
view that those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operation were complicit 
in violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. The 
mere fact of this allegation by a body appointed by the UN bears on whether the MAG can 
be regarded as independent and impartial in performing its role of investigating these 
serious allegations.21 In its second report, the Committee found that Israel had initiated 
investigations into 400 allegations of operational misconduct, of which, however, only 
</p>
<p>  
 19 A/HRC/12/48. 
 20 CCPR/ISR/CO/3/CRP.1, para. 9. 
 21 A/HRC/15/50, para. 91. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>three had lead to disciplinary actions and only one to the laying of criminal charges against 
an Israeli soldier.22  
</p>
<p>44. While regretting the lack of thorough investigations, I welcome that your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government has, to an extent, implemented the recommendation of the Fact-
Finding Mission contained in paragraph 1972 (c) of its report,23 that Israel should initiate a 
review of the rules of engagement, standard operating procedures, open fire regulations and 
other guidance for military and security personnel, as reported by the Secretary-General.24<b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. As far as targeted killings are concerned, according to the information at my 
disposal a total of 254 Palestinians have been the object of targeted killings by Israeli 
security forces since September 2000, 21 of whom were killed since &#8213;Operation Cast 
</p>
<p>Lead&#8214;. Mindful of the shortcomings that my predecessor has identified in the judgement of 
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court of Israel concerning the issue of the legality of targeted killings 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, paras. 51 &#8211; 52), with which I concur, I am particularly concerned 
about allegations received, albeit reportedly denied by your Excellency&#8216;s Government, that 
</p>
<p>Israeli forces are alleged to have conducted targeted killings in violation of the Supreme 
Court&#8216;s requirements after the mission of my predecessor.25 Against this background I 
sustain the concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee that Israel &#8213;should end 
</p>
<p>its practice of extrajudicial executions of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist 
activities. The State party should ensure that all its agents uphold the principle of 
proportionality in their responses to terrorist threats and activities. It should further ensure 
that utmost care is used to protect every civilian&#8216;s right to life, including civilians in the 
Gaza Strip. The State party should exhaust all measures to arrest and detain a person 
suspected of involvement in terrorist activities before resorting to the use of deadly force. 
The State party should further establish an independent body to promptly and thoroughly 
investigate complaints about disproportionate use of force.&#8214;26<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Demolition of housing and destruction of property as a means of combating terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>46. Despite the recommendation of my predecessor to ensure that any demolition of 
housing or other destruction of private property conducted as a measure aimed at combating 
or preventing terrorism must be carried out in strict compliance with international law and 
must be accompanied by adequate reparation, and his recommendation that your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government exercise extreme caution in resorting to such measures due to 
</p>
<p>their high emotional impact eand their potentially counterproductive effects in a sustainable 
fight against terrorism (A/HRC/6/17Add.4, para. 61), three Treaty Bodies have been 
satisfied that such practices have continued in the oPt without compensation since my 
country mission, and have urged your Excellency&#8216;s Government to cease them27 According 
to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, forced evictions and demolition of 
Palestinian structures have increased recently so that approximately 1,300 Palestinians, 
including 700 children, were forcibly displaced or otherwise negatively affected 
(A/HRC/16/71, para. 30). 
</p>

Excellency&#8216;s Government could provide me with detailed substantive information on the

<p>appropriate in following up on the recommendations in my predecessor&#8216;s country visit 
report, at your earliest convenience, but no later than 31 May 2012: 
</p>
<p>1. In view of the Counter-terrorism Memorandum Bill and the Memorandum 
Bill concerning the partial revocation of the 1945 Defense (Emergency) Regulations 
pending before the Knesset please provide detailed information on what steps your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government has taken to bring Israel&#8216;s anti-terrorism legislation fully into 
compliance with applicable international human rights norms and standards? In particular, 
how would a determination of membership in a terrorist organization be made should the 
Counter-terrorism Memorandum Bill be enacted into law? I would appreciate receiving the 
text of the Bills in its present state from your Excellency&#8216;s Government in the English 
language, if possible, and offer the advice and assistance of my mandate to verify the 
compliance of its provisions with applicable international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>2. Is your Excellency&#8216;s Government considering repealing the Incarceration of 
Unlawful Combatants Law without replacement?  
</p>
<p>3. Please provide updated statistics on the handling of ISA related complaints 
and corresponding statistics on the handling and outcome of GSS related complaints of 
torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>4. What steps is your Excellency&#8216;s Government taking to establish mechanisms 
outside of the respective security agencies against which complaints are directed by which 
victims of interrogation methods applied in the counter-terrorism context and amounting to 
torture or other forms of ill-treatment are provided with an effective remedy? 
</p>
<p>5. What plans does your Excellency&#8216;s Government have to ratify OPCAT? 
</p>
<p>6. What steps is your Excellency&#8216;s Government undertaking to ensure that 
security detainees enjoy all rights and guarantees enshrined in applicable international 
human rights instruments, particularly in articles 7, 9 and 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture, and articles 37 and 40 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child in view of minors? 
</p>
<p>7. What measures is your Excellency&#8216;s Government taking to comply with its 
international legal obligations in relation to the construction of the barrier and its associated 
gates and permit regime as mentioned in the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of 
Justice of 9 July 2004? 
</p>
<p>8. Please provide detailed information on the outcome of the review carried out 
by your Excellency&#8216;s Government of the rules of engagement, standard operating 
procedures, open fire regulations and other guidance for military and security personnel, in 
the context of the use of force in counter-terrorism measures and explain whether they are 
in compliance with international law norms and standards with a view to the assessments 
made by my predecessor in his country mission report. 
</p>
<p>9. Please provide updated information on the steps taken by your Excellency&#8216;s 
Government to implement the recommendations of the United Nations Fact Finding 
Mission on the Gaza Conflict in relation to independent and credible investigations into 
alleged violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in 
the context of countering terrorism. 
</p>
<p>10. In relation to the alleged targeted killings of terrorist suspects, I would like to 
receive information on the rules of international law that your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
</p>
<p>considers to govern its determination that people be targeted and the basis for a 
determination to kill rather than capture; clarity as to which treaty instruments or customary 
norms are considered to apply to target and kill individuals, including terrorist suspects; the </p>

<p>legal basis, your Excellency&#8216;s Government invokes to determine the targeted individual to 
</p>
<p>be a combatant or a civilian directly participating in hostilities; whether your Excellency&#8216;s 
Government considers its determination to be governed by the law applicable to the use of 
inter-State force and the international law doctrine of self-defense, and whether self-defense 
is invoked in addition or as an alternate to international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>11. What steps is your Excellency&#8216;s Government taking in order to prevent 
violations of applicable international humanitarian and human rights law, in particular, 
articles 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, 43 of the Hague Hague Regulations, and 11 
(1) of the International Covenant on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, when resorting to the demolition of Palestinian structures?

contra el terrorismo de acuerdo con la resoluci&#243;n 15/15 del Consejo de los Derechos

del 7 al 15 de mayo del a&#241;o 2008 (A/HRC/10/3/Add.2).

<p>52. A la luz del desarrollo de una serie de acontecimientos que han tenido lugar desde 
mi visita, incluyendo la adopci&#243;n de Observaciones Finales sobre Espa&#241;a por el Comit&#233; de

la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal espa&#241;ol (LEC) que permite el uso de la detenci&#243;n en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n durante cinco d&#237;as consecutivos bajo custodia policial cuando 
existen sospechas de delitos de terrorismo. Descubr&#237; que, durante dicho periodo de 
detenci&#243;n, a los sospechosos detenidos no se le permit&#237;a hablar en privado con sus propios 
abogados ni ser atendidos por un m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n y por tanto, hice la recomendaci&#243;n

<p>de la erradicaci&#243;n total de este excepcional r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n.30 Soy consciente de las 
medidas de regulaci&#243;n y salvaguarda as&#237; como de las medidas administrativas que se han 
establecido para que el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n solo sea aplicado en casos 
excepcionales acordes al art&#237;culo 509.1 de la LEC y para garantizar el respeto de los 
derechos fundamentales de los detenidos por parte de funcionarios policiales. Sin embargo, 
existen indicios de que dichos mecanismos no se est&#225;n aplicando de manera consecuente y 
de que, en los casos de sospechosos de terrorismo, de acuerdo con estad&#237;sticas realizadas en 
el per&#237;odo 2000-2007, &#233;stos han sido sujetos de manera sistem&#225;tica a este r&#233;gimen 
excepcional de detenci&#243;n (en m&#225;s de un 90% de los casos) incluso cuando, 
subsecuentemente, han sido puestos en libertad por la polic&#237;a antes de su comparecencia 
ante un juez.31 Tambi&#233;n comparto las preocupaciones expresadas recientemente por el 
Comit&#233; Europeo para la prevenci&#243;n de la tortura y de las Penas o Tratos Inhumanos o 
Degradantes (CPT), publicadas en su reciente y detallado informe tras su visita a Espa&#241;a, 
elaborado sobre el r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n incomunicada, donde se inclu&#237;an las deficiencias 
relacionadas con la notificaci&#243;n de custodia, acceso a un abogado o a un m&#233;dico, 
procedimientos de interrogaci&#243;n, registros de custodia, informaci&#243;n de los derechos y la 
situaci&#243;n legal, aplicaci&#243;n del r&#233;gimen a menores as&#237; como el escrutinio judicial 
correspondiente por parte de la Audiencia Nacional sobre los sospechosos de delitos de 
terrorismo a los que se aplica el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n.32 En lo concerniente a la 
videovigilancia de los detenidos en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n33, si se aplicara 
sistem&#225;ticamente, tendr&#237;a en mi opini&#243;n el potencial para convertirse en una medida eficaz 
de prevenci&#243;n de un comportamiento inapropiado de los funcionarios policiales y de 
acusaciones infundadas por parte de los detenidos. Sin embargo, la eficacia de esta medida 
depende exclusivamente de su instalaci&#243;n e uso continuado en todas y cada una de las 
instalaciones utilizadas para los interrogatorios y combinada con la supervisi&#243;n apropiada 
de las celdas de detenci&#243;n, bajo control exclusivo del detenido en lo referente al derecho de 
su privacidad, o utilizada para grabar todo movimiento de entrada y salida de la celda, 
durante el per&#237;odo integro de la detenci&#243;n. Adicionalmente, las grabaciones obtenidas 
deber&#237;an encontrarse a disposici&#243;n de los abogados y de las instituciones pertinentes de 
supervisi&#243;n en el caso de necesidad de verificaci&#243;n de los hechos y deber&#237;an establecerse 
las garant&#237;as apropiadas para el correcto funcionamiento de esta medida. Las deficiencias 
de este sistema, especialmente si son debidas a la falta de cooperaci&#243;n por parte de las 
autoridades policiales, ponen en serio peligro la credibilidad de esta salvaguarda. En este 
sentido, me siento negativamente sorprendido al recibir informes concernientes a la 
negaci&#243;n, con fecha del 16 de abril del 2010, por parte del Departamento del Interior del 
Pa&#237;s Vasco, de proporcionar las videograbaciones de la detenci&#243;n incomunicada de varios 
sospechosos de delitos de terrorismo a principios del mes de febrero del 201034, al Defensor 
del Pueblo del Pais Vasco, lo cual impidi&#243; a &#233;ste la realizaci&#243;n de su funci&#243;n supervisora de

<p>momento en el que se present&#243; la denuncia y se abri&#243; una investigaci&#243;n judicial, el material 
audiovisual pertinente ya hab&#237;a sido destruido. 
</p>
<p>54. Un tema relacionado, tambi&#233;n citado en el informe de mi misi&#243;n, son las continuas 
denuncias por parte de detenidos en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n de haber sufrido torturas u 
otros tratos y penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes prohibidos expresamente por el CPT, 
mientras se encontraban bajo custodia policial. En el a&#241;o 2008, el Comit&#233; de Derechos 
Humanos, en sus Observaciones Finales sobre Espa&#241;a, en concordancia con mis 
descubrimientos y declaraciones previas por parte de las Naciones Unidas as&#237; como otras 
instituciones internacionales cuya funci&#243;n incluye un mandato de monitorizaci&#243;n del 
cumplimiento de las obligaciones del respeto de los derechos humanos, hizo notar la 
ausencia de una &#8213;estrategia integral o de medidas adecuadas para erradicar esta situaci&#243;n de 
</p>
<p>una vez por todas&#8214;.36 En este respecto, soy consciente de la reciente condena, emitida por la 
Audiencia Provincial de Gipuzkoa, de cuatro miembros de la Guardia Civil por torturas 
cometidas a Igor Portu y Mattin Sarasola,37 de cuyo caso ya tuve conocimiento en mi visita 
a Espa&#241;a. Tambi&#233;n celebro el hecho de que la Audiencia enfatizara que la circunstancia de 
que ambos hombres hubieran sido condenados por graves delitos de terrorismo no 
desacreditaba sus denuncias de malos tratos. Sin embargo, las alegaciones que se me 
presentaron en mi visita, en relaci&#243;n a la ausencia de los mecanismos apropiados que hacen 
posible una eficaz y completa investigaci&#243;n de las denuncias de tortura de los detenidos en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n sospechosos de delitos de terrorismo, han sido corroboradas 
por recientes informaciones.38 As&#237; mismo ha llegado a mi conocimiento el hecho de que, de 
acuerdo con recientes estad&#237;sticas sobre las denuncias relacionadas con torturas u otros 
maltratos presentadas en el informe anual de la Fiscal&#237;a General del a&#241;o 2008, una cantidad 
sorprendentemente elevada de estas denuncias fueron desestimadas sin llegar a juicio. El 
CPT, en su informe previamente mencionado, concluye con la siguiente afirmaci&#243;n: &#8213;En la 
</p>
<p>situaci&#243;n actual, las autoridades (espa&#241;olas) pueden experimentar dificultades a la hora de 
negar de forma convincente las alegaciones de maltrato presentadas por personas a las que 
se les ha aplicado el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n as&#237; como cumplir con su obligaci&#243;n de 
llevar a cabo una investigaci&#243;n eficaz de dichas alegaciones&#8214;.39 
</p>
<p>55. Considero que la promoci&#243;n de definiciones estrictas y precisamente formuladas de 
los delitos de terrorismo es un aspecto importante de mi mandato como Relator Especial en 
el campo de los derechos humanos y de la lucha contra el terrorismo. Desde mi punto de 
vista, la aplicaci&#243;n de la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista deber&#237;a estar restringida a aquellos delitos 
que sobrepasen un cierto umbral de violencia, como establece la Resoluci&#243;n 1566 (2004) 
del Consejo de Seguridad y como elabor&#233; en mi reciente informe sobre pr&#225;cticas id&#243;neas en 
la lucha contra el terrorismo (A/HRC/16/51). He identificado en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola 
algunas medidas antiterroristas de formulaci&#243;n vaga as&#237; como los riesgos inherentes de la 
vaguedad de dichas redacciones a la hora de garantizar el pleno disfrute de los derechos 
humanos relacionados con la libertad de expresi&#243;n y asociaci&#243;n as&#237; como el derecho de 
asamblea pac&#237;fica. Espec&#237;ficamente, los art&#237;culos 515 y 516 del C&#243;digo Penal espa&#241;ol (CP) 
en los que se penaliza a las organizaciones terroristas y la pertenencia a tales 
organizaciones pero no proporcionan una definici&#243;n precisa y clara de dichos conceptos. Ha

<p>llamado mi atenci&#243;n el hecho de que la organizaci&#243;n terrorista ETA ha sido a menudo 
considerada, tanto a nivel pol&#237;tico como judicial, como una red formada por diferentes 
frentes con diferentes funciones donde todos promueven los objetivos de la organizaci&#243;n 
terrorista, incluyendo aquellas acciones pac&#237;ficas que no ten&#237;an una conexi&#243;n directa con la 
ejecuci&#243;n de acciones terroristas. Aunque me encuentro decididamente a favor de la 
reforma de la legislaci&#243;n penal antiterrorista que, en mi opini&#243;n, no cumple con los 
requisitos establecidos por los principios de legalidad, quisiera expresar mi apoyo a la 
Audiencia Nacional en su sentencia del 12 de abril del 2010 referente al peri&#243;dico 
Euskaldunon Egunkaria, en cuyo caso espec&#237;fico rechaza firmemente la credibilidad 
probatoria de la supuesta &#8213;omnipresencia&#8214; de ETA en diferentes &#225;mbitos sociales y 
</p>
<p>absuelve a los cinco acusados del delito de pertenencia a una organizaci&#243;n terrorista. 
Tambi&#233;n celebro el hecho de que la Audiencia cuestionara especialmente el cierre del 
peri&#243;dico como medida precautoria y reconociera los efectos ulteriores que dicha medida 
tiene en el ejercicio y disfrute de los derechos fundamentales que caracterizan a una 
sociedad democr&#225;tica.40 
</p>
<p>56. Durante mi misi&#243;n a Espa&#241;a, as&#237; como en otras ocasiones, he tenido la oportunidad 
de profundizar mi conocimiento de la legislaci&#243;n penal concerniente a la criminalizaci&#243;n 
del delito de glorificaci&#243;n o apolog&#237;a del terrorismo y los riesgos inherentes de dicha 
legislaci&#243;n, particularmente en lo relacionado con el disfrute y ejercicio de la libertad de 
expresi&#243;n y opini&#243;n. Con respecto a este delito espec&#237;fico, como se encuentra dispuesto en 
el Art&#237;culo 578 del C&#243;digo Penal espa&#241;ol, entiendo que, durante el a&#241;o 2010 fueron 
iniciados, por la Fiscal&#237;a de la Audiencia Nacional, 400 procedimientos relacionados 
espec&#237;ficamente con la muestra p&#250;blica de s&#237;mbolos o im&#225;genes de convictos por 
terrorismo. Aunque, en principio, pueda admitir que el llamado discurso simb&#243;lico, que 
incluye las im&#225;genes, pueda ser sujeto de enjuiciamiento criminal, soy de la opini&#243;n de que, 
para poder establecer espec&#237;ficamente el delito de glorificaci&#243;n del terrorismo, el ministerio 
fiscal tendr&#237;a que probar tanto la intenci&#243;n de incitar a la comisi&#243;n de un delito grave como 
el riesgo objetivo y real de que alguien, subsecuentemente, por efecto de esta incitaci&#243;n sea 
capaz de cometer delito de tal naturaleza. En referencia a la exposici&#243;n p&#250;blica, por parte de 
los familiares, de fotograf&#237;as de los presos convictos por terrorismo y pertenencia a la 
organizaci&#243;n terrorista ETA, soy de la opini&#243;n de que se deber&#237;a adoptar la presunci&#243;n de 
motivos de car&#225;cter humanitarios y con la intenci&#243;n de crear simpat&#237;a como base para tales 
expresiones y no deber&#237;an ser percibidos como una posible incitaci&#243;n a la violencia. Soy 
consciente de la sentencia de la Audiencia Nacional con fecha del 8 de octubre del 2010, en 
cuyo caso la Audiencia no consider&#243; que la muestra de fotograf&#237;as de presos de ETA por 
sus familiares supusiera un delito de glorificaci&#243;n del terrorismo ya que la intenci&#243;n de 
glorificar o justificar los delitos cometidos por tales convictos o humillar a las v&#237;ctimas, no 
pudo ser probada. Sin embargo, sigo preocupado por el hecho de que ni el art&#237;culo 578 del 
CP sobre el delito de glorificaci&#243;n del terrorismo ni la interpretaci&#243;n realizada por la 
Audiencia Nacional o el Tribunal Supremo espa&#241;ol41 pueden enmarcarse dentro de los 
requisitos citados anteriormente.

la Ley Org&#225;nica de los Partidos Pol&#237;ticos 6/2002 (LOPP), que regulan la disoluci&#243;n de 
partidos pol&#237;ticos que abogan el uso de la violencia y tienen conexi&#243;n con una organizaci&#243;n 
terrorista, varios partidos pol&#237;ticos vascos han sido declarados ilegales por ser considerados 
complementos de ETA. Consecuentemente, se les ha prohibido a miembros de estos 
partidos, el poder presentarse como candidatos a elecciones, tanto a nivel nacional como

partido pol&#237;tico que quisiera, a trav&#233;s de medios pol&#237;ticos pac&#237;ficos, alcanzar objetivos 
similares a aquellos asociados a grupos terroristas. Ha llegado a mi conocimiento, sin 
embargo, que el Tribunal Supremo, en su jurisprudencia con respecto a esta cuesti&#243;n 
espec&#237;fica, ha desarrollado unos criterios definidos que se han de tener en cuenta a la hora 
de evaluar la legalidad de las nuevas formaciones pol&#237;ticas establecidas por antiguos 
miembros de partidos disueltos con anterioridad. De acuerdo con la argumentaci&#243;n del 
Tribunal, tales formaciones no deben constituir una continuaci&#243;n o sucesi&#243;n de un partido 
que haya sido previamente declarado ilegal. Sin embargo, cuando existen indicaciones 
substanciales de que se da esta situaci&#243;n, el principio de onus probandi (carga o 
responsabilidad de prueba) recae sobre los promotores de la nueva organizaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica, 
quienes, mediante una clara y expresa condena y rechazo de la violencia desarrollada por 
ETA, deben demostrar que tales indicaciones carecen de fundamento.43 En este aspecto, he 
de se&#241;alar que los estatutos de Sortu, adem&#225;s de formular de forma expl&#237;cita y clara su 
intenci&#243;n de romper con el pasado, expresan su rechazo a la violencia terrorista y sus 
perpetradores as&#237; como una intenci&#243;n expl&#237;cita de contribuir a la definitiva desaparici&#243;n y 
cese de cualquier forma de violencia, en particular aquella cometida por ETA. 
Adicionalmente, estos principios fueron hechos p&#250;blicos el 7 de febrero del presente a&#241;o 
con ocasi&#243;n del anuncio de su constituci&#243;n como partido pol&#237;tico. 
</p>
<p>58. Con estos antecedentes, me sorprende el razonamiento del Tribunal Supremo en su 
decisi&#243;n de declarar inadmisible el registro del partido pol&#237;tico Sortu en el RPP en base a la 
argumentaci&#243;n de que representa una continuaci&#243;n o sucesi&#243;n de la organizaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica 
Batasuna declarada anteriormente ilegal y aprobada su disoluci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n mi informaci&#243;n, 
el art&#237;culo 12.3 de la LOPP establece que: &#8213;en particular, corresponder&#225; a la Sala 
</p>
<p>sentenciadora, previa audiencia de los interesados, declarar la improcedencia de la 
continuidad o sucesi&#243;n de un partido disuelto a la que se refiere el p&#225;rrafo b) del apartado 1, 
teniendo en cuenta que para determinar la conexi&#243;n y la similitud sustancial de ambos 
partidos pol&#237;ticos, de su estructura, organizaci&#243;n y funcionamiento, de las personas que los 
componen, rigen, presentan o administran, de la procedencia de los medios de financiaci&#243;n 
o materiales, o de cualesquiera otras circunstancias relevantes que, como su disposici&#243;n a 
apoyar la violencia o el terrorismo, permitan considerar dicha continuidad o sucesi&#243;n en 
contraste con los datos y documentos obrantes en el proceso en el que se decret&#243; la 
ilegalizaci&#243;n y disoluci&#243;n&#8214;. Sin embargo, en este caso espec&#237;fico, el Tribunal, en lo 
</p>
<p>referente a la existencia de los hechos considerados como constituyentes directos 
probatorios, tom&#243; la posici&#243;n de considerar innecesario un exhaustivo an&#225;lisis de los 
criterios enumerados en el art&#237;culo 12.3 de la LOPP para probar la sucesi&#243;n a trav&#233;s de 
medios fraudulentos de Batasuna por parte de Sortu. En mi opini&#243;n, s&#237; es necesario el pleno 
cumplimiento de criterios estrictos, de acuerdo con los principios de legalidad, a la hora de 
la limitaci&#243;n del derecho de participaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica para poder respetar los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales que regulan los derechos humanos fundamentales en el marco de una 
sociedad democr&#225;tica. Adicionalmente, considero que la promoci&#243;n de la tolerancia con 
todas las expresiones pol&#237;ticas radicales, si existen personas o grupos de personas que

que le sea posible pero no m&#225;s tarde de 27 de mayo 2011: 
</p>
<p>1. &#191;Qu&#233; medidas se han tomado para rectificar los art&#237;culos 520 bis, 527 y 509 
de la Ley de enjuiciamiento criminal, en particular en lo concerniente a la abolici&#243;n del 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n y sobre el derecho efectivo del detenido de comunicarse en 
privado con un abogado de su elecci&#243;n, as&#237; como el poder ser examinado por un m&#233;dico 
tambi&#233;n de su elecci&#243;n? 
</p>
<p>2. Le agradecer&#237;a que me proporcionara las estad&#237;sticas disponibles sobre el uso 
del r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n incomunicada de los sospechosos de terrorismo, incluyendo as&#237; 
mismo las causas espec&#237;ficas por las que los sospechosos han sido detenidos. 
</p>
<p>3. &#191;Qu&#233; medidas se han establecido para asegurar que la vigilancia por circuito

<p>6. &#191;Cuales son las condiciones legales bajo las cuales se les permite a antiguos 
miembros de partidos pol&#237;ticos disueltos, registrar un nuevo partido pol&#237;tico que rechace el 
uso de la violencia pero promueva una agenda pol&#237;tica similar a aquellos partidos que han 
sido anteriormente declarados ilegales? &#191;Est&#225;n estos criterios actualmente definidos seg&#250;n 
la ley correspondiente de forma que sean compatibles con los requisitos de legalidad? 
</p>
<p>60. Quisiera comunicarle mi intenci&#243;n de informar de los resultados de esta 
correspondencia con el Gobierno de su Excelencia en un pr&#243;ximo informe ante el Consejo 
de Derechos Humanos.  
</p>
<p><b>  Respuesta del Gobierno  
</b></p>
<p>61. El antiguo Relator Especial recibi&#243; la siguiente respuesta del Gobierno de Espa&#241;a 
con fecha de 1 de Junio 2012. 
</p>
<p>62. En respuesta a su carta de 26 de abril de 2011, por la que solicitaba informaci&#243;n 
detallada en seguimiento al informe sobre la visita que realiz&#243; a mi pa&#237;s en mayo de 2008, 
tengo el agrado de informarle de lo siguiente : 
</p>
<p><i>  Detenci&#243;n incomunicada 
</i></p>
<p>63. Buena parte de las preocupaciones expresadas por Usted se refieren a la existencia 
en el ordenamiento jur&#237;dico espa&#241;ol de un r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n incomunicada<b>.</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b>  
</p>
<p>(i) Su carta cuestiona la previsi&#243;n de que el incomunicado sea asistido por un 
abogado de oficio. Esta cuesti&#243;n, en los mismos t&#233;rminos, se suscit&#243; ante el Tribunal 
Constitucional Espa&#241;ol que, en su STC196/1987, de 11 de diciembre, afirm&#243;: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Que la asistencia letrada cumple una funci&#243;n distinta en la fase de detenci&#243;n y en la 
fase del juicio. Mientras que en el juicio tiene especial importancia la confianza que 
al acusado le inspire s&#252; Letrado, siendo esencial su libre elecci&#243;n. En la fase de 
detenci&#243;n, la presencia, del abogado tiene por finalidad asegurar que los derechos 
constitucionales del detenido sean respetados, que no sufra coacci&#243;n o trato 
incompatible con su dignidad y con su libertad de declaraci&#243;n y que tenga el debido 
asesoramiento t&#233;cnico sobre la conducta a observar en los interrogatorios, incluida la 
de guardar silencio. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Que las declaraciones del detenido ante la polic&#237;a en principio carecen por s&#237; mismas 
de valor probatorio y subray&#243; que &quot;una vez concluido el per&#237;odo de. 
incomunicaci&#243;n, de breve duraci&#243;n por imperativo legal, el detenido recupera el 
derecho a elegir Abogado de su confianza&quot;. 
</p>
<p>64. Por estas razones, el Tribunal Constitucional declar&#243; que la asistencia al detenido 
por el abogado de oficio garantizaba sus derechos de manera equivalente al Letrado de libre 
designaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>65. Adem&#225;s, en Espa&#241;a existen plenas garant&#237;as de formaci&#243;n y especializaci&#243;n del 
abogado de oficio en la atenci&#243;n al detenido. El sistema legal espa&#241;ol garantiza el acceso 
r&#225;pido y eficaz del detenido a un abogado (art&#237;culo 17.3 de la Constituci&#243;n y art&#237;culo 520 de 
la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal). Tan pronto como el funcionario policial practica un 
arresto, est&#225; obligado a solicitar la presencia del abogado de la elecci&#243;n del detenido o del 
Colegio de Abogados para que designe uno del turno de oficio. Si el funcionario no cumple 
con esta obligaci&#243;n puede ser objeto de sanci&#243;n penal y disciplinaria. Durante las ocho 
horas que, como m&#225;ximo, establece la ley para que dicho abogado efect&#250;e su 
comparecencia en dependencias policiales, no se le pueden hacer preguntas al detenido, ni 
practicar' con &#233;l mismo diligencia alguna. Desde el mismo momento del arresto, se informa 
al detenido de que tiene derecho a guardar silencio y a un reconocimiento m&#233;dico.<b> </b>La 
situaci&#243;n de incomunicaci&#243;n en dependencias policiales por decisi&#243;n judicial, no priva al 
detenido de este derecho a la asistencia letrada, de forma que en todas las declaraciones que 
preste ante la polic&#237;a judicial y en las diligencias de reconocimiento de identidad estar&#225; 
presente el abogado 
</p>
<p>66. Los trabajos en curso para la reforma de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal inciden 
sobre esta cuesti&#243;n, en aplicaci&#243;n del Plan de Derechos Humanos del Gobierno de Espa&#241;a, 
de 12 de diciembre de 2008, sobre el que ya hemos informado en repelidas ocasiones, tanto 
al Sr. Scheinin como ante diversos Comit&#233;s de protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos. En 
particular, los trabajos, en aplicaci&#243;n de la medida 97 b del mencionado Plan introducen la 
recomendaci&#243;n de los organismos de derechos humanos de grabar, en v&#237;deo u otro soporte 
audiovisual, todo el tiempo de permanencia en dependencias policiales del detenido 
sometido a r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n (v&#233;ase tambi&#233;n respuesta a la pregunta<b> 3).</b> 
</p>
<p>(ii)<b> </b>Por lo que respecta a la otra cuesti&#243;n que le preocupa cabe recordar que 
nuestro sistema legal vigente no reconoce el derecho del detenido a la asistencia por un 
m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n, ni en el r&#233;gimen ordinario ni en el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, sino 
que atribuye espec&#237;ficamente a los M&#233;dicos Forenses la asistencia o vigilancia facultativa 
de los detenidos, lesionados o enfermos, que s&#233; hallen bajo la jurisdicci&#243;n de los jueces y 
magistrados. El sistema vigente se asienta en la imparcialidad y pericia de la asistencia 
m&#233;dica que proporciona el M&#233;dico Forense, como instituci&#243;n adscrita a la Administraci&#243;n 
de Justicia y por tanto especialmente vinculada e imbuida de la imparcialidad de los 
Juzgados o Tribunales instructores o enjuiciadores a los que est&#225;n adscritos. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>67. En todo caso, la ley prev&#233; tambi&#233;n la posibilidad de que, en caso de urgencia, el 
detenido sea atendido por otro facultativo del Sistema P&#250;blico de Salud e incluso por 
m&#233;dico de una Entidad privada. Igualmente, como plus garantista de asistencia m&#233;dica al 
detenido, la Autoridad Judicial tiene competencia para estimar, en cada caso concreto, si 
existe la necesidad de que sean dos o m&#225;s facultativos los que asistan al detenido. 
</p>
<p>68. Los trabajos, en curso para la reforma de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal tambi&#233;n 
inciden sobre esta cuesti&#243;n, en aplicaci&#243;n de la medida 97 c del Plan de Derechos Humanos 
del Gobierno de Espa&#241;a. Dichos trabajos introducen en particular la posibilidad de que el 
detenido sometido a r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n pueda ser reconocido, adem&#225;s de por el 
forense, por otro m&#233;dico adscrito al sistema p&#250;blico de salud, y que &#233;ste pueda ser 
designado por el titular del Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n<b> </b>de la Tortura (que Espa&#241;a 
ha nombrado en aplicaci&#243;n del Protocolo Facultativo a la Convenci&#243;n contra la Tortura-
OPCAT). 
</p>
<p>69. Le agradecer&#237;a que me proporcionara las estad&#237;sticas disponibles sobre el uso del 
r&#233;gimen de detenci&#243;n incomunicada de los sospechosos de terrorismo, incluyendo las 
causas especificas por las que los sospechosos han sido detenidos. 
</p>
<p>70. El r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n es en Espa&#241;a absolutamente excepcional en su 
aplicaci&#243;n, como lo demuestra el hecho de que, entre 2007 y 2010, la incomunicaci&#243;n 
afect&#243; a un porcentaje inferior al 0,035% del total de personas detenidas en Espa&#241;a en esos 
a&#241;os. 
</p>
<p>71. Por lo que se refiere a la aplicaci&#243;n del r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n a las personas 
detenidas por delitos de terrorismo o pertenencia a banda armada, en el mismo periodo 
2007-2010 se detuvo a un total de 930 personas por estos delitos, siendo incomunicadas 
461, lo que representa el 49,6 % de los mismos. 
</p>
<p>72. &#191;Qu&#233; medidas se han establecido para asegurar que la vigilancia por circuito cerrado 
de televisi&#243;n sea instalada y usada de forma sistem&#225;tica en todas las instalaciones, 
incluyendo las celdas de retenci&#243;n individual y de interrogatorio asignadas para el uso del 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n? 
</p>
<p>73. En cumplimiento de las recomendaciones formuladas por los organismos 
internacionales de defensa de los derechos humanos, incluido ese Relator Especial, el Plan 
de Derechos Humanos del Gobierno de Espa&#241;a incluy&#243; la siguiente medida (n&#250;mero 97 b): 
</p>
<p>74. &quot;Se abordar&#225;n las medidas normativas y t&#233;cnicas necesarias para dar cumplimiento a 
la recomendaci&#243;n de los organismos de. derechos humanos de grabar, en v&#237;deo u otro 
soporte audiovisual, todo el tiempo de permanencia en dependencias policiales del detenido 
sometido a r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n&quot;. 
</p>
<p>75. A d&#237;a de hoy, las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado est&#225;n dando puntual 
cumplimiento a todas las resoluciones judiciales (normalmente de la Audiencia Nacional) 
por las que se acuerda la grabaci&#243;n en v&#237;deo de los detenidos sometidos a r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n. Para ello, se les ha dotado, de los medios t&#233;cnicos necesarios, tales como 
un avanzado sistema de grabaci&#243;n de las zonas comunes y salas para pr&#225;ctica de diligencias 
(declaraciones, reconocimientos, desprecinto de efectos intervenidos) de la Comisar&#237;a 
General de Informaci&#243;n en Madrid, as&#237; como unidades port&#225;tiles de grabaci&#243;n para su 
utilizaci&#243;n por la Guardia Civil. 
</p>
<p>76. En cuanto a la instalaci&#243;n de videoc&#225;maras en todos los centros de detenci&#243;n de las 
FCSE, se est&#225;n instalando c&#225;maras en las zonas comunes de los centros de detenci&#243;n 
estando ya cubierto un porcentaje superior al 90% de los centros del CNP y un 65% de los 
centros de GC. Las Polic&#237;a aut&#243;nomas Vasca y Catalana tambi&#233;n disponen de videoc&#225;maras 
en sus instalaciones para la prevenci&#243;n de malos tratos a los detenidos. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>77. &#191;Cu&#225;l es el periodo de conservaci&#243;n del material audiovisual de documentaci&#243;n de 
los detenidos en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n?, &#191;qui&#233;nes est&#225;n autorizados a su obtenci&#243;n y 
qu&#233; criterios regulan la disposici&#243;n de dicho material? 
</p>
<p>78. La videograbaci&#243;n de la estancia en dependencias policiales de las personas 
detenidas en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n debo ser autorizada mediante Auto de la 
Audiencia Nacional. Los archivos de v&#237;deo obtenidos s&#233; almacenan en las dependencias 
policiales a disposici&#243;n exclusiva de dicha autoridad judicial, por el tiempo qu&#233; el juez 
considere oportuno, correspondiendo al mismo ordenar su destrucci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><i>  Art.-578 CP (delito de enaltecimiento) 
</i></p>
<p>79. El delito de enaltecimiento del terrorismo fue introducido en el C&#243;digo penal por L. 
O. 7/2000, de 22 de Diciembre de 2000. 
</p>
<p>80. En dicho art&#237;culo, conviven dos figuras delictivas claramente diferenciadas, cuya 
acci&#243;n t&#237;pica y elementos que' las vertebran son claramente distintos: a) el enaltecimiento o 
justificaci&#243;n del terrorismo o sus autores y b) la realizaci&#243;n de actos en desprecio, 
descr&#233;dito o humillaci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas de delitos terroristas. 
</p>
<p>81. En el segundo de los casos, la justificaci&#243;n material del merecimiento de pena reside 
en la exigencia indiscutible de cierre a la impunidad de las conductas en ofensa o 
menosprecio de las v&#237;ctimas del terrorismo, lo que aparece como una exigencia 
indiscutible. En este caso, con la doctrina de Sala Segunda del Tribunal Supremo -vgr. 
SSTS149/2007 de 26 de Febrero (RJ 2007,948) , 585/2007 de 20 de Junio ( RJ 2007, 3440) 
&#243; 539/2008 de 23 de Septiembre ( RJ 2008, 5597), que los elementos que vertebran el 
enaltecimiento son los siguientes: 
</p>
<p>1&#176; La existencia de unas acciones o palabras por las que se enaltece o justifica. 
Enaltecer equivale a ensalzar o hacer elogios, alabar las cualidades o m&#233;ritos de 
alguien o de algo. Justificar quiere aqu&#237; decir que se hace aparecer como acciones 
l&#237;citas y leg&#237;timas aquello, que solo es un comportamiento criminal. 
</p>
<p>2&#176; El objeto de tal ensalzamiento o justificaci&#243;n puede ser alguno de estos dos: 
</p>
<p> a) Cualquiera de las conductas definidas como delitos de terrorismo. 
</p>
<p> b) Cualquiera de las personas que hayan participado en la ejecuci&#243;n de 
tales comportamientos. Interesa decir aqu&#237; que no es necesario identificar a una o a 
varias de tales personas. Puede cometerse tambi&#233;n ensalzando a un colectivo de 
autores o copart&#237;cipes en esta clase de actos delictivos. 
</p>
<p>3&#176; Tal acci&#243;n de enaltecer o justificar ha de realizarse por cualquier medio de 
expresi&#243;n p&#250;blica o difusi&#243;n, como puede, ser un peri&#243;dico o un acto p&#250;blico con 
numerosa concurrencia. 
</p>
<p>82. Caracter&#237;sticas del delito son el tratarse de un comportamiento activo, que excluye la 
comisi&#243;n por omisi&#243;n, tanto propia como impropia, siendo un delito de mera actividad y 
carente de resultado, material, y de naturaleza esencialmente dolosa o intencional. Ahora 
bien, cabe resaltar que se aplica el art. 578 s&#243;lo cuando ya existe lesi&#243;n del bien jur&#237;dico 
protegido con la acci&#243;n de enaltecimiento. 
</p>
<p>83. A fin de evitar que el tipo penal de la exaltaci&#243;n, en la doble modalidad del crimen o 
de sus autores, pueda adentrarse en la zona delicada de la sanci&#243;n de opiniones, por 
deleznables que puedan ser consideradas, y, lo que es m&#225;s delicado, pueda entrar en 
conflicto con derechos de rango constitucional como son los derechos de libertad 
ideol&#243;gica y de opini&#243;n y expresi&#243;n, la labor judicial examina, caso por caso, tanto las 
concretas frases o expresiones producidas as&#237; como la ocasi&#243;n y el escenario en el que 
fueron pronunciadas. En definitiva, todas las circunstancias concurrentes son examinadas </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>para determinar si est&#225; dentro del &#225;mbito del tipo penal o extramuros de &#233;l, jugando el 
principio favor libertatis necesariamente en los casos de duda ante la naturaleza 
constitucional de los derechos, de libertad de expresi&#243;n e ideol&#243;gica que podr&#237;an quedar 
afectados por el tipo penal. 
</p>
<p>84. Por tanto, el bien jur&#237;dico protegido se sit&#250;a en la interdicci&#243;n de lo que el Tribunal 
Europeo de Derecho Humanos -vgr. SSTEDH de 8 de Julio de 1999 (TEDH 1999,28) , 
S&#252;rek vs Turqu&#237;a, 4 de Diciembre de 2003 ( TEDH 2003, 81) , M&#252;sl&#252;m vs Turqu&#237;a- y 
tambi&#233;n nuestro Tribunal Constitucional -STC 235/2007 de 7- de Noviembre ( RTC 2007, 
235)- califica como el discurso del odio, es decir la alabanza o justificaci&#243;n de acciones 
terroristas que no cabe incluir dentro de &#237;a cobertura otorgada por el derecho a la libertad de 
exposici&#243;n o ideol&#243;gica, en la medida que el terrorismo constituye la m&#225;s grave vulneraci&#243;n 
de los derechos humanos de aquella Comunidad que lo sufre. 
</p>
<p><i>  Partidos pol&#237;ticos 
</i></p>
<p>85. Desde las primeras sentencias del Tribunal Supremo y del Tribunal Constitucional 
dictadas en aplicaci&#243;n de la Ley Org&#225;nica 6/2002, de 27 de junio, de Partidos Pol&#237;ticos (en 
adelante LOPP) qued&#243; claro que la declaraci&#243;n de ilegalidad de un partido pol&#237;tico no 
supon&#237;a la privaci&#243;n del derecho de sufragio pasivo de los antiguos miembros del partido 
ilegalizado y disuelto. Por tanto, nada les impide integrar una formaci&#243;n pol&#237;tica, que actu&#233; 
totalmente desvinculada de las causas que determinaron la ilegalizaci&#243;n del partido pol&#237;tico. 
</p>
<p>86. Tambi&#233;n desde el primer momento qued&#243; claro que la causa de ilegalizaci&#243;n de un 
partido pol&#237;tico no estaba en relaci&#243;n con su ideolog&#237;a sino con sus actividades. As&#237;, ya en 
la primera sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional 48/2003, de 12 de marzo, se lee que, desde 
el respeto de los esenciales principios de convivencia, &quot;cualquier proyecto es compatible 
con la Constituci&#243;n, siempre y cuando no se defienda a trav&#233;s de una actividad que vulnere 
los principios democr&#225;ticos o los derechos fundamentales. La Constituci&#243;n es un marco de 
coincidencias suficientemente amplio como para que dentro de &#233;l quepan opciones pol&#237;ticas 
de muy diferente signo&quot;. Sin embargo, &quot;la existencia de un partido que con su actividad 
colabore, o apoye la violencia terrorista, pone en peligro la subsistencia del orden pluralista 
proclamado por la Constituci&#243;n; y, frente &#225; ese peligro, no parece que pueda aplicarse otra 
sanci&#243;n reparadora del orden jur&#237;dico perturbado que la disoluci&#243;n&quot; (STC 48/2003). 
</p>
<p>87. La defensa de una determinada ideolog&#237;a nunca ha sido obst&#225;culo para concurrir a 
unas elecciones, tampoco la ideolog&#237;a sostenida por la llamada &quot;izquierda abertzale&quot;. Esta 
afirmaci&#243;n se demuestra desde que un partido pol&#237;tico con una ideolog&#237;a muy similar a 
Batasuna, pero claramente desvinculado de ETA, como es Axalar, viene concurriendo sin 
ning&#250;n problema a los diversos procesos electorales. Recu&#233;rdese que en el documento del 
partido &quot;ARALAR, L&#205;NEA IDEOL&#211;GICA&quot;, &#233;ste se define como &quot;un partido abertzale e 
independentista de izquierdas. El objetivo de su actividad pol&#237;tica es la creaci&#243;n de la 
Rep&#250;blica Federal de Euskal Herri&#225;&quot;, que incluye &quot;el municipio euskaldun de Eskiula bajo 
administraci&#243;n bearnesa en Iparralde&quot; -nombre del Pa&#237;s Vasco franc&#233;s-. Tampoco puede 
desconocerse que existen partidos pol&#237;ticos que concurren a las elecciones defendiendo la 
separaci&#243;n de partes del territorio espa&#241;ol [Ezquerra Republicana de Catalunya o Solidaritat 
Catalana per la Independencia]. 
</p>
<p>88. Pero es que adem&#225;s, en relaci&#243;n con la &quot;izquierda abertzale&quot;, la STC 126/2009, de 
21 de mayo, recuerda que est&#225; &quot;absolutamente vedado en un proceso doctoral y en 
cualesquiera otros de nuestro ordenamiento&quot; llevar la &quot;fiscalizaci&#243;n judicial al terreno de la 
ideolog&#237;a y las convicciones personales&quot;, a&#241;adiendo que &quot;la &#171;izquierda abertzale&#187; como 
expresi&#243;n ideol&#243;gica no ha sido proscrita de nuestro ordenamiento ni podr&#237;a llegar a serlo 
sin quiebra del principio pluralista y de los derechos fundamentales a &#233;l conexos y que las 
ideolog&#237;as son en el ordenamiento constitucional espa&#241;ola absolutamente libres y deben 
encontrar en el poder p&#250;blico la primera garant&#237;a de su indemnidad, a la que no pueden </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b>  
</p>
<p>aspirar, sin embargo, quienes se sirven para su promoci&#243;n y defensa de medios il&#237;citos o 
violentos y se sirven de la intimidaci&#243;n terrorista para la consecuci&#243;n de sus fines. En 
definitiva, son esos medios y no las ideas o los objetivos pol&#237;ticos pac&#237;ficamente 
perseguidos a los que est&#225; destinada la reacci&#243;n del poder p&#250;blico en defensa del marco de 
convivencia pac&#237;fica dise&#241;ado por el constituyente para que en &#233;l tengan cabida todas las 
ideas (STC 99/2004, de 27 de mayo, F. 18, con cita de las SSTC 48/2003, de 12 de marzo, 
85/2003, de 8 de mayo, y 5/2004 y 6/2004, de 16 de enero)&quot;. 
</p>
<p>89. De hecho, en las elecciones al parlamento europeo de 2009 se present&#243; la coalici&#243;n 
electoral &quot;Iniciativa Internacionalista-La Solidaridad entre los Pueblos&quot;, respecto de la que 
exist&#237;an fuertes indicios de estar instrumentalizada por el complejo ETA-Batasuna. Aun as&#237;, 
nuestro Tribunal Constitucional, en el m&#225;ximo respeto del derecho de sufragio pasivo, 
entendi&#243; que no exist&#237;a prueba suficiente de vinculaci&#243;n de esa coalici&#243;n con la 
organizaci&#243;n terrorista. Lo mismo ha ocurrido en las elecciones locales, forales y 
auton&#243;micas de 2011 a las que ha concurrido la coalici&#243;n electoral BILDU sobre la que 
pesaban importantes elementos probatorios que la vinculaban al complejo ETA-Batasuna. 
Nuevamente el Tribunal Constitucional, en sentencia 62/2011, de 5 de mayo, con un 
criterio extremadamente garantista, consider&#243; insuficientes las pruebas existentes contra 
BILDU para impedir a la coalici&#243;n concurrir a esas elecciones. 
</p>
<p>90. El TEDH se ha pronunciado en varias ocasiones sobre el escrupuloso respeto a los 
derechos humanos de los procesos judiciales de ilegalizaci&#243;n de formaciones pol&#237;ticas 
seguidos en Espa&#241;a. As&#237; lo avalan las tres sentencias de 30 de junio de 2009, en los asuntos 
&quot;Batasuna y Herri Batasuna contra Espa&#241;a&quot;, &quot;Etxeberria, Barrena Arza, Nafa-rroako 
Autodeterminazio Bilgunea y Aiarako y otros contra Espa&#241;a&quot;, y &quot;Herritarren Zerren-da 
contra Espa&#241;a&quot;, respectivamente, y sentencia de 7 de diciembre de 2010, asunto &quot;ANV 
contra Espa&#241;a&quot;. En ellas el TEDH declar&#243; que no hab&#237;a existido vulneraci&#243;n de derecho 
alguno, dado que los partidos ilegalizados emplearon &quot;m&#233;todos&quot; incompatibles con los 
&quot;principios democr&#225;ticos fundamentales&quot;. El Tribunal consider&#243; acreditada la vinculaci&#243;n 
entre los partidos pol&#237;ticos y la banda terrorista ETA, v&#237;nculos que; &quot;pueden ser 
considerados objetivamente como una amenaza para la democracia&quot;. 
</p>
<p>91. En definitiva, no se ilegaliza ning&#250;n partido por su ideolog&#237;a, sino por servir de 
instrumento a una banda terrorista. 
</p>
<p>92. Por &#250;ltimo, el Gobierno de Espa&#241;a no quisiera desaprovechar esta oportunidad para 
aclarar un par de cuestiones. 
</p>
<p>93. Por una parte, en su carta, el Relator afirma que &quot;las alegaciones que se me 
presentaron en mi visita, en relaci&#243;n a la ausencia de los mecanismos apropiados que hacen 
posible una eficaz y completa investigaci&#243;n de las denuncias de tortura de los detenidos en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n sospechosos de delitos de terrorismo, han sido corroboradas 
por recientes informaciones&quot;, citando dos resoluciones judiciales a p&#237;e de p&#225;gina. 
</p>
<p>94. Al respecto, se considera oportuno realizar determinadas aclaraciones. En primer 
lugar, debe indicarse que los hechos a los que se refieren esas informaciones son anteriores 
a su visita a Espa&#241;a (a&#241;o 2005, en el caso de la Sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional de 18 
de octubre de 2010; y a&#241;o 2002, en el caso San Argimiro Isasa c. Espa&#241;a) y, por tanto, sin 
que en dicho momento fueran aplicables las garant&#237;as adicionales puestas en marcha para 
garantizar los derechos de los detenidos en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n (segundo examen 
m&#233;dico forense, &quot;protocolo Garz&#243;n&quot;, etc.). De otro lado, la sentencia del Tribunal 
Constitucional, que ordena continuar las investigaciones penales de un caso de alegados 
malos tratos durante la detenci&#243;n en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, pone de manifiesto 
precisamente lo contrario que se afirma en su escrito: que en Espa&#241;a est&#225;n funcionando 
correctamente los mecanismos jurisdiccionales y de protecci&#243;n de los derechos 
fundamentales en la lucha contra la tortura y los malos tratos, al corregir los errores que se </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>29 
</b></p>
<p>aprecian en las instancias judiciales inferiores. Se llama la atenci&#243;n sobre el hecho de que la 
sentencia del Tribunal Constitucional de 18 de octubre es continuadora de las dictadas por 
el mismo Tribunal con posterioridad a su visita a Espa&#241;a: STC 63/2008, de 26 de mayo, 
STC 69/2008, de 23 de junio, 107/2008, de 22 de septiembre, 123/2008, de 20 de octubre y 
40/2010, de 19 de julio,, en las que se ordena extremar todas las posibilidades de 
investigaci&#243;n judicial de las denuncias de malos tratos y torturas. En cuanto a la sentencia 
del Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos, asunto San Argimiro, como se ha adelantado, 
se trata de un supuesto ocurrido hace bastante tiempo, en el a&#241;o 2002, en el que el Tribunal 
aprecia que debieran haberse desarrollado investigaciones penales m&#225;s amplias. Ahora 
bien, esa doctrina del TEDH es precisamente la que el Tribunal Constitucional viene 
aplicando rigurosamente desde el a&#241;o 2008, incluso con cita .de la doctrina del TEDH, 
ordenando la continuaci&#243;n de las investigaciones penales. 
</p>
<p>95. Por otra parte, por lo que se refiere a la referencia contenida en su carta sobre las 
grabaciones realizadas por el Departamento de Interior del Gobierno Vasco, ha de 
manifestarse que, en la actualidad, la Polic&#237;a Aut&#243;noma Vasca (Ertzaintza) procede a la 
video grabaci&#243;n de toda persona detenida en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, conservando las 
grabaciones a disposici&#243;n de la autoridad judicial competente durante un plazo de tres 
meses. Transcurrido dicho plazo, de no mediar petici&#243;n de las autoridades judiciales para su 
conservaci&#243;n p&#243;f un plazo mayor, se procede a su destrucci&#243;n por razones de 
proporcionalidad y protecci&#243;n de datos. 
</p>
<p>96. Durante el plazo de tres meses, cualquier operador de derechos humanos legitimado 
dispone de acceso a la visualizaci&#243;n de las im&#225;genes. Seg&#250;n informa el citado 
Departamento de Interior, la Defensor&#237;a Auton&#243;mica Vasca (Ararteko) accedi&#243; a la 
visualizaci&#243;n de video grabaciones de un operativo antiterrorista desarrollado por la 
Ertzaintza en el mes de agosto de 2010, en dos visitas realizadas en las propias 
dependencias policiales en el mes de octubre del mismo a&#241;o, durante m&#225;s de nueve horas. 
Tambi&#233;n una Delegaci&#243;n del Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n de la Tortura visit&#243; in situ 
las dependencias policiales en el transcurso del referido operativo antiterrorista, 
conversando privadamente con los detenidos y visualizando las video grabaciones que 
estimaron oportunas. Ninguna de estas Instituciones independientes de defensa de los 
derechos fundamentales ha puesto de manifiesto que el plazo de conservaci&#243;n de las 
grabaciones deba ser ampliado? Parece m&#225;s que proporcionado entender que cualquier 
denuncia de malos tratos o torturas producidas durante el per&#237;odo de incomunicaci&#243;n ser&#225; 
comunicada a las autoridades judiciales en el plazo de tres meses. 
</p>
<p>97. Agradeci&#233;ndole de antemano su atenci&#243;n, aprovecho esta ocasi&#243;n para saludarle 
atentamente.<b>

<p><b> D. Follow-up to mission to Turkey</b>44<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Letter to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>98. On 27 June 2011, the former Special Rapporteur sent the following letter to the 
Government of Turkey. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>99. I have the honour to address you in my capacity as Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/RES/15/15 of 7 October 
2010, and in the spirit of our constructive dialogue developed with your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>  
 44 A/HRC/4/26/Add.2. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>Government since my fact-finding mission to Turkey held 16 to 23 February 2006 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>100. In light of a number of developments that have taken place since my visit both in 
Turkey and at United Nations level, including the recommendations issued in June 2010 
following the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Turkey,45 and the adoption of the 
respective Concluding observations on Turkey by the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict in October 200946 and the Committee against 
Torture in November 201047, I wish to follow up with your Excellency&#8216;s Government on a 
selected number of issues that I elaborated on in my mission report on the legal and 
institutional counter-terrorism framework and practice in your country. I believe this letter 
comes timely in view of the general elections held in your country on 12 June 2011. In the 
following I therefore take the opportunity to address some of the recent developments 
reported to me that have taken place at the national level. 
</p>
<p>101. Since my country visit, your Excellency&#8216;s Government has made efforts to address 
some of the issues in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights noted then in 
my report. Reforms have been carried out in the face of political difficulties, and in the light 
of these circumstances the reforms deserve praise, albeit many issues remain to be 
addressed. The political situation has however also led to regrettable delays, and many 
envisaged constitutional amendments aiming at the protection of human rights going 
beyond the reforms noted in my report on the mission (ibid., paragraph 10) are still 
outstanding.  
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of terrorism and related issues 
</b></p>
<p>102. In my report, I recommended the definition of terrorist crimes be brought in line 
with international norms and standards, notably the principle of legality as required by 
article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, 
paragraph 90 a) and regretted that some of the provisions of the Anti-Terror Act of 1991 
appeared to have been retained in the Bill tabled by the Government in April 2006 (ibid., 
paragraph 10). I note that the Anti-Terror Act was amended in June 2006 and in July 2010 
(through the &#8213;Law Amending the Anti-Terror Law and other Laws&#8214;- Law No. 6008), and 
welcome the commitment of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to continuously review its 
</p>
<p>anti-terrorism legislation evidenced by these reforms. I reiterate my concerns, however, that 
the broad and vague definition of terrorism contained in article 1 of the Anti-Terror Act was 
not amended.  
</p>
<p>103. Referring to my report, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, in said 
Concluding observations of 2009 (CRC/C/OPAC/TUR/CO/1, para. 19 (b), and the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in the report on its mission to Turkey 
(A/HRC/4/40/Add.5, para. 101) also recommended that Turkey ensure the conformity of 
any domestic definition of terrorist crimes with international norms and standards. The 
report of the UPR Working Group contains a recommendation to revise or abolish the Anti-
Terror Law (A/HRC/15/13, para. 102.39), which your Excellency&#8216;s Government considers 
</p>
<p>to be under the process of implementation (A/HRC/15/13/Add.1, para. 78). However, the 
&#8213;specific law of amendment&#8214; of July 2010 referred to in this document by your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government (ibid.) would appear not to govern an amendment of the 
</p>
<p>  
 45 Report of the working group on the Universal Periodic Review, Turkey, A/HRC/15/13 and 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/15/13/Add.1

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>definition of terrorist crimes in Turkish anti-terror legislation as such, but to relate to 
legislative amendments to the effect that children will henceforth stand trial for terrorism-
related offences in the juvenile justice system only. 
</p>
<p><b>  Juvenile justice in the context of counter-terrorism 
</b></p>
<p>104. I have received allegations that hundreds of children have been prosecuted, during 
the years of 2006 to 2010 for &#8213;membership in an armed organization&#8214;, which is an offence 
</p>
<p>entailing criminal punishment under the Penal Code and simultaneously under the Anti-
Terror Law, or for &#8213;propaganda for a terrorist organization&#8214; pursuant to the Anti-Terror 
Law alone. Scores of juveniles between the age of 15 and 18 years have been convicted as 
adults to prison sentences by Serious Felony Courts, whose jurisdiction was established 
following amendments to the Anti-Terror Law in July 2006. 
</p>
<p>105. On 5 December 2008, I sent a communication to your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
regarding information received on six children who were to face trial in the Diyarbakir 
Criminal Court on charges of propaganda for a terrorist organization and of other terrorist 
crimes allegedly committed by throwing of stones and Molotov cocktails on the police 
during a demonstration. The Prosecutor of the court asked for a prison sentence of 23 years 
for the accused, who were reported to be 13-14 years old at the time (A/HRC/10/3/Add.1, 
para. 309). Your Excellency&#8216;s Government replied to this communication by letter dated 25 
February 2009. On 12 October 2009 I sent a joint communication regarding minors M. E., 
M. Z. Y., A. N., and H. H. A., all Turkish citizens of Kurdish ethnicity, which detailed 
issues around the application of anti-terror legislation to juveniles of 15 and 16 years of age 
and the lacking investigation of alleged torture and ill-treatment in these cases 
(A/HRC/13/37/Add.1, para. 98).  
</p>
<p>106. Reportedly, as at June 2010, there were still 206 children detained in Turkey, 
convicted of or standing trial for terrorist-related offences, according to the then Minister of 
Justice. I note the amendments to the Anti-Terror Law of July 2010 to the effect, inter alia, 
that minors will henceforth stand trial only in juvenile courts or adult courts acting as 
juvenile courts, that children participating in demonstrations will not be charged for 
&#8213;committing crimes on behalf of a terrorist organization&#8214; under the Anti-Terror Law 
anymore under the notion of &#8213;propaganda crimes&#8214; or for resisting police dispersal of 
demonstrations, and that juveniles will not receive aggravated criminal penalties.48 These 
amendments, in my view, have the potential of opening the path for the release of the 
detained children and closing the door for the prosecution of child demonstrators as 
members of an armed organization on the basis of participation in public protests.  
</p>
<p>107. However, the amendments to article 2/2 of the Anti-Terror Law would appear to be 
limited only to children who are alleged to have committed &#8213;propaganda crimes&#8214; or resisted 
the dispersal of demonstrations by the police, and do not exclude the possibility of the 
continuance of pressing charges against minors under the Penal Code&#8216;s article 220/6 &#8211; 
punishing persons as members of an organization qualified as terrorist who commit a crime 
on behalf of such organization without being a member &#8211; and article 314/2 and 3 &#8211; 
punishing membership in an armed organization.49  
</p>
<p>108. I therefore call upon your Excellency&#8216;s Government to continue with its efforts to 
comply with applicable international human rights norms and standards to ensure that the 
Anti-Terrorist Act not be used for prosecution of any children as adults in Serious Felony 
Courts, where those over 15 years of age now may face life imprisonment contrary to the 
</p>
<p>  
 48 Human Rights Watch, Protesting as a Terrorist Offence, November 2010, pp. 29 <i>et seq</i>. See also 
</p>
<p>Amnesty International, All Children Have Rights, 2010. 
 49 Human Rights Watch, <i>ibid.</i> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b>  
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, on grounds such as the presence or participation in 
demonstrations. I further call upon your Excellency&#8216;s Government to ensure that claims of 
</p>
<p>torture and ill-treatment against them be brought before independent and effective 
investigating bodies (CRC/C/OPAC/TUR/CO/1, paras. 18 and 19). The 70 complaints 
reported to have been lodged after the 2006 events in Diyarbakir were processed slowly and 
while children were held in custody for several years, the overall image was one of 
prevailing impunity for cases of alleged ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>109. I would also like to recall the recommendation contained in the report of the UPR 
Working Group (A/HRC/15/13), which enjoys the support of your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government, that Turkey apply the standards of the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
to all cases that involve the investigation, the prosecution and the deprivation of liberty of 
children, especially in the context of the enforcement of anti-terror laws (A/HRC/15/13, 
para. 100.87). The report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention on its mission to 
Turkey (A/HRC/4/40/Add.5, ) and the Committee on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC/C/OPAC/TUR/CO/1, para. 19 (c) explicitly recommended the use of deprivation of 
liberty only as a last resort in the juvenile justice system.  
</p>
<p><b>  Criminal procedures for suspects of terrorism and detention safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>110. In my mission report (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 20), I furthermore drew the 
attention to detention safeguards under the Anti-Terror Law and the Penal Code. Concerns 
were also voiced in the report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which, 
although praising impressive progress in detention safeguards overall, noted a great 
reluctance on the part of the authorities to fully extend the beneficial effects of the relevant 
reforms to persons accused of terrorism, recommending the lifting of the limitation on the 
number of defence counsel in terrorism cases (A/HRC/4/40/Add.5, para. 102).  
</p>
<p>111. While the longer allowed detention period for terrorism suspects under the Code of 
Penal Procedure still continues to apply, the June 2006 amendments to the Anti-Terror Law 
provide that only one family member will be informed of detention, the suspect may only 
have access to one lawyer, and the right to see the lawyer may be restricted on request of 
the prosecutor and a court decision, albeit no statements can be taken during such time. 
Access to documents pertaining to the case may equally be restricted by court decision, 
upon request by the prosecutor, and a right of enforcement to monitor communication 
between the suspect and the lawyer may be accorded through the same procedure if there 
are findings indicating communication with members of a terrorist organization. Such 
weakening of procedural safeguards raises serious concerns. The amendment also provides 
for legal assistance for personnel that have taken part in counter-terrorism operations in 
cases where the legality of their actions could be challenged. At the same time there have 
been reports that, particularly in the South-East of the country, suspects have not had access 
to court-appointed lawyers to the same degree as in the rest of the country.  
</p>
<p>112. I am also concerned about reports that I have received about the practice of courts 
blocking the disclosure of evidence to the accused and defence lawyers, including in cases 
brought under anti-terrorism legislation. Such secrecy decisions are made by judges under 
article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure invoking the risk that disclosure would 
jeopardise the aims of the investigation, compromise the ability of defence lawyers to 
challenge the legitimacy of an order to detain the accused and, further, may compromise the 
right to defence under article 14, para. 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>113. As regards allegations of torture during detention, which in the past often has been 
linked to presumed terror-cases, it has been a positive development that evidence obtained 
through such means is no longer considered admissible in trials, albeit this prohibition has </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>33 
</b></p>
<p>reportedly not been applied in cases where the alleged torture occurred at an earlier period 
of time. 
</p>
<p>114. Concerning other developments regarding the detention regime for terrorist suspects 
since 2006, the 2005 changes to the relevant legislation have been followed up by a series 
of circulars which oblige prosecutors to control and monitor detention and the taking of 
statements. While such monitoring is important, there is also a need to ensure independent 
monitoring as envisaged by the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
(OPCAT), which should in my view be ratified as early as possible. I note that Turkey has 
signed the OPCAT in September 2005 and has indicated in the context of its UPR that the 
ratification process is expected to be completed soon (A/HRC/15/13/Add.1, para. 2).  
</p>
<p>115. In view of combating torture and ill-treatment during detention, another important 
set of issues to address are the reported shortcomings around medical examinations, where 
both the confidentiality and the quality has been lacking at times resulting in concerns 
expressed by the Committee against Torture (CAT/C/TUR/CO/3, para. 11), particularly 
with enforcement officials occasionally having been present, even in the absence of a 
request to this effect from the medical personnel in charge. For similar reasons, reforms of 
the Forensic Medicine Institute and introduction of a possibility of independent forensic 
expertise are of utmost importance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Proscription of organizations 
</i></p>
<p>116. In my mission report, I noted the use of the Anti-Terror Law for the prosecution for 
acts related to the right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 18 and 30). Since my mission to Turkey, I have received 
information that indicates that challenges remain. Despite the April 2008 amendments to 
the crime of &#8213;denigration of the Turkish nation&#8214; (previously &#8213;Turkishness&#8214;) as per article 
</p>
<p>301 of the Penal Code, and concerning its application, there still appear to be significant 
limitations to the expression of non-violent opinion that have their root in law. I consider as 
the fundamental problem the broad definition of terrorism and the lack of specific criteria 
for qualifying organizations as terrorist and membership thereof. Consequently, the report 
of the UPR Working Group also highlights restrictions to freedom of association and 
freedom of expression arising from the application of the Anti-Terror Act, the Penal Code 
and other laws, and contains recommendations, including amending or abolishing article 
301 of the Penal Code (A/HRC/15/13, paras. 102.17, 102.18, 102.23, and 102.39). 
</p>
<p>117. With the broad and vague definition of terrorism that I criticised in 2006 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 14) still in place, there remain broadly framed &#8213;organization 
cases&#8214;, such as the so-called &#8213;KCK/TM&#8214; (&#8213;Union of Kurdistan Communities/Turkey 
Assembly) case that since April 2009 has involved detention of members of the pro-
Kurdish &#8213;Peace and Democracy Party&#8214; (&#8213;BDP&#8214; &#8211; formerly &#8213;Democratic Society Party&#8214; &#8211; 
&#8213;DTP&#8214;), including several leading Kurdish politicians and elected mayors, and members of 
</p>
<p>trade unions &#8213;Confederation of Public Workers&#8216; Union&#8214; (&#8213;KESK&#8214;) and &#8213;E&#287;itimsen&#8214; for 
</p>
<p>alleged membership in the outlawed &#8213;Kurdistan Workers&#8216; Party&#8214; (&#8213;PKK&#8214;). The recent 
</p>
<p>commencement of the hearings before the Diyarbak&#305;r Serious Felony Court will also be a 
</p>
<p>test of the discriminatory power of the broad and vague definition of terrorism in the Anti-
Terror Law. 
</p>
<p>118. In relation to this case, on 7 January 2010, I addressed a joint communication to 
your Excellency&#8216;s Government regarding Mr. Muharrem Erbey and the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Association (IHD). This appeal was based on information that Mr. Erbey and other Kurdish 
opposition members, journalists and civil society activists had been arrested at the behest of 
the Diyarbakir Chief Public Prosecution Office and the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>Police, and that the premises of the IHD in Diyarbakir had been raided by the Police, with 
documents including archives on cases of enforced disappearance and torture confiscated. 
While membership in the allegedly &#8213;PKK&#8214;-related &#8213;KCK&#8214; was cited as grounds for arrest, 
claims were made that the charges against Mr. Erbey could have been linked to his work for 
human rights and minority protection. Clarification was sought from your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government on, inter alia, how it is established whether an organization is illegal, and 
whether there were any procedures in place to appeal such a designation. In your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government&#8216;s reply of 4 April 2011, it was stressed that the basis of the arrest 
</p>
<p>was an investigation into the terrorist organisation &#8213;KCK&#8214;. However, I note that there was 
</p>
<p>no reply to the pertinent question about how an organisation is qualified as terrorist and 
what the procedure for appealing such a designation is.  
</p>
<p>119. Similarly, the case of Mr. Hasan Anlar, Ms. Filiz Kalayci, Mr. Halil Ibrahim Varg&#252;n 
and Mr. Murat Varg&#252;n of IHD, who were detained for &#8213;aiding an illegal organization&#8214;, 
</p>
<p>prompted me to send a joint communication to your Excellency&#8216;s Government on 15 May 
2009, asking for a full definition of an &#8213;illegal organisation&#8214;. Unfortunately, your 
</p>
<p>Excellency&#8216;s Government&#8216;s response dated 16 July 2009 did not sufficiently address this 
</p>
<p>question. The letter of 11 April 2007 (A/HRC/6/17/Add.1, para. 104) in response to my 
letter of 24 July 2006, requesting clarification about the definition of terrorism and 
organisational membership, regrettably, did not sufficiently address the personal material 
link to violence against innocent bystanders that an acceptable definition of terrorism would 
require. The designation as terrorist organisation and the appeal procedure against such 
designation remain unclear, thereby also rendering the notion of membership in a terrorist 
organisation lack distinctive force.  
</p>
<p>120. Furthermore, I have received reports about security forces videotaping activities of 
associations in the South-East of the country, and legal action taken against associations 
working on issues of importance for the Kurdish population, such as the investigation 
against the Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association and cases opened against 
associations for promoting Kurdish language and culture, such as the April 2006 closure of 
the Kurd-Der association in Diyarbak&#305;r. In addition, considering the importance and scale 
of the problems of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Turkey noted in my report of 
2006 (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 34 to 45), it is particularly worrying that an association 
working on internal migration related problems, namely G&#246;&#231;-Der, in Diyarbak&#305;r was 
reportedly closed and its leadership prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>121. Removing indeterminacy of legislation such as articles 215, 216, 217 and 220 of the 
Penal Code that have been used to prosecute journalists writing about Kurdish issues will 
also be of importance. Similarly, I have received allegations that article 288 of the Law on 
Influencing the Conduct of a Fair Trial has been used to hamper reporting about the 
Ergenekon case. To be clear, I commend the Government for its courageous steps in 
combating impunity through the Ergenekon case and related prosecutions. That said, by 
letter of 23 June 2010, I, jointly with other mandate holders of Special Procedures, 
expressed concern about the broad application of the notion of terrorism around issues 
protected by the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the prosecution of 
journalists and publicists under the Anti-Terror Act and in particular its article 7, 
prohibiting &#8213;spreading propaganda relating to a terrorist organization&#8214;, citing in particular 
</p>
<p>the cases of Mr. Irfan Aktan, Ms. Merve Erol, Mr. Filiz Kocali, Mr. Ramazan Pekgoz, Mr. 
Ziya Cicekci, and Mr. Mehmet Guler, and noting the need to both show intent to incite to 
terrorism and to show an objective danger that one or more terrorist acts would be carried 
out as a consequence. The 2006 amendments to the Anti-Terror Law do still, after the June 
2009 modifications by the Constitutional Court, allow suspension of periodicals under the 
broad criteria in the law, and such suspensions have reportedly happened in a number of 
cases since 2006. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Combating impunity 
</b></p>
<p>122. In my report (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 2, 46 et seq.) I highlighted concerns about 
impunity for acts of extrajudicial killings and torture undertaken in the course of countering 
terrorism. Impunity was also a cause for concern in the report of the UPR Working Group, 
which contained recommendations to combat it (A/HRC/15/13, paras. 100.44, 100.47, and 
100.70). In its Concluding observations, the Committee against Torture also voiced 
concerns about the lack of steps regarding the implementation of my recommendations 
contained in the report on my mission to Turkey and about numerous, ongoing and 
consistent allegations concerning the use of torture and recommended that Turkey take 
immediate measures to end impunity for such acts, including the immediate establishment 
of effective and impartial mechanisms to conduct effective, prompt and independent 
investigations, and ensure that perpetrators of torture are prosecuted under articles 94 
(&#8213;torture&#8214;) and 95 (&#8213;aggravated torture&#8214;) of the Penal Code (CAT/C/TUR/CO/3, para. 7).  
</p>
<p>123. In terms of extra-judicial killings, I expressed concern in my report 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 46) about the killing of 12-year old unarmed U&#287;ur Kaymaz and 
his father Ahmet Kaymaz in Mardin, and the case of a bombing of a bookshop in &#350;emdinli 
</p>
<p>regarding which there were allegations that members of the security forces had been 
involved. The former case reportedly ended in an acquittal in June 2009, and the latter case 
was reportedly intervened into publicly by the senior military leadership, leading to the 
dismissal of the prosecutor on short notice and transfer of the case to the Van Military 
Court, with the suspects released pending trial. In later stages, investigation of any 
organizational link was reportedly terminated. After jurisdictional issues were resolved in 
the aftermath of certain legislative changes, the case was again reopened at the civilian 
Special Powers Van 3rd Serious Felony Court, which has ordered the re-arrest of the 
accused. The possibility that organizational links and chain of command responsibility 
could now be better pursued is a welcome development, as the case raises serious concerns 
about methods of counter-terrorism operations, independent judicial control of such 
methods and the pursuit of chain of command responsibility in such cases. 
</p>
<p>124. In view of ending impunity and strengthening the protection of the right to life and 
the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment in Turkey, legislative measures and mechanisms 
for independent control will be in a key position. Yet I note that there are some encouraging 
recent developments in terms of prosecution of acts of human rights violations in this area 
conducted in the course of counter-terrorism activities. Most importantly, the case against 
Colonel Cemal Temiz&#246;z et al. in the Diyarbak&#305;r Serious Felony Court and the reported 
indictment from July 2009 in this case indicates that the activities of security forces in the 
East and South-East of the country during the 1990ies can entail court scrutiny and that 
units such as the alleged &#8213;JITEM&#8214;, about whose existence Turkish authorities were 
ambiguous during my visit (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 52), could be within the scope of 
future court judgements.  
</p>
<p>125. Apart from this case, there is a reported large number of indictments that have direct 
relevance to my mandate, such as those in the Ergenekon case against alleged coup plotters. 
Investigations started in 2007. A series of indictments including on charges of forming a 
terrorist organizations followed, the first in July 2008, and the case was merged with 
another related to the attack on the Council of State from 2006 and other cases such as the 
case of the Zirve publishing house. The fourth indictment increased the number of 
defendants to more than 500 with more than 100 military officers. While the proceedings 
can be considered as groundbreaking and having the potential of shedding light on and 
bringing to justice serious past human rights abuses committed as part of counter-terrorism 
operations, it is also important that an overly broad definition of terrorism is not allowed to 
weaken the case. Other important cases are the indictments in the Sledgehammer case in 
July 2010, relating to alleged coup plans in 2003, the Cage plan indictment from March </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b>  
</p>
<p>2010, relating to alleged coup plans in 2009, and a related indictment from April 2010 
relating to the alleged coup plan from 2009 entitled Action Plan against Reactionarism 
(2009). More recent additional cases of the same kind are still being investigated and 
include recent evidence obtained through an operation at a navy base. 
</p>
<p>126. According to documents submitted as evidence in these cases and statements by 
Government officials and members of security forces involved in the investigation of the 
cases, there have been allegations of links between entities conducting counter-terrorism 
operations allegedly outside of the law on the one hand, and elements within other 
organizations against which terror charges have been brought on the other, including the 
&#8213;Revolutionary Headquarters&#8214; (Devrimci Karargah &#214;rg&#252;t&#252;), &#8213;Turkish Hizbullah&#8214;, the 
&#8213;PKK&#8214;, &#8213;Hizb-ut Tahrir&#8214;, the &#8213;Organization of the Turkish Revenge Union&#8214; (T&#252;rk &#304;ntikam 
Birli&#287;i Te&#351;kilat&#305;) and Al Qaeda. Were these links to be proven in court, they would 
highlight troubling aspects of counter-terrorism operations, and thorough investigations into 
such possible links would therefore be important for addressing impunity for crimes 
committed in the course of such operations, including support to terrorism arising from 
such operations.  
</p>
<p>127. It is therefore of utmost importance that these cases are conducted with close 
attention to procedural safeguards, so as not to put in peril landmark steps towards ending 
impunity. Procedural concerns have in particular been raised around prolonged pre-trial 
detention, leaks through media of private communications and evidence, and the scope of 
prosecution for membership in organizations. The last issue can clearly be addressed 
through amendments to the Anti-Terror Law so as to make its criteria more discriminating, 
thus fending off criticism that journalists are also targeted through the case. In a joint 
communication dated 6 April 2011, I have expressed concern about the arrests and 
detention of journalists Mr. Ahmet &#350;&#305;k and Mr. Nedim &#350;ener in the context of these cases. I 
</p>
<p>also note the recent changes of judges and prosecutors in the Sledgehammer and Ergenekon 
cases and the April 2011 public statement of the General Staff criticising courts for the 
arrest of military personnel in the Sledgehammer case. I believe that by addressing issues 
potentially impacting the legitimacy and continuation of the process, the lasting legacy of 
these cases would be a sense of impunity ended through justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  Furthering economic, social and cultural rights as a means of preventing terrorism  
</b></p>
<p>128. In my report, I also assessed counter-terrorism measures against the criteria 
enshrined in international human rights instruments, including non-discrimination and 
economic, social and cultural rights, and concluded that full respects for these rights helps 
eliminating the risk that individuals make the morally inexcusable decision to resort to acts 
of terrorism. I also made related recommendations (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 49-70, 92 
(c) and (d). Whereas there can be no justification for terrorism under any circumstances, the 
role of a functioning system of protection of minorities and combating discrimination are a 
key to the creation of conditions in which terrorist organisations are unable to recruit 
members. Many steps have reportedly been taken since my mission to strengthen some of 
the rights of citizens speaking languages other than Turkish, and such reforms will no doubt 
be a key to ending violence. Changing back some village names to their traditional non-
Turkish ones, also when such village names include letters not part of the Turkish alphabet, 
have been encouraging steps towards reconciliation. Similarly, the reported increased 
prevalence of cultural events in Kurdish, and the opening of post-graduate education in 
Kurdish at the Artuklu University in Mardin have been positive steps. However, as I noted 
in 2006, there still appear to be no systems in place ensuring that non-Turkish speakers be 
integrated in education (cf. A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 69), and statements of high-level 
Government representatives indicate that such changes are not to be expected soon. I wish 
to stress the need to review this policy.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>129. The use of languages other than Turkish by prisoners in their private 
communications has however reportedly been facilitated. Similarly, interpretation is often 
provided in courts, but there also seems to be some lack of consistent application in this 
field as I also noted in the joint communication to your Excellency&#8216;s Government dated 27 
April 2011 concerning the situation of Mr. Muharrem Erbey, Mr. Arslan Mr. Arslan 
&#214;zdemir, Ms. Roza Erdede, and Ms. Vetha Aydin. Another recent case has been reported to 
me regarding terror-suspect Mr. Emrah Bana before the 11th Serious Felony Court of 
Istanbul, which has allegedly restricted the right of the accused to use Kurdish in court. 
</p>
<p>130. Access to the media in one&#8216;s own language is along with legislation on minority 
protection and non-discrimination important as measures to counter terrorism with respect 
for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Such access to media in one&#8216;s own language 
</p>
<p>has reportedly been improved notably through the introduction of full day broadcast in 
Kurdish on State TV through amendments to Law No 2954, the launch of the Kurdish-
language TV channel TRT 6 in January 2009, the removal of prohibitive restrictions to 
private broadcasting in languages other than Turkish and the subsequent increase in private 
radio and TV broadcasters. Yet, along with other restrictions affecting media reporting 
about Kurdish issues, these broadcasts have reportedly been monitored closely, as several 
cases of prosecution in relation to G&#252;n TV in Diyarbakir indicate. DTP mayors sending a 
letter to the Danish Government asking Roj TV not to be closed were reportedly prosecuted 
and sentenced. 
</p>
<p>131. In my mission report, I also drew attention to the socio-economical disparities 
fuelling conflict and hampering return to normal conditions (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 8), 
thus potentially weakening measures to counter terrorism that respect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. The increased regional investment announced by your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government in May 2008 are a sign to the better, but a broad scope of measures will still be 
needed to end regional economic disparities. The improvements in trade with neighbouring 
countries have also had positive impact on the regional economy, but conflict around the 
border with Iraq has at times perturbed such developments, particularly through the 
establishment of temporary security zones in the region. 
</p>
<p>132. While ratifying the revised European Social Charter is a positive step, some 
reservations to international human rights instruments in fields that are of importance for a 
functioning regime of minority protection and in turn for effective counter-terrorism remain 
in force. The report of the UPR Working Group (A/HRC/15/13) also includes 
recommendations to strengthen anti-discrimination laws and minority protection. I 
therefore encourage your Excellency&#8216;s Government to ratify the UNESCO Convention 
</p>
<p>against Discrimination in Education, which would also improve the anti-discrimination 
framework. Similarly, I invite your Excellency&#8216;s Government to review reservations to 
currently binding human rights treaties in view of strengthening the rights framework that 
would be part of the new strategy to combat terrorism. Reservations to article 27 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, articles 17, 29 and 30 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and article 13 (3) and 13 (4) of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could be lifted along with the adoption 
of treaties to improve minority protection and the prohibition against discrimination. 
Lowering the 10% threshold for Parliamentary elections would also be an important step 
for enhanced participation of minority representatives in political affairs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Measures to support victims and the right to return 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Displacement and measures taken to address its consequences 
</i></p>
<p>133. In 2006, I drew attention (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 34 - 45) to the continuing 
obstacles to redressing the situation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in the context of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b>  
</p>
<p>countering terrorism, and the need to systematically address their socio-economic situation, 
including addressing economic obstacles to return and phasing out of the Village Guard 
system, which reportedly has stopped IDPs from returning. 
</p>
<p>134. Regarding the scope of internal displacement-related problems in Turkey, I have 
received new information, according to which the Institute of Population Studies of the 
Hacettepe University in a study from December 2006 found that the number of IDPs was 
higher than had previously been reported, ranging between 950,000 and 1.2 million. While 
there still appears to be no comprehensive plan or Government body dealing with the 
situation of IDPs, I have been informed about pilot work carried out in Van, which is an 
encouraging step that needs to be taken further. While some increased investment has been 
made into the region and some restrictions to the use of pastures have reportedly been 
lifted, and the Law on the De-mining of the Turkish-Syrian Border from 2009 has been 
adopted as a step towards de-mining the area, the current main obstacles to return appear to 
relate to economic circumstances, underdeveloped infrastructure, continuing conflict and 
related to that, landmines and the village guard system. Despite my recommendation that 
the village guard system as hampering the right to return be phased out according to a clear 
plan with benchmarks and time limits needs (A/HRC/4/26/Add. 2, para. 38), the system has 
been continued through legislation in May 2007 on new recruitment of village guards. 
</p>
<p>135. In my report (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 39) I also reminded your Excellency&#8216;s 
Government that repatriation of refugees should be a viable option also for this segment of 
the population of the South-East and East. The process that reportedly started in 2009, 
involving planned returns from the Maxmur refugee camp and other locations, is an 
encouraging step. Ensuring the return of recognized refugees also forms a central part of 
conflict resolution. 
</p>
<p><i>  Compensation 
</i></p>
<p>136. The economic possibilities to return appear to have also been hampered by the slow 
processing of compensation claims under the Law on Compensation and Losses Resulting 
from Terrorist Acts and inconsistencies in the application of the law, albeit I welcome the 
information provided by your Excellency&#8216;s Government in its letter of 31 May 2007, 
informing me about an extension of the deadline for compensation claims. I pointed to the 
fact that the law does not address moral damages and that it should not become an 
alternative to addressing impunity (A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, para. 44).  
</p>
<p>137. Considering the importance of justice and adequate living conditions as measures to 
combat terrorism in a way that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, I 
commend efforts to address social and economic seclusion at current locations of IDPs, 
processing remaining claims consistently and rapidly and continuing investigations into 
crimes committed as part of counter-terrorism activities. Steps taken in this direction are 
highly commendable and together with dialogue, socio-economic improvements, 
strengthening of the human rights framework, and dismantling the village guard system, 
will constitute important milestones in the resolution of conflicts and disparities that foster 
terrorism. The steps towards normalization taken in lifting the State of Emergency should 
also be followed up by a general policy of normalization of conditions in the region, 
including the least possible use of different kinds of security zones with conditions 
resembling State of Emergency, such as the ones established since 2007 in some border 
regions. A recent decision by the Malatya Regional Administrative Court reported to me, 
annulling a temporary security zone as not fulfilling the legal requirements for introduction 
of such measures, is a positive step towards diminishing the use of emergency measures. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>39 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Human rights monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>138. Domestic independent human rights monitoring would similarly be a step towards 
eradicating violations of human rights, which may occur in the context of counter-terrorism 
operations. The report of the UPR Working Group (A/HRC/15/13, paras. 100.9, 100.13-
100.24) not only contains recommendations regarding a national human rights institution in 
accordance with the Paris Principles, but also incorporating the views of civil society. The 
efforts undertaken by your Excellency&#8216;s Government since 2006 to establish the office of 
the Ombudsman have been laudable, and the constitutional amendment in 2010 to 
overcome the impact of the Constitutional Court annulment of the Ombudsman law are to 
be welcomed. Similarly, the introduction through this amendment of the right to individual 
complaint to the Constitutional Court could prove to be important, if the Court assumes the 
envisaged role in view of strengthening the rights of individuals. The proposed Law on the 
Establishment of a Monitoring Commission on Security Forces could also lead to better 
investigation of complaints against such forces. The Improved Transparency of Penal 
Institutions and Detention Houses Monitoring Boards will also have a positive effect in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p>139. The Parliamentary Human Rights Committee and its subcommittees have carried out 
an important role in view of monitoring human rights violations, while other institutions, 
such as the Human Rights Presidency, the District Human Rights Boards and the non-
operational Prime Minister Human Rights Board have allegedly not been able to fulfil the 
role of independent monitoring bodies.  
</p>
<p><b>  Judicial and institutional reforms  
</b></p>
<p>140. Changes in the institutional structures around counter-terrorism activities over the 
past years and some new adopted strategies give rise to hope for further improvement. 
Some important institutional changes are the lessening role of the army in setting policies 
around handling of the domestic conflicts and counter-terrorism, through the changes to the 
functions of the National Security Council so as to increase the role of civilian decision-
making, and abolishing the secret Protocol on Security, Public Order and Assistance Units 
(EMASYA) which had allowed military operations without civilian authorization, and 
changes to border protection enforcement. Improved proficiency and standards of policing 
are also welcomed steps, along with geographical clarifications to the powers of police and 
the Gendarmerie, but these changes need to be followed up by increasing civilian control of 
the Gendarmerie and ensuring that the concept of &#8213;national security&#8214; is defined by civilian 
</p>
<p>authorities. 
</p>
<p>141. Other important institutional reforms have been the judicial reforms through the 
Government&#8216;s Judicial Reform Strategy, and amendments to the Military Criminal Code 
and Constitution in 2006, the Code of Criminal Procedure in 2009 and the Constitution in 
</p><p>2010. Through such changes civilians are no longer tried in military courts in peacetime, 
except in jointly committed crimes, and military personnel are tried in civilian courts for 
crimes that are not associated with military affairs.  
</p>
<p>142. Regarding the ongoing efforts to end the conflict in South-East of Turkey in the 
short term through new strategies, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by statements of 
high Government officials that democratic reforms are at the core of combating terrorism, 
statements insisting on zero tolerance for torture and ill-treatment along with a pronounced 
preference for a strategy to combat terrorism &#8213;based on compassion with the people of the 
region&#8214; rather than &#8213;harsh measures.&#8214; The plan to implement the new strategy with special 
</p>
<p>operations police officers trained in legally correct methods of policing, thereby replacing 
earlier military responses, is highly laudable, but could also require review of the tools 
available to the Under-secretariat for Public Order and Security. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b>  
</p>
<p>143. I wish to encourage your Excellency&#8216;s Government to move forward in its plans for 
reforms to create a rights framework for ending terrorism and in finding a solution to the 
three decade long conflict. 
</p>
<p>144. I would, therefore, in connection with the issues elaborated above, be grateful if 
your Excellency&#8216;s Government could provide me with detailed substantive information on 
the following matters, and any other matters that your Excellency&#8216;s Government deems 
</p>
<p>appropriate in following up on my recommendations in my country visit report, at your 
earliest convenience, but no later than 27 July 2011: 
</p>
<p>1. What further steps does your Excellency&#8216;s Government envisage to review, 
and amend, Turkey&#8216;s anti-terrorism legislation, in order to bring it fully into compliance 
with applicable international human rights norms and standards? 
</p>
<p>2. What practical impact on the administration of juvenile justice have the 
amendments to the Anti-Terror Act in July 2010 had in terms of compliance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international human rights norms and 
standards, particularly with a view to excluding the prosecution of child demonstrators as 
members of an armed organization on the grounds of their participation or actions in public 
protests? 
</p>
<p>3. What plans are there to address internal displacement and the return of 
refugees in the case of an end to the conflict? 
</p>
<p>4. What measures are planned to phase out the village guard system? 
</p>
<p>5. What measures are envisaged to improve the possibilities of a functioning

minority rights and rights of political participation? 
</p>
<p>6. What plans does your Excellency&#8216;s Government have to improve protection 
of minorities and minority languages? 
</p>
<p>7. Are further institutional and legal changes planned as part of the new strategy 
to combat terrorism through non-military means? 
</p>
<p>8. What plans are in place to complete institutional changes to use specifically 
trained law enforcement rather than military in counter-terrorism operations? 
</p>
<p>9.  What plans does your Excellency&#8216;s Government have to end the use of 
temporary security zones and other measures of extraordinary controls? 
</p>
<p>10. In the light of current court cases with important implications for ending 
impunity for different bodies involved in illicit counter-terrorism operations, what further 
measures is your Excellency&#8216;s Government envisaging to combat impunity for past and 
</p>
<p>future human rights violations in the course of counter-terrorism operations? 
</p>
<p>145. My intention is to report on my correspondence with your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
in a forthcoming report to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>146. The Special Rapporteur received the following first reply dated 6 January 2012 
together with an information sheet from the Government of Turkey. 
</p>
<p>147. With reference to the letter of the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism Martin 
Scheinin dated 27 June 2011, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Turkey wishes to 
submit the following information regarding the questions referred to in the said letter.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>148. Turkey has been implementing a multidimensional and comprehensive strategy in 
the fight against terrorism. In this strategy, security measures are complemented by social, 
economic and cultural dimensions. This approach is also an important part of the 
professional training of our security forces. The Democratic Opening process is an 
indispensable element of this comprehensive strategy. 
</p>
<p>149. While various countries, including those having highest democratic standards, 
resorted to restrictive measures after September 11 2001, Turkey, contrary to this global 
trend, made a paradigm shift in the fight against terrorism and brought the human 
dimension to the forefront. We are conducting this fight with full respect for the rule of law 
and human rights. 
</p>
<p>150. In the period ahead, we will continue addressing the terror problem in a 
comprehensive manner. These efforts will reach an all new level soon, in the form of a 
debate around a new constitution. This will inevitably have a significant and positive 
bearing on some critical aspects of the matter. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information sheet 
</b></p>
<p>151. The assessments made by TNP on the claims and questions in the letter written by 
the Special reporter on the Protection of Human Rights in Counter-Terrorism are presented 
below; 
</p>
<p><i> A. Assessments made on the claims: 
</i></p>
<p>  1) That the definition of terror was made very comprehensively and ambiguously, that 
the amendments made in July 2010 was considered positively and that the definition of 
terror was not still in line with international standards. 
</p>
<p>A single definition based on a common understanding has not yet been made. Differences 
in the approaches of the countries are the leading factors making this definition harder. 
</p>
<p>Turkey is of the belief that terror acts cannot be justified by any reasons. Turkey is against 
all sorts of terrorist acts of any motives and origins. 
</p>
<p>  2) That child prisoners can still be judged under the anti-terror-law and can remain 
imprisoned for long periods, that the claims of torture and ill-treatment are not assessed and 
that pursuant to the Children's Rights Convention, the deprivation of children of their 
liberty should be considered as the last solution. 
</p>
<p>With the Law numbered 6008 on necessitating amendments on the counter-terrorism law 
and other laws; 
</p>
<p> a) Increasing the punishments to be inflicted on children who commit terror acts 
by half was abrogated by the amendment made in the 5th article of the Anti-Terrorism Law, 
</p>
<p> b) Minors' being judged in children's courts was regulated in the 9th article of 
the Anti-Terrorism, 
</p>
<p> c) The age to consider someone as a child was raised to 18 from 15 by the 
amendment made in the 13th article of the Anti-Terror Law. 
</p>
<p>It has been deemed appropriate to take Ministry of Justice's view into consideration as a 
basis regarding the issue of judging, imprisoning and thus depriving children of their 
freedom under the Counter-terrorism Law as the lat solution. 
</p>
<p>The issue that the claims on torture and ill-treatment weren't assessed was dealt with under 
the 3rd claim and the 10th question. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>  3) That defence rights of the subjects judged of terror crimes can be restricted, 
especially the courts in the southeast do not provide required evidence and access to the 
investigation file is restricted, that torture and ill-treatment still exist and that both the code 
of privacy is violated in health checks and necessary care is not shown by doctors. 
</p>
<p> a) Terror has been seriously endangering human rights and aiming at 
demolishing democracy and civil society, and dragging the country into political instability. 
It is a threat against the use of many human rights, particularly the right to life, freedom and 
personal security. Personal security is a basic right and accordingly the protection the 
person is one of the major responsibilities of the state. In other words, while combating 
terrorism is a right of a state, it is, at the same time, a duty stemming from its positive 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>152. Therefore, all states have the right to take precautions for fighting terrorism in order 
to protect their countries, citizens and values. 
</p>
<p>153. States must abide by the responsibilities on human rights arising from international 
law and the rule of law. In the event that these precautions restrict human rights, it is 
necessary to express these restrictions as clearly as possible and they need to be essential 
and proportionate to the objective. 
</p>
<p>154. In this respect, &quot;Council of the European Union, Committee of Ministers' Principles 
on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism&quot; , which was adopted in the 804th meeting of 
acting ministers on July 11,2002 needs to be reviewed because: 
</p>
<p>I. In the section titled &quot;Responsibility of states to protect everyone against 
terror&quot;, it is underlined that states are responsible for taking necessary measures to 
protect basic rights of everybody in the scope of their authority, especially the right 
to life. This positive responsibility completely justifies a state's struggle against 
terror as per the mentioned principles. 
</p>
<p>II. In the 3rd article of the section titled &quot;Legal Proceedings&quot;, it is noted that 
combating terrorism might require on certain conditions that some restrictions be 
brought upon the right of defence from the perspectives stated below: 
</p>
<p> (i) regulations regarding finding a lawyer and getting legal advice; 
</p>
<p> (ii) regulations regarding access to the case file; 
</p>
<p> (iii) Consulting to the statements of the witnesses with secret ID. 
</p>
<p>III. In the second article of the section titled &quot;Detention&quot;, it is stated that 
combating terrorism might require the infliction of further restrictions upon a subject 
deprived of freedom because of a terror act, on condition that the taken precautions 
are directly proportionate to the pursued objective and in respect of the issues noted 
below: 
</p>
<p> (i) Regulations on communication and tracing the correspondence 
including the sessions between the lawyer and his client; 
</p>
<p> (ii) Placing the subjects deprived of their freedom because of terror acts in 
the sections protected with special security measures. 
</p>
<p>155. Obviously, these regulations within the Anti-terror Law No: 3713 are harmonious 
with the principles of the European Council. 
</p>
<p>156. The article 10/b of the Anti-terror law no: 3713 carries the provision that &quot;The 
suspect may benefit from the legal assistance of only one defence lawyer. The right of the 
detained suspect to get legal advice from a lawyer might be restricted for 24 hours by the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>ruling of the judge upon the request from the public prosecutor; however the suspect's 
statement cannot be taken within this period. 
</p>
<p>157. As can be understood from the article, the restriction on meeting the lawyer can only 
be realised by the ruling of the judge and in the meantime the statement of the detained 
suspect is not taken. 
</p>
<p>158. Therefore, new regulations brought in conformity to the internationally accepted 
principles are thought not to have negative effects on Turkey's fight against torture in the 
future because Turkey has been following the policy &quot;Zero tolerance to Torture&quot; and will 
continue to do so. 
</p>
<p> b) The provisions of the Law on the Judgement of Civil Servants and other 
Public Officials are applied to the investigations and prosecutions to be opened about the 
civil servants and public officials who have committed the crime of torture and ill-treatment 
and an ex-officio investigation is launched by Public Prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>159. Crimes of Torture and ill-treatment were reorganised within the context of Turkish 
Penal Code no: 5237, which entered into force on June 1, 2005, as Torture (Article 94), 
aggravated torture because of its result (Article 95) and Infliction (Article 96), the 
definition of torture was expanded and its punishment was increased. 
</p>
<p>160. As per the 256th article of the Turkish Penal Code no: 5237, which entered into 
force on June 1, 2005, if the public official, who has the authority to exercise power, 
displays disproportionate use of power in line of duty, the provisions on wilful injury are 
stipulated. 
</p>
<p>161. The role of Public Prosecutors in crime investigations was increased further by the 
regulations made in the law of criminal procedure no: 5271, which was put into force on 
June 1, 2005. 
</p>
<p>162. Judicial and Administrative investigations have been carried out on the officials 
violating rights by displaying arbitrary behaviour contrary to the general principles and 
policies of our organisation and those found guilty are punished. 
</p>
<p>163. In addition to this, conforming to the provisions of legislation in use and within the 
context of the policy &quot;zero tolerance on torture&quot;, with the aim of 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preventing the persons in detention from committing suicide or harming 
themselves, 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Eliminating the claims of human rights violations made for various reasons to put 
the personnel under suspicion, 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Preventing some members of the personnel, even if they are isolated incidents, from 
violating the rights of the persons under detention 
</p>
<p>164. Digital screening and voice recording systems have been set up in detention rooms 
and statement taking rooms of City Police Departments' Counter-terrorism Divisions since 
2007 and the efforts are still continuing to be made to set up the same system in 2011. 
</p>
<p> c) Pursuant to the 9th article of the Directive on Apprehension, Detention and 
Statement Taking, the subject's health condition at the time of apprehension was 
determined by a doctor's examination in the event of the detention of the apprehended 
subject or the apprehension of a subject by exercising power 
</p>
<p>165. The health condition of a subject in detention is also determined by a doctor's report 
before the procedures of replacement of the subject for any reason, lengthening the period 
of detention, releasing or transferring of the subject to judicial authorities. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>166. It is essential that the examination be made in accordance with the relation between 
the doctor and the patient and that the doctor and the examined person be left alone. 
</p>
<p>167. However, the doctor may demand that the medical examination be carried out under 
the surveillance of a law enforcement officer by stating his concerns for personal security. 
This demand is met by preparing the necessary documents. In these circumstances, a lawyer 
might also be present during the medical examination upon the request of the subject under 
detention, on condition that this wouldn't lead to any delays. 
</p>
<p>168. Besides, a copy of the admission report is given to the accompanying law 
enforcement officer, in order to be added to the investigation file. However, of the 
departure reports prepared when the detention period is lengthened, a replacement is 
required or the subject is released from the custody, a copy is kept in the health institution 
and other two copies are sent immediately to the related Public Prosecutor's Office in a 
closed and stamped envelope by the health institution that prepared the report. 
</p>
<p>169. A copy of these reports is given to the subject himself in detention or to his attorney 
and a copy is added to the investigation file by the Public Prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>170. Doctors have to report to the Public Prosecutor any traces and signs of torture and 
ill-treatment during their medical examination. 
</p>
<p>171. In practice, taking actions in line with the provisions of the mentioned legislation, 
the personnel are given pre-service and in-service trainings on the related legislation and 
the significance and the sensitivity of the subject is emphasised with a view to preventing 
torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>  4) That the subjects who are jailed pending trial as part of the investigation of KCK are 
the members of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), the detention of Muh'arrem 
ERBEY, a member of Human Rights Association (IHD), might be related to his being a 
human rights defender. 
</p>
<p>172. It has been deemed appropriate to take Ministry of Justice's view into consideration 
as a basis on this issue. 
</p>
<p>  5) The privacy of the Ergenekon case was violated and some journalists faced some 
judicial investigations as part of the mentioned case. 
</p>
<p>173. It has been deemed appropriate to take Ministry of Justice's view into consideration 
as a basis on this issue. 
</p>
<p><i> B. Assessments made on questions: 
</i></p>
<p>  1) Are there any amendments planned to be made in the Counter-Terrorism Law in 
order to harmonize with the international human rights standards? 
</p>
<p>174. Our country is a member of various supervision mechanisms, particularly ECHR 
and CPT, when practices in the field of human rights are considered. In practice, action is 
taken by the guidance of ECHR practices and the recommendations of CPT and 
amendments in legislation are made when necessary. 
</p>
<p>175. As per the 9th article of our constitution international agreements that are put into 
force in due form are considered as statutory. Any controversies that might appear because 
of differences in agreements on basic rights and freedoms between international agreements 
that are put into force in due form and national laws, the provisions of international 
agreements prevail. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>176. At present, there is no work carried out by TNP in respect of making amendments in 
the Anti-Terror Law. 
</p>
<p>  2) What kind of results were obtained in the practices regarding children as a result of 
the amendments made in the Anti-Terror Law in June 2010? 
</p>
<p>177. With the amendments made in some articles of the Anti-Terror Law no: 3713 by 
another law no: 6008 on July 22, 2010: 
</p>
<p>1- The clause added to the 5th article of the Anti-terror Law states that the 
provisions of this article cannot be practised against children. In line with the 
&quot;proportionality&quot; principle, one of the basic objectives of the child justice system, 
and the principle of &quot;always prioritising children's benefits&quot;, this amendment 
prevents the increase of the punishment applied to adults from being applied to 
children, 
</p>
<p>2- The second sentence of the first clause of the 9th article of the Anti-terror law 
stating that &quot;the cases opened against children over 15 who were involved in these 
crimes are heard in these courts&quot; were extracted from the text of the article and 
children who committed terrorist acts started to be judged in juvenile courts 
notwithstanding their age and the definition of child was thus made conforming to 
the national and international norms, 
</p>
<p>3- &quot;The expression stating that a person is over 15&quot;, which was in the second 
sentence of the first clause of the 9th article of the Anti-terror law, was taken out of 
the article and this eliminated the options of turning the punishment to alternative 
deterrents or prohibiting postponing for the children who committed a terror act. 
</p>
<p>178. It has been deemed appropriate to take Ministry of Justice's views into consideration 
as a basis regarding the issue of the procedures carried out after the amendments made in 
the Anti-Terror Law no: 3713. 
</p>
<p>  3) What kinds of measures have been taken to take the persons who emigrated back 
their villages? 
</p>
<p>179. It has been deemed appropriate to take the views of Ministry of Interior- Provincial 
Administration into consideration as a basis regarding this matter. 
</p>
<p>  4) What kinds of works have been carried out for the abolition of the Ward System? 
</p>
<p>180. It has been deemed appropriate to take the views of Ministry of Interior- General 
Directorate of Local Administrations into consideration as a basis regarding this matter. 
</p>
<p>  5) What kinds of steps have been taken in order to enable the civil society to contribute 
to the strategies of minority rights, political participation rights and counter-terrorism? 
</p>
<p>181. TNP has been diligently making efforts to develop the mechanisms to eliminate 
terror and to upgrade human rights standards by cooperating with the people and the 
organisations embracing combating terrorism and advancing human rights as their primary 
responsibilities. In this regard, contributions from non-governmental organisations are 
welcome in the works and projects conducted. 
</p>
<p>  6) What kinds of works have been carried out in the field of protecting minority 
languages and minority rights? 
</p>
<p>It has been deemed appropriate to take the views of Ministry of Interior- Provincial 
Administration into consideration as a basis regarding this matter. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>  7) Have there been any institutional or legal amendments planned to fight terrorism 
with non-military methods? 
</p>
<p>  8) Has there been a project going on to make the necessary institutional changes that 
will make trained law enforcement officials take over the task of the military personnel in 
counter-terrorism operations? 
</p>
<p>  9) Have there been any plans to make changes about the abrogation of the temporary 
</p>
<p>There is no work carried out by TNP in respect of making amendments in the mentioned 
issues. 
</p>
<p>  10) What kind of measures have been taken to fight the understanding of &quot;impunity&quot;, 
which might appear in case of human rights violations during the operations carried out in 
the field of counter-terrorism? 
</p>
<p>182. The provisions of the Law on the Judgement of Civil Servants and other Public 
Officials are applied to the investigations and prosecutions to be opened about the civil 
servants and public officials who have committed the crime of torture and ill-treatment and 
an ex-officio investigation is launched by Public Prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>183. Crimes of Torture and ill-treatment were reorganised within the context of Turkish 
Penal Code no: 5237, which entered into force on June 1, 2005, as Torture (Article 94), 
aggravated torture because of its result (Article 95) and Infliction (Article 96), the 
definition of torture was expanded and its punishment was increased. 
</p>
<p>184. As per the 256th article of the Turkish Penal Code no: 5237, which entered into 
force on June 1, 2005, if the public official, who has the authority to exercise power, 
displays disproportionate use of power in line of duty, the provisions on wilful injury are 
stipulated. 
</p>
<p>185. The role of Public Prosecutors in crime investigations was increased further by the 
regulations made in the law of criminal procedure no: 5271, which was put into force on 
June 1, 2005. 
</p>
<p>186. Judicial and Administrative investigations have been carried out on the officials 
violating rights by displaying arbitrary behavior contrary to the general principles and 
policies of our organisation and those found guilty are punished. 
</p>
<p>187. With a view to progressing human rights standards, TNP has been conducting many 
projects, giving importance to training activities, participating in the legislation regulation 
works and following the developments in the field of human rights as part of the 
understanding of &quot;zero tolerance for torture&quot;. 
</p>
<p>188. Such developments and regulations in TNP have been appreciated by international 
institutions and organisations and this is reflected on both the Turkey Progress reports 
prepared by the EU and CPT reports. 
</p>
<p>189. In Turkey Progress Report ( November 5, 2008) of the European Commission it is 
noted that &quot;As regards prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment or 
punishment, the downward trend in allegations of torture and ill-treatment in the anti-terror 
departments of the police stations continued. The legal safeguards introduced by the 
government's zero tolerance policy on torture are having a positive effect.&quot;(Chapter 23: 
Justice and Fundamental Rights)&quot;, 
</p>
<p>190. Finally; In Turkey Progress Report (November 9, 2010) of the European 
Commission, it is stated that; &quot;&quot;The government pursued its efforts to ensure compliance </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>with legal safeguards to prevent torture and ill-treatment. This policy has continued to 
produce positive results. &quot; 
</p>
<p>191. The Special Rapporteur received a further reply by the Government of Turkey dated 
19 March 2012.  
</p>
<p>192. With reference to the letter of the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism Martin 
Scheinin, dated 27 June 2011, the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Turkey wishes to 
submit the following additional information regarding the questions number 3 and 6 in the 
said letter. 
</p>
<p><i>  Question number 3: 
</i></p>
<p>193. What kind measures have been taken to take back the emigrated persons back to 
their villages? 
</p>
<p>  Back to the Village and Rehabilitation Project; 
</p>
<p>194. This Project is designed to facilitate the return of Turkish citizen who want to 
voluntarily go back to their villages. It established the social and economic infrastructure in 
these villages in order to form sustainable living conditions for the returnees. The project 
also improves the adjustment capacity and social economic wellbeing of those citizens who 
do not wish to return to their villages.  
</p>
<p>195. Currently the said Project is applied in 14 cities in the Eastern and the Southeast 
Anatolia, namely Adiyaman, Agri, Batman, Bing&#246;l, Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Elazig, Hakkari, 
Mardin, Mus, Siirt, Srinak, Tunceli and Van. 
</p>
<p>196. According to the demographic data gathered from the Governor&#8216;s Office, 386360 
Turkish citizens of 62.448 households have left their villages in these 14 cities. Back to the 
Village and Rehabilitation Project, facilitated the return of 187.861 citizens from 28.384 
households so far. A 
</p>
<p>197. Also through the circular of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Turkey on 
&#8213;project based funding&#8214;, dates 30 June 2009, 87 sub-projects were financially supported. 
Among these projects which were supported from 2009 to 2011 are: construction of social 
center, your center, women and children education center, vocational school, dormitories, 
agriculture, and husbandry. 
</p>
<p>  Legislative Amendments: 
</p>
<p>198. The Law on Compensation for Damage Arising from Terror and Combatting Terror 
(Law 5233) was passed by the Parliament of the Republic of Turkey on July 17, 2004. The 
said law is intended to provide compensation to those citizens for damage caused during 
operations against terrorism. Compensation is provided for physical injuries, disabilities, 
death loss of immoveable and moveable properties. 
</p>
<p>199. The afore-mentioned law established numerous local Damage Assessment 
commissions headed by the Deputy Governors to investigate and compensate citizens. 
Multiple commissions were set up in Bing&#246;l, Diyarbakir, Hakari and Mardin where 
individual applications were above the average. Currently there exist 45 Commissions 
working country wide and 48 Commissions have already concluded their work. </p>

<p><b> E. Follow-up to mission to the United States of America</b>50<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Letter to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>200. On 1 May 2012, the Special Rapporteur addressed the following letter to the 
Government of the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>201. I have the honour to address you in my capacity as Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
terrorism pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/19, and in the spirit of the 
dialogue developed by the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Mr. Martin Scheinin, 
with your Excellency&#8216;s Government prior to, during and following his fact-finding mission 
to your country carried out between 16 to 25 May 2007 (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3). In this 
connection, I would also like to thank you for the opportunity I was given to discuss some 
of the concerns raised in the following in person with Mr. John Sammis, United States 
Deputy Representative for ECOSOC, on 20 October 2011 during my visit to New York on 
the margins of the presentation of my report to the Third Committee of the General 
Assembly (A/66/310). 
</p>
<p>202. In light of a number of developments at the national level that have taken place since 
my predecessor&#8216;s country visit to the United States, as well as at United Nations level, 
</p>
<p>including the recommendations issued in November 2010 following the Universal Periodic 
Review (UPR) of the United States,51 and the adoption of the respective Concluding 
Observations on the United States by the Committee on the Rights of the Child under the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
children in armed conflict in May 200852 and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination in the same month,53 I wish to follow up with your Excellency&#8216;s 
Government on a few issues that my predecessor elaborated on in his mission report on the 
legal and institutional counter-terrorism framework and practice in your country. I therefore 
take the opportunity to address some of the recent developments reported to me that have 
taken place at the national level. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detention, access to court and due process guarantees (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, paras. 55

<p><i>Continuing practice of indefinite detention without charge or trial and the enactment of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>National Defense Authorization Act 
</i></p>
<p>203. I take note that, as recommended in my predecessor&#8216;s report (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, 
para. 56), the categorization of persons as &#8213;unlawful enemy combatants&#8214; has been

persons detained under that previously termed categorization, I regret that the authorities 
have continued the practice of indefinite detention without charge or trial. This was first 
demonstrated by Executive Order 13567 issued by President Obama on 7 March 2011,54 
which instituted long-term or indefinite administrative detention for a select number of

</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, available at 
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-03-10/pdf/2011-5728.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>detainees held at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay. According to section 2 of the Order, 
continued law of war detention is warranted for a detainee if it is &#8213;necessary to protect 
</p>
<p>against a significant threat to the security of the United States&#8214;. While a Periodic Review 
Board (section 3 of the Order) has been established to review the situation of each detainee, 
it is to be noted that such a review pertains to an assessment of the necessity of the 
continued detention pursuant to section 2, rather than a review of the lawfulness of the 
detention as required by international human rights law under article 9, para. 4, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>204. In addition, on 31 December 2011, H.E. President Obama signed into law the H.R. 
1540, the &quot;National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012&#8214; (NDAA). In his 
</p>
<p>Presidential Statement made on that occasion, the President claimed to have signed the bill 
&#8213;despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, 
interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists.&#8214;55 I would like to draw the attention 
of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to my following main concerns in relation to that Act. 
</p>
<p>205. At the outset, I would like to refer to the recommendation of my predecessor to 
ensure that all detainees are held in accordance with international human rights standards, 
including that any form of detention is subject to accessible and effective court review, 
which entails the possibility of release (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 63). Pursuant to section 
1021 of the NDAA, covered persons, as defined by paragraph b of that provision, may be 
subjected to detention under the law of war without trial until the end of the hostilities 
authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force (sec. 1021 para. c (1) of the 
NDAA) and/or to trial by Military Commissions according to legislation amended by the 
2009 Military Commissions Act (sec. 1021 para. c (2) of the NDAA).  
</p>
<p>206. While the principle of detention during an international armed conflict of 
combatants, i.e. soldiers of one of the States involved in the war, until the end of hostilities 
is well-established in international humanitarian law, the NDAA extends the possibility of 
long-term or indefinite detention without charge or trial beyond the context of such conflict 
and determines its applicability also to those persons who are not combatants, including 
persons suspected of having provided substantial support (article 1021 para. (b) of the 
NDAA). 
</p>
<p>207. Furthermore, in relation to the recommendation for a full judicial review of any form 
of detention (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 63), I would like to highlight that while federal 
courts decided in favour of some Guantanamo detainees that had brought habeas corpus 
petitions, determining that there was no basis for their detention, this did not entail the 
detainees&#8216; release as the ruling spelt out that the applicable legislation did not give 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to the courts to order resettlement on the territory of the United States but 
affirmed the authority of the political branches of government to exercise the power of 
release of non-citizens held by the Federal Government.56 In this context, I would like to 
refer your Excellency&#8216;s Government to para. 83 of the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention&#8216;s report A/HRC/13/30, in which it is stated that &#8213;For such remedy [to cases of 
</p>
<p>arbitrary detention] to be effective, as required by article 2 (3) of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, detaining States are under an obligation to release the 
arbitrarily detained (foreign) detainee into their own territory even if they wish to deport the 
(foreign) detainee, but where deportation of the detainee otherwise liable for removal to the 
country of origin or to a third country accepting the detainee is not promptly possible.&#8214;57

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>208. Moreover, according to section 1023 of the NDAA, the objective of the NDAA 
periodic review of individuals held at Guantanamo Bay is not to determine the legality of 
any detainee&#8216;s law of war detention, but to make discretionary determinations whether or 
not a detainee represents a continuing threat to the security of the United States. 
</p>
<p>209. The aforementioned judicial and administrative remedies are not sufficient to meet 
the due process standards, as embodied in article 9, paras. 3 and 4 of the ICCPR, as they do 
not constitute an effective court review, which entails the possibility of release. In this 
context, I would like to refer to recommendations made to your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
</p>
<p>during the Universal Periodic Review calling on the authorities to ensure that all remaining 
detainees be tried without delay in accordance with to international law or be released 
(A/HRC/16/11, paras. 92.156 and 92.160). 
</p>
<p>210. I would also like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to the 
overly broad definition of &#8213;covered persons&#8214; as contained in section 1021 para. (b) of the 
</p>
<p>NDAA, in particular the term &#8213;substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated 
forces&#8214; [emphasis added]. I note that section 1021 para. (e) of the NDAA was introduced 
on 12 December 2011, by Congress as a new provision, which declares the continuing 
applicability of existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, 
lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons captured or arrested in the 
United States. This, however, does not remedy my serious concern regarding the 
incompatibility of section 1021 of the NDAA with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>211. Furthermore, section 1022 of the NDAA provides for military custody for covered 
persons as established by paragraph 2 of this provision. While noting that the term &#8213;covered 
</p>
<p>persons&#8214; is narrowly defined, I am concerned that military custody is established as a 
</p>
<p>general rule for the defined category of individuals, with the only exception of a waiver 
submitted by the President to Congress containing a certification in writing that such a 
waiver is in the country&#8216;s national security interest. It is my understanding that previous 
</p>
<p>similar cases of arrests inside the country and subsequent custody have been successfully 
handled by federal, state and local law enforcement authorities. While H.E. President 
Obama in his statement of 31 December 2011, said that he &#8213;reject[ed] any approach that 
</p>
<p>would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of 
incapacitating a terrorist threat&#8214;,58 I remain seriously concerned as to the breadth of the 
Act&#8216;s detention authority as it is not limited to individuals having committed a belligerent 
</p>
<p>act in the context of an actual armed conflict as required by the laws of war. This provision, 
termed by the President as &#8213;unnecessary and ha[ving] the potential to create uncertainty&#8214;,59 
puts the implementation of safeguards against violations of the most basic fundamental 
human rights, such as the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment and the prompt 
access to legal counsel, at stake.  
</p>
<p>212. Finally, in relation to the issue of long-term or indefinite detention and my 
predecessor&#8216;s comments regarding detainees held in Afghanistan and Iraq (A(HRC/6/17, 
para. 18), I would like to raise concern in relation to the situation of detainees held at the 
Bagram air base, Afghanistan, where, according to the information at my disposal, no 
judicial review, including in the form of habeas corpus, has been undertaken nor is 
currently permitted.60  
</p>
<p>213. In this connection, I would also like to refer to the Concluding Observations of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC/C/OPAC/USA/CO/1), in which it expressed its

<p>concern at the number of children detained in U.S. administered detention facilities in Iraq 
and Afghanistan over extended periods of time, in certain instances for one year or more, 
without adequate access to legal advisory services.61 The Committee recommended that the 
State guarantee periodic and impartial review of their detention and conduct such reviews at 
greater frequency for children than adults.62  
</p>
<p><i>  Ban on transfers from Guantanamo Bay  
</i></p>
<p>214. On 22 January 2009, H.E. President Obama issued Executive Order 13492 requiring 
the closure of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and calling for a prompt and 
comprehensive interagency review of the status of all individuals detained at the time 
therein. Pursuant to this interagency review,63 126 detainees of the 240 individuals 
reviewed were approved for transfer.64 
</p>
<p>215. However, section 1027 of the NDAA establishes a prohibition to transfer 
Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any reason, including prosecution and 
release. Furthermore, section 1028 of the NDAA restricts the transfer of detainees, 
previously cleared for release by the Administration, to foreign countries for resettlement or 
repatriation. In addition, Section 1026 of the NDAA prohibits the use of funds to construct 
or modify facilities in the United States to house detainees transferred from Guantanamo 
Bay. As a result, these provisions effectively block the implementation of Executive Order 
13492 to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. In this connection, I would like to 
refer to several recommendations made to your Excellency&#8216;s Government during the 
Universal Periodic Review in relation to the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention 
facility (A/HRC/16/11, paras. 92.155, 92.156, 92.157, 92.158 and 92.159). 
</p>
<p>216. In the light of the aforementioned concerns regarding the compatibility of the 
provisions of the NDAA with international human rights law, I would like to urge your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government to revisit and accordingly revoke those provisions and in the 
</p>
<p>meanwhile ensure that the Act is implemented in the most complete manner regarding the 
enjoyment of human rights.  
</p>
<p><i>  Failure to disestablish military commissions 
</i></p>
<p>217. The former Special Rapporteur urged your Excellency&#8216;s Government to disestablish 
the military commissions (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 59). While the legislation pertaining to 
the functioning of the Military Commissions has been amended by the 2009 Military 
Commissions Act, important incompatibilities with international human rights law persist 
in relation to the jurisdiction of military commissions, their composition, the use of 
evidence, the limited scope of the appellate review, and the death penalty (please refer to 
the letter of 27 April 2010 of the former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Mr. 
Martin Scheinin, and the former Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, Mr. Manfred Nowak, A/HRC/16/51/Add.1, p. 50). In 
the absence of a reply from your Excellency&#8216;s Government, and in view of the information 
I have received on the decision of the Convening Authority to seek the death penalty

 63 Final Report of the Guantanamo Review Task Force, 22 January 2010, available at 
</p>
<p>http://www.justice.gov/ag/guantanamo-review-final-report.pdf. 
 64 At the time of the release of the Report of the Guantanamo Review Task Force, 44 of the 126 had 
</p>
<p>already been transferred from Guantanamo to countries outside the United States. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b>  
</p>
<p>against Mr. Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri, I would like to reiterate the main concerns the two 
former mandate-holders had expressed. 
</p>
<p>218. While the term &#8213;unlawful enemy combatant&#8214; was removed from the amended 2009 
MCA, the definition of &#8213;alien unprivileged enemy belligerent&#8214;, as contained in &#167; 948a (7) 
</p>
<p>of the MCA, does not exclude the possibility of civilians being tried by military 
commissions. In this context, I would like to refer to recommendations made to your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government during the Universal Periodic Review in relation to the trial of 
</p>
<p>terrorist suspects by legally established judicial instances and not by exceptional tribunals 
or jurisdictions (A/HRC/16/11, paras. 92.218 and 92.170). 
</p>
<p>219. Furthermore, offences listed in &#167; 950v (24)-(29) of the 2009 MCA (terrorism, 
providing material support for terrorism, wrongfully aiding the enemy, spying and 
conspiracy) go beyond offences under the law of war. The amended Act has not addressed 
the serious concern of the retroactive applicability of criminal law by military commissions, 
to the extent that the offences listed were not covered by the law applicable at the time of 
the commission of the actual acts. This is in breach of article 15 of the ICCPR and 
universally acknowledged principles of law. 
</p>
<p>220. Moreover, provisions for the composition of military commissions have not been 
amended in substance. This is why I would like to reiterate the former mandate-holders&#8216; 
concern about the lack of independence and impartiality, including the lack of appearance 
of impartiality, of the commissions, which mainly result from the principle that members in 
a military commission are selected for each trial by the convening authority, which forms 
part of the executive branch, and the fact that there is still no prohibition against the 
selection of members of a commission who fall within the same chain of command. 
</p>
<p>221. As my predecessor did, I would like to welcome that the amended provisions 
exclude &#8213;any statement obtained by the use of torture or by cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment, as defined by section 1003 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005&#8214; to be 
</p>
<p>admissible in a military commission proceeding. In addition, &#167; 948r (c) (2) (B) of the 2009 
MCA requires in relation to other statements, that the statement be made &#8213;voluntarily&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>While I note that the military judge is required to consider in the determination of the 
&#8213;voluntariness&#8214; the circumstances defined in &#167; 948r (d) of the 2009 MCA, the new 
provisions make exceptions regarding statements made at the point of capture or during 
closely related active combat engagement, provided the interest of justice be best served by 
admission of the statement into evidence. Moreover, I deeply regret that, pursuant to &#167; 949a 
(b) (3) (d) of the 2009 MCA, hearsay evidence is still admissible, noting, however, that this 
applies now within stricter limits than under the previous legislation.  
</p>
<p>222. In addition, pursuant to &#167; 950g (d) of the 2009 MCA, the scope of review applies 
only to the findings and sentences as approved by the Convening Authority and as affirmed 
or set aside as incorrect in law by the United States Court of Military Commission Review. 
In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit as the 
exclusive appellate jurisdiction (&#167; 950g (a) of the 2009 MCA), shall take action only with 
respect to matters of law, which raises concerns as to its compatibility with article 14, para. 
5, of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>223. Finally, in relation to my predecessor&#8216;s recommendation that the imposition of the 
death penalty be excluded for military tribunals or courts martial, I note with deep regret 
that the death penalty continues to be available for certain crimes under the amended 2009 
MCA. As highlighted in my predecessor&#8216;s report, article 6 of the ICCPR requires that 
</p>
<p>where a State seeks to impose the death penalty, it is obliged to ensure that fair trial rights 
under article 14 of the ICCPR are rigorously guaranteed, which is, as shown above, not the 
case for military commissions.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>224. In sum, given the persisting significant inconsistencies of the 2009 MCA with 
international human rights law, I urge your Excellency&#8216;s Government to revoke this 
</p>
<p>legislation and ensure that all detainees still held at Guantanamo Bay are brought before 
federal courts for prosecution or released. 
</p>
<p><b>  Interrogation and rendition practices (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, paras. 61 and 62)  
</b></p>
<p>225. I would like to positively note the adoption of Executive Order 13491 by President 
Obama on 22 January 2009, which revoked orders and regulations adopted after 11 
September 2001, which might have contradicted international and national minimum 
standards. As previously highlighted by the former Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, Mr. Leandro Despouy, and the former Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Mr. Manfred Nowak, in 
their press release of 23 January 2009, in implementing these decisions, the United States 
Government ought to fully respect all human rights obligations, including the absolute 
prohibition of torture and the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p>226. In this connection, my predecessor recommended to your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
to take transparent steps to ensure that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) practice of 
&#8213;extraordinary rendition&#8214; is completely discontinued and is not conducted in the future 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 62). Required steps for a full discontinuation and prevention of 
such practices to reoccur in the future include measures of accountability in relation to the 
implementation of interrogation techniques that violated article 7 ICCPR, the Convention 
against Torture and, in the context of an armed conflict, common article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions.  
</p>
<p>227. The information at my disposal further suggests that despite the serious allegations 
of incidents of torture only very few effective criminal investigations against the actual 
perpetrators, superiors who ordered, or acquiesced, in these practices or those who legally 
authorized them were conducted and concluded so far. I note that a number of internal, 
disciplinary and otherwise administrative procedures have been instituted or completed in 
different parts of the executive and legislative branches. However, in the face of the serious 
aforementioned allegations, it is my opinion that those non-judicial measures are 
insufficient to meet the State&#8216;s obligation under article 12 of the CAT, which provides that 
</p>
<p>it has to investigate ex officio all cases where there is reasonable ground to believe that an 
act of torture has been committed.65 In this connection, I would like to draw to the attention 
of your Excellency's Government the Principles on the Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, recommended by General Assembly resolution 55/89 of 4 December 2000, 
and in particular principle 3 (a), which provides: &#8213;The investigative authority shall have the 
</p>
<p>power and obligation to obtain all the information necessary to the inquiry. The persons 
conducting the investigation shall have at their disposal all the necessary budgetary and 
technical resources for effective investigation. They shall also have the authority to oblige 
all those acting in an official capacity allegedly involved in torture or ill-treatment to appear 
and testify. The same shall apply to any witness. To this end, the investigative authority 
shall be entitled to issue summonses to witnesses, including any officials allegedly 
involved, and to demand the production of evidence.&#8214; In light of these requirements, I 
</p>
<p>emphasize the importance of judicial inquiries into the serious allegations of torture.  
</p>
<p>228. Moreover, I would like to draw the attention of your Excellency&#8216;s Government to 
the Concluding Observations of the Committee against Torture, in which it recommended 
that the authorities &#8213;promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigate any responsibility of 
</p>
<p>  
 65 See also, A/65/273, para. 55 and A/HRC/13/39, para. 45. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b>  
</p>
<p>senior military and civilian officials authorizing, acquiescing or consenting in any way, to 
acts of torture committed by their subordinates.66 Furthermore, I would like to refer in this 
context to the report on the Joint Study on Global Practices in Relation to Secret Detention 
in the Context of Countering Terrorism, A/HRC/13/42, in particular to recommendations 
made to all concerned States, as contained in para. 292 (e) and (f) in relation to 
investigations regarding alleged instances of secret detention and torture and other ill-
treatment.  
</p>
<p>229. As regards required accountability measures, I would also like to express concern at 
the reported destruction by the CIA of almost one hundred videotapes documenting the use 
of &#8213;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8214;, including water-boarding, on Mr. Zayn Al-Abidin 
Muhammad Husayn and Mr. Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri. In this connection, I took note of 
the respective judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York which denied that the CIA could be held in civil contempt as the Agency had enacted 
an internal protocol that should avoid such destructions to occur in the future. 67 While 
positively acknowledging that the CIA has instituted some kind of preventive measure, 
which according to the ruling judge &#8213;should lead to greater accountability within the 
</p>
<p>Agency and prevent another episode like the videotapes&#8216; destruction&#8214;, I would like raise my 
doubt as to whether these new protocols would constitute a sufficient and effective remedy 
in relation to the Agency&#8216;s accountability and its personnel that is in compliance with 
international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>230. In this connection, I would also like to express my regret at the recent decision by 
the District Court of Colombia of 2 April 2012,68 dismissing a case challenging the refusal 
by your Excellency&#8216;s Government to disclose certain documents to the plaintiffs pursuant 
to the Freedom of Information Act concerning the involvement of the United Kingdom in 
the US programmes of extraordinary renditions, secret detention and coercive interrogation 
of suspected terrorists. The decision appears to have been based on an erroneous 
understanding of the constitutional position of the United Kingdom's All-Party 
Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition (APPGR). As I said in the statement 
issued on 12 April 2012,69 the APPGR cannot sensibly be categorised as an emanation of 
the State or of the Government of the United Kingdom. Under the system of Cabinet 
Government in the United Kingdom the APPGR is entirely independent of government and 
is a model of democratic oversight of the actions of the intelligence and security services. 
Transparency about the involvement of State officials in the rendition of terrorist suspects is 
essential to securing the accountability of public officials and bringing an end to impunity 
for serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>231. Furthermore, according to the information at my disposal, I would like to express 
concern about the use of techniques outlined the United States Army Field Manual, which 
in its appendix M includes the employment of the &#8213;separation interrogation technique&#8214;, by 
</p>
<p>exception, to meet unique and critical operational requirements. In this connection, I would 
like to refer to the report of the Special Rapporteur on torture, Mr. Juan Mendez, to the 
General Assembly (A/66/268), in which he finds that &#8213;where the physical conditions and 
the prison regime of solitary confinement cause severe mental and physical pain or

<p><b>  Definitions of terrorism and material support (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 64) 
</b></p>
<p>232. My predecessor recommended to your Excellency&#8216;s Government to restrict 
definitions of &#8213;international terrorism&#8214;, &#8213;domestic terrorism&#8214; and &#8213;material support to 
terrorist organizations&#8214; in a way that is precise and restricted to the type of conduct 
</p>
<p>identified by the Security Council as conduct to be suppressed in the fight against terrorism 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 64). In this connection, I remain concerned at the broad 
interpretation by your Excellency&#8216;s Government of the prohibition to &#8213;knowingly provide 
</p>
<p>material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization&#8214;, &#167;2339B(a)(1) of 18 U. S. 
</p>

activities: training (&#167;2339A(b)(2) 18 U. S. C.), expert advice or assistance (&#167;2339A(b)(3) 
18 U. S. C.) and the provision of personnel (&#167;2339B(h) 18 U. S. C.). In my opinion, the 
prohibition of these activities, in the context of the furthering of legal political objectives of 
a designated entity is likely to violate international human rights law, in particular article 19 
of the ICCPR. Therefore, as the case of Holder vs. Humanitarian Law Project 
demonstrated, the provision of advice to train members of a designated organization how to 
use international law to resolve disputes peacefully and to teach them how to petition for 
relief various representative bodies such as the United Nations, can naturally not constitute 
a crime, as such activity does not in itself further &#8211; i.e. materially support &#8211; the terrorist 
ends of such organization or free up any resources of that organization that may then be 
used to pursue its terrorist activities.71 
</p>
<p>233. Furthermore, the former Special Rapporteur strongly urged the authorities to ensure 
that they do not participate in the extrajudicial execution of any person, including terrorist 
suspects (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 64). According to the information at my disposal, your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government is alleged to have conducted several targeted killings in a number 
</p>
<p>of countries pursuant to a new policy. Together with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, I have addressed one of these cases in a 
communication to your Excellency&#8216;s Government of 2 November 2011, to which we await 
</p>
<p>your Excellency&#8216;s Government&#8216;s reply.  
</p>
<p><b>  Racial and religious profiling (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 65) 
</b></p>
<p>234. In his country mission report, my predecessor also recommended not to use the 
country of origin of a person as a proxy for racial or religious profiling, and urged the 
authorities not to act in a manner which might be seen as advocating the use of race or 
religion for the identification of persons as terrorists. In this connection, I would like to 
refer to the recommendation of the Committee against the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination that the State party strengthen its efforts to combat racial profiling at the 
federal and state levels [&#8230;]72and to recommendations made on the occasion of the 
Universal Periodic Review of the United States, A/HRC/16/11, particularly those contained

</p>
<p><b>  Privacy and surveillance (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, paras. 67 and 68) 
</b></p>
<p>235. In relation to the former Special Rapporteur&#8216;s recommendation regarding the 
introduction of an independent mechanism to ensure the compliance of the Attorney 
General&#8216;s guidelines on the availability of surveillance warrants under the Foreign 
Intelligence Service Act (FISA) and the minimization procedures applicable to the 
surveillance of U.S. persons (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 67), it appears to me that with the 
four-year extension of the Patriot Act, signed into law by H.E. President Obama in May 
2011, the main concerns as raised in the country mission report persist.  
</p>
<p>236. Finally, regarding the call by my predecessor to take steps to introduce independent 
checks and balances upon the authority of the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and 
other intelligence agencies to use National Security Letters (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, para. 68), 
I am concerned at reports alleging widespread violations of law committed by the FBI in 
the period of 2001 to 2008. 73 Information at my disposal also suggests that nearly one third 
of the alleged violations were related to the unlawful use of National Security Letters. 
</p>
<p>237. I would, therefore, in connection with the issues elaborated in this letter, be grateful 
if your Excellency&#8216;s Government could provide me with detailed substantive information 
</p>

</p>
<p>appropriate as follow-up to my predecessor&#8216;s recommendations contained in his country 
visit report, at your earliest convenience, but no later than 31 May 2012: 
</p>
<p>1. In the light of the recently adopted National Defense Authorization Act as 
well as the 2009 Military Commissions Act, what steps does your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government envisage to ensure that legislation and practice in relation to the detention of 
terrorist suspects comply with international human rights norms and standards? 
</p>
<p>2. How does your Excellency&#8216;s Government ensure that investigations 
conducted in relation to allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees, including 
those held at Guantanamo Bay, meet the country&#8216;s obligations under article 12 of CAT?  
</p>
<p>3. Kindly provide me with information on current practices applied as 
&#8213;separation interrogation technique&#8214; under Appendix M of the Army Field Manual and 
explain how your Excellency&#8216;s Government ensures that they do not amount to torture or 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>4. How does your Excellency&#8216;s Government ensure that the material support 
clause is in compliance with international human rights law? 
</p>
<p>5. In relation to the alleged extrajudicial killings of terrorist suspects, I would 
like to receive information on the rules of international law that your Excellency&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>Government considers to govern its determination that people be targeted and the basis for 
a determination to kill rather than capture; clarity as to which treaty instruments or 
customary norms are considered to apply to target and kill individuals, including terrorist 
suspects; the legal basis, your Excellency&#8216;s Government invokes to determine the targeted 
individual to be a combatant or a civilian directly participating in hostilities; whether your 
Excellency&#8216;s Government considers its determination to be governed by the law applicable 
to the use of inter-State force and the international law doctrine of self-defense, and

</p>
<p>238. My intention is to report on my correspondence with your Excellency&#8216;s Government 
in a forthcoming report to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>239. The Special Rapporteur received the following reply by the Government of the 
United States of America dated 12 June 2012. 
</p>
<p>240. Thank you for your letter of May 1, 2012, inviting the United States to provide 
supplemental information on issues raised by the former Special Rapporteur Martin 
Scheinin in his 2007 mission report as well as information on certain other identified issues. 
The United States welcomes the opportunity to respond to your request, and has 
endeavoured to provide as complete a response as possible by the requested reply date of 
May 31, 2012. 
</p>
<p>241. The United States has taken numerous steps to fulfill President Obama&#8216;s 
commitments to review and, where necessary, reform U.S. detention, interrogation, and 
transfer policies, to uphold the rule of law in U.S. detention practices, and to ensure 
conformity of U.S. detention practices with U.S. obligations under international law. This 
response highlights certain of these steps that are responsive to your request. 
</p>
<p><b>  The Framework Set Forth in Executive Order 13491: 
</b></p>
<p>242. The United States understands that there have been concerns about a lack of 
adequate international legal protections for individuals the United States engages with 
overseas, particularly in armed conflict situations. In part to address these concerns, 
President Obama has taken a number of actions, including the January 22, 2009 issuance of 
three Executive Orders relating to U.S. detention and interrogation policies broadly and the 
Guantanamo Bay detention facility specifically. Executive Order 13491 on Ensuring 
Lawful Interrogations, 74 Fed. Reg. 4894 (2009), which was adopted, inter alia, &#8213;to ensure 
compliance with the treaty obligations of the United States, including the Geneva 
Conventions,&#8214; provides that: 
</p>
<p>243. Consistent with the requirements of . . . the Convention Against Torture, Common 
Article 3, and other laws regulating the treatment and interrogation of individuals detained 
in any armed conflict, such persons shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and shall 
not be subjected to violence to life and person . . . whenever such individuals are in the 
custody or under the effective control of an officer, employee, or other agent of the United </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>States Government or detained within a facility owned, operated, or controlled by a 
department or agency of the United States. 
</p>
<p><i>  Id., Preamble and Sec. 3(a). 
</i></p>
<p>244. Executive Order 13491 directed a review of U.S. interrogation practices in order to: 
improve the effectiveness of human intelligence-gathering; promote the safe, lawful, and 
humane treatment of individuals in United States custody, and of United States personnel 
who are detained in armed conflicts; and ensure compliance with the treaty obligations of 
the United States, including the Geneva Conventions, and domestic law. That review 
culminated in a report that proposed that the Obama Administration establish a specialized 
interrogation group to bring together officials from law enforcement, the U.S. Intelligence 
Community, and the Department of Defense to conduct interrogations in a manner that will 
strengthen national security consistent with the rule of law. The report also made policy 
recommendations with respect to scenarios in which the United States moves or facilitates 
the movement of a person from one country to another or from U.S. custody to the custody 
of another country to ensure that U.S. practices in such transfers comply with U.S. law, 
policy, and international obligations, and do not result in the transfer of individuals to face 
torture. The President has reviewed and accepted the recommendations of the Task Force, 
and the U.S. Government is implementing the Task Force recommendations.  
</p>
<p>245. The Executive Order also prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
treatment and directs the use of only those interrogation techniques set forth in the Army 
Field Manual and other authorized federal law enforcement techniques. The Order provided 
that in relying on the Army Field Manual, &#8213;officers, employees, and other agents of the 
</p>
<p>United States Government&#8214;. . .&#8213;may not, in conducting interrogations, rely upon any 
</p>
<p>interpretation of the law governing interrogation -- including interpretations of Federal 
criminal laws, the Convention Against Torture, Common Article 3, Army Field Manual 2&#8211;
22.3, and its predecessor document, Army Field Manual 34&#8211;52 -- issued by the Department 
of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009.&#8214; (Section 3(c)). The Army 
Field Manual is consistent with Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR) and with the requirements of the Convention Against Torture.  
</p>
<p>246. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the applicability of Common 
Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to the conflict with Al Qaeda, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 
548 U.S. 557, 630-631 (2006), and the United States announced in March 2011 that it 
supports the principles set forth in Article 75 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva 
Conventions of 1949 as a set of norms that it follows out of a sense of legal obligation in 
international armed conflict. It has also urged the U.S. Senate to provide advice and consent 
to ratification of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, which contains detailed 
humane treatment standards and fair trial guarantees that apply to any criminal proceeding 
associated with the conduct of non-international armed conflict. The United States has 
recently conducted an extensive review and concluded that current U.S. military practices 
are consistent with Protocol II, as well as with Article 75 of Protocol I, including the rules 
within these instruments that parallel the rules in the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>247. The United States has continued to work to address concerns of the international 
community and civil society in regard to its actions abroad, recognizing that complex issues 
arise with respect to the relevant body of law that determines whether a State&#8216;s actions in 
</p>
<p>the actual conduct of an armed conflict comport with international law. Under the doctrine 
of lex specialis, the applicable rules for the protection of individuals and conduct of 
hostilities in armed conflict are typically found in international humanitarian law, including 
the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Hague Regulations of 1907, and other international 
humanitarian law instruments, as well as in the customary international law of armed 
conflict. In this context, it is important to bear in mind that international human rights law </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>and the law of armed conflict are in many respects complementary and mutually 
reinforcing. These two bodies of law contain many similar protections. For example, 
prohibitions on torture and cruel treatment exist in both, and the drafters in each area have 
drawn from the other in developing aspects of new instruments; the Commentaries to 
Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions make clear that a number of provisions in 
the Protocol were modeled on comparable provisions in the ICCPR. Determining the 
international law rule that applies to a particular action taken by a government in the 
context of an armed conflict is a fact-specific determination, which cannot be easily 
generalized. 
</p>
<p><b>  Investigation into allegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment: 
</b></p>
<p>248. The United States does not permit its personnel to engage in acts of torture or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment of people in its custody, either within or outside U.S. 
territory. This principle is embodied in multiple U.S. laws and has been reaffirmed by 
President Obama with respect to all situations of armed conflict, as discussed above. 
</p>
<p>249. The Obama Administration has released, in whole or in part, more than 40 opinions 
and memoranda authored by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) 
concerning national security matters as a result of litigation under the Freedom of 
Information Act. These include four previously classified memoranda released on April 16, 
2009, which addressed the legality of various techniques used to interrogate terrorism 
suspects detained by the CIA and which were revoked to the extent that they were 
inconsistent with Executive Order 13491. 
</p>
<p>250. The U.S. Government has vigorously investigated allegations of detainee abuse and 
has prosecuted individuals for engaging in such conduct. The Department of Defense, 
Department of Justice, and other components of the U.S. Government have investigated or 
prosecuted allegations of mistreatment of detainees held in connection with 
counterterrorism operations, including in administrative and criminal inquiries and 
proceedings.  
</p>
<p>251. The Department of Justice has successfully prosecuted two instances of detainee 
abuse in federal civilian court. In 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice brought criminal 
charges against David Passaro, a CIA contractor accused of brutally assaulting a detainee in 
Afghanistan in 2003. The CIA described his conduct as &#8213;unlawful, reprehensible, and 
neither authorized nor condoned by the Agency.&#8214; Passaro was convicted of felony assault 
and sentenced to eight years and four months in prison. In a second case, on February 3, 
2009, Don Ayala, a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan, was convicted in U.S. federal court of 
voluntary manslaughter in the death of an individual whom he and U.S. soldiers had 
detained. 
</p>
<p>252. The U.S. Attorney&#8216;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia continues to 
investigate various allegations of abuse of detainees. In addition, the Attorney General 
announced on August 24, 2009, that he had ordered &#8213;a preliminary review into whether 
federal laws were violated in connection with the interrogation of specific detainees at 
overseas locations.&#8214; Assistant U.S. Attorney John Durham assembled an investigative team 
of experienced professionals to recommend to the Attorney General whether a full 
investigation was warranted &#8213;into whether the law was violated in connection with the 
</p>
<p>interrogation of certain detainees.&#8214; Following a two-year investigation, on June 30, 2011, 
the Justice Department announced that it was opening a full criminal investigation into the 
deaths of two individuals in CIA custody overseas, and that it had concluded that further 
investigation into the other cases examined in the preliminary investigation was not 
warranted. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Detention at Guantanamo Bay: 
</b></p>
<p>253. With respect to detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, all U.S. detention operations, 
including at Guantanamo Bay, are consistent with Common Article 3 of the Geneva 
Conventions, and other applicable international laws. The Obama Administration remains 
committed to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. In addition, the 
Administration remains committed to maintaining a principled, credible, and sustainable 
policy for detention under the law of war, regardless of location.  
</p>
<p>254. Pursuant to Executive Order 13492, one of the three January 22, 2009 orders, a task 
force composed of representatives from the U.S. Departments of Defense, State, Justice, 
and Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the &#8213;Task Force&#8214;) completed, in January 2010, a 
comprehensive review of the 240 individuals detained at Guantanamo and subject to the 
review to determine whether those individuals should be transferred from U.S. custody, 
tried by the U.S. Government for criminal conduct, or whether another lawful disposition, 
consistent with the interests of justice, and the national security and foreign policy interests 
of the United States, was appropriate. As a result of that process, 126 individuals at 
Guantanamo were designated for transfer, 36 detainees were designated for potential 
prosecution, 48 detainees were designated for continued detention under the law of war 
based on a finding that they pose a national security threat that could not be mitigated 
sufficiently if transferred from U.S. custody at that time, and 30 detainees from Yemen 
were designated for &#8213;conditional detention&#8214; based on the current security environment in 
</p>
<p>that country. Since the Task Force completed its review, 69 detainees have been transferred 
to 25 different destinations, including the transfer of 40 detainees to third countries due to 
humane treatment or other concerns in their home countries. One hundred and sixty-nine 
detainees remain at Guantanamo.  
</p>
<p>255. In 2008, the Supreme Court held in Boumediene v. Bush that individuals detained 
by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay have the constitutional right to petition 
for habeas corpus relief. Since the decision in Boumediene, detainees have been 
challenging the legality of their detention via habeas corpus petitions in the U.S. Federal 
District Court in the District of Columbia, a court that is part of the independent judicial 
branch of the U.S. Government, and separate from the Executive Branch. Detainees have 
access to counsel of their choice and to appropriate evidence, and are assured a means of 
challenging the lawfulness of their detention before an independent court. Except in rare 
circumstances required by compelling security interests, all of the evidence relied upon by 
the government to justify detention in habeas proceedings is disclosed to the detainees&#8216; 
counsel, who have been granted security clearances to view the classified evidence, and the 
detainees may submit written statements and provide live testimony at their hearings via 
video link. The United States has the burden in these cases to establish its legal authority to 
hold the detainees by a preponderance of the evidence. 
</p>
<p>256. Since Boumediene, all of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay who have prevailed in 
habeas proceedings under orders that are no longer subject to appeal have either been 
repatriated or re-settled, or have received offers of resettlement. Approximately 25 
detainees have been released after winning their habeas cases in the federal courts. 
</p>
<p>257. In March 2011, President Obama issued Executive Order 13567, which, consistent 
with applicable law, provides periodic review for certain individuals detained at 
Guantanamo Bay. This periodic review process is designed to ensure that such individuals 
are detained only as long as necessary to protect against a significant threat to the security 
of the United States. The periodic review process includes a full review at least every three 
years, in addition to file reviews every six months. For each full review, the detainee may 
introduce relevant information, call certain witnesses, answer any questions posed by the 
Periodic Review Board, and present a written or oral statement. The detainee will be </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>assisted by a government-provided personal representative to advocate on his behalf during 
the review process and, in addition, may be assisted by private counsel at no expense to the 
government. If a significant question is raised as to whether the detainee&#8216;s continued 
detention is warranted during a file review, a full review will be convened promptly. The 
Department of Defense has published guidelines to implement the periodic review process 
required by the President&#8216;s Executive Order and the NDAA. 
</p>
<p>258. The United States has also implemented enhanced procedural protections for 
military commissions, including: prohibiting the admission at trial of statements obtained 
by use of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, except against a person accused 
of torture or such treatment as evidence that the statement was made; providing a right to 
exculpatory evidence and a right to present evidence, compel witnesses, compel favorable 
testimony, and challenge the government&#8216;s evidence; stipulating that an accused in a capital 
</p>
<p>case be provided with counsel &#8213;learned in applicable law relating to capital cases&#8214;; 
</p>
<p>providing the accused with greater latitude in selecting his or her own military defense 
counsel; enhancing the accused&#8216;s right to discovery; and establishing an enhanced system 
</p>
<p>for handling classified information. 
</p>
<p><b>  Detention in Afghanistan: 
</b></p>
<p>259. On March 9, 2012 the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan signed 
a Memorandum of Understanding regarding the transfer of approximately 3,100 Afghan 
detainees at the Detention Facility in Parwan (DFIP) to Afghanistan in six months, and 
arrangements to transfer full responsibility for the facility. On April 8, 2012, the U.S. 
Government and the Government of Afghanistan signed a further memorandum of 
understanding regarding Afghanization of Special Operations, which confirmed that 
Afghan nationals newly detained by U.S. forces, outside special operations, as defined in 
the MOU, are to be released or transferred to Afghan authorities for prosecution or 
administrative detention in accordance with Afghan law. 
</p>
<p>260. Under current review procedures for individuals held at the DFIP, the U.S. 
Department of Defense reviews the basis for the detainee&#8216;s detention 60 days after transfer 
</p>
<p>to the DFIP, six months later, and periodically thereafter. These robust Detainee Review 
Board (DRB) procedures have improved the ability of the United States to assess whether 
the facts support the detention of each individual, and enhance a detainee's ability to 
challenge the basis of detention as well as the determination that continued detention is 
necessary to mitigate the threat posed by the detainee. For example, each detainee is 
appointed a personal representative, who is required to act in the best interests of the 
detainee and has access to all reasonably available information (including classified 
information) relevant to review board proceedings. Detainees can present evidence and 
witnesses if reasonably available, and the United States helps facilitate the collection of 
documentary evidence (such as letters from family and local villagers on behalf of 
detainees), as well as witness appearances in person, telephonically, or by video 
conferencing. The unclassified portions of review board proceedings are generally open, 
including to family, nongovernmental observers, and other interested parties. 
Determinations that a detainee meets the criteria for continued detention are reviewed for 
legal sufficiency by a Judge Advocate. Detainees are provided with the non-classified 
results of these reviews of their cases. 
</p>
<p>261. The United States also has expended considerable effort to support Afghan criminal 
trials for detainees captured and detained by coalition forces in Afghanistan and to support 
Afghan administrative review procedures similar to the U.S. DRB procedures. In June 
2010, the U.S. and Afghan Governments partnered to establish the Justice Center in Parwan 
(JCIP), which enables the transition of U.S. military detainees into the Afghan criminal 
justice system through transparent trials conducted by the Government of Afghanistan </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>62</b>  
</p>
<p>under Afghan law. The JCIP has become the premier venue for the fair and legitimate 
prosecution of Afghan national security cases. U.S. Government officials provide 
mentoring, training, and assistance to Afghan judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and 
investigators at the JCIP. The courts at the JCIP&#8212;which include primary and appellate 
courts for adult and juvenile defendants&#8212;have processed 548 national security criminal 
cases over the past 18 months. The United States has also worked with coalition partners to 
establish monitoring procedures for detainees transferred from the International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF) to Afghan custody.  
</p>
<p><b>  Detention Provisions in the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act: 
</b></p>
<p>262. Over the past three years, Congress has imposed a series of restrictions on the 
discretion of the Executive Branch to transfer or prosecute individuals held at Guantanamo 
Bay. As your letter observes, the NDAA continues prohibitions on the use of funds for the 
transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States and the construction of detention 
facilities in the United States to house Guantanamo Bay detainees. The Administration 
opposed these restrictions as well as those imposing constraints on its ability to transfer 
detainees abroad, which you also note in your letter.  
</p>
<p>263. Although we will continue to interpret these provisions to avoid constitutional 
conflict, ultimately the Administration seeks repeal of these restrictions so that disposition 
of the remaining Guantanamo Bay detainees can move forward as appropriate, consistent 
with the national security interests of the United States and the interests of justice. These 
restrictions apply only to FY 2012 and the Administration will oppose efforts to impose 
such restrictions in the FY 2013 NDAA. 
</p>
<p>264. We also note that Section 1021 of the NDAA creates no new detention authorities; it 
simply reaffirms the President's existing authority under the 2001 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force (AUMF), as informed by the laws of war, to detain certain individuals until 
the end of the hostilities authorized by the AUMF. Section 1021(d) states plainly that 
&#8213;[n]othing in [Section 1021] is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or 
</p>
<p>the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force.&#8214; As the President has made clear, 
we will interpret Section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes 
complies with our Constitution, the international law of war, and all other applicable law. 
</p>
<p>265. With respect to Section 1022 of the NDAA, the temporary military custody 
requirement in that section applies to a very narrow category of terrorism suspects and can 
be waived. President Obama made clear in his December 31, 2011 signing statement that he 
&#8213;reject[s] any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement 
</p>
<p>provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat.&#8214; He also emphasized that under 
no circumstances will he accept an interpretation of the NDAA that purports to establish a 
rigid, across-the-board requirement for military detention, or that compromises the U.S. 
ability to conduct counter-terrorism investigations in the manner that it has done for the 
past three years.  
</p>
<p>266. On February 28, 2012, the President issued a directive that sets out procedures for 
determining who is subject to Section 1022 and when it should be waived. It explains when 
and how any military custody determination will be made, exercises the waiver of the 
military custody requirement in several categories of cases, and sets out procedures for 
exercising additional case-by-case waiver authority in the interest of national security. 
These procedures are designed to ensure that Section 1022 is implemented in a manner 
consistent with all applicable law, the President&#8216;s signing statement, and the flexibility 
</p>
<p>provided in the statute. They also recognize that the U.S. civilian criminal justice system 
and our law enforcement officials, often with cooperation from our partners abroad, have 
been invaluable in disrupting terrorist plots and incapacitating terrorists through </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>63 
</b></p>
<p>prosecution and incarceration, and will continue to be essential to our counterterrorism 
strategy going forward. 
</p>
<p>267. With respect to questions concerning the legal and policy framework for U.S. 
military operations against Al-Qae&#8216;da and associated forces, including U.S. targeting 
practices, reflective of the importance this Administration has placed on transparency, the 
United States has publicly discussed such issues several times in the last year. We would 
refer you in particular to the speeches by Assistant to the President John O. Brennan at the 
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars on April 30, 2012; Attorney General 
Eric Holder at Northwestern University School of Law on March 5, 2012; and Department 
of Defense General Counsel Jeh Johnson at Yale Law School on February 22, 2012. 
</p>
<p>268. The United States welcomes a continuing, open dialogue with you, and we hope that 
this information helps to underscore the United States&#8216; abiding commitment to the humane 
</p>
<p>treatment of individuals while countering terrorism. We are committed to the 
implementation of the General Assembly&#8216;s Global Counterterrorism Strategy that makes 
clear that strong and effective counterterrorism policies and practices are not only 
compatible with human rights, but can best succeed when they are grounded in human 
rights and the rule of law. The United States&#8216; commitment to UN efforts to advance 
Member States&#8216; protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law at home and 
</p>
<p>abroad is demonstrated in part by our forthcoming $1 million grant to the UN 
Counterterrorism Implementation Task Force to deliver training, technical advice and 
capacity building in this regard. We continue to work closely with UN Member States to 
advance the protection and promotion of human rights and the rule of law at home and 
abroad, and we thank you for your actions in support of these shared goals.
