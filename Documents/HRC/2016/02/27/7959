<p><b>A/HRC/22/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b>  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations by Myanmar on the Report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar 
(A/HRC/22/58) 
</b></p>
<p><b> I.  Prisoners of conscience 
</b></p>
<p>1. Paragraph 8 of the Report contains the allegations of continued arrest for political 
reasons.  
</p>
<p>2. These allegations are unfounded. Nobody is arrested on political grounds. 
Maintenance of law and order is a key responsibility of the government. Legal action is 
taken against those who violated the existing laws.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Conditions of detention and treatment of prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>3. Paragraph 11 of the Report contains the allegations of arbitrary arrest and torture of 
the people accused of association with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Legal action 
was taken against those who were found guilty of being unlawfully associated with the 
KIA. 
</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 11 also contains the allegations that Muslim prisoners detained in 
Buthidaung Prison after the violence in 2012 were tortured and beaten to death. The 
authorities have examined these allegations. After verification, they found out that the 
allegations were baseless.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conflict and the situation of ethnic minorities 
</b></p>
<p>5. Paragraph 37 of the Report contains the allegations of attack against civilian 
population and other forms of human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>6. These allegations are unfounded. It is regrettable that the Report has omitted the 
destructive, terrorist acts committed by the KIA in Kachin State. It is an undeniable fact 
that the KIA has committed terrorist acts there, causing the deaths of the innocent people 
and the massive destruction of public utilities and infrastructure such as the power grids, 
rail roads, bridges and motor ways. These terrorist acts are too obvious to be ignored.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation in Rakhine State 
</b></p>
<p>7. Paragraph 48 of the Report contains the allegations of harassment, arbitrary arrest, 
arbitrary restriction of movement, destruction of places of worship and restrictions thereon. 
These allegations are unfounded. They do not match with the real situation on the ground. 
Temporary places of worship are set up in the IDP camps, reflecting the freedom of 
worship.  
</p>
<p>8. The government medical personnel are actively working closely together with the 
Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) and international partners to provide medical care 
and attention to the affected people in Rakhine State. 
</p>
<p>9. Academic examinations were held retrospectively to benefit the college students 
from the IDP camps, who had missed their regular exams. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/58/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>10. The views expressed in in paragraph 54 of the Report are inappropriate. Therefore, 
they are unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>11. Paragraph 56 contains the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendation to amend the 1982 
Myanmar Citizenship Act. His recommendation is unacceptable. No country is obligated to 
give citizenship to everybody who is living there. The 1982 Myanmar Citizenship Act does 
not target at any particular group. People living legally in Myanmar for three successive 
generations are eligible to apply for the naturalized citizenship. Therefore, we see no reason 
whatsoever to review or amend this Act.  
</p>
<p>12. We cannot go along with the views expressed in paragraphs 57, 58 and 59 of the 
Report. We cannot agree to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observation that Dr. Tun Aung is a 
prisoner of conscience. He was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment after having found 
guilty of charges such as the instigation and incitement to cause racial discord, the 
falsification of national registration certificate etc.  
</p>
<p>13. In paragraph 60 of the Report, we cannot share the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view that 
the fact that &#8216;&#8216;Rohingyas&#8217;&#8217; put their lives at risk to take to the seas in unseaworthy boats 
</p>
<p>itself indicates the extent of their suffering in Myanmar. This view does not reflect the 
reality. Firstly, one cannot outrightly assume that the so-called boat people have been 
taking to the seas because of their suffering. The fact is that most of them are economic 
migrants who are being exploited by the human trafficking gangs in the region. Secondly, 
we do not accept the notion that all of them came from Myanmar. They could come from 
everywhere in the region. One cannot discount the possibility that, if or when arrested in 
another country, these boat people would hide their true identity; they would instead falsely 
identify themselves as Myanmar nationals.   
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations that are contained in paragraph 76 are 
premature. Time is not ripe to consider the amendment of our constitutional provisions. 
</p>
