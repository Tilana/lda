</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 27/26, the Human Rights Council took note with appreciation of the 
</p>
<p>report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
</p>
<p>on technical assistance and capacity-building options for integrating human rights into 
</p>
<p>national policies (A/HRC/27/41), prepared pursuant to Council resolution 23/19. In its 
</p>
<p>resolution 27/26, the Council further decided to convene, at its twenty-eighth session, a 
</p>
<p>panel discussion on the issue of national policies and human rights, with a particular focus 
</p>
<p>on the findings of the report, identifying challenges, further developments and good 
</p>
<p>practices in mainstreaming human rights in national policies and programmes. The Council 
</p>
<p>also requested OHCHR to prepare a summary report on the discussions of the panel, and to 
</p>
<p>present it to the Council before its thirtieth session. The present report was prepared 
</p>
<p>pursuant to that request.  
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to Council resolution 27/26, a panel discussion was held on 19 March 2015 
</p>
<p>aimed at exploring further the opportunities for States to integrate their obligations and 
</p>
<p>commitments under international human rights law into national legislation, and to prepare 
</p>
<p>and implement national policies geared towards the full realization of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>3. The panel discussion was chaired by the Vice-President of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, the Permanent Representative of Paraguay to the United Nations Office and other 
</p>
<p>international organizations in Geneva, Juan Esteban Aguirre Mart&#237;nez. It was moderated by 
</p>
<p>the Permanent Representative of Lithuania to the United Nations Office and other 
</p>
<p>international organizations in Geneva, Rytis Paulauskas. The Chief of the Americas, 
</p>
<p>Europe and Central Asia Branch, Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR made an opening statement. The panel comprised the Minister and Executive 
</p>
<p>Secretary of the Ministry of Social Action of Paraguay, H&#233;ctor C&#225;rdenas; the National 
</p>
<p>Secretary for Planning and Development of Ecuador, Pabel Mu&#241;oz; Professor of Law and 
</p>
<p>former Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council Vitit Muntarbhorn; Professor of 
</p>
<p>Law and Director of the Faculty of Law ot the University of Trento, Italy, Giuseppe Nesi; 
</p>
<p>and Responsible Adviser for studies and analysis at the Ministry of National Solidarity, 
</p>
<p>Family and Women&#8217;s Affairs of Algeria, Dalila Aliane. 
</p>
<p>4. In his introductory remarks, the Vice-President of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>introduced the panellists and pointed out that the purpose of the discussion was to explore 
</p>
<p>different worldwide experiences of mainstreaming human rights in national policies in 
</p>
<p>order to bridge the gap between legal human rights obligations and their implementation by 
</p>
<p>the State. 
</p>
<p><b>  Opening statement 
</b></p>
<p>5. In his opening statement, the Chief of the Americas, Europe and Central Asia 
</p>
<p>Branch of OHCHR noted that the welcome increase in ratifications of international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments and the expansion of States&#8217; engagement with the international and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights mechanisms had generated a growing need for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the international human rights bodies. In recent years, OHCHR had 
</p>
<p>also seen a marked increase in requests from States for technical assistance. In response to 
</p>
<p>the demand, OHCHR field presences, together with staff at headquarters, had provided 
</p>
<p>support for the development of new and more effective national and sectorial policies, 
</p>
<p>indicators and mechanisms for implementation. In developing their national plans and 
</p>
<p>programmes, many States had adopted human rights-based and results-based approaches. 
</p>
<p>This was essential in order to ensure that all national stakeholders, human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, civil society actors and other relevant partners had the opportunity to influence 
</p>
<p>and contribute to such processes. </p>


<p>6. Noting that the report prepared by OHCHR pursuant to Council resolution 23/19 
</p>
<p>was not intended as a blueprint for policy, the Chief of the Americas, Europe and Central 
</p>
<p>Asia Branch gave examples of projects and programmes carried out with national partners 
</p>
<p>across the world, from constitutional reform and transitional justice to the development of 
</p>
<p>human rights indicator frameworks and curricula for human rights education. He 
</p>
<p>emphasized that integrating human rights did not mean merely acknowledging the contents 
</p>
<p>of human rights standards and recommendations when policies were being prepared. The 
</p>
<p>aim was to go far deeper and translate human rights obligations into real and effective 
</p>
<p>change. 
</p>
<p>7. He stressed that broad-based participation and cohesion were vital components at 
</p>
<p>every stage of policy development. In this regard, the human rights implications of national 
</p>
<p>policies had to be addressed by government ministries, civil servants and parliamentary 
</p>
<p>committees. These processes, however, also needed to include judicial bodies, transitional 
</p>
<p>justice mechanisms, security institutions, statistical systems, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, institutions involving the fight against discrimination, the private sector and&#8212; 
</p>
<p>perhaps most crucially&#8212;civil society. The examples given in the report were concrete ones 
</p>
<p>and were intended to be an inspiration for States that were looking for good practices to 
</p>
<p>emulate in their own planning and programming. Mr. Magazzeni acknowledged with 
</p>
<p>appreciation the important role of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for 
</p>
<p>Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights in providing invaluable advice and 
</p>
<p>support to OHCHR as it continued to develop its technical cooperation programme. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Contributions by panellists 
</b></p>
<p>8. In his opening remarks as moderator of the discussion, Mr. Paulauskas introduced 
</p>
<p>the panellists and highlighted their considerable experience and expertise in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights&#8217; implementation and policy development. He said that the panel discussion 
</p>
<p>was very timely,  as 2015 marked the global celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations. He added that since the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in 
</p>
<p>1945, human rights had constituted one of the three pillars of the Organization, along with 
</p>
<p>peace and development. He said that the Charter was based on the notion that there could 
</p>
<p>be no peace without development, no development without peace, and neither without 
</p>
<p>respect for human rights. He further recalled that during the seventieth session of the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly the international community would debate, articulate and adopt a set of 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals, to follow on from the progress made towards achieving the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals. The post-2015 agenda offered a unique opportunity for 
</p>
<p>the international community to renew its commitment to achieving development through 
</p>
<p>the realization of human rights. In this context, and as an opening to the discussion, he 
</p>
<p>asked the panellists to reflect on the following topics: first, how human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>can be translated into real and effective change; second, what the most effective 
</p>
<p>mechanisms are for achieving that goal; and third, how regional and subregional 
</p>
<p>cooperation could be strengthened through a comparative process. 
</p>
<p>9. He said that Paraguay was engaged in pioneering work in systematizing the 
</p>
<p>implementation of recommendations from the international human rights mechanisms as a 
</p>
<p>basis for national policymaking. In particular, the system for monitoring recommendations, 
</p>
<p>a database called &#8220;SIMORE&#8221;, was an important public tool that facilitated access to 
</p>
<p>information on the status of implementation of recommendations. Acknowledging the 
</p>
<p>innovative aspects of that system, he invited Mr. C&#225;rdenas to explain the main steps in the 
</p>
<p>development of that tool and to highlight how it had helped strengthen the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>capacity to make human rights an integral part of national planning and programming.  </p>


<p>10. Mr. C&#225;rdenas noted that in recent years social policy in Paraguay had changed 
</p>
<p>significantly, moving closer towards a rights-based approach, with the broad participation 
</p>
<p>of people living in poverty and in a state of vulnerability. Institutional strengthening had 
</p>
<p>been identified as key in order to achieve those objectives. That had led to considerable 
</p>
<p>structural change in public institutions, with an increased focus on training civil servants 
</p>
<p>and promoting the participation and empowerment of rights holders. In this framework, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Social Action had requested technical assistance from OHCHR to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the technical capacities of civil servants to ensure that a rights-based approach was 
</p>
<p>integrated into public policies. The assistance also included advice on follow-up to 
</p>
<p>international human rights recommendations linked to the issue of poverty, as well as 
</p>
<p>assistance in the development of indicators for economic, social and cultural rights. In this 
</p>
<p>context, 205 government officials had been trained and of these, 29 had become trainers 
</p>
<p>themselves. A capacity-building manual was also being drafted with a view to preparing a 
</p>
<p>training programme for all civil servants and State institutions. The training materials 
</p>
<p>would also be made accessible to vulnerable families participating in the Ministry&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>programmes. A specific regional plan for the Department of Kiwasul was being developed 
</p>
<p>as a matter of priority in the Government&#8217;s poverty reduction strategy.  
</p>
<p>11. Mr. C&#225;rdenas expressed appreciation for the assistance received from the United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights adviser in developing this programme. The Ministry was also putting 
</p>
<p>in place participatory and human rights-based initiatives for indigenous peoples, aimed at 
</p>
<p>promoting access to social services and increasing food security in these communities. A 
</p>
<p>cash-transfer programme was in place to assist people living in extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities. Also, a participatory gender programme was geared towards 
</p>
<p>guiding government action to promote equal opportunities for women and men. 
</p>
<p>12. He said that the online database SIMORE enabled the public to track follow-up by 
</p>
<p>State institutions to the recommendations from the treaty bodies, special procedures and the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review. The Ministry had also initiated a project to formulate and 
</p>
<p>operationalize indicators for economic, social and cultural rights, disaggregated by gender, 
</p>
<p>geographic location and other key characteristics, to facilitate more targeted policies and 
</p>
<p>interventions. 
</p>
<p>13. Turning to Mr.  Mu&#241;oz, Mr. Paulauskas took note of the atlas of socioeconomic 
</p>
<p>inequalities developed by the Government of Ecuador as a major innovation in the realm of 
</p>
<p>social development and inclusion. He asked Mr. Mu&#241;oz to explain how that approach had 
</p>
<p>helped the Government reach the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, and to share his 
</p>
<p>views on how scarce resources could be best dedicated to have an effective impact on the 
</p>
<p>realization of economic and social rights. 
</p>
<p>14. Mr. Mu&#241;oz said that human rights had to underpin all discussions about 
</p>
<p>development, adding that a requirement to take human rights fully into account in public 
</p>
<p>policy was enshrined in the Ecuadorian Constitution. He pointed out that in the experience 
</p>
<p>of Ecuador, the concept of &#8220;living well&#8221; was far more important than the mere promotion of 
</p>
<p>economic growth. This notion also had to be given a key role in the development of the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 agenda&#8212;a process in which Ecuador was taking an active role. He said that the 
</p>
<p>Constitution of Ecuador provided for a State based on justice and rights. The Government 
</p>
<p>believed that there was no hierarchy of rights and pursued a policy that placed human 
</p>
<p>beings at the centre of progress. All public planning followed a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach, including the right to water, food, a healthy environment, communication, 
</p>
<p>science, education, accommodation, health, work and social security. He said that the 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights was also a cross-cutting theme in all government policies, 
</p>
<p>which were designed and implemented in an inclusive and participatory manner, especially 
</p>
<p>with regard to persons with disabilities, minorities and women.  </p>


<p>15. In 2009, the Government put in place three plans for poverty reduction, which were 
</p>
<p>implemented through a human rights-based process. Since then, poverty had been reduced 
</p>
<p>by 15 per cent and inequalities had been narrowed through targeted government policies. At 
</p>
<p>the same time, the health system had been strengthened, and public trust in public services 
</p>
<p>had increased over time. Ecuador, together with the Plurinational State of Bolivia, had the 
</p>
<p>lowest unemployment rate in the region&#8212;at around 3.8 per cent. The justice system was 
</p>
<p>being strengthened, and Ecuador now had the lowest murder rate in the region, and 
</p>
<p>overcrowding in prisons was being successfully addressed.   
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Mu&#241;oz said that the key to success had been a determined effort by Ecuador to 
</p>
<p>narrow social and economic inequalities through a human rights-based approach to poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction. Precise targeting of policies had enabled the Government to devise effective 
</p>
<p>strategies to improve education, social security and access to work for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>populations. Public policies had also been designed to pinpoint specific challenges at the 
</p>
<p>regional level, so as to address geographic disparities. The aim was to guarantee social 
</p>
<p>protection through all life stages. The Government had committed itself to eradicating 
</p>
<p>poverty in Ecuador by its term limit in 2017. Ecuador was also heading two regional 
</p>
<p>networks in Latin America, under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Latin 
</p>
<p>America and the Caribbean, focusing on combating cross-border development challenges. 
</p>
<p>17. Turning to the third panellist, Ms. Aliane, the moderator noted that broad-based 
</p>
<p>participation was widely recognized as a key element of sustainable development. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, he invited her to share some of the lessons Algeria had learned about promoting the 
</p>
<p>participation and inclusion of women in public life as an integral part of national 
</p>
<p>development.  
</p>
<p>18. Ms. Aliane said that Algeria had its own values and civilization, which were duly 
</p>
<p>reflected in the country&#8217;s Constitution and legislation. The country was working to expand 
</p>
<p>the space for human rights implementation and was determined to assume its 
</p>
<p>responsibilities and international obligations. Algeria was convinced of the value of 
</p>
<p>investing in social capital as a means to combat poverty. Government programmes included 
</p>
<p>initiatives to promote the rights of women, especially regarding education from primary 
</p>
<p>school to university. Currently, 63 per cent of all holders of university diplomas were 
</p>
<p>women. 
</p>
<p>19. Women&#8217;s rights were also mainstreamed into ongoing efforts for national 
</p>
<p>reconciliation, as well as in various microcredit schemes to support development projects in 
</p>
<p>agriculture and small business. A national solidarity fund provided support to 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged people to overcome exclusion and break out of poverty. Algeria had more 
</p>
<p>than 100,000 associations active in the social and cultural fields, which also played an 
</p>
<p>active role in supporting women. Around 1 per cent of all public funds were devoted to 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities. The panellist noted that youth represented around 70 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the population. The Ministry of Youth was responsible for programmes and initiatives to 
</p>
<p>combat child labour and for devising special measures for youth and orphans. 
</p>
<p>20. Women in Algeria had the opportunity to participate in development initiatives and 
</p>
<p>efforts were made to ensure a participatory society. This was enshrined in domestic law in 
</p>
<p>line with commitments under international conventions. Women held 30 per cent of all 
</p>
<p>public positions&#8212;the highest proportion in the Arab world and the twenty-seventh highest 
</p>
<p>in the world. Women further presided over courts and held many decision-making 
</p>
<p>positions. The current Government had seven women ministers, and the Army had several 
</p>
<p>women among its generals. Women were also active in economic life and frequently 
</p>
<p>candidates in elections, including for the presidency. Algeria further had a National Council 
</p>
<p>for Women and the Family, and a National Research Centre to generate data to guide public 
</p>
<p>policy. A proposal was being put forward to create a fund to support divorced women.  </p>


<p>21. The moderators asked the fourth panellist, Mr. Muntarbhorn, to share his experience 
</p>
<p>as a former Member of the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical 
</p>
<p>Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, especially regarding the main challenges in 
</p>
<p>ensuring impact of projects on the ground. 
</p>
<p>22. Mr. Muntarbhorn identified five initial considerations that should be kept in mind 
</p>
<p>when examining the effectiveness of technical cooperation initiatives in the field of human 
</p>
<p>rights. Firstly, in less open settings, the promotion and protection of political rights was 
</p>
<p>often quite difficult. However, there was still a lot of space to enhance protection, 
</p>
<p>particularly with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, with an emphasis on 
</p>
<p>poverty and specific groups such as women and children, as well as aspects of 
</p>
<p>environmental protection. Secondly, in all settings, there was the challenge of 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and this was being tested by the need to protect not only the nationals of the 
</p>
<p>country, but also non-nationals, such as refugees and migrant workers. That was one reason 
</p>
<p>why human rights programmes should be anchored in the principle of non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>both in spirit and in practice. Thirdly, United Nations-backed funds and programmes should 
</p>
<p>reach out not only to government officials and ministries, but also to non-governmental 
</p>
<p>actors and civil society at large, with due regard to gender sensitivity and child 
</p>
<p>responsiveness, as an invitation to find creative ways to support these groups. Fourthly, the 
</p>
<p>establishment of United Nations human rights presences in countries that have difficulties 
</p>
<p>meeting their obligations was a welcome development. This was being done directly 
</p>
<p>through OHCHR offices or, more indirectly, through United Nations country teams or 
</p>
<p>human rights advisers. The successful mainstreaming of human rights, in turn, depended on 
</p>
<p>the following: the presence of good laws, policies and plans; enforcement; strong and 
</p>
<p>capable institutions and personnel, including national human rights institutions; resources 
</p>
<p>and national budgets; good information and monitoring; good education and capacity  
</p>
<p>development; and good participation and networking between various stakeholders. The 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals presented a golden opportunity to make real progress in all 
</p>
<p>these areas.  
</p>
<p>23. Mr. Muntarbhorn noted that in Thailand, policies and plans, especially national 
</p>
<p>human rights action plans, had proven to be very useful entry points. Since 2001, the 
</p>
<p>country had already developed three such plans. The strength of the first plan was that it 
</p>
<p>had been designed based on broad participation and consultation, matching national 
</p>
<p>standards with international law. It also aimed at providing various groups with enhanced 
</p>
<p>protection. However, the main weakness of the plan was poor coordination. 
</p>
<p>24. The second plan provided for participation by a broader segment of the population. 
</p>
<p>The third, and current, plan was much better prepared, through a strong participatory and 
</p>
<p>consultative process, coupled with a good database and analyses by universities. 
</p>
<p>Importantly, the Ministry of Justice was now the main coordinator of implementation and 
</p>
<p>received regular reports from other line ministries every year as an important means of 
</p>
<p>monitoring and accountability. 
</p>
<p>25. Mr. Muntarbhorn finally proposed to test the implementation of these measures 
</p>
<p>against a set of five questions: (a) who, for whom and with whom; (b) what rights; (c) how 
</p>
<p>to implement; (d) where and when; and (e) by what means. With regard to the first 
</p>
<p>question, the plan targeted State authorities, in particular key actors with considerable 
</p>
<p>human rights impact, such as the Ministry of Defence. The activities under the plan would 
</p>
<p>target women and children, as well as asylum seekers, persons with disabilities, drug 
</p>
<p>addicts undergoing rehabilitation and, as an innovation, issues related to sexual orientation, 
</p>
<p>such as civil unions. The plan would further be broadened to cover persons deprived of 
</p>
<p>their liberty.  
</p>
<p>26. It opened up opportunities for stakeholder participation, particularly cooperation 
</p>
<p>with civil society and the business sector, along with international cooperation. As to which </p>


<p>rights the plan would cover, the aim should be to match priorities with recommendations 
</p>
<p>arising from the universal periodic review, as well as from the treaty bodies and special 
</p>
<p>procedures. An innovation of Thai plan was to abolish the death penalty. An important 
</p>
<p>challenge would be how to match the need to protect civil and political rights with national 
</p>
<p>security laws, including martial law, emergency decrees and criminal law provisions that 
</p>
<p>affected the enjoyment of freedom of expression and assembly.  
</p>
<p>27. Regarding implementation, Mr. Muntarbhorn emphasized the importance of 
</p>
<p>enforcement of the law by the court system, securing sufficient resources, as well as 
</p>
<p>cooperation with civil society. As to where and when to act, the plan was to be 
</p>
<p>implemented during a five-year period, including in regions of unrest, such as in the south 
</p>
<p>of the country. Finally, he said that while it was important to recognize that resources were 
</p>
<p>naturally linked to budgets, the effectiveness of the programme depended on good 
</p>
<p>coordination, systematic monitoring and capacity development within the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice, based on the results of evaluations. 
</p>
<p>28. The moderator asked Mr. Nesi to explain how the Italian Interministerial Committee 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights was able to meaningfully affect the national situation. He also asked him 
</p>
<p>to reflect on how the Committee related to the various European Union entities in charge of 
</p>
<p>policy-setting, such as in relation to asylum seeking, trafficking and border control. He 
</p>
<p>further asked him to share his experiences of how all stakeholders could be successfully 
</p>
<p>involved within large and complex European Union policy-setting mechanisms in order to 
</p>
<p>strengthen regional and subregional cooperation. As a slightly provocative twist, the 
</p>
<p>moderator asked whether one could say that there was an optimal balance to be struck 
</p>
<p>between participation and effectiveness in national policy-making. 
</p>
<p>29. At the outset, Mr. Nesi said that, although Italy remained engaged in and committed 
</p>
<p>to international norm-setting, issues concerning the integration of human rights in national 
</p>
<p>policies had been at the centre of much debate in recent years. Among the various national 
</p>
<p>bodies that had had a meaningful impact on human rights in national policies he highlighted 
</p>
<p>the Italian Interministerial Committee for Human Rights, established in 1978 at the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, as an institution meriting 
</p>
<p>particular attention. 
</p>
<p>30. He said that in the previous 18 months, the Inter-ministerial Committee had 
</p>
<p>strengthened its role in the implementation of human rights in Italy and the integration of 
</p>
<p>human rights in national policies. In particular, it had become an essential focal point for 
</p>
<p>any branch of the State administration for incorporating human rights in the national legal 
</p>
<p>system. It could be seen as a form of clearinghouse for State policy and action in several 
</p>
<p>fields linked to human rights.  
</p>
<p>31. Ten ministries were represented at the meetings of the Committee and participated 
</p>
<p>in its work, together with other relevant public institutions, including local authorities. 
</p>
<p>Recently, the Interministerial Committee had assumed a crucial role in coordinating Italy&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>response to complex international crises, such as forced migration and human trafficking, 
</p>
<p>while respecting fundamental human rights. 
</p>
<p>32. With input from other line ministries, he said that the Interministerial Committee 
</p>
<p>prepared the periodic and ad hoc reports that Italy presented to the human rights monitoring 
</p>
<p>bodies of international organizations (United Nations and Council of Europe), and 
</p>
<p>monitored follow-up to those reports. It was also responsible for the systematic examination 
</p>
<p>of the legislative, administrative and regulatory measures adopted by national authorities as 
</p>
<p>follow-up to international commitments under international human rights instruments to 
</p>
<p>which Italy is a party. The Interministerial Committee was also in charge of outreach 
</p>
<p>towards civil society and the promotion of debates on human rights. Through its database it </p>


<p>was able to follow the status of implementation of Italy&#8217;s international human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. 
</p>
<p>33. It had also set up several working groups on specific issues, including on the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review, civil and political rights, racial discrimination and torture, 
</p>
<p>women and gender issues, rights of the child, economic social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and the development of a core document for the international treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>which was completed in 2014. 
</p>
<p>34. In July 2014, it had submitted the second national report to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council for the universal periodic review. It had prepared the report through a complex 
</p>
<p>procedure of consultation and coordination. This process had involved discussing a number 
</p>
<p>of sensitive issues, such as: (a) immigration, asylum and the rights of migrants; (b) the fight 
</p>
<p>against racism; (c) the treatment of Roma and Sinti communities; (d) the administration of 
</p>
<p>justice and the treatment of detainees; (e) counter-terrorism legislation and the expulsion of 
</p>
<p>aliens; (f) national institutions for the protection and the promotion of human rights; and (g) 
</p>
<p>protection of the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>35. He said that the Interministerial Committee very actively promoted outreach to civil 
</p>
<p>society and awareness-raising in the field of human rights. It was engaged in consultations 
</p>
<p>with non-governmental organizations on the implementation of the country&#8217;s international 
</p>
<p>commitments at the United Nations and the Council of Europe. It also actively cooperated 
</p>
<p>with universities, promoting academic initiatives in the field of human rights, including the 
</p>
<p>right to peace, environmental sustainability, education and the protection of cultural 
</p>
<p>heritage. Italy had for many years pursued the establishment of a national human rights 
</p>
<p>institution, which, when established, would be a welcome complement to the Inter-
</p>
<p>ministerial Committee. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Plenary discussion 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the panel discussion, representatives of the following States and 
</p>
<p>organizations took the floor: Algeria, Bahrain, Burkina Faso, China, Colombia, Congo, 
</p>
<p>Ecuador (on behalf of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), 
</p>
<p>Estonia, France, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Mexico, Morocco, 
</p>
<p>Namibia, Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of the Islamic Conference), Paraguay, 
</p>
<p>Peru, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation, Thailand and Venezuela 
</p>
<p>(Bolivarian Republic of), as well as the European Union. Representatives of the following 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations also took the floor: 
</p>
<p>Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain, Conseil national des droits de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;homme du Maroc, International Service for Human Rights, Korea Center for United 
</p>
<p>Nations Human Rights Policy, Scottish Human Rights Commission (video statement) and 
</p>
<p>Verein S&#252;dwind Entwicklungspolitik.   
</p>
<p>37. In their comments, many representatives praised the technical assistance provided by 
</p>
<p>OHCHR and acknowledged the value of using a human rights-based approach when 
</p>
<p>planning, implementing and monitoring national policies. The High Commissioner was 
</p>
<p>encouraged to continue supporting States with technical assistance and advisory services in 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming human rights in public policymaking and policy implementation. 
</p>
<p>Delegations also underlined the importance of ensuring that policies were conceived 
</p>
<p>founded on broad-based participation and consultative processes that engaged all the 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders in the country. That was particularly important in countries with large 
</p>
<p>and diverse populations. Transparent and impartial mechanisms for cooperation were 
</p>
<p>important to ensure the quality of support. There was further general agreement that 
</p>
<p>exchanging best practices was an important tool for policymakers to identify suitable </p>


<p>models for the implementation of human rights through public policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>National policies and programmes formed a vital bridge between norms and concrete State 
</p>
<p>action on the ground. 
</p>
<p>38. Most delegations highlighted the value of the recommendations from international 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms as a basis and guidance for national policymaking, in line with 
</p>
<p>the fundamental principles of non-discrimination, impartiality, non-selectivity, 
</p>
<p>accountability, transparency and the rule of law. Panellists were asked to elaborate on how 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms could contribute to implementation at the national 
</p>
<p>level. Some delegations noted that States implemented their human rights obligations in 
</p>
<p>line with their national constitutional structure and cultural dynamics. They stressed that 
</p>
<p>human rights-based programmes were most effective when they took into account such 
</p>
<p>special national circumstances and were aligned with national development priorities.  
</p>
<p>39. Note was also taken of the role of national human rights institutions in monitoring 
</p>
<p>and supporting the implementation of human rights-based policies and programmes at the 
</p>
<p>national level. Participants shared their experiences of developing and implementing 
</p>
<p>national human rights action plans, and there was general agreement that such plans were 
</p>
<p>vital to the effective implementation of human rights as they ensured that all public policies 
</p>
<p>were in line with a country&#8217;s international human rights obligations. Participants underlined 
</p>
<p>the importance of developing such plans in a participatory manner that allowed wide 
</p>
<p>segments of the population to contribute. Many delegations emphasized the invaluable 
</p>
<p>contribution of civil society in the protection and promotion of human rights in their 
</p>
<p>countries.  
</p>
<p>40. Most delegations agreed that coordination and coherence were key to successful 
</p>
<p>policymaking and implementation, and many gave examples of various standing 
</p>
<p>committees and other institutions they had established in order to support the effective 
</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights. The availability of sufficient resources, both 
</p>
<p>monetary and human, was referred to by many participants as a common obstacle to 
</p>
<p>progress in this field. The need for further capacity development on human rights 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming and implementation among key State officials and institutions was also 
</p>
<p>emphasized by many participants. Additional international cooperation and support at the 
</p>
<p>request of States was needed to address these gaps. 
</p>
<p>41. Delegations appreciated the fact that the format and arrangements of the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion had been adapted to accommodate persons with disabilities, including through 
</p>
<p>captioning and other special measures. Many expressed the hope that in the future all 
</p>
<p>sessions of the Human Rights Council could follow the same adapted format. 
</p>
<p>42. Several delegations emphasized the importance of using well-crafted human rights 
</p>
<p>indicators as an analytical tool that allowed policymakers to identify social and economic 
</p>
<p>disparities that affected specific locations or particularly marginalized or vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p>They further recognized that precise indicator frameworks were needed in order to measure 
</p>
<p>impact and progress in the implementation of public policies and programmes. The 
</p>
<p>panellists were asked to share ideas of how such indicators could be further developed and 
</p>
<p>better used in improving rights-based policies at the national level. 
</p>
<p>43. Non-governmental organizations strongly supported human rights-based approaches 
</p>
<p>to policy development and implementation at the national level, and urged States to renew 
</p>
<p>their efforts to ensure broad-based participation of all segments of society in such 
</p>
<p>processes. Whereas there was strong support for national human rights action plans, some 
</p>
<p>organizations observed that not all plans were fully inclusive and participatory in their 
</p>
<p>approach, thus limiting their impact and effectiveness. Some organizations also called for 
</p>
<p>more effective and consistent follow-up to international human rights recommendations, </p>


<p>while others identified the rights of migrants and other non-nationals as requiring further 
</p>
<p>attention.  
</p>
<p>44. With regard to the use of human rights indicators, it was noted that specific outcome 
</p>
<p>indicators were needed alongside structural and process-oriented indicators. One participant 
</p>
<p>also lamented the lack of inclusiveness and genuine participation in some instances when 
</p>
<p>national plans had been developed. OHCHR was further encouraged to provide more 
</p>
<p>assistance to States to strengthen the protection of human rights defenders. Special 
</p>
<p>measures were needed to address instances of threats, attacks and reprisals against 
</p>
<p>individuals who cooperated with international human rights institutions. National action 
</p>
<p>plans on business and human rights also needed to include measures to protect human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders. States were therefore encouraged to adopt guidelines for the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights defenders, along the lines of policies developed by Finland, Ireland, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>45. One national human rights institution underlined the importance of engaging a wide 
</p>
<p>range of partners across government in drawing up and implementing national human rights 
</p>
<p>action plans, and outlined its own experience of promoting access to justice and child rights 
</p>
<p>through a national action plan. 
</p>
<p>46. The moderator then asked the panellists to respond to the comments and questions 
</p>
<p>from the floor. Mr. Magazzeni agreed that human rights indicators were essential in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of human rights standards and were key to transparent and effective policy 
</p>
<p>development and impact assessment. He said that in response to the strong demand from 
</p>
<p>States, OHCHR had developed a human rights indicator framework, which was available to 
</p>
<p>all States as guidance on how to better monitor and implement their human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations.  
</p>
<p>47. On the issue of alignment of human rights recommendations with national 
</p>
<p>development priorities, Mr. Magazzeni referred to experiences that showed how national 
</p>
<p>human rights action plans and national coordination mechanisms could support 
</p>
<p>implementation, especially when they were designed and implemented in an inclusive and 
</p>
<p>participatory manner. He said that it was also important to include regional standards and 
</p>
<p>recommendations from regional human rights bodies as part of a coordinated and coherent 
</p>
<p>policy framework for human rights implementation at the national level. 
</p>
<p>48. Mr. C&#225;rdenas said that policy implementation through a human rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach was the best way to ensure that all rights-holders could be part of the process and 
</p>
<p>benefit from the outcomes. He underlined that it was the responsibility of the State, through 
</p>
<p>all its organs&#8212;judicial, legislative and executive&#8212;to ensure that human rights were 
</p>
<p>realized through public policies and action. People needed to be made aware of their rights 
</p>
<p>and empowered to claim what they were entitled to. That required training of both duty-
</p>
<p>bearers and rights-holders, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized groups such as 
</p>
<p>indigenous communities or persons with disabilities. Government officials needed to be 
</p>
<p>better equipped to work with these target groups. Non-governmental organizations also had 
</p>
<p>a vital role in educating and empowering people to know and claim their rights. 
</p>
<p>49. Mr. Mu&#241;oz said that human rights had been introduced as a cross-cutting theme in 
</p>
<p>Ecuador&#8217;s national development plan, and that all civil servants were being held 
</p>
<p>accountable for their performance in implementing human rights in their respective fields. 
</p>
<p>He fully agreed that coordination and participation were key to successful policy planning 
</p>
<p>and implementation, and explained that Ecuador had taken decisive steps to address the 
</p>
<p>lack of coherence and inclusiveness in its own implementation framework.   
</p>
<p>50. Ms. Aliane noted that setting up strong human rights institutions at the national level 
</p>
<p>was a priority, adding that this had to be supported by adequate legislation to facilitate the 
</p>
<p>implementation of decisions and recommendations. Such initiatives had to be based on </p>


<p>solid research and reliable data, so that policy measures could reach the most marginalized 
</p>
<p>and vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>51. Mr. Muntarbhorn referred to the multifaceted nature of technical assistance, which 
</p>
<p>could consist of funds, capacity-building, advisory services, education, information sharing, 
</p>
<p>technology exchange and other forms of cooperation. He also observed that delivering 
</p>
<p>technical assistance in conflict situations was a complex and challenging task. He said that 
</p>
<p>the United Nations had two main funds for human rights technical cooperation: the 
</p>
<p>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights, and the Voluntary 
</p>
<p>Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the Implementation of the Universal 
</p>
<p>Periodic Review. He added that there was more room for developing South-South 
</p>
<p>cooperation under the auspices of these funds. He also said that un-earmarked funds gave 
</p>
<p>more flexibility for OHCHR to manage and allocate resources for its programmes. He said  
</p>
<p>that new ways for civil society to access such funds should be explored. 
</p>
<p>52. The United Nations Secretariat had additional funds that also supported human 
</p>
<p>rights implementation, such as the Democracy Fund and the Human Security Fund. The 
</p>
<p>United Nations development assistance frameworks and the common country assessments 
</p>
<p>also provided entry points for United Nations support for human rights implementation in 
</p>
<p>cooperation with national Governments and civil society partners.  
</p>
<p>53. The ongoing work to articulate the sustainable development goals offered yet 
</p>
<p>another opportunity for human rights cooperation. He said that international cooperation, 
</p>
<p>including through South-South and multi-partner arrangements, had to be coupled with 
</p>
<p>efforts to mobilize civil society and the business community, and introduce more systematic 
</p>
<p>human rights auditing of budgets. National and local-level budgets also needed to be 
</p>
<p>reviewed to better respond to human rights priorities. 
</p>
<p>54. Mr. Nesi referred to United Nations assistance to the European Union in setting up 
</p>
<p>frameworks to combat trafficking in human beings as a positive example of how the 
</p>
<p>Organization could contribute to regional arrangements generally and to European Union 
</p>
<p>policies specifically. Underlining the importance of international cooperation by all parties 
</p>
<p>concerned in the fight against human trafficking, Mr. Nesi commended the European Union 
</p>
<p>on its initiative in benefiting from United Nations advice and assistance in this particularly 
</p>
<p>complex and sensitive field.  
</p>
<p>55. In the second round of comments and questions from the floor, delegations again 
</p>
<p>underlined that all human rights were universal, interdependent and interrelated. Many 
</p>
<p>recognized that human rights protection and promotion as a cornerstone for development, 
</p>
<p>reconciliation, peace and security. Some speakers emphasized that States had the right to 
</p>
<p>choose the framework that was best suited to their particular needs. International 
</p>
<p>cooperation in support of national efforts should therefore be based on requests from the 
</p>
<p>States concerned and be implemented in close cooperation with the national authorities. 
</p>
<p>56. Delegations also called for closer adherence to the recommendations of the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, special procedures, the Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review and 
</p>
<p>OHCHR in the development of national policies and strategies for the implementation of 
</p>
<p>human rights. Others drew attention to the crucial role of civil society and national human 
</p>
<p>rights institutions in supporting the development of human rights-based policy and 
</p>
<p>development frameworks that ensured a link between international legal commitments and 
</p>
<p>domestic implementation. One delegation asked the panellists for their views as to how 
</p>
<p>non-State actors could be more closely involved in defining national policies, so as to 
</p>
<p>ensure that those frameworks were more respectful of human rights.  
</p>
<p>57. Another speaker highlighted the merits of holding annual gatherings of politicians, 
</p>
<p>civil society and the general public to discuss major policy issues, such as migration and </p>


<p>State budgeting. Others gave examples of State bodies set up at the highest level, and with a 
</p>
<p>broad representation of civil society, to ensure coordination and coherence in policymaking.  
</p>
<p>58. Many delegations agreed that constitutional guarantees for human rights protection 
</p>
<p>and promotion, as well as participation and inclusion in public life, were essential for 
</p>
<p>sustainable development and poverty reduction. National human rights action plans were 
</p>
<p>instrumental in strengthening human rights protection for vulnerable groups, including 
</p>
<p>migrants, persons living with HIV/AIDS and persons at risk of discrimination because of 
</p>
<p>their sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>59. One delegation gave examples of how national policies could be developed with a 
</p>
<p>view to protecting the rights and interests of indigenous peoples and raising public 
</p>
<p>awareness of human rights and fundamental freedoms. There was general agreement on the 
</p>
<p>need, globally, to strengthen measures to promote and protect the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities through appropriate planning of transportation, housing, education and other 
</p>
<p>facilities.  
</p>
<p>60. Technical assistance in the field of human rights was recognized as pivotal in 
</p>
<p>ensuring the alignment of national policies with international legal norms and 
</p>
<p>commitments. Member States who could afford to do so were encouraged to contribute 
</p>
<p>generously to the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and the Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review. It was recognized that OHCHR would need additional funds 
</p>
<p>to be able to help States address capacity and implementation gaps. Assistance in 
</p>
<p>implementing universal periodic review recommendations was deemed particularly 
</p>
<p>important in this regard.  
</p>
<p>61. One delegation asked the panel to reflect on the main challenges in building human 
</p>
<p>rights indicators systems, and provide best practices of involving civil society in 
</p>
<p>strengthening human rights policies. Another speaker referred to the role of OHCHR in 
</p>
<p>advising the European Union in developing its anti-trafficking policies and in training 
</p>
<p>border guards on how to apply and respect relevant international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>62. One national human rights institution underlined the importance of participatory and 
</p>
<p>inclusive processes in the design and implementation of national development plans. Such 
</p>
<p>initiatives also needed to be accompanied by legal reform and institutional strengthening so 
</p>
<p>that policy objectives could be translated into reality for all.  
</p>
<p>63. A speaker representing civil society expressed concern that, despite technical 
</p>
<p>assistance, some States still failed to establish adequate accountability frameworks and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights defenders from threats and physical attacks. The speaker asked the 
</p>
<p>panel to comment on how States could be made more accountable for realizing human 
</p>
<p>rights beyond the mere enactment of legislation.  
</p>
<p>64. Another non-governmental organization pointed out that sanctions were often used 
</p>
<p>as excuses by some countries for not living up to their human rights obligations. The 
</p>
<p>speaker asked the panel what steps could be taken if there was a lack of political will on the 
</p>
<p>part of States to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. Concluding observations  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Following the second round of comments and questions, the Chair gave the 
</b></p>
<p><b>floor to the moderator and the panellists for their concluding observations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Muntarbhorn, responding to a query about the role of non-State actors in policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>development, said that the term was very broad and was often understood to 
</b></p>
<p><b>encompass not only civil society, but also the business sector and the media. As the </b></p>


<p><b>main entry points for non-State actors, Mr. Nesi identified consultative processes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms such as public hearings, enquiries and other open forums for discussion 
</b></p>
<p><b>and exchange of views. Other avenues could include local and national assemblies.  
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>He said that human rights impact assessments were also important as they 
</b></p>
<p><b>allowed all stakeholders and beneficiaries to be part of the national planning process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, real participation needed to be broad-based and pluralistic, and to include 
</b></p>
<p><b>vulnerable and marginalized groups. The business sector had an important role to 
</b></p>
<p><b>play through corporate social responsibility, which also needed to be based on 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation and inclusiveness. The importance of accountability in development was 
</b></p>
<p><b>also increasingly recognized within the United Nations system. In this regard, it was 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to understand accountability as a strategy consisting of several important 
</b></p>
<p><b>elements. The first and foremost component was a functioning national justice system. 
</b></p>
<p><b>If the national system did not work, one had to turn to linkages between national and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international accountability.  
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Mr. Nesi observed that the role of the International Criminal Court was often 
</b></p>
<p><b>mentioned and he recalled the possibility that permanent members of the Security 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council had to block the prosecution of specific cases through the use of their veto. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This, in turn, had led the discussion towards considering the possible role of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>General Assembly in endorsing the prosecution of cases or setting up special ad hoc 
</b></p>
<p><b>tribunals. A State could in some instances also resort to extraterritorial jurisdiction in 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursuing its nationals for criminal acts committed abroad or when its nationals had 
</b></p>
<p><b>become victims of acts outside its territory. Another option to explore was universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction through which a State could use its jurisdiction to pursue non-nationals 
</b></p>
<p><b>regardless of where the crimes had been committed. With regard to national 
</b></p>
<p><b>policymaking, the most essential elements were good laws linked to effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforcement measures through the courts. National human rights institutions also had 
</b></p>
<p><b>a crucial role to play.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Mr. Magazzeni underlined the important contribution national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and civil society could make to national policy development and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation. Those actors could help identify capacity and implementation gaps, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and monitor implementation against indicators and benchmarks. Through their 
</b></p>
<p><b>involvement with international mechanisms, such as the universal periodic review, 
</b></p>
<p><b>they could also participate at the international level. In the experience of OHCHR, 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights action plans had proven to be effective instruments for 
</b></p>
<p><b>coherent and effective human rights implementation.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>He said that the most successful plans included a strong element of 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation, involving all relevant stakeholders. The Board of Trustees of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights had also 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed that a human rights-based approach involving civil society and national 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights institutions at all stages of national planning was essential to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective implementation of programmes. Broad participation also strengthened 
</b></p>
<p><b>national ownership, which,</b> <b>in turn, increased the impact and sustainability of 
</b></p>
<p><b>development initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>Mr. Nesi said that many States gave primacy to international law over domestic 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation, which could be </b>the best way to ensure that the country&#8217;s human rights 
</p>
<p><b>obligations were incorporated into national policies. It was also important for judges 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be aware of that principle and take it into account in their work to render justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>through the national court system. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Mr. C&#225;rdenas</b> <b>said that the use of human rights indicators was a key 
</b></p>
<p><b>instrument in policymaking in Paraguay. Such frameworks were being used to </b></p>


<p><b>monitor the implementation of international human rights recommendations and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate follow-up action by the legislative, executive and judicial authorities. That 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanism provided all citizens with access to information so that they could follow 
</b></p>
<p><b>how the State was making progress in implementing its policies. Paraguay was also 
</b></p>
<p><b>benefitting from technical assistance from OHCHR in developing specific indicators 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, to allow for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>disaggregation and monitoring of social and economic data. A comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicator framework also made it possible to better monitor budgetary allocations for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the implementation of rights-based policies. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Mr. Mu&#241;oz emphasized the need to go beyond traditional development 
</b></p>
<p><b>indicators, which usually focused on economic growth and gross domestic product 
</b></p>
<p><b>measurements. In this regard, Ecuador had established national goals for </b>&#8220;<b>living 
</b></p>
<p>well&#8221;, measured through the use of human right<b>s indicators. The Constitution further 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided for broad-based participation in national policy processes and in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>preparation of development plans. As a measure of accountability and transparency, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the National Assembly had to adopt national development plans before they entered 
</b></p>
<p><b>into force. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>Ms. Aliane underlined the importance of ensuring that women could fully and 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningfully participate in all aspects of national planning and decision-making. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Women constituted an invaluable talent pool that had to be used effectively for 
</b></p>
<p><b>national development. Through clear political will, Algeria had been able to make 
</b></p>
<p><b>considerable progress in the advancement of women, in terms of legal reform and 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutional strengthening. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>In concluding the discussion, the moderator thanked the panellists, delegations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations for their 
</b></p>
<p><b>interventions and contributions. He recalled that the aim of the panel discussion had 
</b></p>
<p><b>been not to propose one single model for policies, but rather to share good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>that could inspire States in their pursuit of national polices and strategies for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of human rights. One theme that had been emphasized by most 
</b></p>
<p><b>participants was the need for national action to be based on participation, inclusion, 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-discrimination, accountability and the rule of law. There had also been general 
</b></p>
<p><b>agreement on the importance of engaging civil society and national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions in all stages of national planning and decision-making. Finally, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>moderator noted the crucial role of international cooperation, including South-South 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation, in providing effective technical assistance and capacity-building to all 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant partners.
