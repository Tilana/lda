PINE CLIFF ENERGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2011 FINANCIAL 
AND OPERATING RESULTS 
 
Report to Shareholders
For the three  
Months ended 
March 31, 2011
Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. (Pine Cliff or the Company) is pleased to report its operational and financial results 
for the three months ended March 31, 2011.   
 
Refocused Corporate Strategy 
Senior  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors  have  refocused  Pine  Cliff’s  corporate  strategy  on  its 
Western Canadian properties and will take an aggressive approach in Canada to find new opportunities to 
increase shareholder value.  
 
A  significant  step  to  realizing  this  strategy  was  the  disposition  of  its  South  American  Operations  in  the 
third quarter of 2010 which significantly reduced future operating and capital costs. Currently, Pine Cliff 
has positive cash flow from operations as well as a positive working capital position. A key focus for the 
Company will be to substantially increase the Company’s asset base. Pine Cliff has no debt and as such, 
should be able to finance any domestic opportunities it identifies either through current working capital, 
bank debt or an equity placement. 
 
Operations 
Production increased 46 percent in Q1 2011 over the same period in 2010 with average daily production 
totaling 111 BOE per day.  The higher volumes are due to the Company’s increased activities in Canada, 
specifically on its Sundance properties. During 2010, the Company completed and placed on production 
four gross natural gas wells (0.6 net, 15 percent working interest in each well) between February and April 
of the year.  Quarter over quarter production levels decreased approximately 14 percent mainly due to 
natural production declines related to these new wells.   
 
The promising results realized on the Sundance properties have led to further opportunities in the area.  
Subsequent  to  quarter-end,  four  wells  (0.6  net,  15  percent  working  interest  in  each  well)  have  been 
licensed in the area and it is anticipated that the operator will drill these wells in 2011.   
 
IFRS Transition 
As  a  final  comment,  the  first  quarter  of  2011’s  Management’s  Discussion  and  Analysis  (MD&A)  and 
Financial Statements along with the notes thereto, are reported under International Financial Reporting 
Standards  (IFRS).  It  is  mandatory  that  all  Canadian  publically  accountable  enterprises  prepare  their 
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  Canadian  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (Canadian 
GAAP) revised to incorporate new accounting standards under IFRS. This change in accounting principles 
significantly  affected  certain  financial  information  and  disclosures  from  past  financial  reporting  of  the 
Company and may be confusing to Pine Cliff’s shareholders. Reporting under IFRS will result in Canadian 
standards  now  being  more  aligned  with  European  and  Australian  accounting  standards  and  away  from 
previous Canadian principles and present United States principles. IFRS permits companies to be flexible
- 2 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
with their reporting and this may result in making it more difficult to compare Canadian companies with 
each other, or in some instances, cross border reporting Canadian companies with their U.S. peers.   
 
IFRS has been and continues to be a very costly and time consuming transition for Canadian companies 
and will likely continue to be so into the future. Management is of the opinion that the adoption of IFRS 
should have been delayed for Canadian companies and for the respective industries that are affected at 
least  until  the  United  States  decided  what  form  of  IFRS  it  would  adopt,  if  any.  Regulators  and  the 
accounting profession obviously did not agree.  
 
Pine  Cliff  will  ensure  that  appropriate  disclosures  and  discussions  are  provided  in  the  MD&A  and  the 
financial statements to assist shareholders, analysts and other parties with their respective evaluations. 
 
Outlook 
As March 31, 2011, Pine Cliff had positive working capital of $482,299.  With the current and prolonged 
low  natural  gas  price  environment,  there  may  be  opportunities  for  either  corporate  or  property 
acquisitions.  Pine  Cliff  also  intends  to  continue  increasing  activity  in  Canada  through  participating  in  a 
more active drill program.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The following report dated June 21, 2011 is a review of the operations and current financial position for 
the three months ended March 31, 2011 for Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. (Pine Cliff or the Company) and should 
be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements including the notes related 
thereto  presented  under  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  and  the  audited  financial 
statements presented under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (Canadian GAAP) for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, together with the notes related thereto.  
 
A  reconciliation  of  the  new  and  revised  standards  and  interpretations  are  outlined  in  Note  14  of  the 
March 31, 2011 condensed consolidated financial statements for the comparative periods. 
 
Transition to IFRS from Canadian GAAP 
 
IFRS are premised on a conceptual framework similar to Canadian GAAP, however, significant differences 
can  exist  in  certain  matters  of  recognition,  measurement  and  disclosure.  On  adoption  of  IFRS,  the 
Company experienced material changes related to its January 1, 2010 opening consolidated statement of 
financial  position.  The  following  discussion  highlights  the  new  standards  and  first-time  adoption 
exemptions that the Company has adopted and elected to use under IFRS.  It also discusses the impact on 
the comparative period results of operations and financial position as previously reported under Canadian 
GAAP as well as possible effects going forward. 
 
Additionally, the changes to the opening statement of financial position required that a corresponding tax 
asset  or  liability  be  established  based  on  the  resultant  differences  between  the  carried  value  of  these 
fixed assets under IFRS and their associated tax bases. In aggregate, these increases and the application of 
various policies under IFRS that differ from Canadian GAAP increased shareholders’ equity by $642,113 at 
January  1,  2010.  Note  14  of  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  provides  detailed 
reconciliations between Canadian GAAP and IFRS of shareholders’ equity as at January 1, March 31 and 
December 31, 2010 and of net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and for the year ended 
December 31, 2010, respectively. These reconciliations provide explanations of each major difference.   
 
The  following  discussion  highlights  the  significant  new  standards  that  the  Company  has  adopted  under 
IFRS and the effect on the comparative period results of operations and financial position as previously 
reported under Canadian GAAP as well as the possible effects going forward.  
 
IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations (IFRS 5), similar to Canadian GAAP 
requires the Company to reclassify assets and liabilities of a disposal group or discontinued assets in the 
statements of financial position, comprehensive income and cash flow.  Under Canadian GAAP, the date 
certain  assets  and  liabilities  meet  the  criteria  for  discontinued  operations,  the  Company  retroactively 
restates  the  statements  of  financial  position,  comprehensive  income  and  cash  flow  to  conform  to  the 
current period presentation.  Under IFRS, the discontinued operations are segregated in the statement of 
financial  position  prospectively  from  the  date  discontinued  operations  was  determined,  while  the 
statements of comprehensive income and cash flow are retroactively restated to conform to the current 
period  presentation.    This  difference  under  IFRS  resulted  in  January  1,  2010  and  March  31,  2010 
statements of financial position to be adjusted to remove the segregation of discontinued operations this 
change had no effect on the Company’s total assets, liabilities or shareholders’ equity. 
 
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (IAS 27), similar to  Canadian GAAP requires the 
Company to record a non-controlling interest (NCI) proportionate share of comprehensive income or loss 
to the NCI original equity investment on the face of the statement of financial position.  Under Canadian 
GAAP, if a NCI did not have an obligation to fund their losses, the Company would not allocate the NCI’s 
share of comprehensive losses once the NCI equity investment was zero.  Under IFRS the Company must
- 4 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
allocate such comprehensive losses to the NCI even though it creates an NCI deficit on the statement of 
financial position.  The Company is required to record the NCI’s share of losses on a retroactive basis from 
the  date  of  acquisition.    Recording  the  NCI’s  losses  resulted  in  a  NCI  deficit  for  January  1,  2010  of 
$648,583, March 31, 2010 of $663,908 and $nil for December 31, 2010 as the Company purchased the 
non-controlling interest as of November 23, 2010.  Total comprehensive income decreased by $727,185 
on the acquisition of the NCI by the Company. 
 
IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (IAS 37), similar to Canadian GAAP requires 
the  Company  to  recognize  a  decommissioning  liability  for  statutory,  contractual,  constructive  or  legal 
obligations,  including  those  associated  with  the  reclamation  of  oil  and  gas  properties  and  equipment, 
when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of the 
assets. Initially, a liability for the decommissioning of an asset is recognized as its fair value in the period in 
which it is incurred. Upon initial recognition of the liability, the corresponding decommissioning liability is 
added  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  asset  and  the  cost  is  amortized  as  an  expense  over  the 
economic  life  of  the  asset  using  the  unit-of-production  method.  Following  the  initial  recog nition  of  the 
decommissioning  liability,  the  carrying  amount  of  the  liability  is  increased  for  the  passage  of  time  and 
adjusted for changes to the discount rate used, amount or timing of the underlying cash flows needed to 
settle  the  liability.    Under  Canadian  GAAP  the  discount  rate  used  is  the  credit  adjusted  risk  free  rate, 
which is higher than the risk free rate used under IFRS.  Revaluing the decommissioning liabilities under 
IFRS 
liabilities  by  $3,422  for  continuing  operations  ($2,391  for 
discontinued operations), decreased property and equipment by $657 and shareholders’ equity by $6,470 
on an after-tax basis as at January 1, 2010.  
 
The adoption of IFRS impacts the Company’s assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity and net earnings for 
the comparative periods.  A summary of the significant IFRS changes to the 2010 financial information are

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 
During  the  second  quarter  of  2010,  Pine  Cliff  committed  to  a  plan  to  dispose  of  its  South  American 
operations to allow the Company to focus its continuing operations on the development of Canadian oil 
and  natural  gas  properties.  The  South  American  Operations  were  sold  effective  September  24,  2010.  
Accordingly,  the  South  American  Operations  have  been  reclassified  as  discontinued  operations  in  the 
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  This  is  further  discussed  in  the  MD&A  section  entitled  “Operating 
results from discontinued operations.”

Total Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) Per Day (2) 
 
(1)  The comparative highlights have been restated with the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
(2) Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are calculated using a conversion ratio of 6 MCF to 1 barrel of oil.  The conversion 
is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent 
a value equivalency at the wellhead and as such may be misleading if used in isolation.

(1) Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are calculated using a conversion ratio of 6 MCF to 1 barrel of oil.   The conversion is based on an 
energy  equivalency  conversion  method  primarily  applicable  at  the  burner  tip  and  does  not  represent  a  value  equivalency  at  the 
wellhead and as such may be misleading if used in isolation.   
 
Production increased in Q1 2011 over Q1 2010 due to additional production from four wells (0.6 net, 15 
percent  working  interest  in  each  well)  that  were  placed  on  production  between  February  and  April  of 
2010.    Production  was  lower  in  Q1  2011  compared  to  Q4  2010  primarily  due  to  natural  production 
declines related to the same four wells.

Revenue from petroleum and natural gas sales increased by 16 percent in Q1 2011 compared to Q1 2010 
due  to  increased  production  volumes  from  the  four  (0.6  net)  new  wells,  partially  offset  by  lower 
commodity prices for natural gas.  The decrease in Q1 2011 revenue compared to Q4 2010 was primarily 
due to natural production declines from the new wells, partially offset by increased commodity prices for 
natural gas. The Company did not enter into any risk management contracts in either Q1 2011 or 2010 
and does not anticipate entering into any contracts for the remainder of 2011. 
 
Crown  royalties  paid  by  the  Company  in  Q1  2011  were  lower  than  Q1  2010  due  to  lower  commodity 
prices for natural gas and the implementation of phase two of the Alberta Government Competitiveness 
Review program in May 2010.  The increase in crown royalties in Q1 2011 compared to Q4 2010 was due 
to a recovery of crown royalties paid in Q3 2010 and received in Q4 2010.  The increase in gross overriding 
royalties  for  Q1  2011  over  Q1  2010  was  due  to  increased  production  volumes.    The  decrease  in  gross 
overriding royalties for Q1 2011 over Q4 2010 was due to decreased production volumes and prior period 
adjustments in Q4 2010.     
 
Alberta Government Competitiveness Review 
 
On March 11, 2010, the Government of Alberta announced it would modify conventional oil and natural 
gas royalties effective January 2011 to increase Alberta’s competitiveness in the upstream energy sector. 
The five per cent front-end royalty rate on a certain volume of initial production for conventional oil and 
natural  gas  became  a  permanent  feature  of  the  royalty  system.  The  maximum  royalty  rate  for  all 
conventional oil was reduced to 40 percent from 50 percent. New wells that initially had a five percent 
front-end  royalty  will  increase  to  regular  royalty  rates  after  production  exceeds  the  volume  that 
previously  permitted  the  five  percent  rate.  In  accordance  with  the  government  amendment,  the 
maximum royalty rate for conventional and unconventional natural gas was reduced at higher prices from 
50  to  36  percent.  Other  royalty  incentive  programs  will  remain  in  effect.  Management  believes  these 
changes to the royalty system will have a positive effect on cash flow.

Office and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased by $8,313 in Q1 2011 compared 
to  Q1  2010.    The  increase  in  G&A  expenses  is  primarily  due  to  increased  continuous  disclosure  costs, 
partially offset by decreased management fees.  The decrease in G&A expenditures in Q1 2011 compared 
to Q4 2010 is due to decreased legal fees for general matters and decreased continuous disclosure costs.   
 
Pine  Cliff  does  not  have  any  employees  at  the  present  time  and  has  engaged  Bonterra  Energy  Corp. 
(Bonterra),  a  related  party  (see  Related  Party  section),  to  provide  management,  administrative  and

Capital costs for oil and gas properties that result in the addition of reserves are depleted using the unit-
of-production basis by field. For production facility and equipment expenditures such as well equipment, 
the Company depreciates these assets on a straight-line basis over ten years. 
 
Depletion  and  depreciation  increased  in  Q1  2011  compared  to  Q1  2010  due  to  increased  production 
volumes on the additional capital spent on the four wells  (0.6 net) completed in 2010.  Q1 2011 had a 
decrease in depletion and depreciation compared to Q4 2010 due to lower production volumes.    
 
Income Taxes
The Company has adopted the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which the deferred 
tax  provision  is  based  on  the  temporary  differences  in  the  accounts  calculated  using  income  tax  rates 
expected  to  apply  in  the  year  in  which  the  temporary  differences  will  reverse.    The  Company  has  no 
current  income  tax  expense  as  it  has  sufficient  tax  pools  to  ensure  that  no  current  income  taxes  are 
payable.

The increase in net loss for Q1 2011 compared to Q1 2010 was predominantly due to increased depletion 
and  depreciation  expense  and  increased  production  costs,  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  oil  and  gas 
revenue, a decrease in crown royalties and a deferred income tax recovery. The decrease in Q1 2011 net 
loss compared to the Q4 2010 net loss was predominantly due to an impairment provision on the note 
receivable  from  the  disposal  of  the  South  American  Operations  and  a  loss  on  acquisition  of  the  non-
controlling interest in Q4 2010.  
 
Other Comprehensive Income 
 
Other comprehensive income relates entirely to the increase in fair value of Pine Cliff’s investment which 
was received from the disposal of the South American Operations (see discontinued operations).  During 
Q1 2011, the market value of the investment increased by $65,645.

Cash flow increased in Q1 2011 compared to Q1 2010 as the Company had increased oil and gas revenue, 
decreased  crown  royalties  and  positive  adjustments  for  non-cash  working  capital  items,  which  was 
partially offset by higher production costs.  The increase in cash flow in Q1 2011 compared to Q4 2010 
was primarily due to positive adjustments for non-cash working capital items, a decrease in production 
and office and administration costs, which was partially offset by decreased oil and gas revenue.

Related Party Transactions 
 
Pine  Cliff  has  a  management  agreement  with  Bonterra  (a  company  with  common  directors  and 
management with Pine Cliff), to have Bonterra provide executive services (CEO and President, CFO and 
COO), technical  services, accounting services, oil and gas administration and office administration.  The 
management  fee consists of  a monthly fee of  $5,000 (2010  - $7,500).  As at  March  31, 2011, amounts 
owing to Bonterra were $909 (December 31, 2010 - $464). The agreement with Bonterra can be cancelled 
by either party by providing 90 days notice. 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
As of March 31, 2011, Pine Cliff had positive working capital of $482,299 (December 31, 2010 - $309,805).

prices  management  believes  there  may  be  opportunities  for  either  corporate  or  property  acquisitions.  
The Company is examining such opportunities as well as the future development of its existing land base. 
 
From the disposition of the South American Operations, the Company received shares a public company, 
which as of March 31, 2011 were valued at $393,872 (December 31, 2010 - $328,227). 
 
With this disposition, the Company has positive cash flow from operations as well as a positive working 
capital position.  Future activities will be financed from its present working capital, bank debt (currently 
no debt) or by equity issues.

Disposal of South American Operations 
 
On  September  24,  2010  the  Company  disposed  of  its  South  American  subsidiary,  whose  assets  and 
liabilities related primarily to the Canadon Ramirez Concession and Laguna de Piedra Concession (South
- 15 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
American  Properties).    The  proceeds  of  disposition  were  $450,000  consisting  of  $1,000  of  cash,  a  note 
receivable for $449,000 and a contingent receivable not used to calculate the impairment reversal on the 
disposal  of  oil  and  gas  assets  (see  below).    During  Q1  2011,  the  purchaser  settled  the  note  by  issuing 
shares in the purchaser’s publicly traded corporation.  As at March 31, 2011, these shares were valued at 
$393,872 (December 31, 2010 - $328,227 (value of the note receivable)).  At the time of disposition, the 
Company  had  a  net  book  value  of  $23,121  for  the  South  American  properties  after  prior  period  write-
downs of $7,746,705.  It also had decommissioning liabilities of $38,838 and a working capital deficiency 
of $342,969 that was transferred to the purchaser related to the South American property resulting in a 
recovery of impairment on oil and gas assets of $808,686.  
 
Contingent Receivable 
 
Upon  disposal  of  the  South  American  properties,  the  Company  received  a  contingent  consideration  of 
$200,000  (payable  in  cash  or  shares  from  the  purchaser  corporation)  if  by  September  24,  2012  the 
purchaser or an affiliate to the purchaser is successful in obtaining a drilling permit followed by the drilling 
of a well on the Laguna de Piedra concession block in the Rio Negro Province of Argentina or the local 
permitting authority in the province grants a concession to substitute for the Laguna de Piedra concession 
and the purchaser or affiliate entity drills a well on the substitute concession.  Collection of this receivable 
is not determinable at this time and therefore has not been recorded by the Company. 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Given the current status of the Company, changes of U.S. $1.00 per barrel in the price of crude oil, $0.10 
per  MCF  in  the  price  of  natural  gas,  or  a  $0.01  change  in  the  Cdn/U.S.  exchange  rate  would  have  no 
significant impact on the cash flow or cash flow per share amounts for the Company.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
As at and for the periods ended March 31, 2011, 2010, December 31, 2010 and as at January 1, 2010 
(unaudited) 
 
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS
Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. (Pine Cliff or the Company) is a widely held public company listed on the TSX 
Venture Exchange and incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta).  The address of 
the Company’s corporate office is Suite 901, 1015 4th Street SW, Calgary, Alberta. 
 
Pine Cliff’s continuing operations is in the development and production of oil and natural gas in the 
Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
a)
Statement of Compliance 
 
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting 
principles as set out in the Handbook of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA Handbook).  
In 2010, the CICA Handbook was revised to incorporate International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
and requires publicly accountable enterprises to apply such standards effective for years beginning on or 
after January 1, 2011.  Accordingly, the Company has commenced reporting on this basis in these interim 
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  International  Accounting  Standards  34  –  Interim  Financial 
Reporting (IAS 34) after applying the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 1 – 
First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 1).  In the financial statements, the 
term “Canadian GAAP” refers to Canadian GAAP before the adoption of IFRS. 
 
The  March  31,  2011  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  Company’s  first  financial 
statements prepared under IFRS using the accounting policies expected to be used at December 31, 2011, 
having an adoption date of January 1, 2011 and a transition date of January 1, 2010.  Consequently, the 
comparative figures for 2010 and the Company’s statement of financial position as at January 1, 2010 have 
been restated from accounting principles generally accepted under Canadian GAAP to comply with IFRS. 
 
The reconciliations to IFRS from the previously published Canadian GAAP consolidated financial statements 
are summarized in Note 14. In addition, IFRS 1 requires certain exemptions and allows certain exemptions 
from  retrospective application of IFRS in the opening  statement of financial position.  Where these have 
been applied they are explained in Note 14.
b)  Basis of Measurement
These  condensed consolidated financial  statements have  been prepared on a historical cost basis, 
except for certain financial instruments and share-based payment transactions which are measured 
at fair value.
c)  Use of Judgments and Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities as at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position, 
as  well  as  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues,  expenses,  and  cash  flows  during  the  periods
- 22 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
presented.  Such estimates relate primarily to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the 
financial statements.  Actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts. 
 
Amounts recorded for depletion and depreciation and amounts used for impairment calculations are 
based on estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future costs required to develop those 
reserves.  Share-based  payments  are  based  upon  expected  volatility  and  option  life  estimates.  
Provisions for decommissioning liabilities are based on estimates of abandonment costs, timing of 
abandonment, inflation and interest rates.  The provision for income taxes is based on judgments in 
applying  income  tax  law  and  estimates  on  the  timing,  likelihood  and  reversal  of  temporary 
differences  between  the  accounting  and  tax  basis  of  assets  and  liabilities.    These  estimates  are 
subject  to  measurement  uncertainty  and  changes  in  these  estimates  could  materially  impact  the 
financial statements of future periods.  Further details regarding judgments are discussed in Note 3.
d)  Presentation Currency
The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the Canadian dollar. 
 
Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into  Canadian  dollars  at  the  rates  prevailing  on  the 
reporting date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars at the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates.  Exchange gains and losses are recorded as income or expense in 
the period in which they occur. 
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
3.
a)  Basis for Consolidation
(Non-Controlling
Interest).  CanAmericas  through
The  Company  had  incorporated  a  subsidiary  company,  CanAmericas  Energy  Ltd.  (CanAmericas).  
CanAmericas  was  owned  93  percent  by  the  Company  and  seven  percent  by  a  foreign  private 
corporation 
its  wholly  owned  subsidiary 
CanAmericas (Argentina) Energy Ltd. (CanAmericas Argentina) was formed to explore and develop oil 
and gas properties primarily in South America (South American Operations). 
 
On  September  24,  2010  CanAmericas  Argentina  was  sold  and  the  South  American  Operations  are 
presented  as  discontinued  operations  (see  Note  4).    With  the  sale  of  CanAmericas  Argentina,  the 
Company acquired the seven percent interest in CanAmericas from the Non-Controlling Interest on 
November 23, 2010.  On January 1, 2011 CanAmericas was amalgamated with Pine Cliff. 
 
These  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its 
previously owned subsidiaries CanAmericas and CanAmericas Argentina.  The financial statements of 
the  subsidiaries  are  prepared  for  the  same  reporting  periods  as  the  parent  using  consistent 
accounting policies. Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation.
b)  Revenue Recognition
Revenues  from  the  sale  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  are  recorded  when  the  significant  risks  and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer.  This generally occurs when product is 
physically transferred into a third-party pipeline or when the delivery truck arrives at a customer’s 
receiving  location.  Items  such  as  crown  and  gross  overriding  royalties  are  netted  against  revenue.  
These  items  are  netted  to  reflect  the  deduction  for  other  parties’  proportionate  share  of  the 
revenue.

Foreign Currency Translation
Items  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  each  consolidated  entity  are  measured  using  the 
currency  of  the  primary  economic  environment  in  which  the  entity  operates  (the  "functional 
currency").  Foreign  currency  transactions  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  using  the 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting 
from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
not  denominated  in  the  functional  currency  of  an  entity  are  recognized  in  the  condensed 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
 
Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currencies other than Canadian dollars are translated 
at the transaction date exchange rates.
Jointly Controlled Operations and Jointly Controlled Assets
Significant portions of the Company’s oil and gas operations are conducted jointly with other parties 
where the participants have a direct ownership interest in, and jointly control the assets. Accordingly 
the financial statements reflect only the Company’s proportionate interest in such activities.
Exploration and Evaluation Assets
General exploration or evaluation (E&E) expenditures incurred prior to acquiring the legal right to 
explore are charged to expense as incurred. 
 
E&E expenditures represent undeveloped land costs and license and exploration well costs. 
 
Undeveloped  land  costs,  licenses  and  exploration  well  costs  are  initially  capitalized  and,  if 
subsequently determined to have not found sufficient reserves to justify commercial production, are 
charged  to  expense.    E&E  assets  continue  to  be  capitalized  as  long  as  sufficient  progress  is  being 
made  to  assess  the  reserves  and  economic  viability  of  the  well  and/or  related  project.    Once 
technical  feasibility  and  commercial  viability  has  been  established,  E&E  assets  are  transferred  to 
property and equipment (PE). E&E assets are assessed for impairment either annually, upon transfer 
to PE assets or whenever indications of impairment exist to ensure they are not carried above their 
recoverable amounts.  The Company currently has no E&E assets.
Property and Equipment
PE assets include transferred-in E&E costs, development drilling and other subsurface expenditures. 
PE  assets  are  carried  at  cost  less  depletion  and  depreciation  of  all  development  expenditures  and 
include all other expenditures associated with PE assets. 
 
When commercial production has commenced in an area, PE properties, excluding surface costs are 
depleted  using  the  unit-of-production  method  over  their  total  proved  reserve 
life.  Future 
development costs are included in costs subject to depletion. Proved reserves and estimated future 
development costs are determined annually by qualified independent reserve engineers. Changes in 
factors,  such  as  estimates  of  proved  reserves,  that  affect  unit-of-production  calculations  are 
accounted  for  on  a  prospective  basis.    Surface  costs  such  as  production  facilities  and  furniture, 
fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. 
 
Oil and Gas Properties 
 
The  initial  cost  of  an  asset  is  comprised  of  its  purchase  price  or  construction  cost,  including 
expenditures such as drilling costs, the present value of the initial and changes in the estimate of any
- 24 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
decommissioning obligation associated with the asset and finance charges on qualifying assets, that 
are directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation and to its present location.  
 
Production Facilities 
 
Production facilities are comprised of costs related to petroleum and natural gas production 
equipment. 
 
Depreciation 
 
Depreciation  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income.    Production  facilities, 
furniture,  fixtures  and  other  equipment  are  depreciated  over  the  individual  assets’  estimated 
economic lives.  These assets are depreciated on a straight-line method as follows: 
 
Production facilities   
 
Furniture, fixtures and other equipment
10 years 
5 to 10 years
g)
Impairment of Assets 
 
Impairment of Financial Assets 
 
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events 
have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.  An impairment loss in 
respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its 
carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original 
effective interest rate.  Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. 
The  remaining  financial  assets  are  assessed  collectively  in  groups  that  share  similar  credit  risk 
characteristics. An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by 
reference to its current fair value. 
 
All impairment losses are recognized in net earnings. An impairment loss is reversed if there is an 
indicator  that  the  impairment  reversal  can  be  related  objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the 
impairment  loss  was  recognized.  Any  subsequent  recovery  of  an  impairment  loss  in  respect  of  an 
investment  in  an  equity  instrument  classified  as  available-for-sale  is  reversed  through  other 
comprehensive income instead of net earnings. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, the 
reversal is recognized in net earnings. 
 
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 
 
The  carrying  amounts  of  the  Company's  non-financial  assets  are  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each 
reporting  period  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  such  indication 
exists, then the assets’ carrying amounts are assessed for impairment.  
 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets 
that  generates  cash  flows  from  continuing  use  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  flows  of 
other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit or CGU). The recoverable amount of an 
asset or a CGU is the greater of its value-in-use (VIU) and its fair value less costs to sell (FVLCS). 
 
In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset. In determining FVLCS, recent market transactions are used as indicators of fair 
value.  These  calculations  are  corroborated  by  valuation  multiples  or  other  available  fair  value 
indicators.
- 25 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
An  impairment  loss  is  recognized  if  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  or  its  CGU  exceeds  its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Impairment losses recognized in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying value of 
any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying value of the other assets of the 
CGU on a pro-rata basis. 
 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment 
losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the 
loss  has  decreased  or  no  longer  exists.  If  the  amount  of  the  impairment  loss  decreases  in  a 
subsequent  period  and  the  decrease  can  be  objectively  related  to  an  event  occurring  after  the 
impairment  was  recognized,  the  impairment  loss  is  reversed  only  to  the  extent  that  the  assets’ 
carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined,  net  of 
depletion and depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
h)  Decommissioning Liabilities
is  recorded  when
The  fair  value  of  the  statutory,  contractual,  constructive  or  legal  liabilities  associated  with  the 
retirement  and  reclamation  of  oil  and  gas  properties 
incurred,  with  a 
corresponding  increase  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  PE.  The  amount  recognized  is  the 
estimated  cost  of  decommissioning,  discounted  to  its  present  value  using  the  Company’s  risk  free 
rate.  Changes  in  the  estimated  timing  of  decommissioning  or  decommissioning  cost  estimates  are 
dealt  with  prospectively  by  recording  an  adjustment  to  the  provision  and  a  corresponding 
adjustment  to  property  and  equipment.  The  unwinding  of  the  discount  on  the  decommissioning 
provision is charged to net earnings. 
 
The  Company  recognizes  a  decommissioning  liability  in  the  period  in  which  it  is  incurred  when  a 
reasonable  estimate  of  the  fair  value  can  be  made.    On  a  periodic  basis,  management  will  review 
these estimates and changes and if there are any, they will be applied prospectively.  The fair value 
of the estimated provision is recorded as a long-term liability, with a corresponding increase in the 
carrying  amount  of  the  related  asset.    The  capitalized  amount  is  depleted  on  a  unit-of-production 
basis over the life of the reserves.  The liability amount is increased each reporting period due to the 
passage of time and this amount is charged to earnings in the period.  Revisions to the estimated 
timing of cash flows or to the original estimated undiscounted cost would also result in an increase 
or decrease to the provision.  Actual costs incurred upon settlement of the obligations are charged 
against the provision to the extent of the liability recorded and the remaining balance of the actual 
costs is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
Tax  expense  comprises  current  and  deferred  taxes.  Tax  is  recognized  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
 
Current tax expense is based on the results for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable 
or not deductible. Current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that are substantively enacted at 
the end of the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. Provisions 
are  established  where  appropriate  on  the  basis  of  amounts  expected  to  be  paid  to  the  tax 
authorities.  
 
Deferred tax is recognized using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes.  Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the
i)
- 26 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
j)
initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries 
to the extent that they are unlikely to reverse in the foreseeable future.  Deferred tax is measured at 
the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based 
on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 
A deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which temporary differences can be utilized.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at 
each balance date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realized. 
 
Share-Based Payments
The  Company  accounts  for  share-based  payments  using  the  fair-value  method  of  accounting  for 
stock options granted to directors, officers, employees and other service providers using the Black-
Scholes  option  pricing  model.    Share-based  payments  are  recognized  through  the  statement  of 
comprehensive  income  over  the  vesting  period  with  a  corresponding  amount  reflected  in 
contributed  surplus  in  equity.  For  awards  issued  in  tranches  that  vest  at  different  times,  the  fair 
value of each tranche is recognized over its respective vesting period. 
 
At the grant date and at the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses and re-assesses for 
subsequent periods its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest and recognizes 
the impact of the revisions in the statement of comprehensive income. Upon exercise of share-based 
options, the proceeds received net of any transaction costs and the fair value of the exercised share-
based options is credited to share capital.
k)
Financial Instruments
Financial  instruments  are  measured  at  fair  value  on  initial  recognition  of  the  instrument  and  are 
classified  into  one  of  the  following  five  categories:  fair-value  through  profit  or  loss,  loans  and 
receivables,  held-to-maturity  investments,  available-for-sale  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities 
at amortized cost. 
 
Subsequent measurement of financial instruments is based on their initial classification. Fair-value 
through profit or loss financial instruments are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are 
recognized in the statement of comprehensive income.  Available-for-sale financial instruments are 
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income until the 
instrument  is  derecognized  or  impaired.    The  remaining  categories  of  financial  instruments  are 
recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 
 
Cash is classified as fair-value through profit and loss and is measured at fair value which equals the 
carrying  value  and  any  gains  or  losses  are  recognized  in  net  earnings  in  the  period  they  occur.  
Accounts receivable and note receivable are classified as loans and receivables which are measured 
at amortized cost.  Investment is classified as available-for-sale which is measured at fair value and 
any  gains  or  losses  are  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  in  the  period  they  occur.  
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost.
l)  Net Earnings and Comprehensive Income Per Share
Per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net earnings or comprehensive income attributable 
to  common  shareholders  of  the  Company  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  common  shares 
outstanding during the reporting period.
- 27 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
Diluted  per  share  amounts  are  calculated  similar  to  basic  per  share  amounts  except  that  the 
weighted average common shares outstanding are increased to include additional common shares 
from the assumed exercise of dilutive share options.  The number of additional outstanding common 
shares  is  calculated  by  assuming  that  the  outstanding  in-the-money  share  options  were  exercised 
and  that  the  proceeds  from  such  exercises  were  used  to  acquire  common  shares  at  the  average 
market price during the reporting period.
4.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On  September  24,  2010,  Pine  Cliff  sold  its  South  American  subsidiary  CanAmericas  (Argentina) 
Energy Ltd. to an unrelated party.   
 
The  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  South  American  Operations  have  been  presented  as  discontinued 
operations  in  the  condensed  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position,  since  June  1,  2010,  the 
date the South American Operations met the criteria for discontinued operations.  Operating results 
related  to  these  assets  and  liabilities  have  been  included  in  net  earnings  (loss)  from  discontinued 
operations in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss).

Impairment and Disposal of Oil and Gas Assets 
On September 24, 2010 the Company disposed of its South American subsidiary, whose assets and 
liabilities  related  primarily  to  the  Canadon  Ramirez  Concession  and  Laguna  de  Piedra  Concession 
(South  American  Properties).    The  proceeds  of  disposition  were  $450,000  consisting  of  $1,000  of 
cash,  a  note  receivable  for  $449,000  and  a  contingent  receivable  not  used  to  calculate  the
- 28 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
impairment  reversal  on  the  disposal  of  oil  and  gas  assets.    During  the  first  quarter  of  2011,  the 
purchaser  settled  the  note  by  issuing  shares  in  the  purchaser’s  publicly  traded  corporation.  As  at 
March 31, 2011, these shares were valued at $393,872 (December 31, 2010 - $328,227 (value of the 
note receivable)).  At the time of disposition, the Company had a net book value of $23,121 for the 
South  American  properties  after  prior  period  write-downs  of  $7,746,705. 
It  also  had 
decommissioning  liabilities  of  $38,838  and  a  working  capital  deficiency  of  $342,969  that  was 
transferred  to  the  purchaser  related  to  the  South  American  property  resulting  in  a  recovery  of 
impairment on oil and gas assets of $808,686.  
 
For  the  period  ended  March  31,  2010,  an  impairment  provision  of  $15,463  was  taken  on  the 
exploration  costs  related  to  the  Canadon  Ramirez  Concession  and  an  impairment  provision  of 
$17,490 was taken on the Laguna de Piedra Concession prior to the disposal of the South American 
properties.   
 
Contingent Receivable 
Upon disposal of the South American properties, the Company received a contingent consideration 
of $200,000 (payable in  cash or shares in the purchaser corporation) if  within two years after the 
closing date the purchaser or an affiliate to the purchaser is successful in obtaining a drilling permit 
followed by the drilling of a well on the Laguna de Piedra concession block in the Rio Negro Province 
of Argentina or the local permitting authority in the province grants a concession to substitute for 
the Laguna de Piedra concession and the purchaser or affiliate entity drills a well on the substitute 
concession.  Collection of this receivable is not determinable at this time and therefore has not been 
recorded by the Company. 
 
Taxes 
The  Company  accrued  $1,382  current  tax  expense  related  to  Argentina  capital  tax  in  the  three 
month period ended March 31, 2010. A one percent Argentina capital tax is payable in respect of the 
exploration costs for the Canadon Ramirez and the Laguna de Piedra Concessions.  This liability was 
transferred to the purchaser on the disposal of its South American subsidiary.

Impairment  
 
Management has determined that the Sundance area of Alberta, Canada is the only cash generating 
unit (CGU) of the Company. 
 
This  CGU  is  the  Company’s  only  producing  field.    As  part  of  its  annual  impairment  analysis,  the 
Company assessed its property and equipment assets of this CGU for possible impairment.  
 
The assessment for impairment has been determined based on the value-in-use (VIU) method. VIU 
was determined on the basis of the discounted expected future cash flows based on the Company’s 
plans to continue to produce total proved plus probable reserves. 
 
At December 31, 2010, a Canadian-based, independent reserves evaluator’s report confirmed that 
the  Company  does  not  require  a  reduction  in  total  proved  plus  probable  reserve  estimates.  
Expected future cash flows from the sale of these volumes are calculated based on the Company’s 
best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas used for future cash 
flow projections are based on quality and Edmonton PAR for oil and AECO for natural gas forward 
prices. Management have used the past experience to estimate the required capital and operating 
expenditures to extract oil and natural gas and factored inflation at 1.5 percent. 
 
Projected estimates of cash flows from the CGU have been determined based on the economic life of 
the reserves. For this CGU, this projection is based on the expected life ending December 2027. The 
impairment testing undertaken concluded that the value in use is greater than the carrying values of 
the CGU and no impairment provision have been recorded for the three months ended March 31, 
2011 and 2010 or for the year ended December 31, 2010.
INCOME TAXES 
 
The  Company  has  recorded  a  full  valuation  allowance  for  its  deferred  income  tax  assets  as  it  has

8.  DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITIES
At  March  31,  2011,  the  estimated  total  undiscounted  amount  required  to  settle  the 
decommissioning liabilities was $95,032 (December 31, 2010 - $95,032, January 1, 2010 - $71,932).  
The provision has been calculated assuming a 1.5 percent inflation rate (December 31, 2010 – 1.5 
percent inflation rate, January 1, 2010 – 2.0 percent inflation rate).  These obligations will be settled 
based on the useful lives of the underlying assets, which extend up to 17 years into the future.  This 
amount has been discounted using a risk-free interest rate of 3.5 percent (December 31, 2010 and 
January 1, 2010 – 4.1 percent).

9.  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST (NCI)
The Company incorporated the subsidiary company CanAmericas to explore and develop oil and gas 
properties  primarily  in  South  America.   CanAmericas  was  owned  93  percent  by  the  Company  and 
seven  percent  by  a  foreign  private  corporation  (NCI). CanAmericas  was  initially  financed  by 
investments of U.S. $1,400,000 for 5,600,000 common shares from the Company and U.S. $100,000 
for 400,000 common shares from NCI.   
 
On  November  23,  2010,  NCI  sold  its  interest  in  CanAmericas  to  Pine  Cliff  for  $10.  NCI  at  the 
acquisition date had a deficit balance of $727,185, which resulted on a loss on acquisition of non-
controlling interest of $727,195.

13.  FINANCIAL AND CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Financial Risk Factors 
 
The Company undertakes transactions in a range of financial instruments including:
•  Cash 
•  Accounts receivable 
• 
•  Accounts payable
Investment
The  Company’s  activities  result  in  exposure  to  a  number  of  financial  risks  including  market  risk 
(commodity  price  risk,  interest  rate  risk  and  foreign  exchange  risk),  credit  risk  and  liquidity  risk.  
Financial risk management is carried out by senior management under the direction of the Board of 
Directors. 
 
The  Company  does  not  enter  into  risk  management  contracts  to  sell  its  oil  and  gas  commodities. 
Commodities are sold at market prices at the date of sale.
Capital Risk Management 
 
The  Company’s  objectives  when  managing  capital,  which  the  Company  defines  to  include 
shareholders’  equity  and  working  capital  balances,  are  to  safeguard  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continue as a going concern, to continue providing returns to its shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.  In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue debt or new shares. 
 
The  following  section  (a)  of  this  note  provides  a  summary  of  the  Company’s  underlying  economic 
positions as represented by the carrying values, fair values and contractual face values of its financial 
assets  and  financial  liabilities.    The  Company’s  working  capital  to  capital  expenditure  requirement 
ratio is also provided.   
 
The following section (b) addresses in more detail the key financial risk factors that arise from the 
Company’s activities including its policies for managing these risks.

Financial instruments, consisting of accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
included in the statement of financial position, are carried at amortized cost.  Cash and investment 
are  carried  at  fair  value.      All  of  the  fair  value  items  are  transacted  in  active  markets.    Pine  Cliff 
classifies  the  fair  value  of  these  transactions  according  to  the  following  hierarchy  based  on  the 
amount of observable inputs used to value the instrument. 
 
Level  1  –  Quoted  prices  are  available  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  as  of  the 
reporting  date.    Active  markets  are  those  in  which  transactions  occur  in  sufficient  frequency  and 
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
 
Level 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1.  Prices in 
Level 2 are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.  Level 2 valuations are 
based on inputs, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value and volatility factors, 
which can be substantially observed or corroborated in the marketplace. 
 
Level 3 – Valuations in this level are those with inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data. 
 
Pine  Cliff’s  cash  has  been  assessed  on  the  fair  value  hierarchy  described  above  and  is  considered 
Level 1.
b)  Risks and mitigations
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of the Company’s financial instruments 
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.  Components of market risk to which Pine Cliff is 
exposed are discussed below. 
 
Commodity Price Risk 
 
The  Company’s  principal  operation  is  the  exploration  and  development  of  oil  and  natural  gas 
properties in western Canada. Fluctuations in prices of these commodities may directly impact the 
Company’s performance and ability to continue its operations.  
 
The  Company’s  management  currently  does  not  use  risk  management  contracts  to  set  price 
parameters for its production.
Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flow associated 
with the instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.  Interest rate risk arises 
from interest bearing financial assets and liabilities that Pine Cliff uses.  The principal exposure to the
- 36 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
Company is on its cash balances which have a variable interest rate which gives rise to a cash flow 
interest rate risk. 
 
Pine  Cliff’s  cash  consists  of  Canadian  dollar  investment  chequing  accounts  on  which  it  earns  an 
insignificant amount of interest.  Since these funds need to be accessible for the development of the 
Company’s capital projects, management does not reduce its exposure to interest rate risk through 
entering into term contracts of various lengths.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The  Company  has  disposed  of  its  foreign  operations.    The  Company’s  domestic  or  continuing 
operations currently sells all of its Canadian production in Canadian currency.  The Company has a 
Canadian dollar denominated cash balance and as such, Pine Cliff does not have exchange rate risk.       
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  a  contracting  party  will  not  complete  its  obligations  under  a  financial 
instrument and cause the Company to incur a financial loss.  Pine Cliff is exposed to credit risk on all 
financial assets included on the balance sheet.  To help mitigate this risk, the Company maintains the 
majority of its cash balances with a major Canadian chartered bank.  
 
Substantially  all  of  the  continuing  operations’  accounts  receivable  balance  at  March  31,  2011 
($83,660), December 31, 2010 ($155,945) and January 1,  2010 ($129,900) relates to product sales 
with Canadian oil and gas companies and crown royalty credits with the province of Alberta, all of 
which have generally been received within 30 to 60 days.   
 
Pine Cliff assesses its financial assets quarterly to determine if there has been any impairment.  No 
impairment provision was required on the Company’s financial assets.  Pine Cliff does not have any 
significant  credit  risk  exposure  to  any  single  counterparty  or  any  group  of  counterparties  having 
similar characteristics. 
 
The  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  represented  by  the  carrying  amount  on  the  statement  of 
financial position.  There are no material financial assets that Pine Cliff considers past due.
Liquidity Risk 
 
Liquidity risk includes the risk that, as a result of Pine Cliff’s operational liquidity requirements, the 
Company:
•  will not have sufficient funds to settle a transaction on the due date, 
•  will not have sufficient funds to continue with its financing of its major exploration projects, 
•  will be forced to sell assets at a value which is less than what they are worth, or 
•  may be unable to settle or recover financial assets.
To help reduce these liquidity risks, the Company:
•  may arrange short-term financing at a reasonable interest rate with its CEO and director. 
•  may negotiate a bank loan, 
•  may do an equity issue.
14.  EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS
- 37 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
As stated in Note 2, these are the Company’s first financial statements for the period ended March 
31,  2011  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS.  For  all  accounting  periods  prior  to  this,  the  Company 
prepared its financial statements under Canadian GAAP. An explanation of how the transition from 
previous GAAP to IFRS has affected the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position and 
consolidated comprehensive income is set out in this note. 
 
The accounting policies set out in Note 3 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for 
the  period  ended  March  31,  2011,  the  comparative  information  presented  in  these  financial 
statements  for  the  period  ended  March  31,  2010  and  as  at  December  31,  2010  and  in  the 
preparation  of  an  opening  IFRS  statement  of  financial  position  at  January  1,  2010  (the  Company’s 
date of transition). 
 
IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” (IFRS 1) 
IFRS  1  generally  requires  that  first-time  adopters  retrospectively  apply  all  effective  IFRS  standards 
and  interpretations  in  effect  as  at  the  reporting  date.  IFRS  1  also  provides  for  certain  optional 
exemptions and certain mandatory exemptions to this general principle. 
 
Initial Elections Upon Adoption 
Set forth below are the IFRS 1 applicable exemptions and exceptions applied in the conversion from 
Canadian GAAP to IFRS. 
 
•  Business  combinations  (IFRS  3)  -  provides  the  option  to  apply  IFRS  3,  Business  Combinations, 
retrospectively or prospectively from the Transition Date.  The retrospective basis would require 
restatement of all business combinations that occurred prior to the Transition Date or an earlier 
date  chosen  by  management.    The  Company  elected  not  to  retrospectively  apply  IFRS  3  to 
business combinations that occurred prior to its Transition Date and such business combinations 
have  not  been  restated.    Any  goodwill  arising  on  such  business  combinations  before  the 
Transition  Date  has  not  been  adjusted  from  the  carrying  value  previously  determined  under 
Canadian GAAP as a result of applying these exemptions.
•  Share-based  payments  (IFRS  2)  -  encourages  the  application  of  its  provisions  to  equity 
instruments granted on or before November 7, 2002, but permits the application only to equity 
instruments  granted  after  November  7,  2002  that  had  not  vested  by  the  Transition  Date.    The 
Company elected to avail itself of the exemption provided under IFRS 1 and applied IFRS 2 for all 
equity instruments granted after November 7, 2002 that had not vested by its Transition Date.  
Further,  the  Company  applied  IFRS  2  for  all  liabilities  arising  from  share-based  payment 
transactions  that  existed  at  its  Transition  Date.    This  election  has  no  material  effect  on  the 
Company.
•  Borrowing  Costs  (IAS  23)  -  requires  an  entity  to  capitalize  the  borrowing  costs  related  to  all 
qualifying assets  for  which the commencement date for  capitalization is on or after  January 1, 
2010 or earlier if elected by management.  Due to the Company having no debt, this election has 
no effect on the Company.
•  Leases (IAS 17) - requires an entity to assess arrangements outstanding at the Transition Date.  It 
also requires a determination of the appropriate lease classification in accordance with IAS 17, 
should  an  arrangement  containing  a  lease  be  identified  as  part  of  the  International  Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 4, “Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains 
a Lease”, application.  This election has no effect on the Company.

14.1  Reconciliation of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position (Continued)
IFRS  has  many  similarities  with  Canadian  GAAP  as  it  is  based  on  a  similar  conceptual  framework.  
However, there are important differences with regard to recognition, measurement and disclosure.  
Adoption of IFRS resulted in changes to Pine Cliff’s consolidated statement of financial position and 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) as set out below:
a)  Discontinued Operations
As  at  June  1,  2010  the  South  American  Operations  met  the  criteria  for  reporting  as  discontinued 
operations.  Under Canadian GAAP for the comparative periods, the statement of financial position, 
the statement of comprehensive income and the statement of cash flow are restated to conform to 
the  current  period  presentation.    Under  IFRS,  only  the  statements  of  comprehensive  income  and 
cash  flow  are  retroactively  restated  to  conform  to  the  current  presentation.  The  changes  for  the 
condensed consolidated statements of financial position are as follows:
($) 
Increase in accounts receivable  
Decrease in discontinued operations’ current assets 
Increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
Decrease in discontinued operations’ current liabilities 
Increase in decommissioning liabilities 
Decrease in discontinued operations’ long-term
liabilities

b)  Decommissioning Liabilities
The  discounted  value  of  the  decommissioning  liabilities  has  increased  due  to  a  change  in  the 
discount  rate  used  to  calculate  the  present  value  of  future  oil  and  gas  well  reclamation  and 
abandonments. Under Canadian GAAP, a risk adjusted discount rate was used.  Under IFRS, a pre-tax 
discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks 
specific  to  the  obligation  has  been  used.  In  accordance  with  IFRS  1,  the  Company  has  elected  to 
recognize  the  $3,422  increase  in  the  decommissioning  obligation  from  continuing  operations  and 
$2,391  from  discontinued  operations  along  with  an  increase  to  related  property  and  equipment 
assets and an increase in deficit (see 14.1 (d)) at the transition date. 
 
Similar  adjustments  were  made  for  the  increase  in  decommissioning  liabilities  for  three  months 
ended March 31, 2010 of $3,348 for continuing operations and $2,335 for discontinued operations.  
Decommissioning  liabilities  for  continuing  operations  increased  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 
2010 by $7,567 and $nil for discontinued operations.
c)  Non-Controlling Interest (NCI)
Under Canadian GAAP, when the non-controlling interest is not obligated to fund its share of losses, 
the  Company  does  not  attribute  losses  to  the  non-controlling  interest  once  the  interest  has  been 
reduced to nil. Under IFRS, the Company is required to allocate comprehensive losses  to the non-
controlling interest based on their effective interest, even if this results in a non-controlling deficit 
balance.  The  impact  of  the  change  was  to  decrease  deficit  and  increase  non-controlling  deficit  by 
$648,583 at January 1, 2010 (March 31, 2010 - $663,908).  The NCI had a deficit balance under IFRS 
of  $727,185  on  November  23,  2010  (acquisition  date  of  the  NCI)  resulting  in  a  $Nil  balance  for 
December 31, 2010.
- 40 -  Pine Cliff Energy Ltd.
Under IFRS, the Company includes the NCI as a component of equity on the face of the statement of 
financial position.  Under Canadian GAAP, the NCI would be presented on the face of the statement 
of financial position as neither a liability nor an equity component.
d)  Retained Earnings

retained earnings for the respective periods covered under this reconciliation:

14.2  Reconciliation of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) (Continued) 
 
The nature of the adjustments is explained as follows:
a)
Loss on Acquisition of Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) 
 
Under Canadian GAAP, no losses would be attributed to the NCI once the NCI was reduced to nil.  
When  the  Company  purchased  the  non-controlling  interest  for  $10  this  amount  was  recorded  to 
office and administration.  Under IFRS, the Company retroactively started to record the NCI’s share 
of losses from inception for the periods ended March 31, 2010 of $15,325 and December 31, 2010 of 
$78,602.  When the Company purchased the NCI it recorded a loss on acquisition of $727,195, which 
consisted of the NCI’s accumulated losses plus the purchase price.
b)  Depletion and Depreciation

decommissioning  liabilities  previously  grouped
