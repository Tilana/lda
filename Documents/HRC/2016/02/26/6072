1. The Government of Afghanistan was very welcoming and fully cooperative during my 12-
day visit to Helmand, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunar, Nangarhar, Jowzjan and Parwan.  The United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) provided superb logistical and other 
support.  
 
2. The problem of killings is a significant one in Afghanistan. In this preliminary report, I 
identify steps that should be taken urgently. My final report will be more extensive. 
 
3. Afghanistan is enveloped in an armed conflict. That does not mean, however, that large 
numbers of avoidable killings of civilians must be tolerated. The level of complacency in 
response to these killings is staggeringly high. In a nutshell: police killings must cease; 
widespread impunity within the legal system for killing must be rejected; the killing of women 
and girls must end; the international military forces must ensure real accountability for their 
actions; and the United Nations should give greater prominence to the role of human rights in its 
activities.  
 
<b>Ensuring the accountability and transparency of the international military forces  
</b> 
4. The international forces in Afghanistan should take seriously the principles of 
accountability and transparency. I saw no evidence of widespread intentional killings in violation 
of human rights or humanitarian law by international military forces.  However, they reportedly 
killed as many as 200 civilians, often in joint operations with Afghan security forces, between 
January and April 2008. Especially problematic are killings during surprise night-time raids and 
those that occur when soldiers fire at vehicles or passers-by. 
 
5. The response of the international forces combines great seriousness of intent and adherence 
to the applicable law with a surprisingly opaque and unsatisfactory outcome. In a few instances, 
this opacity may be intentional. For example, there have been a number of raids for which no 
State or military command appears ready to acknowledge responsibility.  I received credible 
information that armed Afghan men were working with armed international personnel in certain 
areas, but never received a definitive answer as to how they fitted into anyone&#8217;s chain of 
command. At least some of these units are apparently led by personnel belonging to international 
intelligence services. Such a situation is absolutely unacceptable. 
 
6. Most failures of accountability and transparency are more prosaic, but these ordinary 
failures are also troubling. Often those whose relatives had been killed were unable to ascertain 
any information as to those responsible. Moreover, no-one in Afghanistan tracks the outcome of 
investigations and prosecutions, and makes such information public. 
 
7. The international forces operating in Afghanistan have a responsibility to make sure that 
there is a coherent, unified system of accountability which Afghans and others can follow. 
However messy this system may be on the inside, composed as it must be of multiple mandates 
and of disparate national military justice systems, it is essential that those pieces add up to a 
coherent whole.  
 
 
<b>NATO response </b></p>

8. Following my press conference in Kabul, NATO-International Security Assistance Force 
(ISAF) issued a press release criticizing my statement.  Sadly the response was largely rhetorical 
and failed to address the substance of the issues.  In the release, it said it was &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; to 
suggest that coalition forces had ever committed an intentional killing and implied that no air 
strikes had ever failed to comply with the law of armed conflict.  This level of denial does not 
bode well for future efforts to address past and continuing problems involving civilian casualties. 
 
<b>Police reform  
</b> 
9. For many people living in rural areas, the perceived legitimacy of the Government depends 
almost entirely on police behaviour. If they maintain law and order for all, the Government will 
have legitimacy. If they extort, intimidate and kill, the Government will have no legitimacy. All 
too often, the police function not as enforcers of law and order, but as promoters of the interests 
of a specific tribe or commander.  
 
10. In the course of my visit, these problems were especially visible in the South. When I 
spoke with elders from conflict-affected areas, I was repeatedly told that abuses by the police 
were tempting people to support the Taliban. These realities have not, however, been adequately 
recognized by the Government or the international community. Often, when killings by the 
police are alleged, no-one in the Government has any interest in investigating, much less 
prosecuting, those responsible.  
 
11. The Government and the international community have consistently missed opportunities 
to remove corrupt and abusive individuals from the State&#8217;s security forces and power structures.  
 
12. A key reason for these failures to act is the extent to which senior Government and 
international officials focus on stability and security rather than human rights. The belief that 
human rights can be traded off for stability and security seems widely held. It is gravely 
misplaced. We need to recognize that ensuring respect by Government security forces for basic 
human rights is <i>necessary </i>in order to ensure security and stability.  
<b> 
</b><i>But what does this mean for policy? 
<b></b></i><b> 
</b>13. First, Afghanistan needs a police force that can play both a law enforcement and para-
military role. Any police force that does not deal effectively with the crimes that plague people 
in their everyday lives will be discredited. Any police force that works in conflict-affected areas 
must be prepared to engage with insurgents. Training must thus encompass both aspects.  
 
14. Second, training alone will not fix the police force of Afghanistan. The &#8220;focused district 
development&#8221; programme has, in an unexpected manner, pointed the way towards genuine 
reform. The programme works by taking an entire district&#8217;s police force to another location to 
receive intensive training. While they are being trained, the Afghan National Civil Order Police 
(ANCOP) moves in to police the district. They have generally been well received. Why? The 
answer may lie partly in their training, but the dominant factor seems to be that ANCOP does not 
have any connection to local tribes, commanders or warlords.

15. Third, the Government must stop establishing and legitimizing more militias. It seems that 
the now abandoned auxiliary police programme amounted to little beyond legitimizing existing 
militias by giving them Government uniforms. It is not clear, however, that the lessons of that 
experience have truly been learned. There is reason for concern that the &#8220;social outreach 
programme&#8221; could increase the risk to the local population and lead to the empowerment of 
favoured groups within a community to extort, intimidate and kill their opponents.  
 
16. Fourth, the police must be better trained and equipped with a view to reducing the 
unacceptable rate at which police officers die, which is almost five times that of the military.  
 
17. Finally, the problem of killings by the police and other armed personnel acting under the 
authority of Government officials has been largely overlooked. This should end. While there are 
no reliable figures on the number of such unlawful killings, there are enough particular cases that 
it is certain that the overall number is high. There is a crying need for a system which ensures 
that, when the police and/or their political masters are accused of multiple killings, an 
independent investigation is launched. The killing of 9 and the wounding of 42 unarmed 
protesters in Sheberghan on 28 May 2007 provides a classic example. Local and national 
political interests conspired to ensure that no effective investigation was undertaken.  
 
18. Local police are - not unusually - incapable of meaningfully investigating themselves. A 
national police investigative task force should be established for this purpose. The investigative 
powers of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) should also be 
strengthened and the local and the national Government should be given 90 days to respond in 
detail to the Commission&#8217;s findings.  
 
<b>Women 
</b> 
19. The problems in the criminal justice system are multiplied exponentially for women. When 
women were asked to whom they could lodge a complaint if they faced abuse within the home, 
or feared for their lives, they replied that, for many of them, even leaving the house to make a 
complaint would be difficult. If they could leave, they would be too ashamed to make their 
concerns public. If they did make a complaint to the police, they did not believe that the Afghan 
National Police (ANP) would take any action. They felt they would only be punished further, or 
be imprisoned for running away. In short, far too many women at risk of being killed simply 
have nowhere to turn.  
 
20. Women&#8217;s referral centres recently set up in Jalalabad and Parwan, appear to be making a 
real difference. Such initiatives warrant strong support from the Government and the 
international community. Prosecutions of crimes against women would also be assisted by 
setting up in the Attorney-General&#8217;s office a strong special office for female victims.  
 
21. Women are also threatened or targeted for assassination by the Taliban and other anti-
Government elements for a range of reasons.  
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.6

</p>
<p> 
22. Women who have lost menfolk in the current conflict very often end up in disastrous 
situations. Some receive monetary assistance for their losses, but many are unaware of such a 
possibility.  
 
23. Honour killings continue to be widespread and numerous. They are rarely reported and 
even more rarely investigated. The responsibility of the State is high and urgent steps are needed. 
 
<b>Moratorium on executions  
</b> 
24. The Supreme Court recently submitted some 100 existing death sentences covering the past 
six years to President Karzai. However, the criminal justice system is deeply flawed and is 
incapable of ensuring respect for due process rights. The wealthy and well connected escape 
serious punishment.  Under such circumstances, there should be a moratorium on carrying out 
any death sentences in order to avoid violating international legal standards.  
 
<b>Criminal justice system and corruption  
</b> 
25. Impunity results from the failings in the functioning of the criminal justice system. Time 
and again, I received complaints that many killings are not investigated by the police, that the 
prosecutors far too often do not proceed to prosecute alleged killers, and that the judiciary 
corruptly exonerates many individuals. The result is a system which provides a thoroughly 
unacceptable degree of impunity to those accused of killing. While specific reforms to the justice 
system are essential, corruption seems to be the common thread running through many of the 
problems.  
 
26. Corruption is endemic. It fuels resentment, despair and anti-Government activities. 
Pervasive corruption cannot be eliminated overnight, but there is a pressing need to establish a 
visible and credible mechanism with the power to subpoena witnesses and evidence, and to 
launch prosecutions. Above all, it must be designed to withstand the inevitable pressures of both 
corrupt politicians and those in Government who feel obliged to turn a blind eye to corruption so 
as not to jeopardize their ability to govern. Independent corruption agencies have been 
successfully established in many States including, Nigeria, Hong Kong and Australia. A series of 
carefully targeted prosecutions of egregious cases would work wonders in terms of sending the 
necessary message. While this will require international funding, national ownership is 
indispensable.  
 
<b>Taliban and other anti-Government elements  
</b> 
27. Over the past four months, the Taliban and other anti-government elements have killed 
approximately 300 civilians. Roughly three quarters of these civilians were killed in suicide 
attacks. While the majority of suicide attacks appear to target legitimate military objectives, 
many of these attacks are nonetheless unlawful because it should be obvious that they will result 
in far more civilian than military deaths.  
 
28. Most of the other civilians killed by the Taliban die as a result of targeted assassinations. 
While these killings are fewer in number, they are significant in terms of intimidating and 
repressing the population. Often, killing one teacher will close an entire area&#8217;s schools, killing </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.6 
page 6 
 
one proponent of the Government will intimidate many others, and killing one worker will end 
humanitarian access to a district. These assassinations are completely unlawful, and their 
consequences are dramatic. The Taliban have also engaged in a high level of unlawful killing of 
non-civilians. 
 
29. In future, human rights groups and inter-Governmental organizations in Afghanistan 
should develop contacts with the Taliban and other armed groups. The decision to speak with an 
armed group for the purpose of requesting its views on particular incidents, criticizing its 
conduct and urging better compliance with human rights and humanitarian law does not 
legitimize that group. 
 
<b>Preliminary recommendations  
</b> 
<b>30. Police reform to end unlawful killings should be a priority: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The links between police officers and particular tribes, commanders, and 
politicians must be broken in order to establish a truly national police force; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) All efforts to supplement the police by establishing or legitimizing local militias 
should be abandoned; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) At this stage, the police are clearly obliged to play both law enforcement and 
paramilitary roles and should be structured and trained accordingly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Killings by the police must end. The interminable dragging out of Government 
investigations and inquiries until such episodes are effectively forgotten 
reinforces impunity. A national police investigative task force is needed, the 
investigative powers of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission 
should be strengthened and the Government should have a time limit within 
which to respond to the Commission&#8217;s findings.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 
31. The Government should impose a moratorium on executions.  
 
32. The situation of half of the population &#8211; women &#8211; in relation to killings is largely 
ignored. The criminal justice system must be made accessible to them, initiatives such as 
women&#8217;s referral centres should be encouraged, and a special office for female victims 
should be created by the Attorney-General.  
 
33. More attention must be given to the devastating poverty too often suffered by women 
whose male relatives have been killed. Honour killings, which occur in very large numbers, 
must be treated as the murders that they so clearly are.  
 
34. An independent anti-corruption agency should be established. 
 
35. The international forces present in Afghanistan should respect the principles of 
accountability and transparency. Among other things, they should ensure that, despite the 
complexity of multiple mandates and disparate national criminal justice systems, directly </b></p>

<p> 
<b>affected persons can go to a military base and promptly receive answers with regard to 
responsibility for a particular operation and the status of any investigation or prosecution.  
 
36. A serious effort should be made to pressure and persuade the Taliban and other 
armed groups to respect human rights and humanitarian law. This effort should include 
developing contacts with them for the sole, dedicated purpose of promoting respect for 
human rights. Such efforts should be undertaken subject to security feasibility and in 
conformity with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1267 (1999).
