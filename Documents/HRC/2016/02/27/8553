<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010. The review of Mauritania was held at the 16th meeting, on 10 November 2010. The 
delegation of Mauritania was headed by Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Khattra, Commissaire 
aux Droits de l&#8217;Homme, &#224; l&#8217;Action Humanitaire et aux Relations avec la Soci&#233;t&#233; Civile. At 
its 17th meeting, held on 12 November 2010, the Working Group adopted the report on 
Mauritania. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Mauritania: Hungary, Guatemala and 
Mauritius. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Mauritania: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MRT/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, 
Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway was transmitted to Mauritania through the 
troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, 52 delegations made statements. A number of 
delegations commended Mauritania for the ratification of core human rights instruments 
and for its efforts in the areas of human rights and democracy. Recommendations made 
during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. The delegation said that it would like to take the opportunity presented by the 
dialogue with the Working Group within the framework of the universal periodic review to 
reaffirm the fact that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania stood ready to 
continue its efforts, as a member of the Council, to defend human rights, preserve human 
dignity and respect the fundamental principles of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>7. The national report was the result of a consultation process to which all interested 
parties had contributed. The report had been drafted by an interministerial technical 
committee in coordination with the National Human Rights Commission.  
</p>
<p>8. Mauritania, which was preparing to commemorate 50 years of independence in a 
few days&#8217; time, upheld human rights as fundamental and irrevocable principles. They were 
enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution, which stated that the Mauritanian people 
were determined to guarantee the principles of democracy as set out in the Universal </p>


<p>Declaration of Human Rights of 10 December 1948 and the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights of 28 July 1981, as well as international conventions to which Mauritania 
was party. 
</p>
<p>9. National laws embodied the principles of liberty, justice and equality, non-
discrimination and tolerance, and respect for civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights. Mauritania had ratified the main international human rights treaties, conventions and 
protocols and had submitted reports on their implementation. It had also responded 
positively to all mission requests made by special procedures mandate holders and had 
submitted reports to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination in 1999 and 2004; the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2001 and 
2009; and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to visits by special procedures mandate holders, Mauritania had hosted 
the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance in 2008, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, 
including its causes and its consequences, in 2009 and the Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention in 2008, all of which had demonstrated the political will of the Mauritanian 
Government to overcome the challenges it faced. 
</p>
<p>11. With a view to protecting all rights, Mauritania had created a comprehensive 
institutional framework involving various ministerial departments and human rights 
institutions, in particular the Ministry of Social Affairs, Children and the Family, the 
Commission on Human Rights, Humanitarian Action and Relations with Civil Society, the 
Ombudsman of the Republic, the National Human Rights Commission, the National 
Commission for Financial Transparency in Public Affairs, and the National Council for 
Children. 
</p>
<p>12. The situations described in the national report confirmed the strong political will of 
His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, to continue the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to put an end to human rights violations, address unresolved 
humanitarian issues and overcome the legacy of slavery. The report also highlighted the 
Government&#8217;s determination to strengthen policies and programmes designed to build a 
State underpinned by a strong rule of law and founded upon justice and equality.  
</p>
<p>13. The country was also working to improve living and health conditions for detainees. 
Its penal policy focused on amnesty for convicts who fulfilled the necessary requirements. 
</p>
<p>14. In the area of good governance, significant measures had been taken to address 
problems of mismanagement by creating the National Commission for Financial 
Transparency in Public Affairs and the High Court of Justice, which was responsible for 
trying senior State authorities. The new policy was intended to guarantee an equitable 
redistribution of resources and the development of the country, which had been hampered 
by bad management. 
</p>
<p>15. Despite the efforts made to promote and protect human rights, Mauritania, like other 
developing countries, continued to face multiple challenges, particularly in the area of 
economic and social rights. Rapid development would be required if it was to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>16. Algeria noted the consolidation of the National Human Rights Commission. It also 
noted that a de facto moratorium on the death penalty had been in place for 20 years, while 
sharing concerns regarding its abolition. Algeria also noted a 20 per cent quota for women </p>


<p>allocated in electoral mandates, which had led to their representation in municipal councils, 
the judiciary and other State institutions. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>17. Senegal noted the positive strides made in promoting and protecting human rights, 
despite a context characterized by some institutional instability. It congratulated Mauritania 
on the strong measures taken to do away with slavery and welcomed the progress achieved 
in promoting women&#8217;s rights, the fact that Mauritania had given priority to the return and 
total integration of Mauritanians who had been refugees in Senegal, and the fact that an 
OHCHR office would soon open in Nouakchott. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>18. Qatar acknowledged the positive measures taken to address the discrimination issue. 
It also noted the efforts made with regard to the national human rights institution and its 
work with civil society to implement human rights policy, as this had been done by the 
Ministry of Children and the Family. It was pleased that steps and efforts had been 
undertaken by the Government to achieve reconciliation among all people in the country 
and encouraged this to continue. Qatar made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>19. Oman commended Mauritania for the measures taken to fulfil its international 
commitments. It highlighted the country&#8217;s efforts in building institutions such as the 
Commission for Human Rights, as well as its humanitarian action and relations with civil 
society. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>20. Saudi Arabia noted with appreciation that national legislation and policy had 
included human rights principles. It also welcomed the fact that Mauritania had established 
a national human rights institution and had provided compulsory education for all children 
between the ages of 6 and 14. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>21. Bahrain noted the priorities and challenges, particularly extreme poverty, a major 
obstacle to the full enjoyment of economic and social rights. It also expressed appreciation 
for the Government&#8217;s efforts to promote the advancement of women and for the progress 
made in building institutions and the judiciary in order to protect women and children, and 
in creating a civil society that provided care and protection for them. Bahrain requested 
further information about efforts made to combat poverty through social security. Bahrain 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>22. Greece recognized Mauritania&#8217;s efforts to promote and advance the status of women 
in society. It expressed concern over Mauritania&#8217;s general reservation to CEDAW and its 
reservations to certain provisions of ICCPR, relating to the implementation of shariah law. 
It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. Palestine was pleased that the report submitted by Mauritania indicated the 
Government&#8217;s great interest in human rights. Mauritania had codified international human 
rights principles in its national law. In addition, Mauritania had criminalized slavery and 
had adopted a broad programme to eliminate it.   
</p>
<p>24. Mexico welcomed the principal activities undertaken to improve health care and 
universal access to education. It welcomed initiatives to involve women in politics. It 
requested further details about the current status of the implementation of conclusions 
resulting from the study on social protection. Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>25. Tunisia welcomed the continued cooperation between Mauritania and international 
mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights. It appreciated the role 
played by institutions such as the Ombudsman, as an independent institution for mediation 
between the governmental administration and citizens to settle conflicts in a cordial and 
neutral manner. It made a recommendation. </p>


<p>26. Iraq appreciated the efforts made by Mauritania to promote and protect human 
rights, as reflected in the Constitution of 1991. Mauritania had also adopted a series of 
measures to address human rights challenges. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>27. Brazil noted the legislation providing for a 20 per cent quota for women in electoral 
mandates, while noting concerns about the prevalence of discriminatory practices against 
women, including female genital mutilation. Brazil noted the concerns of the Committee on 
the Rights of the Child about <i>gavage</i> and the lack of a clear definition of rape and other 
sexual crimes. Brazil also noted that, owing to unequal access to employment for women, 
they were overrepresented in the informal sector. Brazil praised the high school enrolment 
of girls and encouraged the birth registration campaigns. Brazil urged Mauritania to 
abrogate corporal punishment in law and to abolish the death penalty. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Malaysia positively noted Mauritania&#8217;s engagement with the international 
community and the United Nations human rights machinery. It inquired about the progress 
made in establishing the OHCHR country office, which had been agreed in September 
</p><p>2009. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Bangladesh was pleased to note that Mauritania had demonstrated the political will 
to address the situation of women and children. It also welcomed the fact that the poverty 
reduction strategy paper accorded priority to health. While recognizing challenges facing 
Mauritania, it acknowledged that the country had been affected by international 
circumstances, including the financial and economic crisis and the food crisis, and had 
drawn the attention of the international community in the assessment of human rights in 
Mauritania. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. Morocco expressed appreciation for the effective role played by the National Human 
Rights Commission, particularly in raising awareness about and promoting education on 
human rights. Morocco praised the legal framework for ending slavery, addressing its after-
effects and creating support funds for slavery victims. Morocco welcomed Government 
efforts to ensure the voluntary return of refugees and guarantee their economic and social 
reintegration. It supported efforts to combat poverty and youth unemployment. Morocco 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Pakistan welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s frank acknowledgement of the challenges faced 
and was encouraged to note its determination to promote and protect the human rights of its 
citizens, particularly their economic and social rights. It was concerned by the persistent 
extreme poverty in Mauritania and stressed that the issue required immediate action. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Egypt congratulated Mauritania on the progress made in the harmonization of 
domestic laws with international standards in the area of human rights, including laws that 
had been effective. It paid tribute to Mauritania for improving the human rights situation by 
allowing the 30 per cent quota for women in the electoral list, as well as with regard to civil 
society. It also welcomed the positive developments in poverty reduction with a focus on 
health care and children. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>33. Poland appreciated the progress made in aligning national legislation with 
international human rights standards. It noted concerns about violence against children. It 
asked the steps intended to be taken to end the corporal punishment of children in the 
public and private spheres. Poland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Canada welcomed the positive steps taken by Mauritania in 2007 by creating a 
framework for criminalizing slavery, underscored the return of Mauritanians in 2008 in 
cooperation with the High Commissioner for Refugees, and was encouraged by its 
initiatives to combat discrimination. Canada, however, observed that only a holistic </p>


<p>approach addressing all forms of slavery and discrimination would enable the country to 
better comply with its international obligations in the area of human rights. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Chad welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s legal framework for respect for human rights, and 
asked a question about the current situation of the survivors of slavery. 
</p>
<p>36. Israel looked forward to the day when constitutional order and democracy would 
serve as the cornerstone for building a comprehensive human rights framework, both in law 
and in practice, to ensure adherence to international human rights norms and standards. 
Israel made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya acknowledged the great efforts made by Mauritania in 
the areas of education, health care and other areas related to human rights, and thanked the 
country for its efforts in relation to the national strategy for social matters and protection of 
the elderly and women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Yemen noted that Mauritania had succeeded in resolving political problems through 
peaceful means and had held democratic elections in 2009. In addition, Mauritania, being 
aware of the human rights challenges, had established a number of ministerial agencies to 
address them. Yemen made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>39. The delegation of Mauritania said that its civil society organizations had been 
involved in preparing the national report, in accordance with universal periodic review 
guidelines, through their participation in the national consultations that had been organized 
at a June 2010 national workshop in which all interested parties had participated. The 
conclusions of the consultations, which took into account both the progress made and the 
limitations and difficulties reported, were reflected in the national report. 
</p>
<p>40. With regard to its standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders of the 
Human Rights Council, it should be emphasized that Mauritania had responded positively 
to all mission requests made by mandate holders and remained open to all similar requests. 
</p>
<p>41. With regard to the question of whether Mauritania planned to withdraw its general 
reservation concerning the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the delegation recalled that, when Mauritania had signed the Convention in 
2000, it had made a general reservation to the provisions of the Convention that were at 
odds with sharia law, which formed the basis of its domestic legislation. In light of the 
recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women during its consideration of the country&#8217;s initial report in 2007, the Government had 
decided to examine the provisions of the Convention that contradicted sharia law. To that 
end, the Government had engaged in broad consultations with the ulema, and was now 
working to complete the procedure for withdrawing the general reservation and replacing it 
with more specific ones. 
</p>
<p>42. All Mauritanian refugees in exile were free to return to Mauritania, and there was 
nothing to prevent them from living in their country and taking part in its development. 
After the events of 1989, more than 20,000 refugees had returned under the tripartite 
agreement signed in 2007 by Mauritania, Senegal and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees. A further 2,400 refugees had been registered and were to 
return by the end of December 2010, when Mauritania intended to conclude the return 
operation. Provision had been made to ensure that all refugees received certification of 
nationality as soon as they returned. An agency to promote refugee reintegration had been 
established, and substantial financial resources had been allocated for that purpose. 
</p>
<p>43. Each year, ever since the launch of an initiative to resolve outstanding humanitarian 
issues in Ka&#233;di by His Excellency the President of the Republic, 25 March was celebrated 
as a national day of reconciliation. As part of that process, the State had awarded material </p>


<p>compensation to victims. The delegation welcomed the solidarity and support shown by the 
international community and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>44. With regard to Mauritania&#8217;s accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, the delegation said that the country&#8217;s current priority was to fulfil the 
obligations it had assumed upon acceding to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 2004. Its efforts in that regard 
had included the submission of its initial report and participation in a constructive dialogue 
with the Committee against Torture. The Government was firmly resolved to investigate 
allegations of torture and to prosecute the perpetrators of such acts. 
</p>
<p>45. Various other developments also reflected Mauritania&#8217;s commitment to meet its 
obligations under the Convention against Torture, including awareness-raising programmes 
for public security officials, refusals by judges to consider confessions extracted under 
torture, the imposition of disciplinary measures by the authorities in proven cases of torture, 
without prejudice to the filing of criminal charges against those responsible as well, and the 
fact that prisoners could now request that judges order the preparation of medical reports in 
order to establish the degree of criminal responsibility of the perpetrators of such acts. In 
addition, the National Human Rights Commission could and did make unannounced visits 
to places of detention throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>46. All the arrangements had been finalized in preparation for the imminent creation of 
an OHCHR office in Nouakchott, which, according to reliable sources, was expected to 
open its doors on Monday, 15 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>47. Death penalty sentences were commuted, as provided for in the Islamic law from 
which it was drawn and other provisions of criminal law. No executions had been carried 
out for 23 years. The moratorium would be examined as part of the current reforms process; 
possible alternatives would be considered, and conclusions would be reached in accordance 
with the country&#8217;s penal policy. 
</p>
<p>48. With regard to equality between men and women, it should be noted that domestic 
law contained no inegalitarian or discriminatory provisions. In order to ensure equality, the 
Government had taken institutional measures, formulated sectoral policies and strategies, 
set up monitoring groups and adopted numerous pieces of legislation. Furthermore, 
discrimination in general was prohibited and punishable under the new Act No. 042/2007 
on the prevention, treatment and monitoring of HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>49. On the question of impunity for sexual and domestic violence, the delegation 
recalled that Mauritania, as a Muslim country, had a system of values and education that 
formed the first defence against such behaviour. In addition, the Government had taken 
significant steps to combat impunity for sexual violence. It had drawn up standard 
operating procedures for cases of gender-based violence, formulated a policy to combat 
female genital mutilation, issued a fatwa in 2010 on ending the practice, and was in the 
process of developing a national policy to combat gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>50. The country had a law that systematically banned slavery-like practices. Under that 
law, victims could submit complaints and receive assistance, and administrative authorities 
found guilty of failing to act in such cases were subject to penalties. A complaint of 
slavery-like practices was sufficient to prompt action by the administrative authorities or 
legal proceedings. The law also protected the interests of children who had been enslaved 
and provided for the punishment of any form of discrimination or violence against them 
and for their reintegration. In a general sense, that law had facilitated significant progress in 
fighting slavery, and the delegation invited non-governmental organizations to collaborate 
with the authorities by reporting all confirmed cases. In order to eliminate the legacy and 
vestiges of slavery, Mauritania was working on additional measures, particularly through a 
programme to eradicate the after-effects of slavery. An action plan to combat trafficking, </p>


<p>including trafficking in women and children, would also be put in place. The delegation 
refuted the notion that slavery-like practices persisted and underlined the fact that 
combating the legacy of slavery was a cross-cutting activity reflected in all policies pursued 
by the Government. 
</p>
<p>51. Slovakia praised the opening of an OHCHR office in 2009. Slovakia stated that a 
more holistic approach at all levels of society was required to combat slavery. Slovakia 
expressed concerns about prison overcrowding, lack of food and health care for detainees, 
and routine abuse. Slovakia noted the de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 1987. 
Slovakia acknowledged the improvement in media freedom since the August 2005 coup, 
which had ended censorship and bureaucratic obstacles to the printing of publications. 
Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The United States of America commended Mauritania for progress in aligning its 
national legislation with international human rights standards. Noting the steps taken by the 
Government and civil society organizations to combat slavery, it expressed concern over 
the fact that, although Mauritania had banned slavery, no one had ever been convicted of 
the crime of slaveholding. It inquired whether Mauritania planned to develop a national 
strategy on slavery. It also expressed concern about the prevalence of human trafficking in 
Mauritania. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. The United Arab Emirates expressed appreciation for the importance attached to 
human rights, as reflected in the national report and institutions created such as national 
human rights institutions and the ministry of humanitarian affairs. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>54. Italy encouraged efforts to address, in collaboration with the relevant international 
organizations, the challenges related to children&#8217;s rights, particularly child labour. Italy 
welcomed the steps taken to withdraw general reservations to CEDAW. Italy noted the 
adoption of a national strategy and plan of action in 2007 to fight against female genital 
mutilation. Italy noted reports about the deteriorated situation of the Christian minority, 
encouraging Mauritania to undertake initiatives to create a better climate for religious 
tolerance. Italy noted the de facto moratorium on the death penalty since 1987. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>55. Sri Lanka commended Mauritania for initiating procedures aimed at the withdrawal 
of its general reservation to CEDAW and welcomed its cooperation with the special 
procedures, as well as its accession in 2003 to ICRMW. It also commended Mauritania for 
having made education compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>56. France was concerned over information about the persistent use of torture by law 
enforcement personnel, particularly in detention facilities. It asked for clarity regarding 
measures taken or envisaged to address this issue and punish the perpetrators of torture. 
France noted that the death penalty had not been used de facto since 1987, although it still 
existed in the penal code and was applicable for homosexuality. France made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland welcomed progress in 
combating discrimination, particularly the law criminalizing slavery and slavery-like 
practices, while noting concern about the effective implementation of the anti-slavery 
legislation and the continued existence of caste-based slavery. Welcoming efforts to 
mainstream gender equality and the national strategy for eliminating female genital 
mutilation, it expressed concern about torture, prison conditions, violence against women 
and gender-based discrimination, including reported trafficking in women and girls; the 
continued practice of early marriage and forced feeding (<i>gavage</i>); child trafficking and the </p>


<p>prevalence of child labour. It called on Mauritania to ensure access for detainees to 
independent and effective legal remedies. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Turkey praised the initiation of procedures to withdraw the general reservation to 
CEDAW. Noting the efforts of Mauritania to organize the voluntary and dignified return of 
Mauritanian refugees, it stated that accelerating the process of issuing identity cards would 
benefit the process. It also positively noted Mauritania&#8217;s various efforts to improve the 
situation of children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Spain noted the commitment of Mauritania to human rights since 2005 and 
encouraged further efforts for consolidation to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Norway welcomed the establishment of a national commission to combat gender-
based violence. It expressed concern about the human rights situation of children. Norway 
noted the adoption of a national strategy and plan of action in 2007 against the practice of 
female genital mutilation. Norway appreciated the efforts made to combat slavery, 
including the adoption of a law criminalizing it and the establishment of a national 
programme to eradicate it. Norway emphasized the importance of civil society participation 
as essential to a meaningful universal periodic review process. Norway made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>61. Germany commended Mauritania on the agreement it had signed with OHCHR 
authorizing the establishment of a country office in Mauritania. In the light of the overall 
female genital mutilation rate in Mauritania, which had remained at approximately 72 per 
cent for the past few years, it inquired about steps that the Government was taking to 
persuade its citizens to abandon the practice. It also asked for information about a national 
strategy focusing on combating slavery and alleviating its impacts. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire congratulated Mauritania on its efforts in ending the crisis that had 
affected its stability, and noted the recent initiatives taken to follow up on the 
recommendations of several Special Rapporteurs. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Azerbaijan noted that desertification and drought constituted a serious threat to 
economic and social development and that extreme poverty remained a major problem, 
affecting almost half the population. It welcomed structural reforms to improve access for 
children to education. Azerbaijan welcomed the steps taken to improve the status of women 
and to promote their participation in politics. Azerbaijan expressed appreciation for 
increased cooperation with the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>64. Argentina paid tribute to the achievements of Mauritania with regard to the 
mainstreaming of childhood issues into its poverty reduction strategies and best practices in 
the areas of cooperation, defence of children&#8217;s rights and community dialogue. It inquired 
about the incorporation of norms aimed at preventing racial and ethnic discrimination into 
Mauritania&#8217;s domestic laws and about measures adopted to put an end to the practice of 
corporal punishment. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Slovenia commended Mauritania for the progress made in aligning its national 
legislation with international human rights standards. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. The Holy See noted the adoption of compulsory education and the implementation 
of the 2003&#8211;2010 national strategy for education, as well as the highest primary school 
enrolment rate in Africa. It also noted the law permitting the National Human Rights 
Commission to carry out unannounced visits to detention facilities to monitor the living 
conditions of prisoners. It noted the significant steps taken to combat slavery. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>67. Sweden, noting that Mauritania had maintained criminal sanctions against same-sex 
activity between consenting adults, inquired about any initiatives taken to repeal the law 
forbidding such sexual activity. It also expressed concern over the regular use of torture by 
security forces against political detainees. It asked for further information about measures 
taken to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of torture against individuals 
detained for political reasons or for ordinary crimes. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. China welcomed Mauritania&#8217;s withdrawal of a general reservation to CEDAW and 
expressed appreciation for its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms. China 
understood the difficulties facing Mauritania in addressing human rights owing to a lack of 
financial and human capacity, and called for greater technical assistance from the 
international community.  
</p>
<p>69. Switzerland noted the 2007 law criminalizing slavery, expressing concern that 
slavery still existed in practice. It also noted that new death sentences had been handed

carrying out its mandate, the Commission made unannounced visits to places of detention, 
investigated alleged human rights violations, carried out promotion, research and education 
activities in partnership with non-governmental organizations, technical and financial 
partners and relevant authorities, and formulated recommendations, many of which were 
included in the annual report it submitted to the President. 
</p>
<p>86. Although the Commission had participated in preparing the national report, it had 
also written its own report, in which it discussed the institutional progress achieved and the
